utonomous region of Moldova this problem is not regarded as a priority by the government and NGOs. Entrepreneurship education is not conducted for persons with disabilities and their right to education and labor rights are very limited. This project contri
butes from its part to tackle this shortcoming in the Republic of Moldova.The goal of the project is to promote the right to education and employment of persons with disabilities through the development of their entrepreneurial skills and assistance in sta
rting their own business in Moldova. This project was designed to improve the quality of life and livelihoods of persons with disabilities in Moldova by building their capacity to exercise their rights to employment. The Institute for Democracy will implem
ent three key activities of the project which include the following actions: 1. Legal assistance for persons with disabilities in starting their own business by establishing a Center of Free Legal Assistance for the Persons with Disabilities. Center&apos;s work

p development. Also collection of the laws under a titled Principles of Entrepreneurship will be prepared and published in order to ease the access to the needed information. 3.Training for persons with disabilities on the Convention on the Rights of Perso
