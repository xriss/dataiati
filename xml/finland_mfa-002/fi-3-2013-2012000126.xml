   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Serious shortfalls in forest governance have hindered development of a significant sector of Tanzania&apos;s economy. It is widely recognised that Participatory Forest Management is the ultimate solution that is required because with broad PFM coverage illegal 
loggers would  join the regulated market and bring gains to the sector. Before Mpingo Conservation + Development Initiative (MCDI) began working in Kilwa communities earned just a token for each log felled in their village compared to government gains. In 
the first PFM harvest MCDI succeeded in raising this to more than 400 times higher than previous. Armed with its FSC certificat that guarantees legality. MCDI now expects to raise the price of certified blackwood felled in community managed forests by seve
ral further orders of magnitude. Villages with substantial tracts of forest that have not  already been logged out stand to make over $ 100 000 each per year from sales of certified timber more than doubling total village income. And the forests from which
 the valuable timber comes will be protected for the long term benefit of all mankind.Main objectives of the activities are: to sustain MCDI&apos;s support to participating communities such that scheme does not collapse, to facilitate all timber sales and thus 
revenue earnings, furthermore to sustain MCDI&apos;s capacity so that it is able to move forward later with renewed funding that is anticipated from Comic Relief in 2013 Funds are requested for: Fourth annual audit of MCDI&apos;s FSC group certificate, support to an
y commercial timber harvests proposed in community forests, revisison of Kisangi village forest management plan, support to villages&apos; forest revenue management process including audit of forest revenues spent , MCDI Annual Stakeholders forum and monitoring
 of programmes covering biodiversity forest integrity and community perceptions of change sustained as well as support to local microfinance groups sustained.The outcomes expected from this project include: Increased village revenue FSC certificate sustain
ed, village governance standards continue to improve and MCDI capacity maintained.</narrative>
