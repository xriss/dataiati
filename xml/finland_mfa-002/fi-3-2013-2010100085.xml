   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Youth (18-35) form the statistical majority of the population in South Sudan. According to the research activities carried out by CMI and its partners in 2011 and 2012 in all the ten states of South Sudan there&apos;s a glaring lack of trust confidence and inte
raction between different youth constituencies and decision makers. Hence empowering youth by making their voice heard in statebuilding and conflict resolution discussions is highly important for the stability and peaceful development of South Sudan. The a
im of the project is to empower the youth especially women by involving them in the state and peacebuilding dialogue with high level decision makers. The youth inputs are to be included in relevant key political processes such as the constitutional review 
which is scheduled to be concluded in 2015.The overall objective of the project is to contribute to the stability of South Sudan after its independence. The specific objectives are to 1) increase confidence + interaction between different youth constituenc
ies across the country (track 2+3), 2) increase confidence between youth and selected state representatives (tracks 2 and 15) and 3) deepen youth participation in relevant state building processes in South Sudan - with special attention to women participat
ion. The crosscutting development policy objectives will be included in the workshops by involving them in the dialogue topics. The second phase of the project builds on the structures which were created in the first phase. These structures support and dev
elop the local institutions in South Sudan. As an example the youth dialogue forum strongly supports forming the National Youth Union (NYU) and the constitutional review process.The main beneficiaries are the 30 youth leaders 500 members of the NYU around 
300 peer youth and 40 local administrators from all the ten states in South Sudan and around 10 high level decision makers from the state structures.The key project activities are implementing the dialogue workshops youth homework consultation activities i
n between the workshops identifying the 10 key decision makers and the political processes and the inclusion of youth messages into them as well as a final comprehensive project evaluation in 2016.</narrative>
