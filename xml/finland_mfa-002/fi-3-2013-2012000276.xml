hich is the target of the project is needed as a location for work training meetings storage and shelter. The workspace will allow the villagers to carry out their basketware handicrafts in a much better environment than outdoors or in confined interiors. 
The community centre space will make it possible to provide education for example and human working conditions throughout the year. In addition to the provision of the building the application includes renovation of existing village buildings and their ada
