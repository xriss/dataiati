   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Afghanistan has 2.7% under-serviced and socially marginalised severely disabled people. Government schools have limited resources and expertise to include Children with Disabilities (CwD) in the educational system. Over the three years of the project staff
 will implement the SERVE comprehensive model of Inclusive Education (IE) to improve access to and quality of education for CwD in 15 government schools in the Kalakan district of Kabul province. The model includes the following: 1. Establishment of and su
pport to school-based Inclusive Education Advisory Committee (IEAC) playing a pivotal role in ensuring the quality of IE and in raising community awareness and behavioural change in disability. 2. Training of master trainers in braille sign language and IE
. Master trainers will in turn train the teachers of the targeted schools according to Training of Trainers principles .3. Development of teaching and learning materials for various categories of disabilities and training teachers to use them. 4. School pr
eparation for hearing and visually impaired children in order for them to attend the regular government schools with an IE curriculum and approach.Additionally staff will establish two Accelerated Learning Programmes (ALPs) a model initiated by the Ministr
y of Education (MoE) in order to bring over-age children into the government school system. These children have either missed out on school or dropped out and are too old according to the MoE&apos;s enrolment rules to (re-) enter school at the appropriate grade
 level. The MoE?s ALP allows over-age Afghan children to complete two cycles of education in one calendar year using the regular MoE curriculum so that after 3 calendar years primary education (grades 1-6) is completed and the children can (re)enter the fo
rmal education system at the grade 7 level closer to their peers (max of 2-3 years age difference). The ALP represents the only entry point for over-age children into the formal education system.The project also includes an advocacy component in which staf
f will advocate for the MoE to take responsibility for the School-preparation programme for CwD and also to take over the Braille production. Staff will also advocate for the MoE to arrange for trainings for Master Trainers independent of the scope of this
 project.</narrative>
