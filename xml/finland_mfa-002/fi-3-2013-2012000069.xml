   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project is based upon the third phase of the project carried out by CEFI in partnership with the Embassy.  During the period the organization created collaborative networks to enhance synergies with other organizations, National Environmental  Manageme
nt  Authority (NEMA)  Kenya Forest Service Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources Ministry of Agriculture  Ministry of Forestry + Wildlife among others. The low cost up- scale agro-forestry model addresses the deforestation and watershed crisis in K
enya in which forest cover has diminished from 62% down to 2% over the past thirty years.  The projects creates community self reliance in obtaining seeds managing community based tree nurseries and carrying out a self help form of extension services. The 
projects creates permanent forests blocks on residual pieces of Farmland agro-forestry systems and a program for sustained annual harvests that do not diminish the forest block. Climate is of a mild inland equatorial type modified by relief altitude and pr
oximity to the lake. It favours the cultivation of sugar cane which is the district?s main industrial crop besides other crops like tobacco cotton maize and cassava. According to Kenya Forest Research Institute KERI the climate also favours the growth of v
arieties of trees. Despite moderate rainfall pattern the forest cover in the district is way below the average due to persistent forest destruction to give way for subsistence farming. According to Ministry Planning and National Development Migori district
 focus 2002-2008 the most prudent/practical form of intervention that deals with both food security problem as well as depletion of forest cover in the district is through Agro-forestry activities. The main objectives of the proposed project are to:a) Prom
ote intercropping of diverse beneficial tree species, fruit tree wood-lots fuel wood and medicinal trees etc.b) reduce rural poverty/hunger through locally led-fruit tree and high yielding crops cultivation that ensures sustainable use of forest and forest
ry productsc) create community-led agro-forestry user groups and Home associations Networks as a vehicle for reforestation and poverty reduction through income generation activitiesd) conserve biodiversity through integrated conservation-development soluti
ons based on agro-forestry practices and innovative idease) Build capacity and sensitize community on social audit and mainstreaming cross cutting issues</narrative>
