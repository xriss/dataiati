   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project  We protect children do you? - Promoting Child Rights and Protecting Children from the Worst Forms of Child Labour in Cambodia focuses on the prevention of child labor and the protection of children involved in the worst forms of child labor in
 particular children engaged in domestic work brick factories and the entertainment industry. According to the recent statistics there are 14 million working children in Cambodia. Within the most dangerous forms of labor the working conditions are extremel
y damaging to health. Thousands of children lack opportunities for education because of being forced to work. This results to a cycle of illiteracy and poverty. In Cambodia the society doesn?t recognize the need to protect children from exploitation and si
gnificant gaps do exist in official child protection structures which makes it important for NGOs to contribute in this field.The project opposes child labor exploitation by developing groups and networks in different community sectors to monitor investiga
te and refer to child rights (CR) violations. Wider audience is reached through activities that disseminate information on CR and on how to correctly respond to violations. The project also aims to contribute to the prevention of CR violations in Cambodia 
and to the protection and rehabilitation of victims of the violations.The project is located in both rural and urban areas in Phnom Penh and its surroundings and the provinces of Kandal Koh Kong Preah Sihanouk and Siem Reap.The first project phase has been
 successful in establishing local level Child Protection Groups (PG) especially Child PGs in the target communities. The public awareness and debate about Child Rights and risks of the Child Labour is also increasing. This continuation phase of the project
 (2014-2015) will be dedicated especially to strengthening the existing Child Protection Groups as part of the local level civil societies. To ensure their continuation as independent actors the number of members in the PGs will be increased child and yout
h PG members&apos; participation and capacity to advocate with peers strenghtened and networking and links to other local level actors  reinforced. Child and youth participation in local level decision making structures (commune/Sangkat meetings) will also be s
trenghtened to increase the child and youth perspective in the decision making.</narrative>
