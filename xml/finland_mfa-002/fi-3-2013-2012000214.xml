   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project concerns the organization&apos;s campaign against HIV/AIDS and promoting women?s sexual and reproductive rights among the indigenous people in the provinces of Jujuy and Salta in northern Argentina. The project takes into account gender and equality
 and focuses on promoting these especially among women of childbearing age and their partners. It aims to improve the situation of low-income indigenous women by promoting gender equality the right to self-determination and sexual health. The activities wi
ll be carried out in cooperation with the local government NGO&apos;s and women communities taking into account the local culture. Salta and Jujuy are among the Argentina&apos;s poorest provinces. Around 20 % of their population belongs to some indigenous group (in 
the location where the project is carried out a substantially greater proportion of the population represent the indigenous people). Most of the indigenous population in the two provinces lives in poverty or extreme poverty and 80 % has not finished compre
hensive school one third has not completed elementary or reached teaching at all. Illiteracy is three times more common than among the Argentine population. The organization takes into account the local culture in its activities and the importance of commi
tting various stakeholders for the project to be successful. It aims for long-term effectiveness by training staff in local health centers as well as community centers separately elected indigenous representatives for sexual health promotion in their commu
nities and the men who have an important role in women?s sexual and reproductive health.</narrative>
