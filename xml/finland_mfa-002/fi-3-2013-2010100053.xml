   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project continues the work of the first phase (2011-2012) of the project which aim is support the Liberian governance reform planning. During 2011 and 2012 the Governance Architecture (GA) model have been developed to answer the Liberian context. The G
A model is a comprehensive planning tool for the use of all Liberian Ministries in their reform planning.The work has been carried out under Joint CSA (Civil Service Agency) GC (Governance Commission) and LIPA (Liberian Institute for Public Administration)
 cooperation. The project has established a GA Joint Working Group (JWG) between the three organizations supporting their cooperation ensuring holistic approach and a strong local ownership and engagement to the project objectives.The project has already d
eveloped based on extensive research and joint working group a Governance Architecture Model (basically a visual mapping tool) for the Liberian context. The model has incorporated the input of CSA GC LIPA and ministries. Next year the model will be trained
 for and applied to three ministries to support their reform planning and implementation. The continuation has been asked by CSA GC LIPA and ministries.In order to apply the GA model to governmental planning in practice the project has started to include t
he ministry level input to the GA model development already in the first phase (2011-2012) to ensure the usability of the model. The second phase (2013) will focus on training and revising the GA model for selected ministries (2-3 ministries). The first mi
nistry to using the GA model will be the Ministry of Commerce and Industry due to its interlinked functions with the second ministry recently merged Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning that is in need of planning support.The project second phase will
 further strengthen the cooperation of local partners in order to ensure the correct political coordination and backing for the GA model to be applied to all MAC?s in Liberia. That means that the all the ministries will have their MTEF (three year planning
 period) reform plan done in similar fashion. The GA reform implementation will focus on the service delivery aspects for the citizens.The project second phase will also create a handbook and a video with prominent persons speaking about the governance. Th
e handbook and video will act together as training material and also serve in other CMI engagements. The project also supports the CMI GooB project in Lieria directly.</narrative>
