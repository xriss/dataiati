   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Election observation is defined as the purposeful gathering of information regarding an electoral process and making informed judgements about the process on the basis of information collected. Over the years election observation in Kenya has largely focus
ed on Election Day processes and activities an approach that fails to take into cognizance the environment and processes prior to and after the elections. ELOG has organized itself as a comprehensive election monitoring and observation programme. Its aim i
s to promote trasparency and accountability in the lectoral processes in Kenya and the Africa Region. Taking elections as a process and not an event ELOG has identified seven key thematic issues under which thematic monitoring and observation shall be anch
ored namely: voter registration monitoring and implenetation of political parties Act and political financing advocacy on electoral law reform and constituency delimitation campaign monitoring promotion and participation of marginalized groups voter educat
ion and media monitoring. This is anticipated to set a comprehensive background and environment for actual election-day monittoring and observation which will utize the traditional observation and parallel vote tabulation methodologies for purposes of dete
rring electoral malpractices and the swift verification of the official results and the credibility of the election-day processesObjectives, to enhance stakeholder awareness on the electoral process undertake comprehensive thematic monitoring and observati
on of electora process leading to and after the 2012 elections to faciliate the stablishment and build capacity for a peace panel to undertake election day observation through fielding general observers and parallel vote tabulation observers</narrative>
