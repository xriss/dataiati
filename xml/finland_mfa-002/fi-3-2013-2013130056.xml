   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In Sota Southern Ghana the small godvillage of Joensuu-Ghana Registered Association 16 girls have dropped out from school during the past five years 13 of them due to a teenage pragnancy according to the statistics kept by the teachers. Teenage pregnancies
 occur already in primary school because kids often start school late and therefore girls may already be14-17yrs old in primary school.Teenage pregnancies are due to gender inequality the attitudes of parents towards teenage pregnancies the attitudes of me
n and boys towards females and poverty and the high illiteracy level of women which prevents them to know their rights.Early unprotected sex increases the incidences of Hiv/Aids and other STDs.The main objectives of the project are to reduce teenage pregna
ncies by 30% to halve the number of girl child drop outs to achieve better health which means less incidences of Hiv/Aids STDs malaria and diarrhea the attitude changes among males towards females and poverty reduction through education.Together with the m
ain objectives of our project we are putting into practice also the development political cross cutting objectives, gender equality reducing inequality and through better education climate sustainability too.The main beneficiaries in the project are teenag
e grils disabled girls included and teenage mothers. The situation of girls cannot however become better without the attitude changes of men boys and mothers so the entire Sota community will be the final beneficiary.The key project activity is the after s
chool club (2-3hrs) five times a week in Sota Basic School.In the club the youth are helped with their assignments basic life skills and hand skills are taught to them they are also given health and ethical education. Small girls will alsohave one club day
 a week because the earlier you start the better the results.The teachers have already this year started an after school club for girls once a week by the support of Joensuu-Ghana Registered Association.Once a month there is a family day on Saturday with c
ounselling of parents and programme for the families.  The school is encouraged to continue their culture group as part of the project to strengthen the roots. Twice a year there will be an excursion.In addition to these a local doctor will lecture to the 
entire community five times a year and once a year screening will be arranged to find the Hiv-positives and other diseases.</narrative>
