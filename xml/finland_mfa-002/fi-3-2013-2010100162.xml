   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The continuation project is based on the results of the pilot project of the year 2011 -2012.In this on-going project the focus is on women as it has been seen that it is the women who have taken responsibility and have participated fully in all the agricu
ltural horticultural and domestic livestock rearing activities and fetching water fodder and firewood form distance places, as well as cooking and looking after the children and managing other day to day household chores thus spending the whole day in perf
orming these tasks. Observing the benefits to the villagers covered under the pilot phase project now people from other surrounding but more remote villages have come forward to want to be part of the main project to be covered under Ph-II during 2013-2015
. Therefore in this continuation phase (2013-2015) it is planned to extend the activities to 3 more villages where no work has been done and so have been left out of many of the developmental interventions.  Of the 4 original villages (covered under pilot 
project=2011-2012) it is planned to reduce the project interventions in 3 of the villages which are right on the road side.This new phase (ph-II) will consist of now spreading the activities to more people in the communities as they have seen the benefits 
of these during pilot phase. The activities planned are:1. organic farming2. kitchen gardening3. construction of roof water harvesting structures4. making compost units 5. bee keeping6. tree plantation7. training in food processing preservation and packagi
ng 8. experiment in solar passive rural house for human/animal shelter + renewable energy gadgets9. experiment R+D in waste biomass (BM) briquettes making improved cook stoves to make the village households kitchens as smoke-free as well as promote time + 
fuel saving efficient cooking.10. strengthening of existing women&apos;s groups and making new women&apos;s groups11.experimenting with the designing of new efficient cook stove for reducing firewood consumption12. celebration of important days such as International
