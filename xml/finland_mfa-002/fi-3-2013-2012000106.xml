   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project has two goals: to strengthen the organisational capacity of Green Living Movement Swaziland (GLM Swaziland) and to increase knowledge on environmental issues in the cooperation communities. The organisational and project managemental skills and
 structures of GLM Swaziland management will be strengthened through institutional capacity development with an aim to make GLM Swaziland an influential actor in Swazi grassroot sector concentrating on environmental and social issues. Knowledge will be spr
ead by organising training and education in the cooperation areas Dlangeni and Msunduza on safe sanitation practices waste (minimisation re-use and recycling) and sustainable natural resources management. The training aims not only to increase people&apos;s kno
wledge but also behavioral changes and community participation. This will be achieved by creating different arenas for learning and participation and also by training of trainers in the communities. Training of Trainers -approach (ToT) will be a central me
thod in the project to develop both organisational management skills and to increase knowledge on environmental issues.In Msunduza the project will continue the process started by the Environmental Health Education Project (EHEP) and Msunduza Dry Sanitatio
n Project (MDSP project code 28000301) in which the communication and cooperation has been established with the local authority City Council (CC) and other actors in the area (such as clinic of Salvation Army in Msunduza schools and commercial actors waste
 recycling and re-use). The project is able to build on the results of the previous projects such as the Sanitation/EnviroClubs of dry toilet users in Msunduza and the Msunduza Community Waste Recycling Centre as well as on the partnerships and the network
s of the City Council the Salvation Army and the local community leadership. These existing networks will allow the project to spread the knowledge further and even beyond the named project areas. A project steering group and community development committe
es will be established to better integrate important project stakeholders in project decision-making and to increase ownership of the project from the very beginning. The steering group will have both Swazi and foreign representatives (from GLM Zambia and 
Finland) and the community development committee will consist of various stakeholders of the respective communities.</narrative>
