   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project targets young people who have dropped out of elementary school or are at risk of dropping out in order to help them get back to school. Young school-leavers will be put back in touch with school staff and former classmates. They will be helped 
to build self-esteem and confidence in people and institutions through different leisure activities as well as awareness of sexual and reproductive health and addictions will be raised. The objective is for the young people to build confidence in society a
nd in their own abilities and opportunities in order to become citizens aware of their rights. In addition their ICT skills and other necessary skills in today?s society will be strengthened. A network between different public institutions will be created 
in order for the youth to receive appropriate psychological and social expertise easily from one place. The staff of the institutions in the network will be trained in seminars and workshops in order for them to be able to respond effectively to the teenag
ers and young people?s problems. The project tackles a broad problem in Argentina related to young people particularly young people of low-income who are neither in school nor working. It is estimated that in Argentina there are about one million 15-24 yea
r-olds who have not completed primary school and are out of the working world. In the Buenos Aires area the number of these young people is estimated to be 370 000. The implementation area of the project is the municipality of San Martin which is one of th
e worst affected areas of the problem and it has in the past few decades suffered significant habitat degradation and the growth of slums and crime imported by an increase in social problems. The project will be implemented in collaboration with the Univer
sidad de Tres de Febrero who will continue the program once the project has ended.</narrative>
