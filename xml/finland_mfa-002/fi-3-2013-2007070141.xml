   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Tanzania is at a crucial stage of development: high economic growth large findings of natural resources with high potential for revenues key political processes including new constitution (2014) and multi-party elections (2015) high population growth and i
ncreasing inequality. Wealth for some but wide-spread poverty for the vast majority combined with special challenges of the most vulnerable groups of society and major environmental problems (deforestation impact of climate change pollution due to extracti
on of natural resources) are some of the major challenges over the next decade. In this process of change civil society organisations have an important role to play firstly as advocates of the most vulnerable people and on changes needed in terms of policy
 and implementation and secondly as service providers for vulnerable groups who are without care. However the capacity of NGOs remains low especially in terms of ability to perform advocacy work. There is a need to further increase the capacity and profess
ionalism of NGOs and to strengthen their coordination and cooperation.Key aim of the CISUNET project is to achieve socially and ecologically sustainable development and reduction of poverty. While the first phase (2008-2010) and second  phase (2011-2013) p
rioritized on strengthening the working capacity and networking of local NGOs the third phase (2014-2016) will precedence strengthening the advocacy element of NGO work. It will increase the capability of Tanzanian civil society via community-based NGOs an
d umbrella NGO TACOSODE to influence policy and decision-making towards reduction of poverty and inequality and to perform advocacy work to improve the situation and rights of the most vulnerable groups (women children people with disabilities people livin
g with HIV/AIDS elderly people unemployed youths etc.). Further the project increases the capacity and networking of Tanzanian NGOs among NGOs themselves and between NGOs and the public and private sectors on a local national and international level. It pr
omotes understanding on issues of globalisation and development among social and health NGOs in Finland and internationally via the global umbrella organisation ICSW thus promoting North-South cooperation. Means of intervention are assessment of local NGOs
, training workshops and seminars, regional national and international awareness-raising, provision of IT equipment and internet access to NGO networks.</narrative>
