   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Finland supports the Renewable Energy Cooperation Programme of the Africa-EU Energy Partnership under its Action Area 4: Technology Innovation and Capacity Development which aims at developing the next generation of energy professionals in Africa and suppo
rting technology development and innovation. With contributions from Austria and Finland this project focuses on two sets of activities: 1) a policy and planning exercise and analysis in order to conceptually further develop the Action Area and thereby gui
de activities on renewable energy research innovation and education in Africa and 2) the provision of support to vocational training and higher education. Based on a labour market requirements analysis and subsequent capacity needs assessment for these act
ivities activities on vocational training and higher education will be initiated by partner demand but will notably rest on the prime principle of the RECP: complementing already existing donor initiatives (such as the Environment and Energy Partnership (E
EP) supported by the governments of Finland Austria and UK). In order to best complement such existing initiatives activities will initially predominantly focus on Eastern Southern and potentially West Africa. Activities will be implemented through the EU 
Energy Initiative  Partnership Dialogue Facility (EUEI PDF) a EU funding instrument to support policy-level work on energy sector. The instrument is supported by a small secretariat hosted by GIZ. EUEI PDF that has extensive experience in the energy sector
 in Africa can draw on the network of education specialists within GIZ as well as from Finland Austria and other EU countries. The consultancy services for the project are tendered under GIZ procurement rules and published on their web site.</narrative>
