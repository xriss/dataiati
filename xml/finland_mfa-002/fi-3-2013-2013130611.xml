   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project aims to build capacity of action partners and enhance their networks to increase sustainability and improve opportunities of vulnerable groups to become empowered through partners work at community level. In most Southeast Asia countries there
 has been impressive economic growth and process toward more open societies. All countries have made outstanding progress towards achieving Millennium Developmental Goals (MDGs). However, increasing social problems and disparities provide new challenges fo
r most countries in the region. On the positive side of the growth, situation offers many opportunities for Fida and partners to strengthen their role in the region as members of civil society. Fida and partners still have challenges of insufficient capaci
ty to operate effectively in the region. This project addresses this challenge and will be jointly implemented and managed by Fida action partners in the region, especially those being civil society partners. Action partners will get opportunity to increas
e their thematic networking and learning from other organisations in the region. Main focus is on networking with representative organisations of vulnerable groups like disabled people organisations and child right organisations. Other networking element i
s to increase cooperation with businesses and business people, being identified through partner networks, to promote ethical investments to poor communities and potential of poor people groups. Project will provide technical assistance, monitoring and smal
l scale additional support to action partners so that vulnerable groups can have their voice heard and their rights ensured. Quality gaps in action partner work are minimized by training key people at project level and through annual trainings and seminars
. Focus is on thematic issues including all mainstreaming topics, best practices and by promoting use of evidence based approach in work. Project will contribute to increased role of civil society in making positive change in communities. This will have su
bstantial impact in fighting disparities and social problems in the region. Fida&apos;s global success factors has been working with churches in many countries, thus it is expected that also church partners in the region have become positive and inclusive chang
e makers in the society.</narrative>
