   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project focuses on gender based violence (GBV) a serious human rights violation as well as a social and a public health problem concerning all sectors of society. GBV is widespread phenomenon in the Southern Africa and presents a major obstacle to atta
ining gender equality. Project objective is to empower Evangelical Lutheran Church in Southern Africa (ELCSA) and local communities at large in Southern Africa (South Africa Lesotho Swaziland and Botswana) to address GBV. Churches play a key role in these 
societies to overcome GBV as they hold great authority and are able to influence social issues in all levels of society. Gender equality is one of the human rights objectives agreed upon in the United Nations. Gender justice is also one of the cross-cuttin
g priorities of the World Lutheran Federation and Southern African Development Community. Altogether poverty and other forms of injustice impact unevenly on men women and children and thus there is a need for actions that promote gender equality. Project r
espects also other cross-cutting development policy objectives notably redument of inequality and climate sustainability. The project does not create any new structure or institution but will be positioned at the existing structures of ELCSA. The ultimate 
beneficiaries of the project are victims and survivors of GBV the potential victims of GBV and the communities they are part of. While GBV is usually targeted at women and girls boys and men may also be victims of GBV. GBV can occur within the family or co
mmunity and is perpetrated by persons in positions of power. Understanding that discrimination and violence based on gender takes place invites everyone to be an agent of change. The indirect beneficiary of the project is the ELCSA who will learn approache
s and methods to respond to ever increasing exploitation of the vulnerable people. Key activities include 1) effective project management and administration, 2) creation of holistic view on GBV among ELCSA training of ELCSA leaders personnel and volunteers
 to respond to GBV development of awareness raising tools and materials and  establishment of trainers&apos; peer network, 3) training of community members to respond to GBV in local level awareness raising on gender rights in communities and peer support and c
ase management of victims of GBV, 4) network building with relevant stakeholders attention brought to challenges faced by victims of GBV and share of best practices.</narrative>
