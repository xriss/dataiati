   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project aims at protecting the sacred place of an indigenous people the wixarika and at supporting the education project of the Wixarika community of Tuapurie Santa Catarina Cuexcomatitlan so that the school will get a status as a Mexican public school
.The federal government of San Luis Potosi in Mexico granted big businesses mining permissions for the holy place of the wixarika. The area is a nature reserve and a UNESCO world heritage site. The implementation of the permissions is suspended at the mome
nt due to a lawsuit by the wixarika but diverse judicial and political acts as well as networking and cooperation between different parties are still needed in order to protect the nature of the area and the wixarika culture.The wixarika community of Santa
 Catarina started to plan and implement the community?s own development model in 2008. In order to establish the effects of the 2010?2012 project the project continues to enable the community?s own secondary school to continue its activities thanks to the 
salary paid to the coordinator while the process of applying for public funding is unfinished. The project fits the cross-cutting themes of the Finnish development cooperation because it fights for respecting the human rights and land property rights of th
e indigenous people. Although this project does not focus on improving gender equality it is taken into consideration and the project tries to promote it. The project also includes significant factors which mitigate the effects of climate change and protec
t the environment both in Wirikuta and in Santa Catarina. The project does not create new structures but develops existing methods. The wixarika have created the defence front of Wirikuta which assembles several NGOs. In addition the community of Santa Cat
arina has organised itself autonomously and pondered on what kind of development it wants for the region.  The main beneficiaries are the wixarika people as a whole due to protecting their sacred place and culture and the teachers and the students of the S
anta Catarina school. The most central activities of the project are the legal proceedings connected with protecting Wirikuta and enabling the work of the coordinater of the Santa Catarina school by paying his salaries.</narrative>
