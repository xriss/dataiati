  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In face of onslaught of modern medicine which is inaccessible to poor communities it is necessary to revive the multi-tiered interactive interdisciplinary eco-sensitive and vegetation-based health care system. It builds on indigenous knowledge systems by w
hich communities&apos; basic health security is in their own hands in their relation to life of trees and plants and biodiversity.JJVS has established a network of traditional folk healers (Gunis) in selected pockets of nine states of India. The base for the Gu
ni cooperation is the law for local governance in scheduled areas PESA Act which gives the Gram Sabhas as local village councils an authority to nominate the traditional healers and thus give them a public recognition The constitutive approach of JJVS is t
o recognize new Gunis and to expand to new areas in Rajasthan and promote then the mutual learning of Gunis and their registration processes in Panchayats their cooperation for local health consultations and school and home herbal gardens preparation of co
mmunity health knowledge registers and local biodiversity registers and cooperation with colleges researchers and authorities.Besides this basic approach there are:- Two construction sites to be promoted: a Temple Garden and Guni Ashram Kurabar - The Natio
nal cooperation - Mapping of so called ?sustainable pockets? where traditional skills and sustainable life still is availableFor 2013 two additional elements are emphasized: - Participation in an initiative process of Accreditation and Certification of Pri
or Learning (ACPL) of Gunis through involving local democratic bodies and technical institutions - supported by the National institute of AYUSH (Ayurveda Yoga Unani Siddha and Homeopathy) Govt. of India and technically supported by Indira Gandhi National o
pen University (IGNOU) Quality council of India. . This process will start with qualifying Minimum standard of competence (MSC) format which is developed by expert folk healers themselves in particular stream or health condition.- The organic cultivation o
f medicinal plant or wild harvesting of raw drugs which are in high trade will be promoted for immediate livelihood support or income by Gunis farmers and villagers. The value addition of such raw drugs can also be taken for product or medicines developmen
t so that they can get more value or cost of the harvested medicinal herbs.</narrative>
