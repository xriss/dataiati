  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Domestic workers are one of the most vulnerable groups in Peruvian society and the labour markets. Being mostly women and migrants from the rural areas of the country domestic workers are treated as second class citizens with less rights than others. Domes
tic work is one of the largest sectors of the informal economy. Although there is a law since 2003 regulating domestic work it is often neglected and the rights of persons working in domestic service are systematically ignored. The salaries are below minim
um wage often only accommodation and food are seen as sufficient compensation fo helping in the household. Domestic workers work up to 16hour days with no 24hour rests holidays and no right to social security. Working in private household they are often su
bjected to violence and abuse by their employers.  The objective of this project is to contribute to the inclusion of domestic workers as workers and full citizens of the society. The immediate objective is that the domestic workers once empowered would be
 in a position to better negotiate their rights and fulfil their responsibilities. The main cross-cutting objectives concerning the Finnish development policy are 1) promotion of equal opportunities for a group that is marginalized and discriminated in the
 society and 2) gender equality: most of domestic workers are women. The project will be carried out by the Peruvian partner Asociacion Grupo de Trabajo Redes (AGTR). Activities are organized using already existing structures: La Casa de Panchita is a loca
l meeting point in Lima coordinated by AGTR that offers a variety of services for domestic workers. In the same establishment is also situated the employment agency LA CASA DE PANCHITA S.A.C. that mediate job opportunities for persons in domestic services 
without commission fees. The beneficiaries of the project are around 1500 women over 18 years who work or are seeking for work in domestic services and wish to improve their working conditions and bargaining power. The beneficiaries are contacted through L
a Casa de Panchita and the ones following a job training are elegible to seek for a job through the employment agency.The main activities of the project are: a. Job training b. Legal counseling for domestic workers experiencing problems at their workplacec
. Empowerment through artd. Participatory theatre where domestic workers practice their bargaining power through theatre.</narrative>
