   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The number of girl pupils enrolled in secondary schools in Tanzania is one of the lowest in the world. Gender disparity while not significant at the primary level is still wide at secondary level. The conclusion of many empirical studies is that child deve
lopment depends more on increased schooling of the mother than increased schooling of the father.  The development of the child includes health of the child schooling and productivity in adulthood.This project is addressing the access to secondary educatio
n among the female children of poor families in Morogoro region especially in Mvomero district. Key idea of the project is to promote and improve education to girls and increase awareness of education.The project continues to support the poor and talented 
girls who pass the national examination and fail to get school fees to join secondary education. Essential point is the sensitization of and mobilization of the families especially parents or guardians to understand the importance of education to children.
 Particularly the project intends to support girls from absolutely poor families orphans or otherwise vulnerable children. Another focus in terms of beneficiaries are  the bright children who would not have otherwise possibility to progress with their stud
ies.Through the continuation project we intend to continue supporting the enrolled students and improving teaching and learning environments in selected rural villages in Morogoro region. The special focus of continuation project is on the evaluation which
 will take place during 2014.The continuation project will make follow up of health clubs established since the beginning of the project so as to ensure their accomplishment. By making follow-up we insure improved health practices in pilot schools and thro
ugh healthy students better performance and less absenteeism. Project will also create new possibilities for fundraising of WEETU with a purpose on increasing financial sustainability. One possibility is to accomplish theatre building to  be used as a fund
ing source for WEETU through rent from outside users.The project aspires to achieve improved gender disparity in enrolment performance and access to secondary education. In the long run it will improve gender equality in decision making improved life skill
s of women improved economic growth and reduced poverty.</narrative>
