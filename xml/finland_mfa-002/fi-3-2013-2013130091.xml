  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project is based upon the United Nations Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) and The United Nations Security Council Resolution 1325. The CEDAW convention and the Security Council Resolution 1325 lay the f
oundation for women&apos;s rights what constitutes as discrimination against women and how they apply in conflict situations. The project aims to empower women on a local village level in Somalia. The objective is to teach women how they can participate and get
 involved in local decision making processes which are controlled by men as well as learn about their own rights as women based on the new Somali constitution. The first part of the project is to arrange a two week seminar in Somalia (Mogadishu) where lead
ers from different women&apos;s organizations from different parts of Somalia will participate. Experts from Finland who work with women&apos;s rights issues (Security Council Resolution 1325 and CEDAW) will teach in the seminar and together with the local leaders d
esign a road map for a three year project plan. The three year project would continue the actions already taken in 2014 taking them on a larger scale across Somalia. The final project design and project application will be completed in Finland during April
 and May. In the latter stages of 2014 (September-October) a three week training program will be implemented in a Somali village. The program includes three weeks of teaching and seminars three days a week. Teaching staff from Finland will include three ex
perts and an African expert. The aim of the three week program is to educate women on their rights and get them involved in the grass roots decision making of their village. The objective would be to include as many interested women as possible to the proc
ess hence the risk of someone being singled out would be diminished significantly.    Village elders would also be included in the process as they are key figures in decision making  and they are always men. This would make it easier for women to take part
 in the program as it would be condoned by the elders. If funding were to continue in the following years the same program would be used in villages across Somalia in order to encourage as many women as possible to take part in local decision making and th
us enhance the rights of women and their living conditions as well as empower women to make decisions about their own future.</narrative>
