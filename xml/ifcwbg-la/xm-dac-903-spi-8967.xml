Technical Partner and/or Major Shareholders    	Endeavour Embroidery Co. Ltd. (the &quot;Company&quot;) will be owned by Mr. John Predl (51%) and by his wife, Mrs. Minichanh Boulyaphol (49%).  Mr. Predl has about eight years of experience running an embroidery business in Australia.  Ms. Boulyaphol is a skilled embroidery machine operator and supervisor who is familiar with Barudan&apos;&apos;s machines.  Barudan Asia Pvt. Ltd. will take preferred shares in the Company worth approximately US$ 104,000.  Barudan Asia Pvt. Ltd. is a fully owned subsidiary of Barudan Japan which is the embroidery machine supplier to the Project.    Project Cost Including Proposed IFC Investment    	US$471,000 including an IFC Loan of up to US$235,000    Location of Project and Description of Site    	The Project will be located in Vientiane, about 10 kilometers from the city center.  A new factory building 16 meters by 17 meters would be built on the ground of Atlanta Enterprises, a large manufacturer of garments.  The site is flat and there is sufficient space for expansion.    Description of Company and Purpose of Project    	The Company will build a modern semi-automated embroidery unit in Vientiane and service the Lao garment export sector with higher quality and more reliable embroidery services.  The export garment sector in Lao PDR is comprised of about 46 producers exporting products.  However, currently, many Lao garment manufacturers are either forced to turn down export orders or send garments out to Vietnam or Cambodia for embroidering due to the lack of modern embroidery capacities in Lao PDR.  By investing in proven technology, the Company can enable local garment makers to attract orders at a higher price level from quality international brands in the sportswear and leisurewear markets.  These products will mainly be for European buyers whose markets demand a high level of finished quality at economic costs.  IFC and the IFC- managed Mekong Project Development Facility have played an important role in the Project by reviewing the technical, strategic, financial, environmental, and legal arrangements.  Under the Extending IFCs Reach Initiative, IFC is one of the few sources of long-term capital for Lao projects.  The Project supports the Lao Governments policy to promote private sector projects and encourage development of the garment industry.  Moreover, by providing embroidery to ISO9001 standards, the Project would provide a demonstaration effect to others in this sector.  The Project will also contribute to generating foreign exchange earnings and increased tax revenues.
