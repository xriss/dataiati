   <narrative xml:lang="EN">IFC is expected to make an equity investment for a shareholding of up to 10% in Vientiane Commercial Bank Limited (VCB), including an expected capital call in the first year after completion of the proposed investment. VCB is the largest private sector commercial bank in the Lao Peoples Democratic Republic (Lao PDR or Laos). This investment would be made jointly with the Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited (ANZ) which is seeking to acquire a 60% stake in VCB, leaving 30% to be retained among key existing shareholders. The proposed IFC investment, alongside that of ANZ, aims to strengthen VCBs governance, management, strategy and commercial operations in a frontier market where banking services (particularly from private-sector banks) remain nascent but vital to support the countrys continued economic growth.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The proposed investment, alongside a strong international partner, ANZ, would help upgrade the governance, management, strategy and commercial operations of VCB, the largest private-sector bank in Laos, which, in turn, would help deepen much-needed bank-intermediation in this frontier market. A baseline survey done by GTZ in 2006 shows that only 7.5% of enterprises surveyed (primarily SMEs) have received financing through banks while 68% indicated demand for loans. With regard to household and retail finance, penetration of banking services in Laos is extremely low as an estimated 90% of household savings are in the form of under-the-mattress cash instead of bank accounts; it is estimated that only 5% of the population has a bank account. Underpinned by increasing trade and industrial expansion (mainly infrastructure and mining), Laos recorded real GDP growth at 7.3% in 2005, a level that is forecasted to reach 7.2% for 2006 (EIU) and averaging 6.7% in 2007-2008. In light of the fledging banking sector, and one where less-efficient SOCBs maintain dominant share, upgrade of private-sector banking services is vital to foster and sustain economic growth going forward.</narrative>
