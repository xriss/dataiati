   <narrative xml:lang="EN">- Economic development through financial intermediation:   Decreasing dependence of the country on foreign capital by utilizing domestic savings for investments.  - Access to credit for the underprivileged:    In Lao PDR, the level of unemployment and underemployment is high, and opportunities for formal wage employment are limited. A significant proportion of the population has turned to self-employment or started a small business. Lack of access to credit is the most important constraint to starting or expanding a business.   - Employment creation:    Large scale licensed retail banks are in a position to provide financial intermediation thereby creating employment and income generating opportunities through support to the development of the local private sector.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project comprises an IFC equity investment of LAK17.5 billion, approximately $1.83 equivalent in ACLEDA Bank Lao Ltd (ABL), a green-field banking/microfinance operation capitalized at LAK100 billion (approximately $10.4 million). ABL will operate as a commercial bank under the Commercial Banking Law in the Lao PDR, with its head office in Vientiane and branches through out the country.  Its main focus will be on the low-end segments of the market, leveraging on its parents (ACLEDA BANK plcs) expertise in MFI management and operation.  ACLEDA Bank plc (ACLEDA) is an existing IFC client in neighboring Cambodia.  ACLEDA was initially a microfinance operation and recently turned into full-fledged bank. ABL is ACLEDAs first step in its regional expansion strategy.  Under current local regulations, foreign investors are not allowed to set up MFIs in Laos, therefore, ABL will seek a full banking license. ACLEDA will be leveraging its relationship with existing strategic shareholders  IFC, KfW, FMO and Triodos Bank  in its Lao venture.  Thus, the proposed shareholding is as follows: ACLEDA- 30% with 17.5% each taken by IFC, KfW, FMO and Triodos Bank.</narrative>
