   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Lawrence Sikutwa &amp; Associates, trading as Madison Insurance Group (Madison Group, or the Group or the company), was established in 1994 to hold and represent shareholding interest of management in Madison Insurance Company following the liquidation of Meridien International Bank, which was a holding company for Madison Insurance Company Limited.  Following the amendment of the Insurance Act in December 2005 to enforce a segregation of operation between life insurance and non-life insurance underwriting, Madison Insurance Company Limited was split into two business entities namely: Madison General Insurance Company (Zambia) Limited and Madison Life Insurance Company (Zambia) Limited.  The Group has also expanded to include Madison Investment Company Limited and Madison Health Solutions Limited.   The project consists of an equity investment of up to $2 million for a shareholding of up to 15% (IFC Equity Investment) and a senior loan of up to $3 million (IFC Loan) to the Group.  Madison Group is the leading insurance group in Zambia.  The projects main objective is to strengthen and expand the operational capacity of Madison Group in Zambia.  The proposed investment allows IFC to: - support  mid-tier local insurance groups in the African region both through financial and non-financial assistance; - support the Group with its strategy of expanding its activities into property development and mortgage financing through its subsidiary Madison Investment Company Limited.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The potential developmental, institutional and capacity building impact of the project is high.  The capitalization proposed for Madison will help reinforce the local insurance industry in Zambia and help the company better compete with foreign based insurers in the local and regional markets. This will in turn reduce the amount of capital leaving the country for the accounts of non-Zambian insurers.  IFC&apos;&apos;s investment will help in the transformation of an existing local institution into a strong and viable private sector entity that will attract other foreign players into the Zambian insurance industry.  The investment will have an important demonstration effect in that it will result in an increase in the overall market size of private insurance in the country.   Insurance companies have a disproportionately high impact on economies because they are necessarily large investors who directly affect the general economy through their operations.  In order to settle claims that may arise, insurers invest excess premium income to build a portfolio of financial assets and income-producing real estate which can then be called upon to pay off any future claims that arise.  A vibrant insurance industry can be a reliable source of long-term capital, which is lacking in Zambia as well as in many African countries.  The provision of quality insurance is therefore crucial for the development of a healthy and dynamic private sector and long-term capital markets.</narrative>
