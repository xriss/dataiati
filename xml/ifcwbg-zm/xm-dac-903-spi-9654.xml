Significant shareholders of APC are New Africa Investments (43%), Silver Holdings (19%), and MADA Limited (10%). The principal individual shareholder is Thomas Kaplan, a US national, who has a 47% shareholding through New Africa Investments and in person.     Project Cost Including proposed IFC investment    	The project is estimated to cost US$8.5 million and IFC has been requested to provide a loan of US$2.5 million.    Location of project and Description of site    	The project is located in the Northern Province of Zambia, near Kasama and Mbala towns.    Description of Company and Purpose of Project     	The company operates three coffee estates; Kateshi, Ngoli and Isanya, which currently have a total of 1,280 ha of coffee. In the next two years an additional 344 ha of new coffee will be planted and 215 ha of the remaining old coffee replanted to complete the companys planned 1,624 ha coffee plantation development. Kateshi and Ngoli Estates, owned by African Plantations Company Limited, were failed government plantations acquired by the sponsor in 1996. Isanya, owned by African Highlands Plantations Limited, was a private mixed farm.    	  The project will result in the following direct benefits; (i) securing existing jobs at the company, the private largest employer in northern Zambia, and creation of about 100 additional permanent jobs and at least 2000 seasonal jobs; (ii) increase in economic benefits to northern Zambia, a largely under-developed region; (iii) demonstration effect of successful coffee cultivation in northern Zambia, a region whose excellent conditions for coffee cultivation have not been exploited; (iv) generation of foreign exchange earnings for the country in the medium to long-term; and (v) skills transfer to locals. (vi) The project will also assist the success of Zambias privatization program by completing the redevelopment envisaged by government when ZCCL was privatized.    Environmental Category and Issues    	This is a Category B project according to IFC&apos;&apos;s environmental procedure. Environmental, health and safety issues analyzed with respect to the plantations included selection, handling, application and disposal of agrochemicals; integrated pest management; provision of protective equipment and employee training; regular medical check-ups for employees handling agrochemicals; and agrochemical container disposal. Key issues analyzed regarding irrigation systems included source and volume of water supply; impacts on riverine hydrology; potential loss of grazing land and wildlife habitat if applicable; impact on fisheries and subsistence fishing if applicable; minimum flow maintenance and impacts on downstream users; increased waterborne diseases; restoration of land disturbed during rehabilitation and construction; and worker safety during construction. The issues analyzed with respect to processing plants included power supply including fuel storage if applicable; emissions from boilers and other sources; workplace hygiene and housekeeping; provision of personal protective equipment and employee health and safety training; solid and liquid waste disposal; and fire protection/ life safety. IFC prepared a detailed Environmental Review Summary (ERS) for the project, which was made available through the IFC InfoShop on December 17, 1999. The sponsors have made the ERS available for public review in Kasama and Lusaka, and a notice was published in the    Times of Zambia    on October 18 and 19, 1999, announcing the availability of the ERS for review.
