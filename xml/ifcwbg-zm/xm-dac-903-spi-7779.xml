   <narrative xml:lang="EN">SUMMARY OF PROJECT INFORMATION    Project Name			Zambia-Mtendere Lodge    Region				Sub-Saharan Africa    Sector				Tourism/Lodge    Project No				007779    Projected Board Date	   	   April 15, 1997    Company Name			Pentire Investments Limited    Technical Partner and/or Major Shareholders   :   		The Company is owned equally by Mr. Mark O&apos;&apos;Donnell and Mrs. E. O&apos;&apos;Donnell. &#xA0;Mr. O&apos;&apos;Donnel was born in Zambia and is a successful business manager. &#xA0;He is currently President of Zambian Manufacturers Association.    Location of Project &amp; Description of Site:	The lodge will be built on a 1100 ha farm 35kms from Lusaka just off the main Lusaka-Ndola road. &#xA0;The farm is owned by Pentire Investments Limited and has been used primarily as a game ranch.    Project Cost Including Proposed IFC Investment:	The project cost is estimated at US$1.41 million and IFC has been requested to provide a loan of US$565,000.    Description of Company and Purpose of Project:	The Company was set up in 1990 to acquire the 1100 ha farm and has run it since as its main business. The owners now plan to build a 20 room tourist lodge with a small conference center to cater for a mixture of foreign tourists or business people passing through Lusaka and residents seeking weekend breaks and a venue for small conferences.    Expected Development Impact:	Interest in Zambia for safari holidays is increasing and Zambian tourism facilities are in need of development. &#xA0;A lodge near Lusaka will help provide a service to foreign visitors. &#xA0;There will be employment for at least 60 people and a good foreign exchange earning capability.    Environmental Category and Issues:	 &#xA0;This is a category B project according to IFCs environmental review procedure. &#xA0;Key environmental, health and safety issues analyzed include game stock source, game disease control, impacts on wildlife and sensitive ecosystems, staff accommodation infrastructure, liquid and solid waste disposal (including sewage), power and water supply source (including fuel storage), safety issues associated with the presence of wildlife, CFC-free cold storage, general safety and employee training, and emergency response preparedness and fire protection. &#xA0;The sponsor has submitted a detailed environmental management plan for the project that addresses all of these issues. &#xA0;In addition, an independent team of researchers from the Center for Wildlife Management at the University of Pretoria recently completed a year in residence at the project site and is preparing a detailed Game Management Plan for the project. &#xA0;This plan is expected to be finalized in March 1997. &#xA0;The ERS for the project is expected to be released to the PIC in early March as well.    Date SPI sent to PIC:	February 26, 1997   &#xA0;	     	For additional information contact: &#xA0;Corporate Relations Unit - 	telephone: &#xA0;(202) 473-7711 - facsimile: &#xA0;(202) 676-0365.
