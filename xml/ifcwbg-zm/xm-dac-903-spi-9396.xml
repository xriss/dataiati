The Group has interests in a wide range of industries including agriculture, packaging and steel. In the growing services sector of Uganda, the Madhvani Group has a presence in tourism, media &amp; communications, information technology, insurance and trading. Masara Holdings Limited is the Groups company responsible for its interests in the tourism sector. Masara was the successful bidder in the Government of Zambia&apos;&apos;s sale of the Inter-Continental Hotel in Lusaka.    	The sponsor has entered into an agreement with the Intercontinental Hotel Corporation (IHC), whereby IHC will continue to manage the hotel, and has requested IFC to support a rehabilitation project.    Project Cost Including proposed IFC investment    	Project Cost: $18.3 million (purchase and rehabilitation of the assets); the requested IFC investment: $5.0 million senior loan.    Location of project and Description of site    	The project is located on Haile Selassie Avenue, in the diplomatic area of Lusaka. The site includes extensive ground for car parking and possible future commercial use.    The existing building is in a reasonable state but needs selective modernisation and rehabilitation, as well as the replacement of much of the furniture and fittings.    Description of Company and Purpose of Project    	Hotel Inter-Continental Lusaka was privatized in March 1998. Previously it was owned by Zambia Hotel Properties, a parastatal 80% owned by the Government.    	The project aims to recapture the hotel&apos;&apos;s former share of the market for business and leisure travelers. It will preserve the jobs of 275 employees. The partnership of Inter-Continental Hotels Corporation and the Madhvani Group will bring quality staff training and development and should contribute to the development of the tourism sector in the country. IFC will play a key role by providing long term financing, which is scarce in the country.
