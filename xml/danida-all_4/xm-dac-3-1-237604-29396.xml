end, we have recently taken forward a number of activities and disbursements.

to the g7+ Secretariat. Recent work includes the completion of the
landmark g7+ publication Natural Resources in g7+ Countries, and the launching of the impressive new
g7+ website.

To further strengthen the partnership
between UNDP Timor-Leste and the Secretariat, a Letter of Agreement (LoA) was signed in October 2015.
Under this LoA, two international Secretariat staff members are being supported by UNDP with the aim to increase the capacity of the Secretariat. Further the Timor-Leste country office assisted with the organization of the g7+ meeting in Nairobi.
