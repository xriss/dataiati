   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The overall objective of the project is to bring about real improvements in the global value chains of Danish companies through a dialogue and collaboration on ethical trade in practice. The project will take the collaboration on ethical trade to a new level by making DIEH a Centre of Excellence with a state of art knowledge and communication center and an ethical hub where dilemmas and challenges can be discussed and through dialogue and collaboration translated into concrete initiatives.
