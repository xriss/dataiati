   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The growth of mobile telecommunications in Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda has resulted in reaching an overall subscriber base of 70.98 million accounting for about 58% of the population of the three countries. Mobile network coverage across the region stands at an overall 80% of inhabited population and close to 50% of land area. A further growth is expected in the years to come. 

In order to tap into this growing market, Dantherm wish to explore how its energy efficient cooling solutions can contribute towards lowering the energy usage in the telecom industry.

At present approximately 25 % of the base stations in the three countries is off-grid. A majority of these are powered by DG battery power or simple diesel generators. The reason herefore being that there is a need to lower the energy usage at the level of the base stations to utilise available green power alternatives such as solar energy. Introducing Dantherm&#xBF;s various alternatives for cooling could potentially lead to significant energy savings.</narrative>
