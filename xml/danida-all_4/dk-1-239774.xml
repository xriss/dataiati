   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project seeks to promote the anti-corruption agenda in China with transparency, integrity and accountability as essential concepts and values. The project has two key components. First, IBGRC will promote the international anti-corruption agenda and support China to maintain its focus on anti-corruption in the transition to a more market oriented economy and rule based governance. Secondly, IBGRC will strengthen young people&#x2019;s knowledge about the anti-corruption agenda in dialogue with their future employers, parents, educational institutions and authorities, and thereby contribute to a new generation of leaders in China that complies with the international standards in the field. In addition to working with young people, IBGRC also focuses on dissemination of knowledge about and implementation of the UNCAC. The two focus areas are in line with IBGRCs previous efforts, which have also had a particular focus on involving young people.</narrative>
