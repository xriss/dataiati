  <description type="2" xml:lang="EN">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The South Sudan crisis has deteriorated significantly with attacks on the civil population, massive displacement of people and with a food shortage that threatens the lives of thousands of people. The situation has left close to 1.1 million people displaced from their homes and the influx of people fleeing the conflict is overwhelming the host communities, leading to tensions between refugees and the host population, which leads to further movements. The objective for this project is improved food security and resilience for 2,500 vulnerable households with children under five, pregnant and lactating mothers. The project will distribute food packages to prevent the 2,500 vulnerable households from starving between two planting seasons, together with activities focusing more on self-reliance. Thus the project will 1) distribute food commodities 2) establish small kitchen gardens for diversified food production and increased resilience and finally, 3) distribute fishing materials/equipment for supporting a balanced diet and the possibility to sell at the local marked. With this intervention, ADRA will support both internally displaced persons (IDPs), returnees and host population. The IDPs/returnees will represent between 1/3-1/2 of the target group. The target area is located in Upper Nile State, close to the Ethiopian border.</narrative>
