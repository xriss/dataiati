   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The private sectors in Kosovo and Bosnia-Herzegovina (BiH) are dominated by micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) with poor access to financial services which undermines their ability to grow and generate much needed jobs and income. The limited interest and ability of the financial sectors to extend financial services to MSMEs are caused by a number of factors including restricted access to refinancing on the commercial markets (especially after the financial crisis), inadequate knowledge about the MSME sector and inadequate management capacity in the banks and micro-finance institutions. The support to EFSE will address these constraints by two components: (1) credit lines for additional MSME lending by micro-finance institutions and banks (Partner Lending Institutions; PLIs) and (2) capacity development of the financial sectors by strengthening the sectors ability to sustainably serve MSMEs, improve corporate social responsibility as well as the general framework conditions.</narrative>
