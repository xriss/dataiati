The development objective of the ESPA II is fully aligned to the Afghanistan National Development Strategy 2008-2013 (ANDS) and fully supports the National Education Strategic Plan II/Education Interim Plan. The objectives of the national development strategies and education sector strategies are in accordance with the rights based approach to development and are an integrated part of the ESPA II. The vision of the education strategic plan is to develop human capital based on Islamic principles, national and international commitments and respect for human rights by providing equitable access to quality education for all to enable them to actively participate in sustainable development, economic growth, and stability and security of Afghanistan.
