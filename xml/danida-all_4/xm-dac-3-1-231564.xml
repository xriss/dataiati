   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Violent conflict erupted in Juba on Dec. 15, 2013, and spread to the central and north-eastern South Sudan. The conflicts have led to massive displacement of populations. Despite the ceasefire, signed on January 23, clashes continued between government forces and opposition groups in the provinces Unity, Upper Nile and Jonglei. It is estimated that at least 716,000 people are internally displaced in South Sudan. In addition, approx. 157,000 people have fled to the neighbouring countries of Uganda, Kenya, Ethiopia and Sudan, the majority of which, approx. 76,000 have fled to Uganda. The continued fighting and the worsening humanitarian situation for large parts of the population leads to continued internal displacement and further refugee flows to neighbouring countries are expected. With the start of the 8-month-long rainy season in 3-4 weeks, the concerns about a massive humanitarian crisis in South Sudan is growing.

UN&apos;s overall appeal for South Sudan for the first six months of 2014 (January to June) was at 27.1 billion. USD. The appeal is based on the assumption that 7 million South Sudanese (60-70% of the total population) will be vulnerable, of which 3.2 million will be met with relief.</narrative>
