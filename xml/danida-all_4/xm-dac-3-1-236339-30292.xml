The winning bidder was notified. and SAEK II helped establish means of communication between the company. the contractor. and KACA. SAEK II was heavily involved in coordinating meetings to ensure proper implementation and requirements. The project supported drafting of legal amendments for introducing e-declaration. as a prerequisite for the system to be fully used by en-users (high public officials).

The project was involved in official coordination fora that contribute to oversight of implementation of anti-corruption measures and improve multilateral coordination. Collaboration between SAEK and other internationally funded organization is effective. UNDP proposed that members of the Partnership Briefing come up with policy priorities to be agreed and presented to the authorities to help set an anti-corruption agenda. The last partnership briefing contributed to better coordination of marking the international anti-corruption day. Considering that the partnership forum is the only functioning informal coordination mechanism for anti-corruption. meetings contributed to minimizing potential duplication and improving sending messages to authorities in line with the priorities of all main international actors in the field of anti-corruption."></actual>
