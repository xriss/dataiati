   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Ongoing civil conflict throughout Syria continues to affect civilians. Recent reports estimate that 9.5 million Syrians are in need of humanitarian assistance, with 6.3 million persons displaced within Syria and a total of 2.3 million people taking refuge outside of Syria (OCHA, Syrian Bulletin No. 42, 26 February 2014). As early as the summer of 2012, IDPs settled in shelters in Damascus and Rural Damascus, as a result of the security deterioration within the governorate. OCHA estimates that more than 1,600,000 mainly women, children and the elderly are in a critical humanitarian situation and 762,000 IDPs in Rural Damascus alone (OCHA, SHARP 2014). This estimate has likely increased in recent months with ongoing conflicts in Barzeh and near Yarmouk in Beit Sahm, Babila and Yalda of Rural Damascus (OCHA, Feb 2014). Both Damascus and Rural Damascus are grappling with serious WASH issues in collective shelters and shelter has been recognized as a key priority for Rural Damascus (OCHA, Comprehensive Regional Strategy Dashboard, March 2014)</narrative>
