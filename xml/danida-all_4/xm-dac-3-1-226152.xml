   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The overall objective for the Program 2014-2017 is: to support key Indonesian stakeholders in further consolidating and developing Indonesian democracy and governance. The total budget is DKK 60 million divided into two main clusters of the program and a small pool of unallocated funds: 

Cluster 1: Transparency and Accountability
The immediate objective: to further strengthen and deepen the anti-corruption movement in Indonesia. The program supports key anti-corruption organisations: Transparency International Indonesia and Indonesia Corruption Watch with a proven will and capacity to advocate for implementation of anti-corruption measures and engagement of the public, private sector, government and media. This also includes support for the capacity building of both organizations. 

Cluster 2: Non-discrimination, Tolerance and Civic Values
The immediate objective: to strengthen the capacity and commitment of society, state and law enforcement agencies to uphold human rights, peace and tolerance in Indonesia and the region through collaborative action.
This cluster is implemented by Asia Foundation known for its reputation in promoting non-discrimination and civic values. The program also supports Institute for Peace and Development to contribute to exchange of experiences on democracy and state building between Indonesia a other ASEAN countries. Finally, this cluster supports the law enforcement training facility JCLEC that has been working to improve the capacity of the police and other law enforcement agencies to enforce the law while respecting human rights and civic values, including through cross-sectorial and regional cooperation. 

A limited amount of unallocated funds is available to give the opportunity to provide strategic and flexible support for shorter-term activities.</narrative>
