   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Embassy started disbursing loans to projects under its PSD loan program in 2003. On 20th June 2006, file no. 104.X.50, an internal memo approved by the Ambassador, was made stating that Embassy is allowed to disburse fund from the balance returned from PSD loan component that had been discontinued from the first quarter of 2006. The fund from PSD loan repayment has gradually been received and reallocated among other activities like Millennium Development Goals (MGD) campaigns, seminar for women entrepreneurs, etc. In 2012, few new appropriations had been created to support other activities from the balance in PSD loan repayment account. One of them are still on-going called Utsho Bangladesh, had been approved a grant DKK.500.000 on 7th September 2011. The programme activities are on track.</narrative>
