   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In January 2014, Danish Family Planning Association (DFPA) began the implementation of the first year of the new Danida framework agreement that is fully integrated into our international strategy. We work in South Asia and East Africa where maternal mortality, unmet needs for family planning and violations of sexual rights are high, and where governments lack commitment to fulfil people&apos;s sexual and reproductive rights. Our partners are local, national and regional civil society organisations (CSOs) that we support through jointly prepared, comprehensive capacity development plans. We work with partners in three thematic areas (TAs): 1) Women&apos;s reproductive health and rights, where, by 2017, demand for quality reproductive health services will have increased in intervention areas in Nepal, Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, Uganda and Kenya through empowerment of 17,000 women and increased accountability of duty bearers. 2) Reproductive health and rights and sustainable development, where, by 2017, an integrated project model will be implemented in intervention areas in Kenya and vulnerable communities will have improved their resilience. 3) Young people&apos;s sexual health and rights, where, by 2017, 19,000 young people, including sexual minorities, in intervention areas in Nepal, Kenya and Uganda will have been empowered to claim their rights through life skills training, comprehensive sexuality education and improved access to youth friendly services. Within all thematic areas, DFPA and partners aim to increase access to and influence on local, national and international policy development and implementation. This is done through double pressure advocacy where CSOs represent rights holders at national and international level, while community based organisations and groups advocate at local level. The pressure from below and the evidence generated at this level feed into national and international advocacy.</narrative>
