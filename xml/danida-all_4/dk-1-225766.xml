   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Support for enhanced interoperability between UNODCs regional and national programs in order to strengthen synergies, including the exchange of experience, in relation to the fight against drug trafficking originating from Afghanistan. There will be a special focus on human rights and women&apos;s rights. 

The contribution of UNODC Vienna - in coordination with Denmark - will be allocated to existing UNODC programs with a special focus on Afghanistan, Pakistan and the region, in a way that promotes the above. The funds will in agreement with UNODC, be soft-earmarked. This means that there will be parameters attached to the contribution in accordance with the objectives and priorities within the Afghanistan-Pakistan program. The funds shall encourage:
- Greater regional coherence between national and regional programs on the basis of the fight against drug trafficking originating from Afghanistan
- Capacity building in primarily Afghanistan and also support for stabilization efforts in Pakistan and the region

Human rights and women&apos;s rights should be safeguarded either by mainstreaming or by targeted activities. It should also seek synergies with other UNODC programs like Afghanistan-Pakistan program funding.</narrative>
