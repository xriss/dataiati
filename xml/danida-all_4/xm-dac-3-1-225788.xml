  <description type="2" xml:lang="EN">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The programme will support two areas, forestry and energy. Forests cover over half of Bolivias territory of 1,1 million km2 and are home to over 30 indigenous groups. Deforestation rates have increased to a level close to 3.000 km2/year, among the highest p.cap. in the world. This leads to a p. cap. CO2 emission of 20 tons, above the European average. Instead of the REDD+ market-based schemes, Bolivia has established a &quot;Mother Earth Authority&quot; and a Joint Mechanism for Mitigation and Adaptation for Integrated and Sustainable Forest Management and Mother Earth. 
Energy: Only half of the rural population has access to public electricity (90% in urban areas). Alternative energy represents only 1.3% of the total energy supply in Bolivia. The Government&#xB4;s goal is to provide access to electricity to all citizens in 2025 and prioritize the development of alternative energy. The strategic considerations of the Programme include:
Sustainable Forest management: Supporting the Authority and the Joint Mechanism to promote sustainable forest management, regulation of water resources, reduction in carbon emission, and reduced vulnerability of the people depending on the forest. 
Access, efficiency and alternative energy: Support to the energy sector will help to (i) improve access to electricity in rural areas; (ii) incorporate alternative energy in Bolivia&#xBF;s energy matrix, (iii) rethink fossil fuel subsidies, and (iv) technological development. 
Alignment and harmonization: Programme activities are aligned as possible to the national partners plans and procedures and harmonized with other donors. 
Green growth and civil rights: The programme links to other strategic areas of the Danish Development Strategy and the Bolivian Country Programme. 
State and Civil Society links: The programme aims at strengthening state and civil society links through setting-up of regional platforms, to secure dialogue at all levels with civil society, private sector and local populations</narrative>
