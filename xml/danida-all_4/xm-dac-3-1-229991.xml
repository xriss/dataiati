   <narrative xml:lang="EN">With 622,865 UNHCR registered Syrian refugees in Jordan by the end of 2014, the pressure on the existing public health care system in Jordan is immense. The project provides access to essential primary and secondary health care services for 2,800 Syrian refugees residing in urban centres and surrounding areas and 1,200 extremely vulnerable Jordanians in host communities in the Northern Governorates of Irbid, Mafraq, Amman, Zarqa and Balqa and in the Southern Governorates of Karak and Madaba. Primary health care services are provided to targeted beneficiaries by Caritas GPs and health staff at Caritas Centres. Referrals for necessary secondary outpatient and inpatient diagnostic and treatment services are secured through agreements between Caritas and a number of MoH approved public and charity hospitals, specialists, laboratories and pharmacies in targeted areas. In light of the disease profile of Syrian refugees where almost 30% of refugees in Jordan suffer from non-communicable diseases such as hypertension or diabetes, 140 chronic, medicine-dependent Syrian refugee patients and 60 vulnerable Jordanian patients are provided with monthly GP monitoring and medication and attend individual and group counselling sessions about their chronic illness and the nutritional and life-style changes that should be undertaken to improve the daily management of their disease. The project also addresses some of the basic household and seasonal needs of 700 extremely vulnerable Syrian refugee families in urban centres and outlying areas as well as of 300 vulnerable Jordanian families in host communities in the Northern Governorates. Each of the 1,000 families, comprising a total of 4,514 persons, have received and redeemed vouchers valued at DKK 790 per family for the purchase of home supplies, kitchen utensils, personal hygiene items and detergents. In addition each family has been provided with blankets in time to help them through the winter.</narrative>
