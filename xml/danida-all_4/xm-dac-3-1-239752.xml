  </title>
  <description type="2" xml:lang="EN">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The study will provide new evidence on pro-poor growth in low- and middle-income countries. It will investigate the observed differences in economic inequality within countries as well as the impact of different growth-strategies and policies on inequality and inclusive growth.

The study is expected to provide insights into the strategies pursued by countries escaping the status of low-income and their impacts on the economic distribution within the countries. It will investigate the existing knowledge and provide new insights into which policies and strategies may be compatible with inclusive and pro-poor growth and the possibilities and limitations of these policies and strategies.

As such, the policy recommendations will guide Danida policies and strategies targeting inequality in developing countries and support of pro-poor growth. Furthermore, the results can provide a foundation on which subsequent research may be able to determine the impact of existing specific Danish development cooperation initiatives targeting inequality.</narrative>
