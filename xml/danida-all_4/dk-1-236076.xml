   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In mid-June 2014 ISIL launched an offensive in northern Iraq. The increased violent fighting resulted in massive displacement of populations into the Kurdistan Region of Iraq. On this basis UNHCR in August requested the Danish Emergency Management Agency (DEMA) through the cooperation of the International Humanitarian Partnership (IHP) to support UNHCR efforts to augment the emergency response efforts of the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) in securing safe accommodation of the large number of internally displaced persons (IDP). Concretely UNHCR requested the IHP to provide a service package of 1 self-contained camp with the capacity of 15.000 persons to be located in the Dohuk Region of northern Iraq. Time frame for establishing the camp was estimated to 6 months. The project was initiated through cooperation and support from IHP partners in Sweden, Norway, UK, Germany and Denmark with the Swedish Civil Contingency Agency, MSB, as lead agency and local delegations of IOM (International Organisation for Migration) and ACF (Action Contre la Faim) as supporting implementing partners.
 
Main objectives of the intervention is:
-Enhance capacity of the camp related infrastructure in the Kurdistan Region
-Improve living conditions for the internally displaced population in Kurdistan, including improved access to power supply, water supply and sanitary facilities.</narrative>
