   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Support to the Resumption of Public Order and Criminial Justice Functions and Protection of Civilians in the Central African Republic</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2" xml:lang="EN">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project aims to support the resumption of basic rule of law functions by legitimate institutions in the Central African Republic following an almost total breakdown of law and order in the fall of 2013. 

The project has two phases: 

Phase 1) Immediate payment of food stipends to police / gendarmerie, justice and corrections personnel. Since October 2013 rule of law personnel have not received salaries and most have abandoned their posts. The payment of food stipends is required to ensure that they report back to duty. The payments will be given for an initial period of 3 months, starting in late March 2014, until more comprehensive United Nations and European Union programmes are in place.

Phase 2) Support to a comprehensive UNDP-UNWOMEN-MINUSCA project to restore public order and criminal justice functions as well as improve the security situation and increase the protection of civilians in CAR. The project will be initiated as soon as the security situation allows for it and will be coordinated with the European Union. It aims to 1) help establish the strategic and operational framework of the justice system along with mechanisms to combat impunity, 2) strengthen the protection of vulnerable groups and their access to justice, 3) restore the basic protection tasks of the police and the gendarmerie, 4) help to reduce impunity in relation to gender-based and sexual violence and enable victims to receive assistance, 5) strengthen mechanisms to protects rights and community-based dispute resolution systems.</narrative>
