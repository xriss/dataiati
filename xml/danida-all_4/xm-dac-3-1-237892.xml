   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The program provided hum assistance to internally displaced and conflict-affected families in Sudan from Jan 1 - June 30 2015. In March 2015 an average of over 75% of households experienced moderate to severe food security. Families received cash for the purchase of food and/or vegetable seeds and agricultural tools allowing for more varied diet and income from sale at local markets. New internally displaced families received relief items (tarpaulins, mosquito nets, soap) to cover basic needs. Local communities and women&apos;s groups received training etc. in own protection, rights and mental health. Support was given to barefoot vets and drugs for livestock; school material to local schools; and support and training of staff of local health clinics. The program supported a small secretariat for a consortium of implementing hum organizations in the conflict zone. The secretariat aims to ensure effective and coordinated transport, information sharing and advocacy work. The Secretariat also monitored the hum situation, incl. food security through data collection and analysis. Reports were shared with the implementing hum organizations in the area and other actors. Finally, the program supported capacity building of local partners and local authorities. The program was supported by Danida and other donors.</narrative>
