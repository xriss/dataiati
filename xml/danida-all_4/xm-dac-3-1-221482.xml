  <description type="2" xml:lang="EN">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This programme comprises support to both Government and Civil Society organizations and focus on continuous improvements of transparency and efficiency in public financial management, including taxation with an emphasis also on income derived from natural resources at the various stages (concession fees, royalties, corporate income tax and state participations); (ii) policy relevant advocacy and research in support of government decision making and a public debate on key development questions based on wider social and economic concerns.
The first component of the support is channelled to the Revenue Authority and to the Financial Information Systems Development Centre (an unit within the Ministry of Finance which has designed and implemented the Mozambican version of an Integrated Financial Management and Information System and a key institution in PFM reforms). Both institutions count on technical assistance from the IMF which also receives part of the funds.
The second component comprises support to the National Directorate for Economic and Financial Analysis (within the Ministry of Finance) and the Centre for Economic and Management Studies at the Eduardo Mondlane University. Both institutions will carry out research on policy issues that can be used in policy formulation for poverty reduction and better allocation of resources. These two institutions count on technical assistance support from the KU and UNU-WIDER.
One last component is related to support to two Civil Society Organizations one of which has been very vocal on economic policy for poverty reduction and the other one on anti-corruption, transparency, governance both at central and local level.</narrative>
