   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The objective of the Fund is to contribute to a reduction of GHG emissions by providing financing on commercially viable terms to eligible investments to renewable energy and energy efficiency -additional to the resources of the local financial sector in the target countries and/or by development finance institutions. The Fund fosters primarily energy efficiency and renewable energy investments for SMEs and private households in the target countries via qualified financial institutions, thereby contributing to the reduction of primary energy consumption. The focus of the fund&#xBF;s activities to date have related to energy efficiency lending. The fund was established in 2010 by the German Kreditanstalt f&#xFC;r Wiederaufbau (KfW) acting on behalf of the German Government and with initial grant contribution from the German Ministry of Environment (GMoE). The Fund offers shares and notes to certain eligible investors, typically pension funds and other financial institutions as defined in the issue document. The capital raised through the sale of these shares and notes are invested in activities as described in the purpose of the fund. The operations managed by the investment manager (resonsAbility Investment AG) are carried out by Partner Institutions (P.I.), mainly financial institutions and NGOs, in developing countries. The investment structure and composition of shares mean that donor contributions in so-called C-shares can leverage private capital by a factor of five. This construction is deemed to be an example of both an innovative and financially sustainable public-private partnership.</narrative>
