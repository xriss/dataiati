  <description type="1" xml:lang="EN">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Two decades of conflict have had devastating effects on the education sector in Somalia. The education sector in particular has suffered due to a complete absence of public education during the entire period of conflict and unrest. The Transitional Federal Government failed to provide even minimal educational services, due to a lack of access to many areas. Overall education figures in Somalia are among the worst in the world, with gross enrolment figures three times lower than Sub-Saharan averages. Enrolment rate for children 6-13 years age group is 42%, and girls 37%. Political developments in Somalia since 2012 present new opportunities for deeper and broader international engagement. Political progress has been achieved. Responding to the current window of opportunity brought about by the end of transition requires a two-pronged approach that will balance concrete and time-bound service delivery with building capacities at key levels and positions within the education sector. The programme will underpin the legitimacy of Federal Government of Somalia by delivering basis services and simultaneously strengthening the institutional capacity within the education sector at district and community level in accessible regions outside Mogadishu through the Go-2-School Initiative implemented through UNICEF.
Component 1: Service Delivery of Quality Basic Education consists of support to 1) School construction, rehabilitation and equipment, 2) Teacher training and 3) Teacher incentives.
Component 2: Intuitional Strengthening of the Education Sector consists of support to 1) 
Capacity builing for district education officers; 2) Capacity building of school management at community level and 3) Children empowerment and participation at community level.</narrative>
