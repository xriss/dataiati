   <narrative xml:lang="EN">World Food programme (WFP) has asked the International Humanitarian Partnership (IHP) via the Swedish Civil Contingencies Agency (MSB) for help in the restoration and expansion of office and accommodation facilities in the UN compound in Kaga Bandoro, situated about 300 km from the capital Bangui in the Central African Republic (CAR). The status of the compound was totally useless in the summer 2014 because of looting and vandalism that had occurred earlier. Following the request for support, the IHP has sent a fact finding mission to the Central African Republic (CAR) in the end of May. Based on the findings and subsequent dialogue with UNICEF and WFP a joint project plan where developed. The aim of the plan is the establishment of a facility, which in the future will work as a &quot;Base of Operations&quot; for about 40 people from WFP, UNICEF, OCHA, etc.
The total project budget is approximately 2.8 million USD + additional allocation of 5.6 million. SEK in 2015. The division of payment for the project was originally: Sweden 65%, Luxemburg 2%, UN by UNICEF 23% and Denmark 10%.
The work division agreed between MSB and DEMA was the following: 
The Danish grant covers the Danish Emergency Management Agency&#xBF;s participation in the project with an electrician, a plumber, and a combined camp technician/mechanic. A total of approximately 7.5 months. In addition, DEMA will provide the equipment to create the &quot;Base of Operation for the IHP construction team&quot; both in terms of accommodation facilities, generators, technical support, equipment and tools.</narrative>
