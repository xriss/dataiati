   <narrative xml:lang="EN">University of Copenhagen arranged an international, scientific conference in Copenhagen on 22-24 October 2014 in collaboration with the International Alliance of Research Universities (IARU). The subject of the conference was &quot;Global Challenges: Achieving Sustainability&quot;. The purpose of the conference was to gather scientists in different areas of sustainability, with the ambition of stimulating research environments to take a holistic view on global challenges. 
The specific purpose of the Danida Grant was to facilitate that researchers from developing countries could also participate in the IARU conference and contribute with their research and special challenges. 14 researchers from developing countries (including 12 from Danida priority countries) were selected as relevant beneficiaries of the Danish grant, and these researchers were invited to join the conference in Copenhagen.</narrative>
