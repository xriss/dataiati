   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The humanitarian crisis in Somalia is still one of the World&#xBF;s biggest. Despite progress within food security there are still 870.00 people in acute need for humanitarian assistance, while 2.3 million people need humanitarian assistance to not fall back into an acute need of food. 206.000 children are still acutely malnourished, far the most of these children are located in the conflict affected southern and central regions. Early warning systems predict a poor harvest in 2014, and a fast preventive response is therefore important to avoid weakening of food security in Somalia. The challenges related to humanitarian access are still huge in the southern Somalia, despite an improved security situation. 
The consolidated appeal for 2014 is USD 933 million. In 2013 half of the applied for funds were achieved. The UN&#xBF;s common country fund play a central role in the collective effort for securing financing to the prioritised actions that can support the long term goal for strengthened resilience and stability. In 2013 Denmark supported the humanitarian country fund for Somalia with DDK 41 million, while in 2012 Denmark&#xBF;s contribution was DKK 30 million.</narrative>
