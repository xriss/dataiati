   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The objectives of the project are to: Enhance Transparency and Credibility of Election Processes; Decrease Political and Electoral Violence ; and, Strengthen the Quality of Representation and Democratic Accountability.
The project has made some good progresses in all its outcome and outputs. All of these achievements are significant given the challenging circumstances in which the activities took place. Alongside these achievements, some activities needed to be cancelled or scaled down significantly in 2013 following discussions with donors and partner NGOs. The prevailing security situation compromised the ability of staff to safely carry out some activities, while the political turmoil heightened the sensitivities and reputational risks associated with carrying out other activities. In this circumstances, the project has been provided with no-cost extension until March 31, 2016.</narrative>
