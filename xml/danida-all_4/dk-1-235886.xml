   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project covers urgent gaps identified within the sectors of protection, NFI/shelter and food security. Priority sectors and geographical areas were derived from the revised SRP from June 2014 as well as DRC&#xBF;s subsequent analysis and was by the local authorities. The intervention targets the most vulnerable conflict affected populations in hard to reach areas (Iraq, Kurdish Region. The Dohuk Governorate and disputed border areas in proximity of the towns of Telafar, and Sinjar) and within sectors that are not currently covered by other humanitarian actors. 
10.000 families will benefit from a CRI distribution, 300 families will benefit from direct and unconditional cash transfers. Activities include; Food security and NFI/shelter. Distribution of appropriate Core-Relief Items (CRI) to vulnerable conflict affected populations, including: food parcel, drinking water, winterization items and general household itemised goods. Itemised food list includes `ready to eat&#xBF; food, approved by the food security cluster and WFP, and meeting Sphere standards; Field based first hand assessments to be conducted, within DRC standard operating procedures and the established terms of reference; Disseminating information to beneficiaries directly about the distribution, and to keep beneficiaries informed, intended to keep up to date with expectations and to ensure transparency and accountability to beneficiaries; Distribution of winterisation items, such as clothing, blankets, safe heaters. This will impact on keeping adequate level warmth, and alleviate follow on risks linked to cold temperatures and exposure to them; Maintenance of supply lines, storage and delivery systems, sufficient to respond to fast paced demands. 
Those most in need are the target of the proposed activities. DRC will conduct protection monitoring in the areas of intervention and with the aim of identifying 2000 vulnerable IDP households.</narrative>
