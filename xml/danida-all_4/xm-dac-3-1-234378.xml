   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Having been screened in April 2014 as a partnership, the partners are applying for Preparation Phase directly. The business idea is to bring quality renewable energy and clean-tech solutions to Kalimantan by leveraging the technological capabilities of Oestkraft to develop products more suitable for an Indonesian context, including the BOP segment. The project will also be supported by Business Academy Aarhus (to draw experience in creating an incubator company) as well as possibly other partners from Bornholm. There is a great need for these types of products in West Kalimantan, as well as need for local business development.

Tanjungpura University (TPU) is currently the largest public university in Kalimantan. It has the desire to create an innovation centre attached to the university, as a means to commercialise and put R&amp;D results to the market and create a revenue stream from the university. One of the initial ideas that will be looked at in this process is the possibility of Oestkraft or other Bornholm entity to join this commercial partnership.

The business plan will be developed after working with idea generation, prototype development and business plan development for the products. This process will serve both as a test case for commercialisation of technology in TPU and an input to the business plan of the partnership between Oestkraft and TPU.

The project has both economic viability for the involved partners and a potential large development impact in a region of Indonesia that otherwise face the risk of falling behind in terms of sustainable development and innovative high-tech solutions.</narrative>
