There is a growing international consensus about the need of promoting a more inclusive and diverse humanitarian system with a strengthened capability to reach vulnerable groups with timely, efficient and appropriate assistance. This will first and foremost happen through a comprehensive process of consultation that is led by the UN&#xBF;s Coordination Office for Humanitarian Assistance (OCHA) and that during the coming two year will include all the relevant humanitarian actors on a global level, this includes the involved governments, UN-organisations, civil society actors and the private sector. The process will end up in a higher level meeting that is expected to be held in Istanbul March 2016. 

From Danish side there is engagement for active participation in and support to the process. It is happen through the Danish presidency for OCHA&#xBF;s donor group in the period of 2014-2015 and through Denmark financing parts of the preparation process, hereunder regional consultancy and central functions in the secretary of planning. Parallel to this the work on developing a new Danish humanitarian strategy or policy is started, likewise is the implementation of the current Danish humanitarian strategy subject for an extensive external evaluation. The present study will be a central competent of these activities.</narrative>
