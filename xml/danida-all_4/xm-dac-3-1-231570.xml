  <description type="2" xml:lang="EN">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Five months after the first fighting broke out in South Sudan as a result of a political power struggle in the country&apos;s elite, the situation is becoming increasingly difficult and complex, and it takes increasingly characteristics of ethnic persecution. The humanitarian situation continues to deteriorate and since the beginning of April, the number of IDPs increased from 800,000 to 959,000 persons, and the number of refugees to neighboring countries has increased from 270,000 to 325,000.
The grant of 25 million. DKK. to WFP relates to the fact that the crisis is increasingly affecting the access to food in the country and the situation is quickly moving towards a food crisis. WFP is the central player in the distribution of food aid to both refugees and IDPs. Currently, WFP has only received funding for 34 per cent of the budget of South Sudan and only 9 per cent funding for assistance to refugees in neighboring countries. The contribution is therefore proposed to be used both in South Sudan and to help South Sudanese refugees in neighboring countries.</narrative>
