   <narrative xml:lang="EN">IIED is a policy research organisation with focus on generating, organising and sharing knowledge. It advocates people led development in global fora by transforming local experiences into national/global policy advice, learning and implementation. Furthermore, the organisation facilitates knowledge sharing and learning in national, regional and global networks and partnerships. 
IIED&#xB4;s strategy &quot;Engaging for Change&quot; covers the period 2014-2019. Four new change initiatives underpin this strategy: 1) Inclusive transitions to climate resilience and green economy, 2) International engagement for a sustainable planet, 3) Rights plus action, 4) Fair consumption from sustainable food systems. The foundation for these initiatives is the internationally acknowledged research capacity at IIED which is divided in to the following four research groups: 1) Natural resources, 2) Human settlements, 3) Climate change, 4) Sustainable markets. 
IIED engages with a broad number of partners from national and local governments, multilateral organisations, NGO&apos;s, community based organisations, research networks and the private sector. 
In its work with IIED Denmark will focus on: 
- A more concise strategy for engagement with partners acknowledging the need for engaging with a broad spectrum of partners while at the same time focusing on key partners; 
- Making better use of IIED&#xB4;s products, especially on green economy, vulnerable groups, climate change and resilience;
- Enhancing IIED&#xB4;s focus on gender;
- Follow organisational reforms and changes of IIED, including monitoring and evaluation systems.</narrative>
