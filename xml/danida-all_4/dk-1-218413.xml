  </title>
  <description type="1" xml:lang="EN">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Support to public administration reforms (PAR) is essential for Bosnia-Herzegovina (BiH) to, on the one hand, cultivate a well-functioning relationship between citizens and public administration and, on the other hand, continue on the path of reform towards EU candidate status and beyond. Most neighbouring countries are making progress in this respect and this has also &#x2013; to some extent &#x2013; proven a driver of change in BiH. 

Due to the very complex state construction in BiH , inter-ethnic rivalry, a weak public administration and low capacity with respect to political leadership, progress on EU-related reforms has been limited. This has especially been true in terms of the development of non-biased, transparent and well-functioning state structures that respond effectively and efficiently to the needs of the citizens. The objective of the envisaged Danish support is therefore to support the national PAR strategy&apos;s overall objective:  

A public administration at central and local level with an improved ability to deliver on the requirements of EU integration and on citizen&#x2019;s rights as well as the emergence of a more pluralistic society containing strong democratic actors. 

A Public Administration Reform Fund (PARF) is established to support key areas of the strategy and implementation of its action plan. Denmark foresees providing DKK 30 million for the PAR process with a view to co-financing key activities identified in the PAR strategy via PARF as well as a component entailing civil society monitoring of the PAR process.</narrative>
