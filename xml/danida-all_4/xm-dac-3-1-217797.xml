  <description type="2" xml:lang="EN">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The strategic approach of this specific IEA programme is to produce analyses showing the benefits of energy efficiency policies. The aim is to support scaled-up energy efficiency activities in key developing countries with the goal to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and generating other energy related benefits. 

The IEA programme will build results through policy dialogue in workshops, roundtables, etc. for policymakers and energy efficiency experts. As the target group is middle income countries, the expectation is that there will be focus on specific policies and regulations with the collaborating countries and across countries including South-South dialogue. 

The IEA programme is carried out through a collaborative effort with key agencies including UNDP, the World Bank and UNEP. Moreover, the IEA works closely with international fora to share lessons learned such as the Major Economies Forum, the Clean Energy Ministerial as well as SE4All, including the SE4All Energy Efficiency Hub, which is based in Copenhagen. 
The IEA Programme focuses on countries that have large visible energy sectors and are important in relation to global GHG emissions such as Mexico, Brazil, China, India, South Africa, Chile, and Indonesia. Other countries could also be included, in particular as part of regional or sub-regional efforts.</narrative>
