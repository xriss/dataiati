   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Ongoing turmoil, increased polarization and instability in the MENA region underlines the continuous need for support to a strengthened civil society by involvement of youth and youth organisations. Structural challenges for youth remain largely the same even though the overall national and regional context has changed tremendously since the formulation of DUFs MENA-DK Youth Programme 2014-2016 &apos;Strengthening Youth Agency&apos;. Youth is still marginalized socially, economically and politically and there is need to support democracy, strengthen cooperation and dialogue across borders and strengthen the role of youth in society. DUF will address the development objective: A strengthened civil society and democratic political culture in the MENA-region where youth are organised and youth organisations have influence through three programme objectives: 1) Youth organisations in the MENA region increases capacity in and practical experience with influencing own societies and contributes to reform and democratization processes. 2) Youth and youth organisations in MENA and Denmark increase capacity in and practical experience with dialogue and cooperation across political, cultural and geographical divides. 3) Danish youth organisations are committed to support and engage in reform and democratization processes in the MENA region by using and developing own organisational experiences and competences, and through participation in public debates and events. The core of DUF&apos;s programme remains our youth-to-youth approach. Experience shows that youth-led initiatives give rise to unique commitment and approach to cooperation and joint projects to build trust and create strong sense of ownership. The outcome is not merely cost effective but, more importantly, sustainable. Work is focused on the well tested programme components of especially the MENA pool including advisory services, learning activities, cross-political network and the Ambassadors for Dialogue programme.</narrative>
