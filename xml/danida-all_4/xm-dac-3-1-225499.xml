  </title>
  <description type="2" xml:lang="EN">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The objective is to contribute to the realization the enormous potential which Fairtrade still holds in Denmark. In spite of impressive growth rates, the market share of Fairtrade labeled products is still very small compared to total retail sales. The annual consumption of Fairtrade labeled products in Denmark was app. DKK 96 per capita in 2012. Fairtrade Mark Denmark estimates that the potential for Fairtrade labeled products in Denmark is app. DKK 500 per capita before 2020, and it is only through continued and massive motivation of consumers and commercial actors that the potential can be realized and thereby create yet more development impact in developing countries. 
Realizing this potential requires a continuation of the year-long and successful cooperation between The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Fairtrade Mark Denmark, which among other things has resulted in very high label recognition and in impressive growth in both sales and number of products. With its CSR action plan and development strategy, the Danish government wishes to strengthen the social responsibility of consumers and companies. With this project, Fairtrade Mark Denmark wishes to contribute to these ambitions in a very relevant and important way.</narrative>
