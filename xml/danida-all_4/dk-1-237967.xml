   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Development objective: 
Improve the nutritional and educational status of hard to reach children in three districts of the Mid-Western high hills of Nepal. 
Immediate objectives: 
1. Improved access to flexible and better quality education for seasonal migrant children 
2. Improved nutrition and food security of families in the target districts 
3. Strengthened links between communities and service providers to ensure quality services 
Primary target groups: The project is directly targeting 4500 children in 30 schools as well as 4.500 women of 180 mothers groups and members of 90 farmers groups in the hills. The project area will be approximately 20 Village Develop&#xAC;ment Committees in the two districts and the selection is based on consultation with local authorities. The 30 schools are selected considering lack of basic infrastructure, number of migrating students and a high level of marginalized children in the area. The project will target all 180 mothers groups. Likewise, the project aims to directly target most of the farmers groups assuming 3-5 farmers groups in each Village Develop&#xAC;ment Committee (180 lead farmers from 90 farmers groups). 
Secondary target groups: The secondary target groups include service providers in Bajura, Mugu as well as in the Humla district, including 90 teachers, 40 extension agents, 30 Village Development Committees, as well as 180 female community health volunteers, 180 volunteer peer educators. In total approx. 700 volunteers, service providers and local government staff. In addition, local organisations representing Dalits and indigenous peoples will be involved as change agents who can continue to lobby for service provisions and influence the planning in the areas. 
Indirect beneficiaries: The project will positively affect up to 250.000 people (the population of the three districts) through campaigns, improved local planning and better quality services.</narrative>
