   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The grant is a response to the United Nations&apos; call for its Member States to continue providing funding for the AFISMA Trust Fund to finance activities during the transition from AFISMA to MINUSMA. The overall purpose of the Danish contribution to the UN Trust Fund for the African-led International Support Mission in Mali (AFISMA) is to contribute to the stabilization of Mali and to prevent the country from becoming a safe haven for Islamist terrorist groups. In line with other Danish support to African peace and security efforts the support to AFISMA has as an inbuilt objective to support Africans to take on a greater role and responsibility for African security challenges.

The objective is to provide a non-earmarked but DAC-able contribution to the Trust Fund for financing activities such as civilian personnel, IT-equipment and -systems, and outreach activities in Mali. The proposed grant will complement the previous Danish contribution granted from the Peace- and Stabilization Fund, which was non-DAC-able. 

While the first contribution to AFISMA helped to accelerate the deployment of AFISMA and thus strengthen the relationship with the Danish military contribution, the objective of this proposed grant is to further support AFISMA pursuant to its resolution UN Security Resolution 2085 in order to contribute to a smooth transition phase from AFISMA to MINUSMA, as a response to the call in UN Security Council by Resolution 2100 (UNSCR 2100).

As the transition to a UN mission was completed, the remaining grant will be transferred to be utilized by MINUSMA, pending an agreement with the UN.</narrative>
