   <narrative xml:lang="EN">WFP&apos;s efforts in Syria and the region is only funded 44 per cent and 49 per cent respectively. WFP has in a letter dated 18 September requested donor countries, including Denmark, for additional financial resources for food intervention in Syria and neighboring countries. Additional 352 million USD are needed for the rest of the year. Due to insufficient funding, WFP has already reduced food rations in Syria by 40 per cent, and from November, they also have to reduce the distribution in Lebanon by 20-30 per cent., while refugees outside the camps in Jordan will have their aid cut with more than 50 per cent. At the same time WFP suspend the distribution of food in camps in Turkey. The consequences will include increased food insecurity, further population movements and a growing trend of child labor and early marriage. A Danish contribution to WFP&apos;s regional efforts, however, will help to reduce such problems.</narrative>
