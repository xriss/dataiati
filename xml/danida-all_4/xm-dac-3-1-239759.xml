   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Copenhagen Accord from the 15th Conference of the Parties (COP) of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in Copenhagen 2009 - mentions a Climate Fund. The Green Climate Fund (GCF) was formally established the following year during the 2010 United Nations Climate Change Conference (UNCCC) in Cancun. 

A GCF Board was established comprising 12 members from developing countries and 12 members from developed countries. In the GCF Board&apos;s first term, which expires in 2015, Denmark shares a Board seat with the Netherlands. 

The purpose of the GCF is to make a significant and ambitious contribution to the global efforts towards attaining the goals set by the international community to combat climate change. The GCF will support programmes and projects in developing and middle income countries in order to counter climate change. 

The GCF Board has decided to aim for the following portfolio targets: 
- a 50/50 funding balance between adaptation and mitigation over time 
- a floor of fifty percent of adaptation allocation for vulnerable countries in order to ensure sufficient allocation of adaptation funding for vulnerable countries (including the least developed countries (LDCs), small island developing States (SIDS) and African States)
- reasonable and fair allocation across a broad range of countries in order to ensure geographic balance of funding

The GCF Secretariat is in Songdo, South Korea. The World Bank is serving as the Interim Trustee of the GCF</narrative>
