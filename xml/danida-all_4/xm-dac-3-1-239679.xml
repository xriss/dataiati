   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The overall strategic objective of the project is to obtain a significant and sustained reduction in the incidence of sexual and gender based violence (SGBV) against women and children in Ghana. The project is perfectly in line with the Danish Strategy for Development Aid `The Right to a Better Life&apos;, which states that Denmark will &quot;be at the forefront of international efforts to promote sexual and reproductive health and rights&quot;, the newly launched `Strategic framework for Gender Equality, Rights and Diversity in Danish Development Cooperation&apos;, where both gender-based violence and the involvement of men and boys plays central roles as well as the Denmark-Ghana Policy Paper 2014-2018 where Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights is one of three policy tracks. The focus will be on preventing violence by raising awareness of SGBV and sensitizing court personal and the media. The aim is to bring attitudinal and behavioural change at the cultural, institutional and individual levels, with a particular focus on working with men and boys. Over a one year period, this project aims to achieve the following results: Improved service delivery from the justice sector in handling sexual and gender based violence (SGBV) cases; Enhanced capacities of communities and organised men&apos;s groups to prevent and report the incidence of SGBV; Sensitize religious and traditional leaders to better understand the damaging practices and consequences of SGBV; Foster strong partnerships with the media through the demystification of SGBV for journalists and media practitioners to facilitate gender sensitive reporting.</narrative>
