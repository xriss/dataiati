   <narrative xml:lang="EN">International Partnership for Microbicides (IPM) is a leading partner in the global HIV/AIDS response with a special focus on women. IPM works on a rights based global health agenda to prevent HIV transmission by addressing the need for safe, affordable and effective microbicide-based HIV prevention. Microbicides are medicines being developed based on antiretroviral drugs already used successfully to treat AIDS, but now used to offer protection against HIV.

IPM has a triple mandate: to develop antiretroviral-based safe, effective and affordable microbicides which can be used by women to protect themselves against HIV infection; to make these products available as soon as possible where the need is the most urgent; and to advocate for awareness about microbicides as a key to control the spread of HIV.
 
IPM is a non-profit product development partnership (PDP). PDPs are non-profit organisations which generate resources and forge partnerships across public, private and philanthropic sectors to accelerate the development of new health tools and technologies that target diseases which affect developing countries disproportionally, such as HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria. PDPs collaborate with pharmaceutical and biotech companies to develop critically needed, but often not profitable, medical products for resource poor settings.</narrative>
