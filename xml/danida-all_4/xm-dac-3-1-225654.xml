   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project provides immediate humanitarian assistance to Sudanese refugees in camps in Upper Nile and Unity States, as well as host-communities, and (from mid-June) IDPs. Activities include shelter, non-food items, community infrastructure and provision of agricultural inputs to help improve self-reliance amongst refugees. Support to DRC&#xBF;s technical staff based in the camps is also provided. Direct beneficiaries include at least 20,000 households (100,000 people). Status: In June, 2014, the project was revised to also include support to IDP&#xBF;s displaced due to conflict in the 2 project states. Whilst many activities were completed as planned, some significant delays occurred in procurement of NFIs for IDP sites - scheduled to coincide with the end-of-year dry season. In December 2014 DRC was granted a budget revision (primarily to re-align support costs with changing needs, including reduced costs for national staff). Subsequently DRC also requested a 3-month, non-cost-extension to complete remaining procurement and finalise the project.</narrative>
