  </title>
  <description type="2" xml:lang="EN">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The seminar examined how a selection of donors, development agencies and development interventions: 
A) Analyse the nexus between growth, employment, income, productivity and jobless Growth.
B) Utilize employment generation as an indicator for success in programming, and 
C) Aim to measure employment in affiliated indicator and M&amp;E systems.
A panel discussion with Q&amp;A from participants examined if the indicator of employment should or could be relevantly supplemented - or made more operational - with the inclusion of other indicators (e.g. income). The following questions were discussed:
1) Is employment creation a realistic goal? Do we have sufficient evidence of the potential links to increases in employment, from increases in productivity, competitiveness and incomes?
2) Can employment creation readily be combined with other priorities, such as a poverty focus, gender, environmental concerns and a rural focus? Do programmes accept/use employment as a priority focus or do they choose other priorities?
3) Is understanding of the employment dynamic sufficiently widespread and agreed upon to enhance measurement? 
4) How are goals of employment supervised and addressed in M&amp;E systems?</narrative>
