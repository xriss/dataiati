   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The overall aim of the appropriation is to bring momentum and relevance into negotiation processes on climate and environment by engaging and involving the civil society in developing countries. In order to secure a transparent, lean and professional process an agreement was reached in 2013 with &quot;Civil Society in Development - CISU&quot; to administer a Climate and Environemnt Fund (CEF) where Danish civil society organisations can apply for Funding to activities in developing countries. Under a previous project an application round took place in 2013. The NexT application round was in October 2014. Two more application rounds are envisaged in 2015 and 2016. The focus is on activities related to capacity building and specific advocacy on behalf of or together with poor and underrepresented target Groups in the Sourht, primarity linked to regional and international political and international political and strategic Development processes and negotiations on subjects regarding climate and environemnt (such as the climate COP&#xB4;s and the post 2015 process on formulating sustainable development goals). Consideration is given to ensure that the Projects supported are demand-driven and that partnerships are genuine. A desk appraisal has appraised CEF positively.</narrative>
