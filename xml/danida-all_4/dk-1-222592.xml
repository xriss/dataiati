  <description type="1" xml:lang="EN">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Global Water Partnership (GWP) is the world&#xBF;s largest network on water with some 2700 members in 167 countries. Denmark has supported the GWP since its inception in 1996 with the objective of strengthening in particular civil society/water user organizations in the management of water resources. A new strategy with focus on 
catalysing change, generate, access and share knowledge and strengthen partnerships is being formulated with Denmark playing an active role as a donor representative on the Strategy Committee. The new support of 67 million DKK will be provided for a 5 year period with 40 million as core funding, 20 million in an Innovation Fund with focus on regional activities in Africa and on private sector development, and 7 million in support of GWP engagement in the SDG process on water. The support to GWP compliments multilateral support to water being provided of UNEP and World Bank. Special consideration for Danish support to GWP is a rights based approach to water user participation in integrated water resource management.</narrative>
