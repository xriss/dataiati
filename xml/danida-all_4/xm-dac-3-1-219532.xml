   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project contributed to the alleviation of the humanitarian needs of Syrian IDPs in Syria and Syrian refugees in Jordan and Lebanon during winter 2013-2014. In Syria due to the good prices obtained through the international procurement procedure, NFI kits for at least 5,000 Households were purchased and distributed. DRC rehabilitated three communal shelters, and provided water supply system connection for 19 unfinished buildings where IDPs have been relocated in agreement with relevant authorities. All the works implemented contributed to providing IDPs with minimum living conditions and a winterized shelter. DRC provided different equipment (laptops, generators, furniture etc.) for 4 distribution points for SARC in Homs. Finally DRC provided desktops and laptops for 1 charity organization working in Homs in partnership with SARC and in charge of managing 10 communal shelters and 2 distribution points. In Jordan the project provided one-time cash assistance to 1,382 households (70% Syrian, 30% Jordanian) in Amman over the course of 6 months using DRC&#xBF;s Emergency Cash Guidance Note and standardized criteria for emergency assistance. In Lebanon the funding was used to procure 3,416 mattresses, 4,270 winter blankets and 854 hygiene kits as part of a contingency stock. The funds were used to procure the necessary items to support approx. 800 families in the case of a sudden emergency influx of Syrian refugees into Lebanon.</narrative>
