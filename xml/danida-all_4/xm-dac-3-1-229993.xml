   <narrative xml:lang="EN">DRC&#xBF;s NFI programme in Syria mainly targets five governorates: Damascus, Rural Damascus, Dara&#xBF;a, Homs and Aleppo. Inside the target governorates, DRC prioritizes the distribution of NFIs in Hard Reach Areas because assistance has been provided irregularly and needs are higher. DRC&#xBF;s NFI programme is aimed at meeting both general NFI needs of the target populations as well as specific needs of the most vulnerable individuals. DRC will distribute standard NFI kits as agreed by the Shelter/NFI sector in Damascus (per each family: 3 matrasses, 5 blankets, 1 hygiene kit, 1 kitchen set, 1 plastic sheet, 1 jerry can, and 1 infant kit per each infant up to 24 months) primarily to newly displaced families, and ad hoc NFIs and special needs equipment (e.g. wheelchairs, walkers, crouches, to PWSN). Beneficiaries of the project will be IDPs, refugees, and people in need. No. of beneficiaries: 7,500 HH, and 250 individuals for ad hoc NFI distribution. 
Turkey: The objective of the project closely aligns to the priorities documented in the Regional Response Plan. The project contributes to the Syrian refugees food assistance needs in Turkey. The purpose is to provide food security for 500 extremely vulnerable refugee households living in Kilis, for a period of 6 months; DRC will build-on is its e-card system developed under its DFID-funded project. DRC will utilise its extensive assessment data to accurately identify the most vulnerable refugee households for assistance. Beneficiaries will be visited by a member of staff where a follow-up assessment will be conducted. A committee will finalise a caseload of 500 of the most vulnerable households to receive monthly assistance. Each household will receive an e-card on which a prescribed amount of cash will be pre-loaded. The card can be used at selected outlets for specific food items. Each month the card will be topped up with the same amount - 30 TRY per month for all households regardless of size.</narrative>
