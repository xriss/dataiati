   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The ESMAP Business Plan 2014 -2016 with a proposed budget of 137 million USD builds on ESMAPs track record as a global program for analytical and advisory activities in the energy sector. ESMAP is integrated in the World Bank&#xBF;s country dialogue and lending programs, while it maintains a separate identity. The core of ESMAPs Business Plan is analytical and advisory activities linked to the World Banks country policy dialogue and investment lending programs supplemented by global and regional programs.

ESMAP focus areas are as follows:

Energy Security. To help ensure long-term energy security, countries are looking closely at renewable energy, efficiency practices and technologies, diversification of supply, and improved sector performance. ESMAP assists its clients to carry out energy assessments and develop strategies to enhance sector planning, regulation, and governance.

Energy Access. ESMAP supports initiatives to reduce energy poverty by expanding access to modern, safe, affordable and sustainable energy services, e.g. support to sector reforms as well as grid and off-grid solutions and through new access projects etc. ESMAPs energy access work covers electrification and household energy needs in rural areas and for the urban poor. The World Bank on its own will not be able to provide all needed financing to meet the access goals of SE4All, but it will also actively cooperate with partners and serve as catalyst for additional investment from both public and private sources.

Climate change. ESMAP assists client countries to integrate climate change mitigation and adaptation options into energy sector planning with a view to sustaining low-carbon transformation. ESMAP also supports the scale-up of renewable energy through resource assessments, strategy development, and policy and institutional development.</narrative>
