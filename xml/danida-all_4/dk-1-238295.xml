   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In the light of the still more serious developments in Syria and the escalation of needs in Syria&apos;s neighboring countries, the UN decided in July to focus the existing Regional Humanitarian Fund (which since 2012 has distributed 73,5 million USD) on activities exclusively in Syria and simultaneously create two country funds for Jordan and Lebanon. Based on the experience of the regional fund, the country fund for Lebanon will focus on providing complementary funding to primarily international and national NGOs working in the 242 areas in Lebanon classified as vulnerable or in Syria in the border area to Lebanon. Support for the fund will enable Danish participation in the fund&#xBF;s &apos;Advisory Board&apos;, which the Danish embassy in Beirut will charge. Support will also complement the Danish efforts during RDPP and show solidarity with the Lebanese host communities, which will also be supported by the Fund. The fund was launched in week 42, and it operates with a budget of 10 million USD the first 12 months. So far, Norway, Sweden, Germany and the UK indicated its intention to support the fund, but OCHA has not yet received specific pledges of support.</narrative>
