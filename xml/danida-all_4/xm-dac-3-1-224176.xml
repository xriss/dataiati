   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The United Nations Environmental Programme (UNEP) was established in 1972. UNEP&#xB4;s headquarter is placed in Nairobi. The UNEP mandate comprises five overall, interrelated areas: 1. Keeping the world environmental situation under review; 2. Catalysing and promoting international cooperation and action; 3. Providing policy advice and early warning information, based upon sound science and assessment; 4. Facilitating the development, implementation and evolution of norms and standards and developing coherent interlinkages among international environmental conventions; 5. Strengthening technology support and capacity in line with country needs and priorities. At Rio+20 in 2012 Heads of State and government decided to strengthen and upgrade UNEP. This was followed by a UN General Assembly resolution which granted UNEP universal membership and called for increased resources. UNEP is currently undergoing an institutional reform as a follow up of Rio+20.

UNEP&apos;s Programme of Work and budget is biannual and is approved at the UN Environmental Assembly (UNEA) which takes place every second year. UNEP&#xB4;s activities includes work on biodiversity, climate and green growth, chemicals, energy, the atmospere, water, oceans and coastal areas, urban environment, capacity building, etc. These activities are financed through voluntary contributions, non-earmarked contributions to UNEP&apos;s Environment Fund, and different forms of earmarked contributions.</narrative>
