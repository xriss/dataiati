   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project is a pilot project for modeling the integration of the constitutional values and principles in health service delivery and will assist in guiding the process of implementation by various actors in the other counties. As part of its mandate to facilitate the implementation of the Constitution and its strategic objective to strengthen institutional frameworks and administrative procedures for full implementation, Commission for the Implementation of the Constitution has planned to work with various implementers at the national and county government levels to ensure integration of constitutional values and principles including the rights based approach to service delivery in their operational systems for improvement of service delivery to citizens and full implementation of the Constitution. CIC will work closely with Bungoma, Nyeri and Kitui counties to review their administrative and operational frameworks for the County health facilities for better service delivery. Whereas these health facilities have some operational frameworks including service charters, these need to be reviewed to ensure compliance with the Constitution in particular the provisions of Articles 10, 27, 53, 54, 55 and 56 and chapters 6, 12 and 13 among other articles.</narrative>
