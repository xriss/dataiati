   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The SSF is a multi-donor fund, whose aim is to work towards a peaceful, secure and stable Somalia by addressing the political, security and developmental drivers of instability throughout the country. To achieve this, the Stability Fund aims to address the security, development and political drivers of conflict in a local area to achieve the following outcomes: (1) Legitimate, viable governance structures are able to make and enforce rules locally; and (2) existing and emerging conflicts are brought to conclusion and risks of future conflicts are mitigated. 

The SSF delivers this support through four windows: the government window that provides support to the Federal Government of Somalia (FGS) in support of districts liberated from Al Shabaab; the area based window that supports conflict mitigation and governance in a given area; the sector based window that manages projects to address nation-wide conflict drivers such as youth unemployment; and finally the Rapid Disbursal Fund that support pre-existing projects related to SSF.

The Stability Fund is governed by the Fund Manager (currently Adam Smith International) overseen by the Secretariat Office. The Secretariat Office is in turn overseen by the Joint Donor Committee. As of January 2015, Denmark, Norway, Netherlands, Sweden, UAE and UK are funding SSF.

The Somalia Financial Mechanism (SFM) was established in 2013 to support the federal government of Somalia to implement social projects and capacity development project in specific ministries. the SFM was closed in April 2016, with 100% delivery and satisfaction from both the FGS and DK.</narrative>
