   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Program Title: &#xBF;Lifesaving relief to vulnerable South Sudanese affected by the conflict in South Sudan&#xBF;. The programme addresses the immediate shelter and relief needs of 17,000 of the most vulnerable populations in Bor County, Jonglei state by assisting South Sudan Red Cross in distributing shelter and relief items for the most affected living in temporary settlements or in host communities (Result 1). The project will ensure that both the population displaced by the conflict and the host communities are made aware of public health risks and have adopted measures to prevent a deterioration of the existing hygienic conditions (Result 2). The severity of the violence witnessed and losses and traumas experienced by many among the displaced population make psychosocial interventions imperative. The psychosocial component will secure the immediate well-being and longer-term resilience of the target group through functional, and culturally appropriate, strategies and interventions that do not require psychological expertise (Result 3). South Sudan Red Cross, through their local branch in Bor will lead the implementation of the activities. Danish Red Cross has a delegate based in bor to support the programme activities. The programme is also supported by the international Committee of Red Cross (ICRC) who is overall responsible for security of the project staff and volunteers and access to activity sites outside Bor town. The ICRC is also supporting the project with procurement of shelter and relief items and transportation to the South Sudan Red Cross branch in Bor.</narrative>
