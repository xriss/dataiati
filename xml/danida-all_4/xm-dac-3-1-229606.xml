   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Denmark&apos;s humanitarian support is guided by the &quot;Strategy for Danish Humanitarian Action 2010-2015&quot;, and its overall strategic priorities and in particular the objectives of &apos;protecting conflict-affected populations&apos; with a focus on vulnerable groups, and &apos;strengthening partnerships&apos;.

Denmark has identified UNICEF as a key implementing partner organization in the priority area of child protection, and entered into a Humanitarian Partnership Agreement with UNFPA in 2010. Under the Agreement, Danish support is provided to UNICEF humanitarian programme interventions in countries experiencing protracted humanitarian crises.

In 2014, Denmark granted DKK 40 million under the Humanitarian Partnership Agreement between UNICEF and Denmark. The grant was based on UNICEF&apos;s 2014 Humanitarian Action for Children which provides an overview of UNICEF&apos;s humanitarian programmes. 

In 2014, the Danish funding was allocated to the following conflict-affected countries in protracted crises: Afghanistan, Pakistan, Sudan and South Sudan . Moreover, global humanitarian support was provided for UNICEF programme support, operational support for rapid mobilization and shipment of essential life-saving supplies, and regional support in emergency preparedness and response.

UNICEF targets interventions in the areas of health, nutrition, water and sanitation, child protection and education.</narrative>
