   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The main objective of the Project was to enhance the transparency and accuracy of election results and the management of the
candidate nomination process of the Bangladesh Election Commission (BEC) through the
development of a computerised results management system and candidate management system. However due to the volatile political situation and amid the boycott of the 10th Parliamentary Election by the opposition, some activities could not take place, as planned. Later UNDP came up with a broader project aiming at creating a more conducive environment for stakeholders including political actors to generate and participate in inclusive public policy dialogue on big society issues. Although some achievements in the originally planned activities were made in the area of training and capacity building, ensuring transparency and effectiveness in candidate information management and election result management, supporting major procurements and logistics for elections, etc. However, it was identified that several of the planned activities notable in the area of voter education and training were substantially reduced from that was initially planned as a result of volatile political situation and the decisions of the opposition to boycott the polls. In this circumstances, the participating Development Partners agreed to have some revised activities under the project. Accordingly the Project has been provided with a no-cost extension until September 30, 2015 to implement those activities. However due to reduction of activities the full Danish amount remained unspent. UNDP completed the project and returned the Danish contribution. Thus this project is considered as non-materialised project as far as Denmark is concerned and will be closed accordingly.</narrative>
