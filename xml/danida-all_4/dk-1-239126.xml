    <narrative xml:lang="EN">Improvement in Ease of Doing Business Ranking (as reported by the World Bank)
Baseline: 112
Target: 100	

Technical and financial assistance to the GRA is expected to lead to increased domestic revenue collection (taxation and customs duties), greater investor confidence, and strengthen the environment for doing business in Ghana. Core support to GII and IMANI will reduce levels of corruption and increase levels of transparency and accountability that will in turn ensure that revenue due to and collected by GoG, including but not limited to taxation and customs revenue, is not lost. This in turn will increase investor confidence in doing business with Ghana and lead to greater trade and investment and higher levels of revenue collection through taxation and customs duties that can be used to improve service-delivery and access to socio-economic rights, contribute to the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and reduce levels of poverty and inequality.</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">Using the World Bank&#x2019;s Ease of Business ranking, it shows that Ghana&#x2019;s ranking slipped from 112 to 118 instead of attaining the target of 100. This negative rank was due to a number of factors, many of which are beyond the direct influence of the Tax and Development programme.</narrative>
