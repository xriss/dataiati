    <narrative xml:lang="EN">Assessment of results: The Education Bureau and All China Women&#x2019;s Federation have recognised the importance of children&#x2019;s holistic development for better life, and the crucial importance of schools to support children&#x2019;s healthy developments. They have produced official endorsements and asked all village level schools to use the curriculum in their weekly schedule. As the life skill concept was very new to the partners, their understanding and acceptance had the first priority, while the intervention through curriculum and improvement of children&#x2019;s life skills was rolled afterwards. Additionally, the project was advocated to regional level partners through different meetings to make a bigger impact.

      <narrative xml:lang="EN">Concrete evidence from project sites will be used to encourage local education authorities to mainstream life skills education in primary schools. As the life skills curriculum is best taught using child-centred, participatory teaching methodologies, advocating for a broad adoption of the life skills curriculum will help introduce these teaching methodologies. Local authorities in Korla and Hotan will be aimed to roll out life skills education in all schools under their administration beyond the existing project schools. The regional education bureau will be involved at strategic moments during the project to encourage wider adoption at the regional level, and media will be used to widely publicise project success stories.</narrative>

Schools have implemented a more robust management to enhance students&#x2019; safety and teachers&#x2019; behaviours and reporting systems have been set up.

      <narrative xml:lang="EN">Incorporating the life skills curriculum will enable children to acquire skills beyond the national unified school curriculum and empower them with additional skills to use later in life. A life skills curriculum will be introduced in primary schools by cooperating with education research centres, teachers and children to set up a working group and identify appropriate topics that the curriculum will deal with. Following the model of the previous life skills project, a set of life skills curriculum targeting different age groups will be developed.</narrative>

The project team developed six sessions on positive parenting training, including how to encourage children to cooperate with adults, the methods instead of punishment, to teach children how to be independent etc. The sessions have been very useful for parents who know very little about positive parenting. The parent gained a sound understanding of education notions, and their educational and parenting behaviours have been improved to some extent.
