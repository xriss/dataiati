   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Through this project, Danida has helped ensure the continuation and expansion of the Danish Refugee Council&#xBF;s (DRC&#xBF;s) response to the displacement crisis caused by the conflict that erupted in South Sudan in December 2013. Activities include Camp Coordination and Camp Management (CCCM) and Protection programming in three IDP sites in Unity and Upper Nile states, as well as Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) activities and Protection support for South Sudanese refugees in Ethiopia and Uganda. Protection issues are being mainstreamed into all programming in line with DRC&#xBF;s approach, and specific attention given to vulnerable individuals/groups, including people with special needs, women, children, elderly and at-risk youth. The project is directly benefiting more than 185,000 people who have been affected (and the vast majority displaced) by the conflict &#xBF; including some 85,000 IDPs who have sought protection inside the United Nations Mission in South Sudan (UNMISS) compounds in Rubkona, Malakal and Melut counties; 50,000 people in refugee camps in Gambella, Ethiopia; and more than 50,000 refugees residing in Arua and Adjumani districts in Uganda</narrative>
