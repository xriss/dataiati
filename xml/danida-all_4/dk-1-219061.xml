  <description type="1" xml:lang="EN">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Security and Defence Transformation Programme in South Sudan builds on a bilateral initiative by the UK&apos;s Department for International Development (DFID) that from 2009-2012 has engaged with the Government of South Sudan on security sector reform and transformation of the South Sudanese army - Sudan&apos;s People Liberation Army (SPLA). In 2013 a second phase of the programme was agreed with Denmark as a co-donor along with the UK. The technical provider for both phases is Adam Smith International.

The programme is comprised of three overlapping areas of focus. The first focus area, development of National Security Policy and Architecture, aims to support the government&#xBF;s efforts to create a national security policy and strategy. 

The second focus area supports the governments stated intent to transform the SPLA and the Ministry of Defence and Veterans Affairs including down-sizing and restructuring of the oversized and costly SPLA. 

The third focus area aims at improving oversight and accountability of the security sector which includes capacity building of civil society groups to engage in security sector reform.</narrative>
