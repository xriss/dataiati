   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Agriculture Fast Track Fund (AFT) was established in 2013 as a multi-donor fund in the African Development Bank (AfDB), with support amounting to 27 million USD from USAID (15 million USD) and SIDA (12 million USD). The overall objective of the AFT is to contribute to the reduction of poverty by mitigating the infrastructure deficiency in the agriculture sector in Africa. The AFT is an innovative facility, which contributes to developing and financing projects that are eligible for funding through development finance institutions and private investors. The innovative approach of the AFT to fast-track private sector investments in the agriculture sector in Africa is in line with Danish strategic priorities for the African Development Bank and goes to the core of the new Danish Opportunity Africa initiative - a growth initiative in Africa. Since the AFT is a new and innovative vehicle, Danida will follow the work of the Fund very closely. Thus, the Danish grant of 10 million DKK for fast tracking agricultural projects will be channelled through the AFT in a 5 year period from 2013-2017, while an additional 0.5 million DKK will be used for external technical assistance.</narrative>
