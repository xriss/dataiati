   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project is to undertake policy advocacy for the implementation of Peace Accord building capacity of state and non-state actors and establish mechanism for the support of the victims of communal attacks and peace-building in the Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHT) region of Bangladesh. The three priority areas of the project are: (1) Advocacy for full implementation of Peace Accord and national process to build support; (2) Capacity development of CHTIs to support confidence building; and 3) A quick response mechanism for the victims of communal attacks. These results will be delivered by achieving synergies with support provided by UNDP in other areas which the Chittagong Hill Tracts Development Facility (CHTDF) has been providing support since 2003. The interventions under this project will be carried out within the framework of the already approved &#xBF;Promotion of Development and Confidence Building in the CHT Project&#xBF; (CHTDF Project) under the Direct Execution (DEX) modality. It will address immediate needs, seizing opportunity to achieve progress and addressing risks. At the same time, it will build a platform for UNDP managed support of development partners and UN 2015 onwards.</narrative>
