   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project was designed to address some of the basic household and seasonal needs of 3,500 Syrian refugee families in urban centres and Jordanian host families. The project served a total of 4,020 families or 23,206 persons, comprising 3,320 Syrian refugee families with a focus on the most vulnerable, particularly recent arrivals, as well as 700 poor Jordanian families. 33% of beneficiary families were resident in Irbid, 27% in Amman, 21% in Mafraq and 19% in Zarqa Governorates. 98% of Syrian refugees served by the project were registered or awaiting registration with UNHCR. Thanks to favourable exchange rate developments between the US dollar and the Danish Krone during 2013, the project was able to assist an extra 520 Syrian refugee families at a time when the number of newly-arriving Syrian refugees to Jordan was increasing dramatically. In concrete terms, 4,020 families received and redeemed vouchers valued at DKK 315.44 per family for the purchase of basic household items, while 4,010 families received and redeemed vouchers valued at DKK 157.72 per family for the purchase of personal hygiene items and detergents. Each of the 4,010 families was also provided with 1 heater and 4 blankets. Beneficiary feedback indicated a high satisfaction rate (89%) with the voucher items provided.</narrative>
