   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The program will be implemented for the benefit of not only Syrian refugees, but also the hard-hit communities. Other refugees may be included if relevant in the present context. The program will consist of the following activities:
- Activities to strengthen refugee protection through individual counseling, capacity building of relevant authorities and civil society organizations in order to ensure that refugees are treated in accordance with international principles.
- Activities in favor of the social and economic development of communities that host refugees, including improving living conditions primarily through income and employment incentives among refugees as well as local host communities. It is expected, among other things to include technical training, support for the establishment of small businesses and shops etc.
- Implementation of independent analysis to ensure a more objective and accurate knowledge-base for the authorities and aid organizations&apos; future efforts in host countries. The analysis will include focus on social and economic consequences of the protracted refugee crisis in these countries. The analytical work is carried out by local and international institutional capacities in the host countries. The work is expected to be conducted by the World Bank and will to some extent include capacity building of local partners.
- Advocacy, policy dialogue and communication, which helps to ensure that neighboring countries&apos; governments and peoples remain prepared to keep the borders open for the refugees.
- Programme management, monitoring etc. In accordance with the general guidelines of the EU Commission&apos;s aid direct costs for program development and management is covered. It involves costs to pay for a program manager and two program officers, the operation of the program offices in Amman and Beirut, as well as the costs of any external consultants.</narrative>
