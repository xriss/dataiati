   <narrative xml:lang="EN">ADMIRE has been designed by the UNOPS - UNEP DTI-J Partnership with the objective of providing assistance to the private sector in developing countries in the design, implementation and financing of NAMAs and NAPs. ADMIRE had the target of supporting 14 climate adaptation or mitigation projects, out of which 10 were expected to be registered by UNFCCC and 5 were expected to raise external funding for future implementation.
ADMIRE&apos; s objective was to identify initiatives that support development of commercially feasible, replicable and scalable business models via direct engagement with the private sector submitted to UDP by local proponents and approved by ADMIRE&apos;s Technical Review Committee (TRC).
The concept and importance of NAMAs and NAPs have not reached its original expectation, and by 2019, they are almost non-existent as an instrument. ADMIRE therefore adjusted its approach and continued to support private sector involvement in mitigation and adaptation actions.</narrative>
