    <narrative xml:lang="EN">Mali is in a period of transition, as the country attempts to secure a fragile peace through implementation of the Accord for Peace and Reconciliation in Mali that was brokered by Algeria in June 2015. Having emerged from a complex crisis, Mali is rebuilding its social, economic and governance institutions while trying to combat violence and lawlessness throughout the country. The U.S. government will continue to deliver the critical development assistance necessary to support Mali&apos;s recovery and the peace process. Key U.S. interests in Mali include support for restoration of a stable democracy and improvement in accountable governance; promotion of regional security by combating terrorists and narco-traffickers that exploit ungoverned spaces in the Sahel; reduction of chronic vulnerability through improved social services; response to, and prevention of, threats such as Ebola; increased resilience; and economic growth through sustainable development and increased U.S. economic investment. Achieving these U.S. priorities requires not only continued U.S. government engagement on security and governance issues, but also robust investments in the areas of democracy, agriculture, health, education, and public diplomacy. Mali is also a Relief to Development Transition (R2DT) Focus Country.</narrative>
