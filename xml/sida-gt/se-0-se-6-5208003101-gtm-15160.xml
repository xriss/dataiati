   <narrative xml:lang="EN">&quot;Support to the National Strategy for Protection of the Human Rights of Children 2014-2017&quot;, extended to 2108, in the total amount of SEK 54 600 000, seeks to help child and adolescent victims of threats and violations exercise their human rights in a coordinated and decentralized child protection system. Construction of a consolidated national system will strengthen inter-institutional coordination with clear roles and responsibilities, and improve State protection services and attention to child and adolescent victims of violence. The intervention builds on results of previous, long-term cooperation between UNICEF and Sida in Guatemala, related to children&apos;s special protection needs and respect for child rights.
The intervention also seeks to identify, evidence and question social practises which promote violence and exclusion of children and adolescents, reproduced in State institutions in charge of protection of minors. The objective is not only to strengthen the relevant State institutions, but also impact positively on attitudes towards minors in need of special protection and the institutional practises when attending child victims.
Within program framework, UNICEF coordinates and works with nine different State institutions, including the National Police, the Judicial, Attorney General, Ministry for Foreign Affairs, and agencies directly in charge of child welfare and protection. It also coordinates with civil society organizations dedicated to child rights and protection.</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">During the five year program period, important results have been achieved at community, municipal, institutional and civil society levels, which together constitute a strategy for protecting human rights of children while supporting institutional transformation in duty-holder state institutions.
Below some of the main achievements at each intervention level:
1. Community and municipal level
There is an improved access and more personalized attention to victims requiring special protection services. Foundations have been created to develop a model for Community Protection System (principal focus of the 2019-2023 program) with creation of tools, pilot exercises and validation of future intervention proposal, including attention in urban areas of high vulnerability of the department of Guatemala. The State of Guatemala now has a validated model to implement the Municipal Protection System. At the end of the program, 45% of municipalities had Municipal Offices for Child Protection; 8% of municipalities receive support from other cooperation agencies based on the methodology created by UNICEF with Swedish support. UNICEF has promoted the creation of Municipal Directorates of Children and Adolescents to engage in initiatives to promote social and special protection polities for child victims. The concept of Municipal Offices for Children has been integrated in public policy documents, such as the Policy on Violence Prevention 2014-2034.
2. National level
Although Bill 5285, which seeks to create a holistic and comprehensive national child protection system, was not passed (discussions to approve laws related to children and adolescents may take up to 10-15 years in the Congress), important social and institutional transformation processes at different dependencies of the executive, legislative and judiciary branches have been achieved. Among concrete results are, for example, the development of a national protocol to receive and provide care to returned unaccompanied migrant children; the creation of new prosecution office for children and adolescents within the Public Prosecutors Office (considered one of the most important results of the program); policy advocacy efforts jointly with other actors (resulting in adoption of new Migration Code in 2016); technical training to government officials; and the Child and Adolescent Protection Toolkit (compilation of analytical, educational and normative materials providing guidance and practical advice on how to implement the Child and Adolescent Protection Systems at each level).
3. Special protection sector
During the program cycle spanning over two different government administrations, important progress was achieved at Ministries of Health, Education, Social Development, Foreign Affairs and the Interior.
Ministry of Health established separate clinics to provide services to victims of sexual violence at the national hospital network and recording/follow-up of child mistreatment cases and sexual aggressions was improved in the Health Management Information System (SIGSA).
At the Ministry of Education, UNICEF promoted establishment of a Child Protection Unit. Follow-up was given in the use of VozApp which seeks to reduce violence at schools.
Ministry of Foreign Affairs has mainstreamed provision of psycho-social care for children in special care units comprised of psychologists and social workers at Consular Services in the US and Mexico; the related communication campaign on migrant rights during migratory process in the US and Mexico has been translated into 3 Mayan languages.
UNICEF has supported the Secretariat of Social Welfare in the development and implementation of Reception Protocols for returned, unaccompanied minors, and protocols for returned Family Units with the Secretariat of Social Works of the First Lady.&#xA0;Both protocols have psychosocial approach and are aimed at identifying children, adolescents and families in highly vulnerable situations needing special protection. Through Casa del Migrante, comprehensive minimum standards for provision of care at shelters have been established, while interviewing tools to avoid secondary victimization of migrant children have been developed. A National Protocol for the Reception and Provision of Assistance to Migrant Children and Adolescents in Guatemala managed to institutionalize a route for inter-institutional coordination among the different bodies of the Child Protection System.
Ministry of the Interior has made progress in establishing specialized criminal investigation and protocols for police action related to child and adolescent victims of crime. At central level, a criminal investigation team specialized in crimes against children has been created, and at national level, police agents have received training on application of protocols on police procedures to protect child victims of violence and for the detention of adolescents in conflict with the law.
Humanitarian attention (focusing on psycho-social attention) to children and adolescents was provided in 3 specific cases: State Care Home Hogar Seguro victims in 2017, victims of the volcanic eruption in June 2018 and the migrant caravans of 2019. 1,446 child victims of the volcanic eruption were assisted during seven months, and more than 2,000 migrant children and family members received emotional support and humanitarian assistance, while direct psycho-social and medical support were provided to survivors of the Hogar Seguro tragedy with assistance in relocation/reunification of other 550 children transferred from the care facility.
The Secretariat of Social welfare, the Office of the Attorney General and the National Adoption Council have all been benefited by the program. Support to staff technical training; advice on decentralization of services; normative reforms; implementation of pilot programmes; development of protocols; creation of uninstitutionalization policy for institutionalized children and youth (estimated at 5,000); development of regulation for case resolution; support to institutional re-restructuring; production of Guide for Foster Families; program and protocols for working with youth addictions; three specific programs related to children, youth and adults with disabilities under state care/Special Protection Services; development of program to provide assistance to child and adolescent victims of sexual violence (23 reported cases daily); design of a new model &quot;Family-based Education&quot; currently used by organizations working with parents; seven (7) different instruments and tools to enhance staff technical capacities were developed and delivered to the Office of the Attorney General; development of institutional pathway at National Adoption Council to ensure follow-up and accompaniment of children and adolescents given in adoption; proposal for &quot;Standards for providing care to girls, boys and adolescents at temporary residential foster care&quot;; and the development of a manual at the Office of the Human Rights Ombudsman&apos;s (PDH) Office for the Defense of the Child and Adolescent for monitoring of state institutions comprising the protection system, and a proposal for a protocol for management of complaints of violations against children at PDH.&#xA0;
4. Specialized Justice Services
The Supreme Court, supported by UNICEF and its local partner IEPADES, endorsed a Judicial Policy for the Special Protection of Children and Adolescents, including a diagnostic of the child and adolescent courts, revealing serious weaknesses. As a results, job description manuals for posts at the Courts and a new regulation for case management were developed, which ultimately lead to Resolution 74-2017 &quot;Regulation on the Management of Courts and Court Divisions with Competence in Matters regarding Children and Adolescents, and Adolescents in Conflict with the Criminal Law&quot;, approved by the Supreme Court. 29 Courts currently apply the Resolution, benefiting annually nearly 23,000 cases of child victims of crime. Technical support was provided to the Civil Chamber of the Supreme Court which lead to Resolution 53 and 54-2018 establishing a new model of intervention and Pluripersonal Family Courts regarding alimony and voluntary divorce, benefiting 15,000 annual cases. Diagnostics were undertaken in the Attorney Generals Office resulting in Congressional approval of creation of the Prosecutor&apos;s Office Section for Children and Adolescents to investigate crimes against children, which directly benefited 3,134 cases of child victims in 2018. UNICEF provided technical assistance to develop the regulations for the new office and in staff training. Assistance was provided for the preparation of the new Model for Assistance and Criminal Prosecution Specialized in Adolescents in Conflict with the Criminal Law. As for the National Civilian Police (PNC), technical assistance was provided to enhance the technical capacities of the Office Specialized in Children and Adolescents by developing a training process on human rights of children for the commissaries throughout the country. Regarding criminal investigation, support was provided for the institutionalization of the Department for Sexual Crimes and the Department of Crimes against Children, including a specific unit for missing children, within the PNC Department Specialized in Criminal Investigation. Curriculum was developed for the National Police Academy to ensure specialization of investigators of cases of children and adolescents victims of sexual violence. Lastly, technical assistance was provided to the Vice-Ministry of Prevention of Violence and Crime of the Interior Ministry for the development of a Public Policy for the Prevention of Violence and Crime 2014-2023, and for the National Crime Prevention Strategy 2017-2027.</narrative>
