    <narrative xml:lang="EN">The evaluation conducted during 2020 states that &quot;The impact of OHCHR in the three countries needs to be understood in the context of the socio-political situation in the region. Central America is marked by a profound social and political crisis driven by high levels of poverty, violence and insecurity. The escalation of authoritarianism and the weakening of State institutions combined with high levels of impunity and corruption have severely impacted the protection of human rights in Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras.&quot;
Guatemala
The support to OHCHR Guatemala enabled observation and reporting on the human rights situation and contributed to strengthening state capacity to comply with international human rights conventions. The support enabled educational initiatives with 12 government institutions and contributed to the formulation of public policies and protocols to promote compliance with human rights. Special emphasis was placed on the situation of human rights defenders and in 2020 the office strengthened the networks for journalists and human rights&#xA0;defenders through technical support and accompaniment.OHCHR also worked to counteract discrimination against LGBTQI people, indigenous peoples, women and people with functional variations, including technical support for inclusion in decision making and to improve legislation.
Honduras
The OHCHR Honduras played an important role in the protection of Human Rights in a volatile social and political context aggravated by the consequences of the Pandemic Covid 19. In response to the pandemic the office put in place a COVID-19 Response Strategy mapping to identify relevant actions in each area of work.&#xA0;&#xA0;
OHCHR gathered and provided realiable&#xA0; information on human rights situation, and&#xA0; &#xA0;made important advances in the dialogue with state institutions, including the Ministry of Human Rights and the Honduran Public Prosecutor&apos;s Office.
The work bynOHCHR is key for the protection of human rights defenders, indigenous peoples, and their vindication of their economic, social and cultural rights and their right to access to justice, especially on regard of the defense of the lands and natural resources.&#xA0;
El Salvador
The OHCHR team acting as a special adviser on Human Rights for the UN Country Coordinator, proved a strategic asset for the defense of Human Rights in El Salvador.&#xA0;
The team, supervised by the Regional Office in Panam&#xE1;, continued to play an important role in coordinating efforts with Salvadoran civil society&#xA0; and the justice sector in the cases of women arrested and sentenced in abortion and miscarriages cases.
The team is also implementing a strategy for the protection of human rights defenders&#x2019; cases, paying special attention to the situation of journalists, and independent media. The team continued to support efforts to advance transitional justice and to strenghten the capacity of the justice sector to address human rights violations comiited during the internal armed conflict.
OHCHR also played an important role in monitoring the governments response to the pandemic.</narrative>
