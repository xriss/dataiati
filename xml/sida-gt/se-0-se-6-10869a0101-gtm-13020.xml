Progress results during 2021

1. Despite of the pandemic, the progress of results turned out according to the work plan.  As a result of the Covid-19 pandemic and the constant risk of infection from in person meetings, the organizations established new strategies and approaches to reach their target audiences, adapting their methodologies and techniques. These changes included procuring the necessary licenses and training facilitators to use technology solutions and lead virtual and remote meetings.  A strategy was developed with the facilitators to identify participants that could be reached by the information technology tools to serve the target population for the program.  In-person strategies were maintained for groups that faced a greater technology gap and had limited internet access.
2. In the area of training processes: (i) 549 women were involved in the training processes, allowing the participants to improve their knowledge of their bodies and sexual and reproductive rights. These trainings also supported participants decision-making on birth control methods, access to sexual and reproductive health services, and engagement with community groups.  (ii) The awareness -raising process reached 17, 270 women, who learned about sexual and reproductive rights, prevention of sexual violence, and Covid prevention. This process was conducted through in-person formats and repeated with persons and social media or the radio system. (iii) 500 midwives were strengthened in their work, they received bio-security and personal protection equipment for their work on the front lines to serve women in times of Covid-19.  This area of work had an important effect on pregnant women who were able to access maternal and infant health check-ups in their communities during the pandemic.
3. As part of the outcome social actors, community stakeholders and youth have transformed their social norms to be free from violence, sexism, and discrimination, the contribution reflects progress as follows: (i) 6,700 youth, teachers and community leaders have been strengthened and have gained awareness of the power relations that causes violence against women and girls and have questioned traditional forms of masculinity that normalize violence. Due to the pandemic, these actions have included social media outreach, radio broadcasts, streets festivals and online and community activities to change the mindset and social norms around sexual violence.  (ii)  Two communication campaigns were implemented in six Mayan language and in Spanish in the program intervention area, on issues of sexual and reproductive rights and reporting sexual violence.  These campaigns were spread over the radio, social media and printed materials reaching over 235, 200 people.  The campaign on reporting sexual violence was coordinated with the Secretariat Against Violence, Exploitation and Trafficking in persons, SVET, which is the advisory body for the State of Guatemala on matters of sexual violence, trafficking, and exploitation, to support the enforcement of the awareness-raising sections of Policy against Violence, Exploitation and Trafficking in persons.</narrative>
