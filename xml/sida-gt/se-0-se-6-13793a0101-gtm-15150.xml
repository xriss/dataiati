&quot;Institutions, communities, families and individuals are more resilient, and better prepared to respond, to disasters and emergencies. The intervention has facilitated information from the community to be shared and inform the Disaster Risk Reduction plans. According to the final KAP 85% of the targeted members of local and municipal organizations were familiar with the transmission of alerts and evacuation protocols. 79% of participants at the CERED, COLRED and institutional level in the targeted communities now know and apply protection mechanisms for women and children, response plans and evacuation plans.&quot;

&quot;Implementation of an awareness and information campaign: reaching 1
million people. A radio campaign was launched, with an anticipated effective
reach of 70% (700,000 people). It was complemented by an information
campaign on social networks, the delivery of printed information and messages sent to mobile phones.&quot;

&quot;During the impact of storms Amanda and Cristobal, 27 COLREDs were
activated to monitor and warn the population; 12 communities evacuated
families in line with maps and response plans identifying the houses most at risk; and shelters were also set up at the local and municipal levels using the
response plans and in coordination with COMREDs.&quot;

&quot;In spite of the restrictions due to the impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic, the implementing teams worked hard to find alternative approaches to support the different targeted groups, working remotely and promoting digital platforms to undertake trainings. A consistent support to the target population on the use of digital platforms allowed for a successful implementation.&quot;

&quot;Women and girls have been in majority within the local and municipal groups organised and participated on an equal footing with men ensuring that their perspective is included in the response plans.&quot;

&quot;By the end of the project, 85% of the members of COLRED, COMRED and the
Referral Networks were aware of mechanisms for the protection of women and
girls during an emergency.&quot;

Link to strategy goal 1. Strengthened capacity within civil society in
developing countries to contribute to poverty reduction in developing
countries:

&quot;By the end of the project, 90% of the trained COLREDs and COMREDs
demonstrate that they have developed their capacities to respond to an
emergency or disaster, thus reducing the impact and damage that the
community may face.&quot;

&quot;As part of the action 27 DRR School Committees (CEREDs), 10 COLREDs,
2 COMREDs and 10 Community Protection Networks were organised and
received training. At the end of the project the evaluation showed that 79% of
participants at the CERED, COLRED and institutional level in the targeted
communities (compared to an average of 34.8% at baseline) know and apply
response plans, evacuation plans and protection mechanisms for women and
children&quot;

&quot;Training processes for women leaders and technical staff who make up the
referral networks: 60 women leaders, who recognise the different manifestations and forms of violence that exist, and can recognise and refer
cases of violence against women and children. These women were given advice and, where necessary, supported in the initial phase of their complaint. In the referral networks 306 people took part in capacity building processes (238 women and 38 men). 100% of the COLREDs and COMREDs integrate protection actions into their response plans and evacuation protocols. The risk maps identify vulnerable populations.&quot;

&quot;The project included several aspects of learning and capacity building to create awareness, engagement and capacity among community members - including vulnerable groups of the population such as infants and young children, elderly, disabled  to have knowledge about and claim their rights to protection against violence and right to live in a safe and secure environment. By linking these community members to both formal and informal civil society actors also contributed to a stronger and more legitimate civil society that represented the people they work for, and supported the same community members to organise and claim their rights.&quot;

&quot;The participating 265 teachers developed school response plans which were
validated through simulation exercises. The school response plans covered
6,467 students. Furthermore, 105 members participating in the 10 COLREDs
undertook a hazard, vulnerability and capacities analysis highlighting
vulnerabilities and hazards in their communities.&quot; 

Link to strategy goal 2. Promoting an enabling environment for civil
society organisations in developing countries:

&quot;The project&apos;s main contribution to the CSO strategy goal number 2 was the
creation of spaces for collaboration and dialogue between civil society actors
and other development actors within the field of DRR as well as with the
vulnerable populations whom they represent. To strengthen the mechanisms
for interaction and collaboration by ensuring that they function effectively and
that the actors involved have the necessary technical capacity and skills,
therefore directly contributes to a more enabling environment for them to
operate.&quot;

&quot;The COMRED of Escuintla and San Juan Alotenango was reorganized and
trained including integrating 57 institutional representatives. The COMREDs
have in a coordinated manner developed the Municipal Response Plan. The
simulation exercise with the COMRED was unfortunately not possible due to
the COVID-19 pandemic. The project technical team exhausted the options to
finalize this process, but it was not possible&quot;</narrative>
