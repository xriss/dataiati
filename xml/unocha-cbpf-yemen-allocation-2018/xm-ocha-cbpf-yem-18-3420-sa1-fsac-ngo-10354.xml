   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Emergency Livelihoods assistance to Affected Communities in Khabb wa ash Sha&apos;af	and Rajuzah districts in Al Jawf Gov.</narrative>

  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The conflict in Yemen has led to an alarming deterioration in the food security and nutrition situation leaving sixty percent of the population in food crisis or emergency.
BFD intends to invest in agricultural livelihood interventions to help food insecure vulnerable 1310 households (9170 beneficiaries) with access to productive assets to produce and generate much-needed and life-saving food and income and reduce their dependency on food assistance and food imports while improving the community coping mechanism. Renewed conflict in the eastern line of Al Jawf governorate especially Khab wa sh Sha&#x2019;af district resulted in further displacement and the destruction of homes and livelihoods already affected by crisis even before the recent escalation of situation.
The situation of the current location hosting displaced population is so precarious as they lack access to vegetable seeds and necessary tools because of greatly reduced purchasing power and the disruption of markets in many areas. As those conflict-affected families can produce nutritious food close to their homes and earn much-needed income with the surplus they have missed the cropping season and very little window of opportunity is still available for livelihoods intervention.

This Emergency Response Program for 2018 is in line with Food Security strategy for the first standard allocation of 2018 to targets vulnerable households with access to productive assets with emergency livelihoods kits who are in IPC Phase three and four in greater risk of starvation and in very critical Food insecurity situation. The principal beneficiaries of the project are household hosting IDPs, returnee HH and affected vulnerable host communities in conflict affected areas in Khab wa sh Sha&#x2019;af and Rajuzah districts of Al Jawf governorate. 
BFD has been working in Al Jawf since 2016 and its existence has always been vital, essential and strong, originating from the status of Al-Jawf as a damaged and afflicted governorate, suffering from the scourge of war in addition to poverty, scarcity and the prevalence of epidemics and diseases, which all led to the need of establishing an office in the field to respond actively and monitor closely.

The Key activity to be supported will be provision of emergency vegetable (1,310 kits) while scaling up agricultural farmers in both targeted districts will be supported and continue to depend on prolonged scaling up agricultural livelihood support otherwise, reduce their dependency on food assistance and food imports while improving the community coping mechanism.

Beneficiary targeting will involve a participatory process through consultative stakeholder meetings (mobilization) and established 56 Community Committees (CCs), which build on BFD&#x2019;s current approach where communities are involved in beneficiary selection, HH registration and beneficiary list verification exercises. The selection criteria are: returnee households, households hosting IDPs, and vulnerable host communities with able bodied members, access to land, and access to productive assets to severely food insecure rural households in IPC phase four and phase three areas as the case in the targeted districts of Khab wa sh Sha&#x2019;af and Rajuzah . So, BFD will work to identify and support the most vulnerable families and individuals within these targeted communities in Khab wa Sha&#x2019;af and Rajozah districts and the Selection process for the distribution will be based on the information gathered from household surveys and community discussions. Targeting criteria include household (HH) vulnerability criteria, such as: Single parent Elderly Disabled chronically ill Female-headed. But only if they have able bodied members, access to land, and access to productive assets as well as having the desire and ability to take advantage of such intervention.</narrative>
