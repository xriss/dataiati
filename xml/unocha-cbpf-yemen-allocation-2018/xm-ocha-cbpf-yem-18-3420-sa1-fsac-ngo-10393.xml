   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Food Security support project in Tur AlBaha district -  Lahj Governorate</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project main objective is to help preventing famine in one of the in risk of famine districts of Lahj governorate by increasing access to food for highly vulnerable families, where the intervention will address first line priorities of Food Security sector, which also covers an important sector of the Integrated Famine Risk Reduction (IFRR) that could help preventing famine.
The project aims to provide FSL support to most vulnerable families (including IDPs) in 6 sub-districts (Al-Gharqah, Al-Shabah, and Habeel Al-Sabt, Al-Farshah, Al-Ghareeq, Sha&apos;ab Al-Asfal,) of Tur AlBaha district &#x2013; Lahj Governorate.
Men, women, boys, and girls are in risk of famine and malnutrition, the project will address the food needs of those food insecure people who are in risk of famine for 6 consequences months, in order to help them securing their food needs and preventing from using negative coping strategies that may harm their diet and livelihood, hence it is important to support those families to overcome their food insecurity and their financial difficulties.
By securing food needs, the targeted HHs could save the money they use on food be invest in small income generating activities, or they could use it to expand their current source of income example: expanding their herd of livestock, expanding their farming activities, etc&#x2026;
NMO will provide food assistance through food vouchers to the most vulnerable groups in all the targeted sub-districts of Tur AlBaha, the food assistance will target 1300 HHs, where each household should receive 6 rounds of food assistance during the project implementation. 
As a first step of implementation, NMO will conduct a market assessment to decide whether to go vouchers modality or change to cash modality in coordination with FSAC and OCHA.  
For effective and efficient implementation of the project the community involvement/participation will be at all stages of the project, where NMO will establish food community committee in order to involve the local community in the project implementation, 
The project will implement with good coordination with the NGOs which are also implementing projects in Tur AlBaha. The MampE team of NMO will conduct Base line, Midline, and End line evaluation, in order to keep track on the project performance and follow the project indicators to meet its targets.
Moreover, the MampE team will conduct several PDMs as required after each month of each distribution, in order to insure safe delivery of items to the beneficiaries, alongside with monitoring field visits and feedback mechanism that will achieve accountability to affected population. 
NMO will adhere to FSAC Household vulnerability and targeting criteria in beneficiaries selection  as follows: 
- Severely food insecure HHs (based on evidence e.g. FCS, CSI, Livelihood change, HHS, HDDS etc.)
- Vulnerable IDP households (presently IDPs have some of the worst food security indicators in the country)
- Vulnerable Host households hosting IDPs
- HHs with children under 5 with Severe Acute Malnutrition (SAM) or Moderate Acute Malnutrition (MAM)
- Vulnerable HHs with children under five years old and/or pregnant women and/or lactating women
- Vulnerable Female headed households
- Child headed households
- Vulnerable HHs with no productive assets, or functional means of income/ reliable source of income
- Vulnerable Elderly headed households
- Vulnerable HHs headed by chronically ill members
- Vulnerable HHs headed by physically challenged heads
- Vulnerable marginalized communities e.g. Muhamasheen
- Vulnerable HHs not receiving adequate assistance from other sources
- HHs meeting other vulnerability criteria as identified by the communities.
The vulnerability criteria includes different groups of people such as marginalized communities, IDPs, and host community, where all the activities could include them depending on their vulnerability.</narrative>
