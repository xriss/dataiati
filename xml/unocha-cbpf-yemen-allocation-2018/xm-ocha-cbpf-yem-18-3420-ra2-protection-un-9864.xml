   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Cash assistance for safe relocation of households affected by the conflict in Hodeida</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The objective of this intervention is to support up to 63,281 households from frontline villages (identified as the most affected ones by the government) with one-time cash assistance amount of YER 10,000 per household, to enable the safe relocation of the families. The semi &#x201C;unconditional&#x201D; cash assistance is to prevent mass casualties essential in saving the lives of populations in frontline areas. The cash grant will be provided to affected communities to make their choice to move on voluntarily basis to safer location. The cash assistance will be provided to the beneficiaries who are in those districts where the fights between KSA coalition and Al Houtis have erupted in Hodeidah (source: UNOCHA 4th July Hoidedah update and displacement map). The potential risk that lies with the affected people in those districts where the fights are continuing, there is high possibility that, the population might get trapped or can become human-shied. The proposed provision of cash for transportation is a choice to targeted beneficiaries to move to safer location. In this proposed intervention, NAMCHA as government partner will be responsible to provide access to the affected districts in coordination with the local level formal and informal security arrangements such as check points and security operation centers. UNDP, NAMCHA and financial institution will move to the affected locations once the security clearances and approval is granted by security institutions. NAMCHA along with the community functionaries (Sheikh, Akal and tribal leaders) from the affected districts will be responsible for the identification of the list which further will be presented to UNDP and UNDP will apply verification process before the transfer of the cash.  Please refere to Annex 1 and 2 for more information. Furthermore, the list of supported households with the cash will be submitted to IOM to keep track of movements the supported households in Hodeidah. To make sure that sustainability in the place, the beneficiaries who moved to safe locations will be further engaged into the durable-solution activities carried out by UNDP. 

In terms of modality of cash transfer, following are the key to the transfer to the affected beneficiaries: 
- Distribution of cash assistance to households after fulfilling in the pre-agreed payment procedures stated in Work Mechanism and verification by UNDP staff 
- Formation of required distribution teams (UNDP, NAMCHA and financial institution representatives) as per plan to be developed mutually with related parties.
- Secure of required liquidity in agreed distribution sites.
- Distribution in sites agreed by UNDP and deconflicted by government.
- Hand to hand Payment to beneficiaries against supporting documents required by UNDP (Authorization form) at the pre identified payment sites.
- Payment to beneficiaries after taking all supporting documents (beneficiary photo and copy of approved documents) or written exceptions from UNDP verification team.
- Payment to all targeted groups in all areas governed by conflict parties. 

The above proposed intervention is in line with humanitarian response to protect and provide an opportunity for the right to safely relocate. The upsurge of conflict in Hodiedah has pressured the affected communities who are already facing the heat of the humanitarian crisis such as risk of famine, lack of critical facilities and economic crisis, given that Hodeidah continues to one of the most affected governorate (IPC 4 classification), if the population in the affected districts continue to stay without any support to move or relocate to safer place, the consequences would be disastrous..
