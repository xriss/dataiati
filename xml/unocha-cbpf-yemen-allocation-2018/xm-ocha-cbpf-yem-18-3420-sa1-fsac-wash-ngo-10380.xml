  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Mayar Foundation for Development (MFD), through this action, aims to address the needs of the most underserved and poverty striken population in Mudiya district, Abyan governorate. The project will provide lifesaving interventions in the sectors of food security and WASH for a period of 10 months. 10,500 individuals (1500HHs) will be targeted..  MFD aims to focus on Mudiya district in particular because it is a priority and the because the seven selected locatiosn are the most underserved by the humanitarian community and are hard to reach areas (IFRR). In addition, there is a technical and geographical gap in response of life saving WASH and food security interventions as there is a limited number of NGOs providing assistance to this population and serving their dire needs.  The project would seek to meet the two strategic objectives: provide life-saving assistance to the most vulnerable people in Yemen through an effective, targeted response and ensure that all assistance promotes the protection, safety and dignity of affected people, and is provided equitably to men, women, boys and girls.

Food Security  
In line with the guidance tools and priorities of the FSAC cluster and the findings from the needs assessment that was recently conducted by MFD, the project aims to unconditional food assistance with an amount of $65 to 1,500HHs (10,500 individuals) in 7 locations in Mudiya district. The distribution will take place over a duration of six consecutive rounds in order to have a meaningful impact on improving household&#x2019;s food security situation.  

WASH 
MFD will also respond to the basic WASH needs of crisis affected people, so that the population has access to safe drinking water to reduce excess morbidity and mortality related to water borne diseases. WASH was reported to be the second highest need within the district, as per the categorization of the community members in the assessment. The key activities in this response will include distribution of ceramic filters and hygiene kits 1500HHs (10500 individuals) and hygiene promotion activities and messages to the community at large. 

Integrated response: MFD is proposing an integrated response of WASH and food security because the outcome of insufficient food intake and repeated infectious diseases is undernutrition, which is one of the world&#x2019;s most serious problems, with long-lasting harmful impacts on health and devastating consequences for social and economic development. The three main underlying causes of undernutrition, namely unsuitable or insufficient food intake, poor care practices, and infectious diseases, are directly or indirectly related to inadequate access to water, sanitation facilities, and hygiene practices (WASH). Achieving a long-term, sustainable, and at-scale impact on undernutrition requires a multi-sectoral approach and addressing both direct and indirect causes of poor nutritional status.                                 

Implementation of this project will be in close coordination with all relevant stakeholders at national, governorate and district levels. MFD will also ensure full coordination with both clusters and with other humanitarian partners.MFD has put in place a strong monitoring and evaluation plan to ensure the effectiveness of the action and to ensure that all set targets are met. In addition, the needs of all the population will be taken into consideration, with a special focus on the needs of women and girls.</narrative>
