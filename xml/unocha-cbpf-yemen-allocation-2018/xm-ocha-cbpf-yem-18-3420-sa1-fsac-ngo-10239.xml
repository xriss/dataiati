  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The objective of the emergency food assistance for the most vulnerable households is to increase access to food for highly vulnerable families in Ash Shamayatayn district of Taiz Governorate which has been identified as a priority district for FSAC first line response gaps. Approximately 2,800 Households (19,600 individual dis-aggregated 3,842 Men,3,998 Women,5,762 Boys, 5,998 Girls) / will benefit from unconditional voucher/cash transfer modality  to the same household consecutively for a minimum of six rounds.

The proposed intervention will contribute to FSAC objective of increasing the access to food for highly vulnerable families across the country, the proposed intervention will be implemented for a period of 10 months. BCFHD will select beneficiaries based on FSAC vulnerability and targeting criteria, food basket composition, quantity of commodities, and amount of cash per household per month.

The targeted beneficiaries are composed  of Severely food insecure households, Vulnerable IDP households (presently IDPs have some of the worst food security indicators, Vulnerable Host households hosting IDPs, households with children under 5 with SAM or MAM, Vulnerable Households with children under five years old and/or PLW, Vulnerable Female headed households, Child headed households, Vulnerable Households with no productive assets, or functional means of income/ reliable source of income, Vulnerable Elderly headed households, Vulnerable Households headed by chronically ill members, Vulnerable Households headed by physically challenged heads, Vulnerable marginalized communities e.g. Muhamasheen, Vulnerable Households not receiving adequate assistance from other sources, households meeting other vulnerability criteria as identified by the communities.

The project has been designed based on the rapid needs assessments conducted in Ash Shamayatayn district by BCFHD in mid August 2018. This needs assessment assisted BCFHD to identify the needs of the targeted beneficiaries as well as the level of food insecurity the vulnerable HHs reached (Poor and Borderline Food Consumption Scores).

The following main activities will be undertaken and more details are illustrated in the logical framework:
- Conduct Market Needs Assessment is to ensure the most appropriate modality to be used for providing the food assistance.
- Selection of Community Food Management Committee with representation of at least 50% of women and ensure women in leadership position in the committees.
- Conduct training on FSAC vulnerability criteria, beneficiaries registration and verification process and introduce protection aspects and code of conducts for the registration and verification team.
- Conduct training on the distribution process.
- Registration and Verification of beneficiaries adhering to FSAC vulnerability and targeting criteria.
- Provision of unconditional voucher/ cash transfers assistance to most vulnerable households targeting 2,800 HHS in Ash Shamayatayn district of Taiz Governorate for 6 rounds conforming to FSAC standards.
- Conduct Post Distribution Monitoring (PDM).

BCFHD has the capacity and access to implement this project as BCFHD has just completed the implementation of an emergency food security project in the same district (project was ended in August 2018) under 2nd Standard Allocation 2017 and this project had been implemented successfully. Also the Third Party Monitoring (TPM) has conducted several field visits to monitor the implementation of the project activities and the results of TPM field visit was &quot;good performance&quot;. In addition, the local council and affected community were satisfied with the performance of BCFHD amp the sub implementing partner (RDP) due to considering the humanitarian principles during the implementation of the project and received appreciation letters from the community as well as they have requested to keep working with the same sub implementing partner (RDP) for future.</narrative>
