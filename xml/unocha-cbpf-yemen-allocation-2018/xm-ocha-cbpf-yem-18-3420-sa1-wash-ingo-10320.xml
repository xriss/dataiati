   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Emergency IDP and Cholera WASH intervention in Abs district in Hajja and Az Zaidyah district of Al- Hudaydah Governorate</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project will provide lifesaving WASH assistance to the most vulnerable IDPs and acutely affected host communities, including populations affected by and exposed to cholera/AWD, reinforced with resilience and preventive nature of WASH support.    

The intervention approach will be adapted to the security and access-related constraints and will include the following components for all identified districts, reaching both IDP and host communities: 
Water supply- Lifesaving water supply through trucking with 60 water points for targeted population without water in new IDP sites and cholera hotspot for up to 60 days, starting with direct trucking then switching to CASH for water or voucher where applicable. Water attendants will be deployed to monitor each tanker to ensure quality, quantity and performance. Emergency water supply will be combined with quick repair, rehabilitation, augmentation and operational support to existing dysfunctional or low performing water supply systems in cholera prone communities and IDP areas. Oxfam will work in integration with local water corporation authorities to address priority needs in chlorinated water access supported by water quality surveillance and capacity building of water management committees.Sanitation: Oxfam will provide emergency household latrines for new IDPs in Abs in Hajjah and Az Zaidyah in Al-Hodeida. Sanitation activities are designed in consideration of technical and cultural context and special needs of women (including pregnant women) and differently abled people. Solid waste management activities (garbage collection and safe disposal) will be conducted through the implementation of community-led mass environmental cleaning campaigns to ensure vector control and prevent the spread of diseases. Hygiene promotion: The precarious conditions of living in IDP sites, as well as the fact that the areas are cholera-prone, means that the use of appropriate hygiene practices is essential for both the IDPS and host communities. Apart from the targeted Hygiene consumable kits distribution- training orientation and deployment of up to 132 Community health volunteers to work with community in essential hygiene and best use of WASH assistance provided.  Oxfam will support hygiene promotion sessions adapted to the IDP environment of the IDP&#x2019;s to reduce risks of water-borne and water-related diseases and prevent AWD/Cholera. Community engagement with orientation of up to 210 community representatives from targeted villages, event based mass hygiene campaigns global handwashing day, world toilet day and world water day through mass community mobilisation. Oxfam will form up to 20 School hygiene clubs--oriented and equipped to practice and raise awareness and to participate in mass campaign. Oxfam will develop the project through a participatory approach to strengthen community capacity and resilience to future Cholera outbreaks. For MEAL- Baseline/end line survey, PDMs, structured monitoring visit and reporting. Gender and protection integrated through training and orientation of up to 270 persons relevant to this project (CHVs, water management committees, water quality monitors, tanker attendants, and Oxfam field staff. 
There are ongoing conflict and security incidents in Hudeida and northern Hajja (Midi, Harad, Hyran) and only northern corridor is open for Al Hudeida. In Abs, there has been an increased flow of IDPs from north while Az Zaydiah has seen population movement either escaping conflict and or returning to City. There are active cholera cases in both targeted district as essential services such as water supply already overstretched and limited as a result exposing vulnerable population to larger disease outbreak and suffering. Oxfam seeks to ensure the ongoing sustainability of the project, where practicable, through focusing on behavioral change of beneficiaries, and seeking follow-up funding from donors who provide support for sustainable water rehabilitation.</narrative>
