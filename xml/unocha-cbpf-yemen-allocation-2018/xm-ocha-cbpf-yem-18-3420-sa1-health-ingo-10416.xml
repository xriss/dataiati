   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Emergency Health Response to Conflict Affected People in Taiz Governorate: A First-Line Assistance Project</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">International Medical Corps UK (IMC)* requests support from the Yemen Humanitarian Pooled Fund (YHPF) to scale up the provision of lifesaving health services to conflict-affected people in Taiz. The proposed intervention will improve access to child health and maternal health services among the most vulnerable IDPs &#x2013; primarily women and children-- affected by the conflict in Mawiah district, in line with the strategic priorities of the revised 2018 HRP to provide lifesaving assistance. 
Activities are designed to increase access to emergency primary and secondary health care services to treat common communicable and non-communicable diseases, common causes of mortality among children and women through three priority health facilities based on IFRR priority districts, where IMC is already active. The targeted primary health care facilities include Hanakah, Al Sabeel Asrar, and Mawiah District Hospital . As part of efforts to shore up the capacity of a debilitated health system, IMC will support diagnostic and case management services for common communicable and non-communicable diseases among children and PLW in Taiz, and improve maternal and perinatal health by providing quality lifesaving reproductive health services. This will be achieved through providing trainings 20 health workers, and incentives to 42 HF staff, and also providing medicines, supplies and equipment. 
IMC will also address WASH needs at each health facility through water trucking and maintenance/repair of three water systems (one at each health facility), repair and maintenance of small community waster systems and extension of distribution network to health facilities, provision of solid waste management facilities (including installation of three incinerators), as well as supply of tools and consumables for medical waste management and infection prevention and control. Sanitation needs in the three health facilities will be improved to acceptable standards by repair and maintenance of seven latrines and 13 handwashing stations and installations to ensure easy access to women, elderly people and people with disabilities. Training for management of common causes of morbidity and mortality through IMCI, CMR, BEmONC training and incentives for health facility staff will be delivered as part of efforts to enhance quality services, as well as medical supplies and equipment, and minor rehabilitation to make sure facilities are accessible to older persons and persons with disabilities. 
Aside from the immediate objective to save lives, the intervention is designed to strengthen local health system capacity to provide emergency health services, improve emergency preparedness and coordination of the response. All three supported health facilities will cover and overall population of 42,500. Supported health facilities will also conduct surveillance and monitoring for epidemic-prone diseases, including cholera, measles, and diphtheria in the area, in addition to providing quality lifesaving emergency health services.
