  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">An estimated 16 million Yemenis need humanitarian assistance to establish or maintain access to safe water, basic sanitation and hygiene facilities, out of which 51% are children (8.2 million). Furthermore, 11.6 million of the total number are in acute need and will require immediate WASH services as per the findings of the Yemen HNO 2018 and other cluster assessments (August/September 2017). The public water and sanitation systems are barely functional, water infrastructure is often damaged by belligerent parties. Thus, communities - particularly internally displaced people (IDPs) - are suffering from a chronic lack of safe drinking water, sanitation and hygiene services. The crisis has caused access to improved water sources to drop significantly in 11 out of 20 governorates.
 As part of its 2018 preparedness efforts, the Yemen WASH Cluster developed a comprehensive preparedness plan based on a worst scenario defined by the Humanitarian Country Team (HCT). The worst-case scenario for Yemen is defined as a situation where efforts to advance political dialogue are unsuccessful. Armed conflict intensifies rapidly along major front-lines. Tribal divisions lead to increased violence and uncertainty, as alliances, particularly in the south and central areas, fragment. The influence of terrorist organizations spreads. Supply routes and strategic locations are cutoff, and telecommunications systems are disrupted. No-go areas expand in districts where alliances are shifting. Violations of international humanitarian law increase putting civilians at grave risk, particularly in combat areas, where local forces use people as &#x201C;human shields&#x201D;. Ports and entry routes into the country, including Hudaydah and Aden, are closed. The currency collapses leading to rampant inflation and a severe liquidity crisis. Imports contract and local markets, particularly for basic commodities, start collapsing. Millions of families are displaced along front-lines and from urban centers. 

This project was developed based on the 2018 WASH cluster preparedness plan and aims to pre-position and provide essential WASH supplies to partners upon request to facilitate emergency response in Yemen. The supplies will be used to respond to the needs of affected people based on the preparedness plan developed by the WASH cluster (see attached) to respond to a worst-case humanitarian scenario in Yemen. The WASH supplies will be used in the eventuality of intensified conflict, famine, and failure of government institutions to operate efficiently due to a complex economic and security environment in Yemen. The Humanitarian situation in country is currently leaning towards the predicted worst case scenario. The current security situation in Hodeidah with the planned Saudi Led Coalition (SLC) takeover of the city is alarming and could lead to widespread displacement in Hodeidah Governorate and neighboring areas. . Moreover, conflict has intensified in the northern governorates of Saada, Sana&#x2019;a, Hajjah and Taiz where more displacements are expected over the coming months. The WASH supplies will allow UNICEF to support all cluster partners in their efforts to address the needs of affected people in a timely and effective manner. 

The Contingency Plan for IDPs and cholera response will be used for the procurement and post monitoring of distributed supply items. Specifically, procurement of basic hygiene kits and consumable kits that will be distributed by WASH Cluster partners in affected areas. The priorities of distribution will be for the areas where IDPs moved and high risk of cholera affected people. 
The project will target a total of 1,064,962 people including 789,540 people affected by famine and 275,421 people displaced by conflict and host communities.</narrative>
