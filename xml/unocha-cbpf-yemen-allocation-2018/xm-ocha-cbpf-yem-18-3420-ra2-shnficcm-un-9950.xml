   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Supporting the establishment of Emergency Transit Sites and IDP Hosting Sites for newly arrived IDPs affected by the conflict in Al Hudaydah</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The aim of this project is to provide a standardized coordination mechanism at IDP transit and hosting sites in Al Hudaydah and support the authorities/representatives on site, engage with the IDP community and ensure that assistance gaps, if any, are eliminated. 

This project will support the establishment of five emergency transit sites and twenty IDP hosting sites for the new IDPs affected by the ongoing conflict in Al Hudaydah. Site preparations will include minor rehabilitation works of the school buildings, WASH infrastructure including latrines, waste collection and water trucking, installation of solar lightning, erection of tents, and establishing a health referral mechanism. 

These transit sites will provide temporary space for IDPs displaced by the conflict. In collaboration with NAMCHA, IOM will provide registration, verification, health referrals, IRR amp NFI support, complaint mechanism, and transportation to hosting sites to newly arrived IDPs. 

Prior to this, IOM will ensure that all basic facilities and access to basic services at the transit sites are provided. IOM will work in collaboration with UNHCR, ADRA, and other humanitarian partners experienced in implementing similar initiatives in Yemen.

IOM will support IDPs in the transit sites through the following activities:

-	Support the establishment of transit and hosting sites in four districts of Al Hudaydah governorate: Zabid, Bait Al Faqih, Al Duraihimi, and Al Masouria. These sites, mainly existing schools, will be identified by the authorities in Al Hudaydah. 

-	Provide daily incentives to NAMCHA staff working at the transit sites and also to sub-contracted staff at the transit sites to do registration of IDPs upon their arrival verification of IDPs distribution of IRR kits provided by UNFPA, UNICEF, and WFP transportation of IDPs from transit to hosting sites and operating complaint desks.

-	Although the distribution of IRR kits is an activity of this project, the kits themselves are actually provided by UNFPA, UNICEF, and WFP. Both NAMCHA and IOM sub-contracted staff will be responsible for their distributions only.

-	Serve 35,000 IDPs displaced by the current conflict in Al Hudaydah.

-	Inform cluster partners of assistance gaps identified in the IDP hosting sites through roving site management teams. The role of the roving teams will be:

o	Management and coordination supervisor: responsible for engaging with the IDP community at the hosting sites and mobilize them to make their own decisions regarding their living conditions
o	IM Focal point: responsible for data collection and timely sharing of accurate information on IDP needs to IOM and relevant clusters
o	Referral Focal point: responsible for raising awareness on GBV issues at IDP hosting sites

Risks include expansion of the conflict to areas nearby IDP hosting and transit sites, affecting site management activities. As a mitigation measure, IOM will work with the authorities to identify safest locations for the transit and hosting sites to the extent possible. To mitigate the risk of airstrikes in and around the sites, IOM will work with humanitarian partners for the necessary deconfliction of sites.
IOM staff have access to all the IDP locations at this stage and it is expected to remain so by maintaining flexible planning and close coordination with local authorities and community representatives who can facilitate access if and when necessary. 


The 35,000 IDPs is the expected number of IDPs fleeing the conflict in Hudaydah within the governorate itself. An estimated 1,000 households (HHs) will be supported in each of the 5 transit sites, for a total of 5,000 HHs (5,000*7=35,000 individuals). 

All project activities will be implemented directly by IOM, with no implementing partner involved.</narrative>
