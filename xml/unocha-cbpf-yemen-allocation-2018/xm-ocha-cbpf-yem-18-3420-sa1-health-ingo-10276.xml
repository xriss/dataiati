   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Provide integrated emergency health services by supporting existing health facilities and a network of Community Health Volunteers (CHVs) for conflict affected communities in Lahj district, Yemen.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project aims at reducing morbidity and mortality of the most vulnerable, conflict-affected populations with focus on children under 5, pregnant and lactating women through the provision of life saving emergency health services in Lahj by running 5 partially functioning health facilities, by establishing a network of Community Health Volunteers (CHVs) that provide community outreach services, in addition to support 1 referral hospital, in addition to BLS ambulance services. The project will be addressing the health needs of people in acute need in districts with high access severity (level 4 and 5) per access severity scale. 
The project will focus on 2 peripheral districts in Lahj (Al-Madaribah wa Al-Arah district and Al-Maqatirah district &#x2013; both level 4) where health facilities have nearly collapsed. The selection of districts and respective 5 health facilities was done in close consultation with the Ministry of Public Health and Population (MoPHP) under supervision from health sub-cluster hub in Aden. 
INTERSOS would support the running of the following 5 health facilities: 2 health centres (HC) in Al-Madariba wa Al-Ara district and 3 health units (HU) in Al-Maqatira district
-	2 HCs in Al-Mudariba wa Al-Ara: Al-Haymah HC  and Al-Faroukhiya HC
-	3 HUs in Al-Maqatara district: Al-Hanishah, Al-Hajaj health center, Al-Maeen Mokabrah health center
Also INTERSOS will support 1 referral hospital (Ibn Khaldoun hospital) located in Al-Houtha (access level 5), which is the only general hospital in Lahj Governorate that works with full capacity, receiving patients referred from all different districts for different specialties like ER, outpatient clinics, inpatient department, maternity and general surgical operations, lab test, X-ray department, nutritional department, vaccination department and ICU department.
Overall, the targeted districts are in severe need of emergency assistance and have been identified as priority with a high catchment population by UN agencies and the MoPHP with a significant concentration of IDPs mainly from Al-Hodeidah and Taiz. 
The project builds on INTERSOS&#x2019; prior and on-going experience in Sana&#x2019;a, Ibb, Taiz, Hadramout and Aden, implementing health and nutrition project, funded by OCHA-YHPF, UNICEF, UK-DEC, DG ECHO and WHO. The proposal follows priorities set by the Health Cluster and MoPHP for emergency health interventions.
Through this project, a total 86,075 people (17% men, 29% women, 27% boys and 27% girls &#x2013; 15% IDPs and 85% HCs) will have gained (improved) access to Primary Health Care (PHC) integrated health services package, following the Health Cluster defined MSP (minimum service package) level of care (incl. GBV medical services) guidelines. The Integrated Health Package includes Reproductive Health/Maternal, Neonatal, Child Health (RH/MNCH), incl. antenatal, deliveries and postnatal care for mothers newborn care, immunization (for both routine and supplementary vaccines), deworming, vitamin A supplementation, health promotion and education, Outpatient Consultation and treatment for common ailments for both adults and children. 
With the ongoing cholera outbreak, each HF will also run an Oral Re-hydration Corner (ORC) and refer severely dehydrated cases to the nearest Diarrhea Treatment Center (DTC). 
Per district 1 BLS ambulance will be foreseen to be activated by CHVs at the community level or by the staff at the HFs. BLS ambulances services will be secured with a doctor and nurse, supervised by health supervisor for dispatch. INTERSOS will strengthen Infection Prevention and Control (IPC) measures at the HFs. The HFs will undergo minor renovation, provided with solar power, clean water, waste disposal and sanitation upgrades.</narrative>
