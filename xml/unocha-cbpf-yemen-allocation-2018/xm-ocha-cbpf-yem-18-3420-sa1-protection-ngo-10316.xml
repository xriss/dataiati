   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Provision of first-line protection responses for the most vulnerable IDPs and host communities through community centers in Marib city in Marib governorate and Al-Hazm district in Al-Jawf governorate</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project aims to provide first-line protection responses and live saving support to the most vulnerable IDPs and host communities by ensuring access to a wide variety of services and programmes that cater to people of different ages, genders and diversity profiles in the capital Marib Gov. Marib city and the capital of Al-Jawf Gov. Al-Hazm districts. Such services will be provided through establishment of two community centers, one in Marib city and the second in Al-Hazm, together with some outreach activities . 
The proposed protection services and programmes that will be provided through communities centers include protection monitoring, psycho-social and legal support, cash assistance, case management for GBV survivors, conflict-affected children and people with special need and referral of critical cases to relevant services providers, livelihood support, establishment of child friendly spaces, develop and support community-based responses in order to prevent, mitigate or address protection needs and risks and distribution of transit kits to families in need with basic respect and dignity targeting approximately a total number of  23026 individuals, 18230 in Marib city and 4795 individuals in Al-Hazm district and neighboring areas from IDPs communities and 20% of them from host communities. 
Moreover, a number of outreach activities will be conducted for community mobilizations and promoting for the community centers services in addition to provide some protection services such as awareness raising and information sharing on protection issues and services and providing psychological support. The total period for implementing these activities will be 10 months. 
CSSW has the full capacity to carry out these activities through its offices Marib  and Al-Jawf governorates. It has a good infrastructure to execute and manage multi sectoral services. It has a rich experience in providing protection services through working with UNHCR since 1993 in refugees operation, in camp management in Amran 2009, asylum seekers and IDPs operation since 2009 till 2016 in Hajja and Huddeidah governorates and recently with UNOCHA in provision of protection services to IDPs in Al-Jawf, Taiz and Marib. It has achieved continuous successes to obtain high rates for implementation of activities each year and to better usage of its available resources. 
CSSW also effectively participated in the foundation of clusters on both central and sub-cluster levels. Moreover, it contributed actively in the clusters&#x2019; meetings and their ongoing ever since the initiation of such system, particularly the CCCM/Shelter and protection. 
Furthermore, CSSW, has a well-qualified staff in the field of protections who has accumulated experience and able to adapt with stress and cope with difficult/ conflict situations to provide services to the vulnerable people. It has also active offices in the targeted governorates Marib and Al-Jawf with wide and accumulated experiences that enable them to handle this project.
The expected risks that may encounter the project in this volatile situation, is the spreading of conflict into the target areas, particularly the areas in which the two community centers will be located, and the movement of target people into other safer areas. To mitigate the effect of such risks, an emergency plan will be prepared based on the situation assessment to keep providing the necessary protection services to target people whether through relocating the community centers into a safer and reachable area or through changing the working approach into mobile protection team.</narrative>
