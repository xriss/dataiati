   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Protection for conflict-affected communities in Sa&apos;ada</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project contributes with life-saving assistance targeting the most vulnerable individuals including (women, men, boys, girls and GBV survivors) and the host communities in Sada&apos;a City and  Sahar districts in Sa&apos;ada  governorate. The project aims to reduce the impact of conflict in Yemen which reflected on the community-protection level via interventions within the protection cluster strategy 2018 in one of the most humanitarian need prioritized area targeting 20,792 of the most vulnerable persons (women, men, boys, girls and GBV survivors), 40% IDPs and 60%  from host community and marginalized group due to the continuous displacement. Since March 2015 till today airstrikes never ended, number of displaced people are increased from and to Sada&apos;a governorate.
The (Sphere) outlines four protection principles, which underpin all humanitarian action and encompass the basic elements of protection in the context of humanitarian response.

The project will assist the survivals to improve their life, by providing quality protection services through the activities of community centers.  Such as the case management interventions for the adults, children and GBV survivors with the life-saving services including (cash assistance, legal assistance for the adults and children as well, GBV survivors with the legal and mental and livelihood assistance as well for the adults and children).

When It comes to Sa&apos;ada, DS has indeed the capacity to work and target almost all places in Sa&apos;ada thanks to its good relationships  with local authorities in there since DS has implemented many projects for the area before. DS also has a mobile team that is able to work in the worst of conditions as possible.  
In addition, DS has coordinators from locals which further facilitate its work on the ground.
Some of these projects are 
-	children parliament which is been active for almost 18 years, Sa&apos;ada&apos;s parliament members attend several meetings including mayor and local authority meetings, meetings with other international organizations, thus they help in assessing the needs of the area, This parliament has the trust of society and active centers.
-	Another project that DS has worked on is MRE. 

Though there are still some of the potential risks that are to be taken into consideration, such as:  
1- Conflict escalation in Sa&apos;ada and  nearby districts
Concerns for potential military operations and air strikes increase.
2- Extension of military operations to Sahar area.
If such is to happen then, it would result a displacement from both locals and IDPs causing un-imaginable degradation to the already happening to people there with the scarce of food and other services. 
3. Inability to source good locations for the community centers.
4. Inability to provide cash assistance to beneficiaries due to liquidity issues 
Although DS plan to contract main suppliers likely from the same area by conducting a pre analysis to bankers / exchange agent a lack of liquidity could still happen due to security issue.</narrative>
