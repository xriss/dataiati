  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This is a 11-months Shelter\NFI\CCM and Livelihoods intervention to support IDPs in Al Mukha District. The project aims to ensure that lives are saved and human suffering is reduced through provision of Emergency assistance and longer-term solution to 13,300 IDPs (1900 households) based on their needs, types, present and duration of displacement in four sub-districts of Al Mukha District, Governorate of Taiz.
Depending on the status and the needs of these vulnerable IDPs, the assistance will vary from Cash for Emergency Shelter\NFI for 250 newly households and in public or open space households, construction of Transitional Shelter for 400 displaced households in collective centers (in self-settled camp, schools, old directorate buildings) and IDPs with more than 9 months of displacement, provision of cash for rental subsides to 200 IDP households in rented houses, to provision of Cash for NFI to 1,450 vulnerable internally displaced households in non-hosted houses or with host families. This intervention seeks longer-term shelter solution with a longer life span in safety and dignity by upgrading IDPs&#x2019; present Shelter in the targeted areas.
The sub-IP is &#x201C;Ahdaf for Development&#x201D;, it&#x2019;s a local NGO located in Al Mukha, so the partner will improve the accessibility to the local community. Choosing an sub-IP from Al Mukha will benefit the district as it build capacity of the local civil society. The implementing partner was helpful in the need assessment phase and proved it can take part in this project. The sub-IP is registered and will-known NGO in the targeted district. It will take part in registration of beneficiaries.   
As the local market is available, safe and easily to be access by the beneficiaries,  NFI and Emergency Shelter assistance, will  be unconditional cash for assistance for the IDPs, unconditional cash will not only will assist the IDPs but also boost the local market and improve the purchase power which will benefit the host community. Also, this will contribute the 2018 YHRP which recommended the increasing the percent of Market Based Response Modalities to IDPs to where the markets are available and accessible for the targeted beneficiaries. In Al Mukha there are many money transfer agent, which could provide money transfer to the IDPs at any time during the day, including female-headed households.   
The location of the proposed construction of the transitional shelter is provided by the local authorities in Al Mukha for tenure of two years. The location is in an urban area of Al Mukha city, where there are health and education services, and markets. The design of the transitional shelter is informed through consultation with the community to optimize protection from hazards, health, livelihoods and provides more flexibility for recovery while utilizing materials from the local market. The construction of the transitional shelter will be linked with activities of &#x201C;Site Management and Coordination support&#x201D;, to ensure the establishment or support of a functional site management and coordination system in place to ensure the provision of an integrated response that meets the minimum humanitarian standards, strengthens community engagement, establish/build the capacity of the self&#x2010;management committees and maintains an effective coordination system to identify needs, coordination responses and advocate for gaps with service providers and other NGOs. This project is designed to enhance access to livelihoods and income generating activities through providing Livelihoods cash assistance. These activities will be linked with &#x201C;Provision of Cash for rental subsidies&#x201D; to provide a means to most vulnerable IDPs in rented houses to ensure their access to safe shelter for an extended period of time, to ensure more sustainable shelter, and to promote livelihoods and boost self-reliance. 60 most vulnerable displaced households in rented houses will be the beneficiaries in this assistance.</narrative>
