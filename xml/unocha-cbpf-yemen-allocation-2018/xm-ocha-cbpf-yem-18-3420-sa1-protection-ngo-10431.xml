   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Emergency Protection Response in Sana&apos;a (Arhab) and Al Hudaydah (Al Qanawis and Bajil districts) Governorates</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The SDF will be targeting the most prioritized districts of Sana&apos;a (Arhab) and Al Hudaydah (Al Garrahi and At Tuhayat) in order to provide emergency protection support for 6280 vulnerable population of IDPs and host communities. This project will be focused on establishing community centers in the targeted districts to mainly enabling and strengthening the IDP and host communities. Besides, target groups will be provided with a safe environment/forum to enhance their proactive engagement in decision making that affect their lives. Such centers will support the most vulnerable cases with cash assistance as well as emergency cash assistance for the victim people affected by the war like airstrikes and clashes. This type of assistance will be provided with case management through individual follow-ups. For an effective protection response, the SDF will include eligible team such as social workers in the community center to conduct case management, update the services and referrals map, follow up and manage safe referral. For the child protection response, they will track the families&apos; reunion, provide foster families for unaccompanied children and assist the victim children, survivors, and vulnerable GBV children. Other target groups who will be benefitted are people with special needs and the elderly. Moreover, the community center will provide legal assistance for people who don&#x2019;t have legal documents, including support for legal issues. To this end, the SDF will coordinate with the Civil Registration Authority to facilitate the process of issuing legal documents. Livelihood activities will be managed in this project to contribute in mitigating poverty and increasing sustainable livelihood opportunities for the vulnerable IDPs and host communities through the establishment of micro businesses with low cost in order to meet the urgent needs of vulnerabilities. The community centers will provide dignity kits for women through UNFPA. There will be also established community protection networks including different ages, gender and target groups of IDPs and host communities for promoting the self-protection for the vulnerable groups. The SDF will be targeting these vulnerable beneficiaries without any discrimination between men, women, boys, and girls and ensure the appropriate and safe delivery of services and assistance. SDF is implementing protection awareness campaigns and psychosocial support activities in Hodiedah governorate in addition to implementing protection and education project targeting refugees, host communities and IDPs in Amanat Al-Asema and Sana&apos;a. Hence, this proposed project will complement the current implemented projects in the targeted areas and utilize SDF experience, resources and access. SDF has good relations and acceptance with local communities and authorities, access and expertise in the field in the targeted areas to expand the coverage of providing life&#x2013;saving protection assistance for most vulnerable of conflict-affected people. SDF has also an active main office in Sana&apos;a and an active sub-office in Al-Hodaydah. All other SDF run project resources and experiences in Sana&apos;a, Al-Hodaydah and Hajjah governorates will complement the proposed project. Worsening security situation and expansion of fighting and airstrikes is the main risk for implementing this project. Also, a risk of airstrikes for the community centers to the gathering of people. SDF will consider safety and avoiding creating harm and safety of women, men, boys, girls, people with disabilities, GBV survivors and victims of the conflict that benefit from the community centers, will be monitored all the time. SDF will develop mitigation measures and put in place to keep the centers as &#x2018;safe spaces&#x2019;. Safe access to/from the community centers will be continuously monitored, post-distribution monitoring, exit interviews and other informal/formal discussions with the people visiting the centers can be very helpful in revealing existing risks.</narrative>
