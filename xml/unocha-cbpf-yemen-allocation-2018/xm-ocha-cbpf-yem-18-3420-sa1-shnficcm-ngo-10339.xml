   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Lifesaving Shelter Intervention for Vulnerable IDPs in Al Hudaydah</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Overview
According to reports conducted by international organizations, Yemen is one of the poorest countries in the Middle East. Besides, the security situation there is dangerous, especially, on the west coast where the fight has intensified causing a lot of suffering for the local residents, and a lot of destruction to their homes and the infrastructure of their homelands where they grow up and work. Therefore, the number of IDPs is in a rapid increase every day, and life-saving interventions have become indispensable in order to continue living in this harsh environment and non-humanitarian situation.

Intervention
All Girls Foundation for Development (AGF) is planning to intervene in one of those afflicted areas to support IDPs with necessary shelter services for a year. The urgent intervention of shelter kits and cash will provide an instant relief for the target IDPs, whereas the livelihood activities will guarantee the sustainability of income for those IDPs after the end of the project.

Target area 
The targeted area of the project will be Az Zaidiyah and Al Munirah Districts in Al Hudaydah Governorate. Lately, Az Zaydiyah and Al Munirah Districts have become the most crowded areas with IDPs coming from all rural districts around in Al Hudaydah Governorate and even from Al Hudaydah City and other cities located on the conflict lines. The security condition in the area is stable however, the biggest challenges are the harsh geography of the area represented in hot sandy plains and the lack of infrastructure of basic life necessities such as shelter, health, Wash and protection except some life- saving services provided by some NGOs.

IDPs in the area 
The IDPs in the area are in a critical condition due to the lack of proper accommodations and services. They are large households, the usual size of Yemeni households, who have been displaced with no properties, documents, or cash money. The households are full of vulnerable individuals such as illiterate women, children, the disabled, and patients with chronic diseases. Most of these IDPs have no access to health medications and treatment and have no shelter or any source of income. Many IDPs are living in open areas or in other host families&#x2019; house yards while some others were lucky to find houses to rent but, unluckily, unable to pay rent for the coming months due to their inability to find jobs or other sources of income. The congested areas of IDPs are places dominated by negative feelings of sorrow, helplessness, depression, and fear of the unknown future.

Numbers
The number of IDPs planned to be helped by AGF will be 1,300 households. This is almost 9,100 persons in total. 800 HHs of them will be provided with essential non-food items and emergency shelter kits. AGF will procure the NFIs kits  through announced tenders. Another intervention will target 500 HHs of the aforementioned 1,300 HHs. The intervention will include the provision of cash for rental subsidies after conducting a market survey, as it is a core element for any cash assistance. Furthermore, effective livelihood activities in coordination with ER will accompany the project in order to ensure a sustainable source of income for those households to enable them to get their basic needs and pay rent after the project is over.

Expected impact
After the implementation of the project, AGF expects to have fulfilled the following objectives: 500 households will be living in temporary shelters and 800 HHs will have been provided with the most basic non-food items, 500 households will have been provided with rental subsidies for almost a year, and those latter will also have been able to spend on their families and pay rent after receiving vocational training on work they can do and receiving items needed to start their own business.</narrative>
