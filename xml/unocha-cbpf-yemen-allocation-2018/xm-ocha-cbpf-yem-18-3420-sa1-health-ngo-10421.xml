   <narrative xml:lang="EN">&quot;Providing life-saving medical assistance to the most vulnerable among host community and internally displaced people in Boraa District, Hodeidah Governorate&quot;</narrative>

  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The main objective of MMF is to faster and extend access to primary health care for vulnerable groups. Through this specific project, MMF will expand its activities to 5 Health Facilities in Bura&apos;a district in Hodeida Governorate, specifically in Manwab PHCU, Alghailain PHCU, Algoran PHCU, Almaghrabah PHCU, Almarzaim PHCU. This project will benefit from lessons learned from current and previous projects implemented in Hodeida . Today, we still support 8 of these HFs as we run 4 mobile clinics providing health services in remote areas in Hodeida  Governorate. But MMF is aiming at extending its interventions in Hodeida  to ensure equal access to health services for all vulnerable groups and build community capacity to help them better identify and prevent diseases in their areas. We can count on our experienced staff already in the field to provide the necessary technical support to our future operations, in close partnership with the Ministry of Public Health and Population (MoPHP) and in coordination with other international (MSF, WHO, UNFPA, UNICEF and other NGO&#x2019;s) and local (district authorities) actors, in order to avoid overlapping activities and build on the capacities and know&#xAC;how of each stakeholder .
MMF will maintain targeted HFs to match MSP according to the assessment attached at the document area, in additional to provision  medicines supply to support primary health care and basic secondary health care.
MMF with collaboration with MoPHP aiming to Provide  a package of Health training Courses to build capacity for health workers : IMCI, IYCF and EMONC courses ,as well as providing HWs with monthly incentives according to health cluster  criteria to keep the health facilities running. 
The operating mode of this intervention will be to provide support to HFs located in the mountainous areas where low income and poor communities are concentrated. Total number of direct beneficiaries are 22500( 6500 male, 9000 female, 3000 boys and 4000 girls) , total number of IDPs 1616(620 male, 513 female, 249 boys and 234 girls) Numbers depends on DHO letter which attached to documents at this application. We strongly believe it is absolutely crucial to address this challenge today, as even though the proposed areas of intervention are close from the current front lines of fighting , we keep seeing an increase in the number of IDP arriving to the area as they escape from other districts severely hit by fighting, this puts a huge burden on an already weakened health system, justifying immediate action to help and support access to healthcare for already vulnerable groups, living in dire conditions. 
The country is currently facing a cholera epidemic the world&#x2019;s largest  outbreak  which is considered one of the potential risk for the staff working in the targeted areas, As a mitigating strategy  the team work will raise the awareness of the Communities through CHVs  health education sessions to prevent and respond to disease outbreaks on time.
 As mountainous villages, people suffered a lot because of difficult terrain, rough and narrow road. One of the HFs(Alghailain) has the most difficult  accessible road by vehicles so we are going to use an alternative solution to provide them with equipment&apos;s, medicine and furniture. Rapid spread out of ongoing clashes in Hodeida will affect the main road access, So alternative road through Bajil District is advised by security and safety officer of MMF in additional to establishing a new office in Bajil to be closer to the targeted area.</narrative>
