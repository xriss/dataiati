   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Unconditional Cash Transfers in Al Mukha (1500 HHs) and Dhubab (1500 HHs) Districts in Taiz - 6 Rounds.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This proposed project aims to assist men, women, boys, and girls identified in this proposed project in Dhubab (1500 HHs) and Almukha (1500 HHs) districts in Taiz, which are directly affected by the Yemen crisis that experiences less impact of the conflict and economic crisis by safely accessing humanitarian assistance. 3,000 families, which are 21,000 individuals who have been displaced as a result of the conflict will be targeted and will receive unconditional cash transfers to meet their immediate food needs over 10 months with a low support cost. The project budget has been prepared for 9 months and one more extra to prevent asking for NCE.

The 6 distributions of UCTs in Almukha and Dhubab districts are to cover the needs for ONLY 6 months as a standardized period by the FSAC, and as endorsed by FSAC. 

GWQ will ensure the recruiting of the needed qualified staff for this project, which is clearly mentioned under the budget tab, the recruiting process has started already by gathering suitable professionals for fast recruiting to implement this project, in addition, GWQ has already an initial agreement with Al-Kurimi bank to conduct the UCT rounds as per YHPF and FSAC standards in the targeted locations. Moreover, GWQ will ensure 100% coordination with YHPF and the FSAC during project implementation to ensure full compliance.

Concerning beneficiaries&#x2019; type, Unconditional cash transfers to newly displaced IDP households, families hosting IDPs, and trapped host populations due to the escalation in the conflict (in districts of origin and destination locations for newly displaced IDPs). Newly displaced IDPs refer to those displaced from 1st June 2018 to date! In Taiz and specifically in Almukha and Dhubab districts.

The proposed project objective aims to contribute to achieving FSAC objectives, which are increasing access to food for highly vulnerable families across the country (Almukha and Dhubab districts, Taiz) and increase rural households&#x2019; incomes, which contributes directly to the first line response of FSAC.

GWQ with a collaboration of DEEM organization has conducted the needs assessment, which is uploaded under the document tab and ensured that the FSAC has endorsed this proposed project, as also it is uploaded under the document tab.

The project has been designed based on the needs assessment conducted in the target locations, which included meetings and surveys with different vulnerable groups and individuals. This process assisted GWQ organizations to identify how the problems faced affected community members differently. 

Beneficiary identification criteria will also ensure that vulnerable groups affected by cross-cutting issues are targeted. For example, unconditional cash transfers will include female-headed households, in addition to the disabled and chronically ill (amongst others). However, GWQ aims to standardize beneficiary targeting criteria with other agencies through leading the Cash Transfer Working Group and will follow the agreed strategy of aiming to cover 80% of the food basket through a transfer of 32,500 (65 USD), which will be transferred through Al-Kurimi Bank.

In addition, please refer to the document tab to find the needed assessment in both targeted locations, FSAC Custer endorsement, food security risk matrix and related budget breakdowns.</narrative>
