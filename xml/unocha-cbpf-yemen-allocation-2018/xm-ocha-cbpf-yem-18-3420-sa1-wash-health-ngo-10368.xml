   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Integrated Health and WASH response to Famine risk areas in Ataq, Jehaf and Al Qabbaytah districts</narrative>

  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Over the project duration of ten months, YFCA plans to provide integrated health and WASH assistance to estimated 153104 beneficiaries from the most vulnerable individuals of IDPs and host communities to respond to the humanitarian needs at the famine risk districts of Ataq, Jehaf and Al Qabbaytah districts from Shabwa, Aldhale&#x2019;a and Lahj Governorates respectively using the integrated approach of IFRR developed by WASH, health, nutrition and FSAC clusters.

The key objective of this project is to provide emergency health and WASH assistance to the most vulnerable population at famine risk districts at Shabwa, Aldhale&#x2019;e and Lahj governorates through inclusive programming and integrated approaches. MSP health services will include the activities under the first line response including the provision of lifesaving medicines and medical supplies while WASH activities will include the provision of lifesaving WASH assistance and increase the accessibility to safe drinking water to the most vulnerable groups with the at the targeted three districts. The package of WASH activities will ensure the functionality of target communities&#x2019; water assists, providing operational support to water supply system and enhancing the public hygiene practices through conducting hygiene promotion sessions and distribution of hygiene kits. 
This service provision approach is integrated between health and WASH based on the clear findings of the conducted RNA assessment where the gap in health and WASH services is obvious and enhancing the local communities&#x2019; health and hygiene practices is extremely needed to ensure the long-term impact after project finishes its activities. 


The targeted districts are located in Aden hub where YFCA has an office that will carry out the main implementation task with backstopping support from the main office in Sana&#x2019;a.

The Implementing Partner (YAD) has good experience in providing MSP health services as they are one of WHO IPs as well as the good access they have at the target location, the selection of this IP was based on assessment conducted for them to enhance the capacities of national small NGOs to take larger role in humanitarian sector.

Coordination with health and WASH clusters, GHOs and DHOs has already done to support and facilitate the planned interventions and to avoid any duplication with other partners. All stakeholders will be coordinated during the implementation of activities with focus on strengthening the stewardship of local health and WASH institutions to enable them performing in more effective and efficient ways.

The possible risks might be faced are: security deterioration, prices fluctuation, supplies shortage in the local market and outbreaks of endemic diseases. These risks cane be mitigated through close coordination with all stakeholders in the field, contracting with suppliers and staff for the whole period of the project to ensure sustainability of supply and services and avoid any prices fluctuation. 

YFCA will monitor the project activities using concentrated modalities and tools at the central, hub, governorate and field levels with giving more attention to on-time reports to OCHA, WASH and health national and sub-national clusters. Project staff will contain experts to fulfill the specific tasks in administrative and technical aspects with support from staff at the head and Aden hub offices and governorate units.

YFCA will ensure the mainstreaming of protection and gender concepts during the designing and implementation stages of this project as well as to demonstrate its accountability for beneficiaries and affected communities and their engagement in monitoring this project.</narrative>
