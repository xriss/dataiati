   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The total number of people in need has now reached 15.7 million people (previously 14.5 million). While the number of people in acute need are 7.3 million, the number of people in moderate need has now reached 8.4 million. Islamic Relief Yemen has conducted a rapid need assessment (June and July 2018) in the proposed four Governorates to identify the needs in the sector of WASH. Based on this, people in the targeted areas are drinking water from unprotected water sources, unavailability of emergency latrines, safe disposal of waste water and there is an increase in water borne diseases, including cholera and diarrhea. 25% of women and 75% of men were interviewed during this assessment. As per the assessment, 55% of HHs don&apos;t have access to safe drinking water which has led to water borne diseases in the area. 62% of diseases are associated with unsafe water and poor hygiene practices, 55% of community need 20 liters/capita/day to meet their water demand which they can&apos;t get due to inaccessibility, high queuing time, and insufficient discharge at water sources. 90% of HHs are dependent on unprotected dug wells and water trucking while only 10% has access to protected water sources. The community spends a large amount of money buying water through water trucks in order to meet their daily needs. 30% of HHs are paying 100 YERs on a daily basis for water survival, 10% pay 150 YER/day, 15% 200 YER per day, and the rest spend between 250 to 800 YER/day to meet their basic water needs. Access to water is also a challenge and 20% of HHs walked for 1000 meters to collect water, 30% walk for 700 meters, 20% for 500 meters, 20% for 600 meters, and 10% for 200 meters in all targeted Governorates.
The emergency WASH will be responded targeted Governorate (# 2 Districts). The proposed Districts are Haydan and Saqeen in Sada&#x2019;a Governorate having catchment population of 66,789 persons. 

Key WASH interventions will comprise of 08 # of water points in 2 Districts (4# water points in each District), installation of 110 # of emergency latrines (55# of Latrines per District), water trucking to support sanitation facility, training of beneficiaries volunteers to support health and hygiene promoters during hygiene sessions in the affected area. 118 # of hygiene sessions (#40 sessions in haydan amp #78 sessions in saqeen), Distribution of 1178# of hygiene kits to households with SAM cases (#396 in hatdan and #782 in Saqeen), # 1,178 distribution of water filters for safe drinking water (#396 in hatdan and #782 in Saqeen), 08 # of water quality analysis (physical, Biological and Chemical) to protect community from water borne disease, and reproduction of information Education communication (IEC) material to deliver health amp hygiene messages
IR Yemen recognizes that people of different gender and age often face different barriers in accessing humanitarian services and also struggle with various vulnerabilities to violence, in particular when accessing WASH facilities and services. Therefore, it will ensure that women will be consulted throughout the project and the water sources will be safe for women and children. Also, the distribution of hygiene and sanitation materials will also respect the special needs of SAM case. The community volunteers will have at least significant representation of women in order to ensure that women fully participate in the selection, final needs identification, and distribution of the supplies</narrative>
