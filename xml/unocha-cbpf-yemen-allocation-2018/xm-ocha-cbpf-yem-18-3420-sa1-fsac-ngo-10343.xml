   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Yemen Family Care Association plans over a period of 9 months under this project to implement Emergency Food Assistance through 6 rounds of unconditional vouchers transfer to the most vulnerable 1500 HHs in Wusab Assafil district, 500 HHs in Almanar district of Dhamar governorate and 1500 HHs in Aldhalee district of Aldhalee Governorate. The target districts have been considered priority districts for this standard allocation for the first line response of FSAC cluster interventions as per the revised HRP as well as in the FSAC cluster technical guidance.
After getting the approval of districts selection from FSAC sub-cluster in Aden and Sana&#x2019;a Hubs, YFCA&#x2019;s research unit team conjoined efforts with YFCA Aden and Al-Dhalea field teams to conduct a rapid needs assessment in the target districts of Aldhalee.and Wusab Assafil in addition to YFCA lessons learnt report for the ongoing interventions in Wusab Assafil to assess the needs along with the available beneficiaries&#x2019; database. In addition, a detailed market analysis had been conducted within the RNA in both target districts.
The purpose of conducting the needs assessment including the market functionality analysis is to obtain the maximum quantitative and qualitative data about the targeted communities and functionality of local markets for better planning and designing of interventions and to also ensure the involvement of beneficiaries from the planning and designing stage of the project hence ensuring that the project is beneficiaries tailored. 
The RNA detailed report including market functionality analysis in both districts has been shared with FSAC cluster and sub-clusters as well as with the stakeholders in the local authorities in both districts to ensure community engagement and to enrich humanitarian actors and all stakeholder&#x2019;s knowledge about the characteristics of the targeted communities and the scope of planned activities. 
YFCA ensured the alignment of planned activities under this project with the concepts of AAP and Protection amp Gender mainstreaming while designing the project and will do so while implementation by using clear and specific mechanisms that could be easily monitored and measured.
In addition, YFCA is demonstrating its&#x2019; accountability through adhering to YFCA internal AAP manual as well as cluster AAP guidelines, GAM and GEM frameworks. This project includes clear objectives and outputs incorporating protection outcomes and protection mainstreaming principles including prioritizing safety and dignity and avoid causing harm, ensuring meaningful access, accountability and participation and empowerment of vulnerable groups and individuals.
The modality to be used in providing EFA is the unconditional vouchers transfer which had been found most useful and effective over several similar projects implemented by YFCA in many governorates especially Aldhalee and Dhamar governorates where YFCA will very soon finalize similar project in Wusab Assafil and Alhusha districts. The implementation will start by forming community committees that will serve also for effective involvement of beneficiaries and their representatives in providing the humanitarian assistance and monitoring the activities implementation.
The management of this project will be carried out by high professional central and field staff who abide by internal code of conduct that is aligned with humanitarian principles and SPHERE standards in all sectors. YFCA MEAL unit along with field MampE officers in Aden, Aldhalee and Dhamar offices will fulfill effectively the tasks of MampE as per the designed plan to ensure the timeliness and quality of implementation throughout the project duration using project based tailored MampE concepts, modalities and tools at the central and field levels including the active complaint mechanism YFCA is using &#x201C;two-ways feedback mechanism&#x201D; along with using suggestion boxes and complaint phone numbers.</narrative>
