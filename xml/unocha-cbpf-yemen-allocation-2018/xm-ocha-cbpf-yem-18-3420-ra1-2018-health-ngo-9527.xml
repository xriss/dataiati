  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Yemen Family Care Association (YFCA) aims under this project to enhance Alhudaidah Governorate health preparedness capacity for Zabid and Altuhaitia districts towards better response to the increasing health challenges resulted from the escalated military conflict in the Yemeni western coastal areas which recently reached Alhudaidah city southern borders as well as to face the threats coming from communicable disease especially the cholera continuous threat.
YFCA in close coordination with health cluster, Health sub-cluster in Alhudaidah and GHO came out with the outlines of this project which had been designed to meet the health cluster preparedness plan objectives as well as to align with the Contingency plan developed earlier for Alhudaidah area.
The interventions planned under this project include: 1) Enhancement of Alhudaidah Health sector capacity for Zabid and Altuhaitia districts in warehousing medicines, medical supply and equipment at the targeted districts and 6 Health Facilities selected, this will include a backup warehouse establishment in Bajel City as an intermediate location that is safe and easy to access for Zabid and Altuhaitia districts instead of Alhudaidah city with increasing accessibility constraints 2) Provision of medical supply including emergency equipment based on the agreed forecasting with GHO and sub-cluster to be provided to 7 health facilities in the two targeted districts. Three rounds of medical supply will include the medications from the essential drug list with focus on medications for emergency and trauma cases while the equipment supply for one round at the beginning of the project will entirely dedicated for emergency management purposes and lifesaving essential devices such as ventilators, suction machines and DC shock apparatus 3) Improving medical and health staff capacities at the targeted 6 health facilities to manage emergency cases resulted from the escalating conflict through a package of specific 8 short term training courses to refresh their knowledge and update them with the first aid and trauma care knowledge and skills including the training on using referral system. The targeted health facilities will be 1- Zabid district (Almadina HC, Almudn, Altarbia and Almuakar health centers),2- Altuhaita district (Aljabalia, Alsuaiq health centers) 4) Build up health staff capacities in the area of managing communicable diseases with focus on cholera as one of the still challenging health threats in the area,4 training courses under this interventions will cover the surveillance and reporting of suspected cases according to the Early Detection and Warning System (EDeWS) used by health sector actors and leaded by WHO and MoPHampP.

YFCA will benefit from its strong physical presence in Alhudaidah area as well as from its strong capacity in implementing health projects over 40 years to ensure the effective and efficient implementation of the planned activities through a package of close monitoring and evaluation activities designed specifically to fit with the nature of designed activities and considering the extraordinary conditions at the area. 
The management of this project will take place mainly from the field with a technical and administrative backstopping support from YFCA head office in Sana&apos;a and Alhudaydh regional office as well as Aden office if needed in case of any changing in controlling picture on the ground that might constrain accessing any of the targeted locations from Alhudaidah.</narrative>
