   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Integrated Lifesaving Health and Nutrition intervention in Taiz and Shabwa governorates.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In coherence with the HPF allocation strategy regarding the intervention against malnutrition and famine in Yemen, SHS is looking forward to lay a hand of assistance to the vulnerable community of Taiz and Shabwa governorates located at the districts of Mawza, Al-Wazi&apos;iyah (in Taiz ) and Usaylain (in Shabwa). Thus in collaboration with the Governmental Health Office (GHO), through implementing a multi sector integrated project (Health and Nutrition). This project aims to provide basic needs to more than 61,409 individual including IDPs, Returnees and Host Community  affected by the circumstance in these districts. SHS performed a rapid assessment in end of August 2018 at these three districts (Mawza, Al-Wazi&apos;iyah and Usaylan) and held discussions with the community leaders and Local authorities in the district, hence their needs where observed. As a result of the war, the health facilities and the water networks in these two districts are out of service, endangering the lives of IDPs and host community residing in these locations.
The project aims to enhance the capacity of the health facilities (HFs) in order to provide integrated therapeutic and preventive nutrition services along with primary and secondary health care services as well as delivering maternal and reproductive health care at 14 affected HFs in these three districts. This aims to enable the HFs to re-operate again hence serve the community. SHS is also proposing to establish 3 mobile HFs that shall serve the affected population of Mawza (1 mobile HFs), Al-Wazi&apos;iyah (1 mobile HF) and Usaylan (1 mobile HF),  These fixed and mobile HFs shall work hand in hand with the CHVs who shall also provide Communication for Development (C4D), lifesaving messages, awareness programs as well as referring the discovered malnourished cases to the nearest HF. The SAM/MAM cases as well as the malnourished PLWs cases shall be enrolled in these HFs OTP/SFP and treated accordingly with the national CMAM Yemen guidelines. The mobile HFs shall have scheduled visits (2 visits per month) to the villages designated in these three districts, thus to deliver primary and secondary health services along with the nutrition services. The health services shall range from EPI, IMCI OPD for vulnerable beneficiaries in the target areas. Besides these services, women at reproductive age shall receive routine tetanus vaccination, mid wife counselling, ferrous sulfate, folic acid, supplements and other medical needs to prevent possible anemia or any pregnancy related complications. Women at birth shall be assisted by trained midwifes to promote a natural delivery and ensuring a healthy and clean hygienic standards are applied, as well as encouraging immediate breast feeding for their new born.
In collaboration with the epidemic surveillance system and the EDEWS program in the governorate, these HFs shall follow a strategy to monitor the potentials of any diseases outbreak in these four districts, hence awareness campaigns shall be delivered to the community as well as addressing the discovered cases with the required medical assistance.
1 water tank of a capacity 1000lt to each fixed HF shall be provided to all the 14 HFs targeted by this project along with hygiene materials to these fixed HFs. Also these water tanks provided at the health facility shall be routinely supply with water by water tankers (once per week). The CHVs shall promote hygiene awareness campaigns and spread the knowledge among the society, Thus to contribute in assisting the vulnerable beneficiaries and to promote a healthy community</narrative>
