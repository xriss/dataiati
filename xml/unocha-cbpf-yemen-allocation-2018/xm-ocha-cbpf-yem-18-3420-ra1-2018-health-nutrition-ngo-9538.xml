   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Urgent Emergency Health Project in Ad Durayhimi and Zabid districts in Hodiedah Gov. and Wusab As Safil district in Dhamar Gov.</narrative>

  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In line with the aim of the first reserve allocation strategy, associated 2018 Humanitarian Response Plan objectives and priorities, this project intends to support the health Clusters&apos; priority preparedness activities via aiming to ensure the provision of emergency health services to most vulnerable Internally Displaced Persons and host communities, particularly in most conflict affected and prioritized districts in and around Al Hudaydah governorate and responding to the emergency needs of conflict affected populations across these areas. It targets most vulnerable Internally Displaced Persons and host communities in Zabid and Al Doraihimi districts of Al Hudaydah governorate and Wusab As Safil district of Dhamar governorate in their quest for survival as people there have lost their most basic yet essential rights of health services.

So, in response to the emergency humanitarian situation and Clusters&apos; priority preparedness activities, BFD is proposing a 6-month urgent response project that provides to the most needing people in Al Hudaydah through activating health services in 2 Health Centers(AldoraihemiampWesab Alssafil), One General Hospital(Zabid)one Ambulances in Aldorahimi as this intervention will also include the provision of medication, supplies, furniture and equipment. Required rehabilitation to the facilities will also be covered along with the incentives of the working cadre according to the standards of Ministry of Public Health and Population and World Health Organization.

The chosen areas demand urgent interventions which is clear by the raising number of affected people in those areas and the huge spike in the Internally Displaced Persons counts which can only be estimated to be around 6000 Internally Displaced families so far. Through all clusters and acting partners&#x2019; reports, it&#x2019;s clear that Al Hudaydah is currently facing its worst known days with never ending clashes and airstrikes, the number of IDP families fearing for their lives keeps increasing while the assistance seems limited compared to the scale of assistance needed. The lack of assistance has caused them to seek refuges outside Al Hudaydah, Wusab As Safil an adjacent district to Al Hudaydah is currently one of the districts that harbors almost 200 IDP families  up to now which causes a higher work load on the health system there and if no support is provided it is vulnerable to collapse causing a higher risk of outbreaks and infectious diseases among the Internally Displaced Persons and the host communities.

Currently, BFD is not only present in Al Hudaydah alone but it is also present in Dhamar through working Cadre in Wusab As Safil and other districts. While the situation continues to escalate, BFD with its local cadre ensure to continuously coordinate with all authorities and its cadre maintaining safe routes for transportation from our warehouses to health facilities and Internally Displaced Persons camps. While the escalation caused so many to abandon conflict areas, BFD with the current escalation maintained its presence while assessing the situation and in multiple occasions providing assessments and Internally Displaced Persons list verification for Yemen Humanitarian Team.

The project will maintain the health system in the areas of intervention from collapsing and will continue with the already short number of health workers left after the many who have fled and abandoned their posts. This project is surely the method of saving multiple priceless lives and avoiding catastrophic results of outbreaks and infectious diseases.</narrative>
