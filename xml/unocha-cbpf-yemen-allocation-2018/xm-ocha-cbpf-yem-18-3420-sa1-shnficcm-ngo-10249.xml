   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Bena Charity For Human Development (BCFHD) is going to implement a 12- month project that aims at providing life-saving and life-sustaining of cash and NFIs assistance to (1380) HHs of the most vulnerable IDPs, in the host communities in Taiz Governorate: (727HHs) living in Attahreer neighborhood and Aldhabua&apos;a neighborhood of Al Qahirah district and (653 HHs) living in Althorah neighborhood, Alridhwan neighborhood, Health Institute neighborhood, and Alshamsi neighborhood of Salh district. 
This aim will be achieved at three dimensions: supporting 380 HHs of the most vulnerable IDPs (200 HHs in Al Qahirah district and 180 HHs in Salh district) with rental subsidies to ensure their access to safe shelter for an extended period of time supporting 1000 HHs of the most vulnerable IDPs (527 HHs in Al Qahirah district and 473 HHs in Salh district) with cash for NFIs, which will contribute to supporting more sustainable solutions and providing 380 HHs of the most vulnerable HHs who received cash grants for rental subsidies (200 HHs in Al Qahirah district and 180 HHs in Salh district) with livelihood assistance to enhance the self-reliance of the targeted beneficiaries to address basic needs and reduce dependency on relief assistance. Livelihood activities are determined in the light of focus group discussions, taking into account the gender and age of beneficiaries.
Responding to 2018 YHRP, the project activities were planned and will be implemented to promote safety, dignity and rights of affected people, giving priority for the poorest, vulnerable, female-headed households, pregnant and lactating women, children, people with disability, elderly and sufferers of chronic illnesses during the implementation of project activities. Regarding rental subsidies, each targeted HH will receive $75 monthly for 9 months via a cash transfer agency.
What is special about this project is its exit strategy i.e.,  the rental subsidies will be linked with livelihood activities, which will enhance the self-reliance of the targeted beneficiaries to address basic needs and reduce dependency on relief assistance when assistance stops. The livelihood activities are determined in the light of the results of the focus group discussions with the targeted beneficiaries of rental subsidies, which will help in collecting detailed information about the previous livelihoods of the targeted beneficiaries. Based on this, the targeted beneficiaries will receive a cash assistance ranging from $100 to $500 according to the type of livelihood activity to create livelihood and income generating activities for the targeted beneficiaries during the period of displacement and to enable them to pay house rent after the project. All this will be achieved in coordination with the centers of empowerment, the Social Fund for Development, and Risalati Foundation for Woman Empowerment in Al Qahirah and Salh districts and also in coordination with the Early Recovery Cluster.
Moreover,  targeting the beneficiaries with NFIs will be in form of  cash assistance to give the affected people the choice to buy the required NFIs which will contribute to supporting more sustainable solutions, especially that the results of the needs assessment revealed that there are enough NFIs stores as well as cash transfer agencies that can be requested to provide cash transfer service for the targeted beneficiaries in the two targeted districts. In line with this, the results of PDM  revealed that the targeted beneficiaries prefer getting NFIs assistance through  cash based modality  rather than in-kind based modality.</narrative>
