   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project is designed with an aim to increase access to education and to improve the safety and quality of education for school-aged girls and boys in the Al Maton district in Al Jawf the Majz, Sahar, and As Safra districts of Sa&#x2019;ada. The districts have been classified as levels 4, 5 and 6 priority geographical areas by OCHA for Education. Accordingly, to respond to the identified needs, this project will be implemented in close coordination with Education authorities to meet the following overall objectives: 1) ensure equitable access to safe, protective learning spaces and 2) maintain the functionality of the education system.The following activities will be conducted: 
- Establishing 20 temporary learning spaces (TLC) with education materials for IDPs students
- Providing education supplies (school kits, education materials, text books, school furniture, recreational kits, boards/markers/ chalks/ erasers) for roughly 20 schools, 400 volunteer teachers, 12000 students and 400 classrooms
- Offering cash incentives for 400 teachers.
- Establishment of 8 semi -structured classrooms

NFDHR will also conduct monitoring visits for follow-up and documentation of the intervention activities, challenges and success. Monitoring and reporting will be gender dis-aggregated by age, sex and diversity, and will seek to ensure beneficiaries receive the full package of interventions. Ultimately, it is anticipated that 12,400 individuals whom are currently receiving very limited humanitarian support will benefit from and have improved access to education.

Expected major risks consist of the following: security situation becomes worse and targeted beneficiaries cannot be reached with planned services local authorities and stakeholders want to add activities and services not included/approved in the project and schools/learning spaces being targeted by parties of conflict. However, NFDHR has planned for such risks by preparing the following mitigating interventions. We will: conduct regular security assessments establish frequent communication with all stakeholders keep teams informed about the updated situation work with local leaders, local authority, the MoE and NAMCHA to facilitate the implementation process.

NFDHR has a highly-qualified team experienced in implementing various education projects. in the last four years, NFDHR has been working with UNICEF and UNOCHA to implement a variety of projects, which include: rehabilitation of 10 schools in Amran Back-to-School awareness campaigns in 7 districts of Amran I Miss My School campaigns in Al Jawf and Sa&#x2019;ada governorates and psycho social support for youth in the Amran and Al Bayda governorates. Additionally, we have conducted a peace-building project in the Ibb governorate, and we are currently targeting initiatives that improve education through peace-building in Ibb. We ensure that girls and boys get equal opportunities in all projects and activities that are conducted by the education program. Furthermore, NFDHR launched a unique app called Education Watch that helps monitor and evaluate the progress of the education system in Yemen by: facilitating communication between educational staff and students, encouraging community involvement in monitoring, reporting and solving problems or violations that hinder learning, and improving education quality.

Two implementing partners will be sharing NFDHR activities (Najah foundation in Al Maton Al Jawf gov.  and Awtan foundations in Saah and governarates). The IPs activities will consist of Coordination and Selecting schools per each district distribution and conducting  Back to school campaign for IDPs students and dropout  students. Other sub-activities might be added to the IPs where NFDHR technical team is proposing. NFDHR will supervise on IPs tasks, monthly visits by financial and technical team to their offices and ensure that all activities are conducted properly.</narrative>
