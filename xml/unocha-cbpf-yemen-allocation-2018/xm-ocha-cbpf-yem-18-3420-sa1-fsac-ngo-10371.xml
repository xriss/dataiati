   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Food Security Response for most vulnerable and affected households in Al Udayn district of Ibb governorate</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In response to FSAC first-line Gaps, YDN proposes this intervention aiming to increase access to food for highly vulnerable families in Al Udayn district of Ibb governorate. Al Udayn district has a total population of 197,280 among whom 46,172 are considered in Acute Need according to FSAC 2018 YHRP District Level Targets. Besides that, a need assessment that has been conducted by YDN in August 2018 indicates that more than 80% of the HHs in Al Udayn district are food unsecured and in need for emergency food assistance. 
This project will be implemented in three sub districts through unconditional cash / voucher transfers modality in order to maximize the benefit and strengthen the local market as well as maintain a good control over the project activities and resources. The vouchers modality was preferred by a considerable percentage of HHs as per the conducted initial needs assessment. However, the modality will be decided once the detailed need assessment completed. Moreover, an initial  market assessment was conducted targeting the main market of the district. It showed that the main food needs of the population are mostly available in the local markets and people could easily reach those markets. 
Consequently, the proposed project will target 10,500 individual disaggregated as (4270 men, 4445 women, 875 boys and 910 girls) with unconditional voucher/cash transfers for six rounds to the same households. 
The beneficiaries will be selected based on the FSAC vulnerability and targeting criteria. Registering the beneficiaries will be starting directly after training the registration team on the FSAC targeting criteria, the registration tools and procedures.  The next stage of beneficiaries&#x2019; registration will be done conforming to other FSAC vulnerability and targeting criteria including women headed HHs, Vulnerable IDP households (presently IDPs have some of the worst food security indicators in the country), Vulnerable Host households hosting IDPs, and Child headed households.
Selection criteria will also be further broken down and developed in consultations with community committees at district/village levels during the mobilization and sensitization phase.  Every effort will be made to ensure that both male and female are targeted by the interventions and that both genders are represented in all of the project teams.

Project Activities:
-	Conduct market assessment and monitoring to inform emergency food assistance transfer modalities.
-	Coordinate with all stakeholders/organizations.
-	Selection of community committees in the targeted district and inform them of project objectives, type of intervention, beneficiaries selection criteria and frequency of distribution.
-	Conduction of a community participation workshop for community leaders amp representatives to discuss project goals, activities, and other information to ensure their participation in designing of project activities and decision making process.
-	Conduct training for registration/ verification team.
-	Registration of beneficiaries in the targeted district based on the FSAC selection criteria.
-	Verification of beneficiaries by reviewing the list of most vulnerable people that are eligible for the food voucher/cash
 assistance in the targeted district.
-	Conduct baseline survey in Al Udayn district
-	Selection and contracting of local food traders.
-	Provision of food voucher/cash
 assistance to most vulnerable households targeting 1500 HHS /round for 6 rounds in adherence to FSAC standards in terms of food basket composition, quantity of commodities, amount of voucher/cash YER 32,500 per household.
-	Conduct post distribution monitoring (PDM).
-	Monitoring of project activities, developing humanitarian stories during the project implementation.
