  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Kharief is one of Amran governorate&apos;s 21 districts with estimated population projected from 2004 census 104,000, 52% Women and 48% men. Population of Kharief are living in 66 mostly very small villages and 4 Nomad centers divided into 5 Ozlas With 5 populated centers (New ALSoqe, Bait AL-Qafaf,  Shibrah, AL-Maham and  Dhahyan). 20% of its population are migrants or living outside Yemen. However, the current conflict situation drive many IDPs especially from Sa&apos;ada governorate to live in Kharief district especially in the main villages (CDF primary assessment) which put more pressure over poor infrastructure and resources available in the district. Population activities are mostly agriculture therefore, it is estimated that 50% of population are in need for protection (50000) half of them in great need. This estimation is based on UN estimation that 2.6 of general Yemenis are in need for protection and half of them are in great needs. In addition to those (25000) populations are in great need, there are IDP&apos;s living in several villages of the district.
 CDF project focused on establishment of community center in kharief district which aims to contribute in decreasing risks and insecurity of IDPs and their host communities at Kharief district, with special attention to vulnerable groups including women, girls and people with disabilities, provide multi sectroal and inclusive protection services as a community center at Kharief district for IDPs victim of violence including GBV and provide equitable assistance to men, women, children, boys and girls to promote their equal protection, safety and dignity of all IDPs and their host communities in Kareif district.
The project will targted 5117 as direct beneficiaries from both IDPs and host communities (1226 men, 1267 women, 1319 boys and 1305 girls), the percentage of male 24% of the total, 25% female, 25% boys and 26% girls). 35000 will be indirect beneficiaries of that services and awareness raising activities. 
The Project activities will be Community needs and service assessment, Case Management, Legal Assistance, Protection cash assistance, Livelihood and community development, Community Based Protection Network&#x2013;CBPN, Mine Risk Education and outreach based on the community needs.
The project will work in Kharief district in Amran governorate in 7 populated villages (New Al-Souq, AL-Mahm, Al-Dhabr, Al-Demnah, Bait AL-Qafaf, Shibrah and Dhahyan
CDF has the capacity to work in Kharief district because of CDF accumulative experiences with all governorates of Yemen and most of it&apos;s district. CDF worked with local councils, local government, NGOs in Amran governorate which will facilitate its work process. CDF also has voluntarily network all over Yemen including Amran governorate which enable CDF to be access to locations and people.
Potential risks is increase of IDPs in the district because of western coast war front (AL-Hodida) coming to Kharief. The other one Unlikely, move of conflict from Hajjah Governorate to Amran governrate.</narrative>
