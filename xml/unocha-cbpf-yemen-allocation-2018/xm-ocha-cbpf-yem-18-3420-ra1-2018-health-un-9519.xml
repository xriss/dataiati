  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The recent and ongoing conflict in Hodieda has resulted and continues to cause massive damage and disruption to the lives of the affected populations. Health service provision has been disrupted by the attacks. Many health facilities have been reported as damaged or destroyed. As late December 2018, it is estimated there have been that 9,245 conflict related deaths and over 52,807 injuries &#x2013; meaning that an average of 60 people have been killed or injured every day in the past two and a half years. An increasing number of health facilities and ambulances damaged / destroyed, lack of critical medicines and medical supplies and the reduced number of health workers in the country are preventing those most in need from accessing life-saving medical care. Escalation of violence and armed clashes in Hodieda has worsened the already dire situation. Influx of war wounded on already overwhelmed functioning hospitals can quickly reduce the quantity and quality of limited number of available services.  Without the provision of timely trauma treatment, suffering is exacerbated and the risk of complications with consequent longer-term impact heightened from infections and outbreaks of communicable diseases. Unless efforts to contain and scale outbreak response continue, risk of exacerbated disease transmission will remain a public health concern on top of the other sequences of the ware. 

Host communities trapped with the conflict zones will pay high price as with the continued insecurity and displacement of large segments of the population, accumulation of uncollected garbage, lack of water, the threat of communicable disease outbreak is considerable and thus the imperative to ensure outreach activities in hygiene and sanitation to reduce exposure to unsafe drinking water, disease surveillance to ensure outbreaks are averted.

The prevailing lack of fuel and electricity not only makes it difficult for the population to reach operational health facilities, but has also has endangered major health stocks such as vaccines and cold chain items in the prevailing hot season in targeted areas. 

Procurement of equipment will be done through bidding among trusted vendors with whom WHO has worked in the past, and only with pre-approved pharmaceutical companies that have been pre-qualified by WHO experts. This is in order to ensure quality as well as suitable pricing of items. The origin of the equipment, weight of equipment, time frame for delivery, and price of transport will all be taken into consideration when deciding whether to ship by air or sea. WHO Yemen will implement the pr

The project will be implemented in all Hodeida governorate with benefiting 600,000 population including IDPs and host communities. The medical supplies and equipment will be distributed for 4 hospitals, 10 health centers and implementing partners in Hodieda  

This escalation of violence in hodieda calls for the need to timely expand the rapid activation of Emergency Medical Teams(EMTs). In light of the escalation of conflict and violence in Hodeidah, WHO plans to expand EMTs in selected Districts. The  ultimate goal is to provide an Emergency Response amp Dispatch Solution to any incidence of mass casualties. In this regard, the activation of EMTs benefits from the existing network of WHO&#x2019;s partners currently delivering the provision of emergency health services.

In order to address the most critical needs and save lives and reduce suffering, WHO will:
1 .Strengthen the epidemiological surveillance and response system to permit timely alerts and prompt mitigation measures
2. Deliver integrated health package interventions support to emergency care along with the provision of ambulance and referral services, operational support to health facilities to maintain their functionality, procurement and distribution of medical kits and other medicines to respond to gaps, enhance health partner coordination to avoid duplication and establish EMT to manage</narrative>
