   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Urgent Protection Response to IDPs and Most Vulnerable in Al Bayda and Dhamar Governorates</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Urgent Protection Response to those Most Vulnerable in Al Bayda and Dhamar governorates project is designed with an aim to improve access to protection services for 15,360 IDPs and other vulnerable people in the two conflict affected districts: Al Bayda City in Al Bayda and Wusab As Safil in Dhamar. Both targeted districts have been classified as priority geographical areas by OCHA for Protection. Accordingly, to respond to the identified needs, this project will include first-line response activities implemented with the goal of contributing to the following Protection Cluster Objectives: 1) to provide specialized assistance to people with specific protection needs, including the victims of violence and 2) to support community centers, programs and protection networks. As such, the project will be conducted in coordination with the Protection Cluster, and NFDHR has received the approval and direction to target the above-mentioned districts. 

This project&#x2019;s activities will be the following:
 Provide emergency cash assistance to people and households at extreme risk, focusing on victim assistance and urgent protection risks.
 Identify and refer people with specific needs, including women, children, the elderly and people living with disabilities, to service providers 
 Assist people without documentation and refer them to the appropriate authorities 

NFDHR will also conduct monitoring visits for follow-up and documentation of the intervention activities, challenges and successes. Monitoring and reporting will be gender dis-aggregated by age, sex and diversity, and will seek to ensure beneficiaries receive the full package of interventions. Ultimately, it is anticipated that 15,360 individuals whom are currently receiving very limited humanitarian support will benefit from and have improved access to protection services.

Expected risks consist of the following: security situation becomes worse and targeted beneficiaries cannot be reached with planned services local authorities and stakeholders want to add activities and services not included/approved in the project the clash area expands increasing the number of IDPs and they flee, making them harder to reach and more difficult to manage. However, NFDHR has planned for such risks by preparing the following mitigating interventions. We will: conduct regular security assessments establish frequent communication with all stakeholders keep teams informed about the updated situation work with local leaders, local authority, NAMCHA and local health offices to facilitate the implementation process.

NFDHR has a highly-qualified team experienced in implementing various protection projects and working in Gender and Protection. NFDHR has been working on protection since 2014. during which, we have implemented four protection project in Amran, Sana&apos;a, Sa&apos;ada, and Al Bayda in partnership with YHF, DRC, ZOA, and IOM. Furthermore, our protection team consists of 5 staff who has post graduate studies in international development and gender and feminine studies and more than 5 years working on protection projects at field and central level.</narrative>
