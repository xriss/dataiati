   <narrative xml:lang="EN">World Learning implements the Developing Rehabilitation Assistance to Schools and Teacher Improvement Program II (D-RASATI II) task order in Lebanon under the FORECAST II mechanism. The program&#x2019;s overarching goal is to support the Ministry of Education and Higher Education (MEHE) in improving the performance of the Lebanese public school system. The D-RASATI II program addresses the underlying reasons hindering the delivery of high-quality education in par with the private school system. World Learning will work with partner organizations AMIDEAST and the American University of Beirut and service providers American Lebanese Language Center and Digital Opportunity Trust.

D-RASATI&#x2019;s Phase 2 (D-RASATI 2, initially October 2013 &#x2013; September 2015) is a $24.5 million, two-year project which builds on the achievements of Phase 1 and contributes to the implementation of MEHE&#x2019;s Education Sector Development Plan. It is implemented by World Learning and has the specific objectives of enhancing the learning environments in public schools and of providing dynamic learning opportunities for school administrators and teachers, while increasing parent and community involvement in the public school system development. The project involves staff from the (MEHE) and from the Center for Education and Research and Development (CERD) in each of its components to embed institutional capacity building and operational and technical know-how in the structure of Lebanon&#x2019;s public school system.

In response to the situation produced by the Syrian crisis and its impact on the hosting communities and the public education system, D-RASATI 2 received an additional $4.5 million on 30 September 2014 to expand existing activities to target host communities. The project budget thus increased from $24.5 million to $29 million and the completion date was extended by six months to March 30, 2016.

D-RASATI 2&#x2019;s activities encompass the development of key strategy and guidance documents for MEHE; a set of standards for Extra-Curricular Activities (ECA), Leadership Development  (LDP), School Improvement (SIP), and Community Engagement (CE); a comprehensive national strategy to promote ECA within the education system including seven ECA modules for schools; an ICT action plan to guide the deployment of ICT to the entire public school system; and training of trainers (TOT) training materials on ICT, ECA, LDP, and SIP/CE.

D-RASATI 2 provides key interactive learning opportunities to the administrators of the public school system on approaches to school development through the LDP and SIP. This is coupled with continuous mentoring, coaching, and small grants to put learning into action. The project also provides teachers with training on the English language to improve the delivery of teaching in English, training for teachers with advanced language skills on language instruction and methodology, intensive coaching on how to integrate ICT in the classroom, and training on the organization and delivery of extra-curricular activities. D-RASATI 2 provides equal opportunity for all to participate in and benefit from its activities.

Ancillary to the project&#x2019;s main activities, D-RASATI 2 gives particular attention to schools located in communities which host high concentrations of Syrian refugees as a means of supporting Lebanese government efforts to alleviate the resultant pressure exerted on the public education system by the Syrian crisis. The project will conduct trainings on human rights-based management skills and psychosocial support skills for school staff in order to improve social cohesion among Syrian refugees in the classroom and community, and establish a mechanism to closely monitor these activities and measure a reduction in tensions between students at the school level. Stipends will also be made available to 65 schools to finance teaching and learning materials to satisfy the needs of the increased student population.</narrative>
