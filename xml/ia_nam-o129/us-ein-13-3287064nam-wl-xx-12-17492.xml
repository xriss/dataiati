  <description type="4">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">A typical project includes up to a week of meetings in Washington, DC, to provide an orientation and overview of the theme and to introduce visitors to federal officials and agencies, national organizations, academics and think tanks, nonprofits and NGOs, and professionals in their specific field of interest. All projects include a briefing on the US federal system of government. Meetings may include panel discussions, site visits, workshops, individual interlocutors, job shadowing, or service opportunities. Visitors typically travel to an additional three or four cities in geographically varied regions of the country; the itinerary may include a state capital and a small town to provide first-hand exposure to the great diversity that exists in the United States. Also included in the program design are hospitality dinners, school visits, volunteer or service activities, and cultural events such as rodeos, state fairs, festivals, visits to sites of scenic beauty, or events that highlight seasonal events or some unique aspect of the region visited.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Each year, the International Visitor Leadership Program brings about 4,500 visitors to the US for observational study tours from a few days to three weeks in duration. The program is administered as a partnership between the U.S. Department of State, Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs, Office of International Visitors, and private sector partners in Washington, DC, and cities around the United States. World Learning, and its predecessor Delphi International, have been developing these programs for more than 25 years. World Learning is responsible for designing and administering programs for about 800 international visitors from 140 countries annually. 

World Learning staff members design national itineraries, arrange logistics, set meetings in Washington, DC, and coordinate the collaboration of State Department program officers, interpreters and International Visitor Liasions, and more than 90 community-based organizations from the Global Ties Network who arrange local programs nationwide.</narrative>
