   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Future Leaders Exchange (FLEX) Program provides scholarships for Eurasian high school students to live in American society for an academic year. In turn, these students will expose U.S. citizens to the culture, traditions, and lifestyles of people in Eurasia.

Annually, World Learning places approximately 30 of the 1,000 high school students from Eurasia with an opportunity to live in the United States with American host families and attend high school during the academic year.

FLEX high school students are between the ages of 15 and 17 and are from the following Eurasian countries: Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Ukraine.

Program Cycle

FLEX students study and live with American host families from August through June of an academic year.  

Program Goals &amp;amp; Objectives, as defined by the Department of State
The goal of the FLEX program is to promote mutual understanding and foster relationships between the people of Eurasia and the United States by enabling students to:

gain an understanding of American culture, diversity, and respect for others with differing views and beliefs;

teach Americans about their home countries and cultures;

interact with Americans and generate enduring ties;

explore and acquire an understanding of the key elements of U.S. civil society, including concepts such as volunteerism, the idea that American citizens can and do act at the grassroots level to deal with societal problems, and an awareness of and respect for the rule of law; and

share and apply experiences and knowledge in their home communities as FLEX alumni, initiating activities that focus on development and community service.</narrative>
