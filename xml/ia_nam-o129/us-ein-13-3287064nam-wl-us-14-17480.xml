   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Youth Leadership Program with Japan and South Korea is a three-to four-week U.S.-based exchange that explores the primary themes of civic rights and responsibilities, leadership development, and community engagement and the sub-theme of entrepreneurship and innovation.

Participants are 16 female high school students and 4 female educators from Japan and South Korea, who will be joined by American students for some of the US-based activities. The program concludes with follow-on activities in the participants&#x2019; home communities in which they apply the knowledge and skills acquired during the exchange experience.

Program Cycle

Students travel to the United States in August to World Learning&#x2019;s Lake Tahoe satellite campus in Nevada; followed by homestays in either Chicago, IL or Seattle, WA; concluding their program in Washington, DC.

Follow-on Reunion Conferences will be reunite participant alumni in Seoul and Tokyo approximately six-months after the completion of the US exchange. 

Program Goals, as defined by the Department of State:

Promote mutual understanding between the people of the United States and the people of the partner countries;

Inspire a sense of civic responsibility and commitment to community development among youth;

Develop leadership skills and community service skills among youth appropriate to their needs; and

Foster relationships among youth from different ethnic, religious, and national groups.</narrative>
