   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Legislative Fellows Program for Pakistan is a two-way exchange program for mid-level professionals from Pakistan and the U.S. The program goal is to promote mutual understanding and establish networks among mid-level professionals in the US. and Pakistan, while also promoting increased knowledge of the legislative process and principles of good governance.

The program includes the following components:

Participant selection and pre-departure orientation in Pakistan;

A one-month U.S. experiential program for participants from Pakistan that includes fellowships, interactive seminars, site visits, synthesis discussions, and designing follow-on projects (multiple cohorts)

In-country seminars and support of follow-on activities for participants from Pakistan, including workshops and consultations by American experts (multiple cohorts)

The U.S. program begins with an orientation in Washington, DC that focuses on the structure of the U.S. government, the legislative process, and the role of civil society. Following is a four-week fellowship in several U.S. cities, which includes professional fellowships, seminars, homestays, and civic engagement. Participants then return to Washington, DC for the concluding Professional Fellows&#x2019; Congress, which includes workshops, debriefs, and meetings with U.S. government officials, and a program debrief.

World Learning is partnering with the Centre for Peace and Development Initiatives in Pakistan, which will assist in recruitment, and pre-departure and follow-on activities in Pakistan. In the U.S., World Learning is partnering with member organizations of Global Ties U.S.</narrative>
