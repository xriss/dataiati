   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The U.S. Agency for International Development has awarded World Learning, in partnership with a consortium of international and local partners led by the International Rescue Committee, to implement the Pakistan Reading Project, which aims to build the reading skills of millions of children across all provinces and areas of Pakistan.

The Pakistan Reading Project will improve the quality of reading in public schools, supporting at least 2.5 million primary school students to read at a level commensurate with standards at their grade level. This overall goal will be supported by the mutually-reinforcing components of teacher continuous professional development, systems reform, and civil society engagement to re-establish a culture of reading in Pakistan. The Pakistan Reading Project will develop the skills of government education experts and improve systems and structures for reading education, including Teacher Training Institutes, so that 94,000 teachers in 38,000 public schools will have improved skills in teaching reading and conducting classroom assessments.

World Learning is leading the development of teaching and learning skills in the English language and is also administering 6,454 scholarships to Pakistani pre-service and in-service teachers to complete either 2-year Associate Degrees in Education or 4-year Bachelor of Education (Honors) Degrees in selected institutions. World Learning will also lead implementation of project activities across components in Gilgit-Baltistan and Azad Jammu Kashmir (AJK).</narrative>
