   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The EducationUSA Academy is an academic summer program that provides three-to-four weeks of English language courses, college preparatory content, tours of diverse colleges and universities, and cross-cultural activities to self-funded 15- to 17-year-old students from around the world.  Students will receive an overview of secondary and higher education systems in the United States and the U.S. college/university admissions process. Topics of study will include high school and college grading systems, college credits, U.S. academic culture, types of U.S. higher education institutions, the common application, essay writing, classroom participation, standardized testing, and much more.  Additionally, students will have the opportunity to develop basic skills in critical thinking, working in teams, and leadership.  By living in residence halls, eating meals in campus dining facilities, and socializing with American students, students will fully experience life on a U.S. college campus. Academy students will also have the opportunity to tour diverse U.S. colleges and universities in addition to the campus that is hosting them. Academy students will attend sports and arts events on campus and in their communities, and visit regional tourist sites, state parks, and museums. Prospective students will apply directly to the Academy host institution of their choice and will pay their own tuition, travel and other program-related costs. The program cost will be between $4,000 and $6,000, depending on the institution. This cost is inclusive of lodging and meals, books and supplies, health insurance, and cultural activities.  Airfare and visa fees are not included in the program cost, and will be paid separately by the student.

Host Institution Eligibility

Accredited colleges and universities in the U.S. can apply to host an EducationUSA Academy. The program is expected to expand over the coming years, and World Learning will announce the next call for proposals in fall 2016.
