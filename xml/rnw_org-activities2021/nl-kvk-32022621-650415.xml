      <narrative xml:lang="EN">Over the years, SRHR information provided by educational institutes has not been comprehensive and often does not reflect the realities and needs of young women.  Also access to online SRHR information has been provided but minimal, does not always reflect the needs, and has issues in reaching young women through the right channels.

The results of the baseline KAP survey show that the level of knowledge on SRHR varies significantly amongst gender and across regions. A majority of young women participants highlighted during focus group discussions that they are not aware of the definition of sexual health and lack the basic knowledge on the matter. Young men participants, on the other hand, were able to identify more easily with the term and provide more concrete examples. The opposing levels of awareness and knowledge is explained by restricting social norms and values that lead specifically young women participants to associate SRHR topics with fear and shame, and influence their ability to access such information. Reproductive health and rights, on the other hand, were more easily identified by both young women and men participants, as they are more socially acceptable to discuss and are understood to be generally more directly related to pregnancy and child birth. However, young women participants demonstrated more detailed knowledge of the topic. The majority of the survey respondents do not believe that young women and men/ girls and boys receive sufficient SRHR education. More respondents believe that young men and boys receive sufficient SRHR education, as 27% agreed to the statement, compared to 23% who agreed that young women and girls receive sufficient SRHR education. It is notable that only 3% of young men respondents report that they have no knowledge at all, a much higher rate was reported by young women respondents (17%).</narrative>

      <narrative xml:lang="EN">There are very few digital media interventions that focus on SRHR advocacy. The concept is still new but there are a couple of initiatves from few CSOs who are trying to advocate on SRHR topics. The scope of these efforts are very small and limited. Civil society organizations have data collection capabilities, but have shortcomings in the aspect of data and information analysis. This hinders the development of evidence-based advocacy interventions.</narrative>
