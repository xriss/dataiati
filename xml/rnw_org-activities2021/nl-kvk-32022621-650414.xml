      <narrative xml:lang="EN">SRHR is considered as a new area of intervention; a lack of easy and accessible information as well as socio-cultural barriers means that SRHR topics are still not well understood and therefore rarely addressed in public. Reproductive health, in particular maternal health is addressed but other issues are excluded both within public and private spaces.</narrative>

      <narrative xml:lang="EN">The civic space in the region where Masarouna is implemented is considered obstructed, repressed or closed, and the country is no exception. Laws contain provisions that have been used to repress opposition and freedom of expression. International actors are not exempt from this. Current space for CSOs working with diverse young people to connect online is minimal. There is limited space for YP and civil society to engage decision-makers, including governments, to fight for their rights, in particular SRHR and influence harmful social and cultural norms.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">The development of the digital platform is an innovative alliance of Oxfam and RNW Media. Over the years, a local CSO working with diverse young people will be added to the alliance and prepared to take over the management of the platform. The partners will be strengthened to build a strong movement. The CSO will be able to influence the agenda and decision making processes with and for diverse young people,  based on information collected and disseminated through the digital platforms they have developed over the past 5 years.</narrative>
