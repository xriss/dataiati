   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Further development of a tourism infrastructure that will support an expanding industry:  The hotel will cater to the growing demand for up market accommodation in The Gambia attracting tourists with higher purchasing power parity versus the current low paying package tourists that dominate the Gambian tourist market. As a result, Coco Ocean will encourage increased business in tourism related activities in the country. The project is also expected to improve the countrys image and competitiveness as a domestic and regional tourist hub in the quality segment.  Demonstration effect:  The success of this project will set a good example for other local investors and hotel developers and will help attract additional foreign investment into the Gambian tourism sector. IFCs provision of a long term loan to the Project will demonstrate that profitable and well structured projects justify longer tenors in The Gambia.  Job creation: The project will create around 200 to 220 new direct and permanent jobs as well as employ additional temporary labor during the construction phase. Indirect employment along the supply chain will be created as well as new linkages with the rest of the economy through the purchase of building materials, operating supplies and services from local suppliers. As a result the Project will contribute to the development of the local communities.    Climate Change: The key heating system for the project is based on solar power which will heat 8 of 9 pools and will supply all of the resorts hot water. The solar heating system will substantially reduce the consumption of electricity from the main grid and of fuel for the back up generators. Air conditioning use will be reduced by building designs that include extended eaves to prevent room heating by direct sunlight and improve air circulation through louvered windows.   Capacity building: the project will contribute to enhancing the local labor skills through extensive hotel training.</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project is located on Bijilo beach, on the main highway between the capital Banjul (10 kms distance) and the airport (10 kms). Prior to construction, the land was a sandy coastal area with limited vegetation. It permitted only limited opportunities for agriculture without addition of organic matter and fertilizer. The land was clear of houses and farming at the time that it was acquired for the project. No prior involuntary resettlement was involved. The land was effectively disturbed natural habitat with little value as habitat.</narrative>
