    <narrative xml:lang="EN">U.S.~strategic goals in Georgia continue to focus on supporting the country&apos;s integration into a Europe that is whole, free, and at peace. These goals include the further consolidation of Georgia&apos;s democracy; its integration into Euro-Atlantic institutions; building Georgia&apos;s resilience against Russian aggression; preventing radicalization of its minority communities; supporting progress toward a peacefully unified nation, secure in its borders; and encouraging inclusive, sustainable economic development. Russian support for the breakaway regions of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, the ongoing crisis in Ukraine, and the increasing number of Georgian nationals fighting in Syria and Iraq illustrate Georgia&apos;s continued vulnerability to external pressures, necessitating increasingly targeted U.S.~assistance to build Georgia&apos;s resilience and reduce its vulnerability. This includes strengthening the stability and viability of communities located along the administrative boundary lines (ABLs) with the breakaway regions through local economic development and improvements in basic livelihoods for vulnerable households. Expanded justice programs will target at-risk youth communities in Georgia&apos;s minority areas, effectively integrating them with current educational anti-crime programs in traditional Georgian communities. U.S.~efforts to help Georgia open up electricity markets and attract investments in clean energy production will increase generation and exports of Georgia&apos;s abundant hydropower resources, and reduce reliance on energy imports from Russia. U.S.~assistance will promote Georgia&apos;s engagement with occupied territories, and increase the inclusion of target populations, including ethnic and religious minorities, women, vulnerable children, and other disadvantaged groups. U.S.~assistance will also continue to support a sustainable resolution of conflicts with the occupied territories, a resolution that is centered on Georgia&apos;s territorial integrity.The United~States will also continue to bolster democratic and participatory governance, including by increasing transparency and accountability; supporting the development of policies and institutions that uphold and strengthen the rule of law; promoting further integration with the European Union (EU) and North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO); increasing regional cooperation; combating corruption while professionalizing Georgia&apos;s internal security apparatus; enhancing institutional training capacity to improve territorial defense capabilities; and strengthening political and electoral processes, civil society, and independent media. Expanded programs will also seek to increase private sector competitiveness and opportunities for trade, including as part of Georgia&apos;s new Association Agreement (AA) and Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area (DCFTA) with the EU, and help Georgia achieve broad-based, sustainable economic growth. U.S.~assistance, including technical support, in meeting Georgia&apos;s AA requirements will strengthen Georgia&apos;s ties to the West and its Western orientation. U.S. assistance will build resilience and reduce vulnerability to Russian aggression, increase European integration, and provide continued support for enduring programs.</narrative>
