   <narrative xml:lang="EN">As a VCA Alliance member, SSN brings extensive experience and expertise on knowledge and partnership brokering for climate-compatible development, and on building unique relationships with decision-makers in various contexts. Through the Alliance, SSN aims to support the generation, dissemination, and brokering of information, building the capability of partners to enable them to
respond innovatively to the challenges and opportunities that climate change presents. Knowledge intermediaries and knowledge translators are roles that we often refer to as part of &#x2018;Knowledge Management&#x2019; and are key roles that SSN provides in the VCA programme. Knowledge brokering, on the other hand, includes activities by knowledge/process brokers and innovation brokers, focusing on networks, relationship-building, and systemic change through knowledge co-production.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Voices for Just Climate Action (VCA) Programme is being implemented in 7 countries, including Zambia. In VCA Zambia, the vision is a Zambia where civil society is heard &amp; respected by influencing &amp; co-creating locally relevant, inclusive and fundable climate solutions that deliver real benefits to people &amp; nature as part of a local &amp; global response to this crisis. The target group of the VCA intervention in Zambia is centered around those who are most vulnerable to climate change impacts: women, youth, urban poor, rural communities, indigenous groups and marginalized groups. These underrepresented groups often have critical perspectives on power structures and alternative approaches to the climate crisis. VCA will operate in ten districts in the Lower Kafue Basin and Lusaka Province regions namely: Luangwa, Rufunsa, Chongwe, Lusaka, Kafue, Chirundu, Siavonga, Chikankata, Mazabuka and Itezhi Tezhi. 

The Alliance will also engage a wide array of partners including CSOs, community groups, research institutions, government, and the private sector at community, local, national, and international levels, as well as seek to establish a set of unusual alliances to enable innovative and unique ways of working for long-lasting impact. This will include the creation of multi-stakeholder platforms to co-create joint solutions between actors (e.g. Food Systems Labs), Public-Private-Partnerships (PPPs) outlining formal engagements for climate action, linking and strengthening existing social and grassroots movements between rural and urban communities, Public-Private-Community-Partnerships (PPCPs), such as informal social audits, by bringing the community, particularly those most vulnerable, and duty bearers together on issues of climate change.</narrative>
