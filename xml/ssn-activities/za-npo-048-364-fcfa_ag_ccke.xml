   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Enhancing the impact of the Future Climate for Africa (FCFA) programme through the the Coordination, Capacity Development and Knowledge Exchange (CCKE) Unit - FCFA Accountable Grant</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="4">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In February 2019 the Coordination Capacity Development and Knowledge Exchange (CCKE) Unit, hosted by SouthSouthNorth (SSN) received a costed extension as one of three activities part of the FCFA Accountable Grant (AG), funded by the UK Department for International Development (DfID), now the UK Government&apos;s Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO). The costed extension was granted to maximise the impact and legacy of the FCFA programme and to implement key components of work that emerged during the FCFA programme. The continuation of the CCKE unit under the Accountable Grant programme (IATI identifier GB-1-203835-107) is a key activity and is focused on leveraging the value of DfID&#x2019;s (now FCDO&apos;s) initial investment in FCFA in order to inform a wider African research agenda whilst bringing new climate information to bear on strategic and operational developmental decisions in Africa. Due to the qualitative nature of this activity, all reporting is done through the submission of quarterly reports, rather than using IATI&apos;s quantitative submissions.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Future Climate for Africa (FCFA) programme (IATI identifier GB-1-203835-102), and the FCFA Accountable Grant programme (IATI identifier GB-1-203835-107) are both coordinated and enhanced through a central hub. The Coordination, Capacity Development and Knowledge Exchange (CCKE) unit performs several functions to increase the overall impact of the FCFA programme, including the following: coordinating activities to promote learning and knowledge exchange between research partners including workshops, conferences, webinars, and meetings; coordinating and compiling reporting to the donors and the annual review of the programme; gap filling research was commissioned as the programme progressed and new research questions emerged; research and travel grants were issued and managed for early career researchers from the FCFA research consortia through the FCFA Innovation and Mobility Fund; generating and disseminating content to communicate FCFA work and key research messages to wider audiences through the FCFA website, Twitter account, news stories, press releases, briefs, and other publications.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In March 2019 the CCKE received an extension under an Accountable Grant. This extension seeks to maximize the impact and legacy of the FCFA programme and continue key components of work that have emerged from the implementation of the programme. In response to the FCFA 2018 DFID Annual Review recommendations, and wider strategy of HMG to scale up the International Climate Fund (ICF) spend, further elements of work were agreed with DFID. The focus remains to leverage the value of DFID&#x2019;s initial investment in FCFA in order to inform a wider African research agenda whilst bringing new climate information to bear on strategic and operational developmental decisions.</narrative>
