   <narrative xml:lang="EN">As a VCA Alliance member, SSN brings extensive experience and expertise on knowledge and partnership brokering for climate-compatible development, and on building unique relationships with decision-makers in various contexts. Through the Alliance, SSN aims to support the generation, dissemination, and brokering of information, building the capability of partners to enable them to respond innovatively to the challenges and opportunities that climate change presents. Knowledge intermediaries and knowledge translators are roles that we often refer to as part of &#x2018;Knowledge Management&#x2019; and are key roles that SSN provides in the VCA programme. Knowledge brokering, on the other hand, includes activities by knowledge/process brokers and innovation brokers, focusing on networks, relationship-building, and systemic change through knowledge co-production.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Voices for Just Climate Action (VCA) Programme is being implemented in 7 countries, including Brazil. In VCA Brazil the programme targets Local Amazonian communities represented by rivereins, indigenous people, and quilombolas. Based on inclusiveness and gender equality, we will focus on:
a. rural and urban communities in biodiverse areas;
b. women from social movements,
c. youth active on climate or in adjacent fields.
VCA Brazil will include grassroots organizations, but also women, youth, rural and urban social movements that are not necessarily formally constituted. In order to create enabling conditions to have local voices effectively heard in decision-making processes, and to enhance their influence. Additionally, the Programme will also link-local voices to supportive financial institutions and the private sector in Brazil and abroad, which could prove to be a powerful combination. This could open space in business agendas to hear local voices and their demands and solutions for effective climate actions. Jointly we can open the debate about the consequences of business as usual occurring in the Amazon. Public opinion should reflect an awareness of climate change&#x2019;s negative impact on economic activities and push companies to transform their practices towards a regenerative economy.The Programme in Brazil will also link local voices to supportive financial institutions and the private sector in Brazil and abroad, which could prove to be a powerful combination.

The Brazil Alliance members have a joint ambition to overcome the barriers to civic participation in order to catalyse climate solutions that promote socio biodiversity in the Amazon. The organisations have complementary expertise and are ideally positioned to ignite the necessary change to make this happen.</narrative>
