   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The VCA programme is creating an environment in which organisational development and new
collaborations can take place through mutual capacity strengthening for co-creating alternative
solutions . This will be done by connecting civil society organisations representing a wide range of constituencies (women, youth, indigenous people, local communities,
urban poor, digital activists, citizen journalists, etc.) that have valuable experience, skills, perspectives and aspirations relating to climate action. 

At the same time, the Alliance (WWF, Hivos, Fundacion Avina, SouthSouthNorth and Slum Dwellers International, Akina Mama wa Africa) and its partners will strengthen their mutual capacity around scalable locally-shaped, climate solutions, promote them and connect scalable solutions to external private and public funding sources.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This IATI activity is the overarching parent activity for the VCA programme for SouthSouth North, with the eight regions reported as separate activities, i.e. Zambia, Kenya, Tunisia, Bolivia, Paraguay, Brazil, Indonesia &amp; Global. 
The VCA programme strategies can be segmented into 1) mutual capacity strengthening: this goes beyond just building the capabilities of partner organisations and includes the capacities of civil society actors to implement strong advocacy strategies involves the transfer and mutual exchange of certain skills, ideas, capabilities or resources to attain development goals or climate justice, 2) Agenda setting and movement building: this is the ability to influence the public agenda and refers to public awareness, the concern of salient issues by the news media, and/or policy debates. In our programme it also refers to the extent to which we succeed in introducing new civil society perspectives and alternative approaches into these debates, 3) Lobbying and advocacy on policy and climate finance: Influencing strategies in this programme centre around the recognition of civil society&#x2019;s views in the development and implementation of climate-relevant (public and private) policies and practices. VCA will promote dialogue and collaboration with, and between, coalitions and networks related to climate justice while building new and surprising alliances for influence with, for example, private sector associations, faith-based organisations or media to ensure more leverage and a diversity of perspectives, 4) enhancing (gender) equality and inclusion: harnessing diverse perspectives, alternative approaches and women&#x2019;s and youth leadership is key to ensuring the voices and experiences of marginalised groups. Women and youth are brought to the front. This will include engagement with Indigenous Peoples and local communities, who are often marginalised, deprived of their human rights and rights to their lands. Supporting them in their efforts for the recognition of their rights and governance of their territories, and their indigenous and traditional knowledge systems is an effective and very cost-efficient strategy that contributes to a just and effective climate transition, as stated in the most recent IPCC report, and 5) Innovation: which is part and parcel of our main intervention strategies. In order to do this, we need to reframe our way of thinking about innovation: stepping away from extraneity, and towards a vision of innovation as a seamless, integral part of all activities.</narrative>
