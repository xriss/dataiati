   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Future Climate for Africa (FCFA) Accountable Grant - Maximising the impact and legacy of the FCFA programme</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Future Climate for Africa (FCFA) is a seven-year research programme, funded by the UK Government&#x2019;s Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO), previously referred to as the Department for International Development (DfID), and the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC), with the ultimate aims of reducing disruption and damage from climate change and safeguarding economic development and poverty eradication efforts over the long-term. In this way, FCFA aims to make new African infrastructure and urban and rural plans and investments more climate-resilient. The programme is implemented by four regional Research Consortia (RC), (HyCRISTAL, AMMA-2050, FRACTAL and UMFULA), a Consortium focused on the continent-wide science (IMPALA) and the Coordination, Capacity Development and Knowledge Exchange (CCKE) Unit, responsible for coordination of activities and maximising the impact of FCFA. More information on the full programme can be found on the FCFA website ( https://futureclimateafrica.org/) or using the IATI activity identifier for the full programme (GB-1-203835-103), currently reported by DfID as FCDO do not yet have an IATI identifier. As the FCFA programme moves into its final phase, it was noted that the Coordination Capacity Development and Knowledge Exchange (CCKE) Unit would have an increasingly impactful role to communicate the growing number of lessons learnt and outputs of the programme. In February 2019 the Coordination Capacity Development and Knowledge Exchange (CCKE) Unit, hosted by SouthSouthNorth (SSN) received a costed extension through an Accountable Grant (AG), funded by the FCDO (previously DfID). The costed extension was granted to maximise the impact and legacy of the FCFA programme and to implement key components of work that emerged during the FCFA programme and within the wider strategy of Her Majesty&#x2019;s Government (HMG) to scale up International Climate Finance (ICF) spend. The focus remains to leverage the value of FCDO&#x2019;s initial investment in FCFA in order to inform a wider African research agenda whilst bringing new climate information to bear on strategic and operational developmental decisions in Africa. The Department for International Development has closed. It&#x2019;s been replaced by the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO).</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This IATI activity is the overarching parent activity for the FCFA Accountable Grant programme, with the four key outputs reported as separate activities. The key components of the Accountable Grant are covered in three pillars: (1) LaunchPAD for a Climate Model Evaluation Hub for Africa: The University of Oxford is leading on the establishment of an African model evaluation hub supporting Early Career Researchers in Africa and the UK to help fast-track understanding of how climate models simulate African regions, as part of a wider international effort (IATI activity identifier ZA-NPO-048-364-FCFA_AG_ModelEvaluationHub/LaunchPad). (2) The Climate Mainstreaming Facility: a technical assistance facility, that is hosted by the CCKE as a mechanism for FCDO staff to access climate science expertise from FCFA and beyond (IATI Activity identifier ZA-NPO-048-364 FCFA_AG_ClimateMainstreamingFacility). (3) Enhancing the impact of FCFA through the the Coordination, Capacity Development and Knowledge Exchange (CCKE) Unit: The CCKE performs several functions to increase the overall impact of the FCFA programme, including the following: coordinating activities to promote learning and knowledge exchange between research partners including workshops, conferences, webinars, and meetings; coordinating and compiling reporting to the donors and the annual review of the programme; and gap filling research commissioned as the programme progresses (IATI Activity identifier ZA-NPO-048-364-FCFA_AG_CCKE). (4) Adaptation Research Alliance (ARA) to accelerate and scale investments in action-oriented research in developing countries (IATI Activity identifier ZA-NPO-048-364-FCFA_AG_AdaptationResearchAlliance). This final activity was added to the Accountable Grant in September 2020 (contract signed with FCDO in December 2020) with additional funds added to the Accountable Grant. Due to the qualitative nature of this programme, all reporting is done through the submission of quarterly reports, rather than using IATI&apos;s quantitative submissions. For this activity, incoming project funds are tracked as income and expenses are only non-project attributable (NPAC) costs. All specific expenditure is captured in the child activities.</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">Non-project-attributable costs (NPAC) are overhead costs that relate to the overall operations, management and identity of the delivery partner rather than to programme services. These costs are necessary for programmes to function although cannot be clearly linked to specific project outcomes and results (i.e. business expenses not including or related to direct labour, direct materials or third-party expenses that are charged directly to projects). Typically, they include overall management and employee costs, administration and support, equipment, space and premises costs, and activities that relate to the whole organisation. SouthSouthNorth receives funds from DfID for the Accountable Grant programme and is authorised to claim 18% of project funds per quarter on NPAC.</narrative>

   <description>
    <narrative xml:lang="EN">Non-project-attributable costs (NPAC) are overhead costs that relate to the overall operations, management and identity of the delivery partner rather than to programme services. These costs are necessary for programmes to function although cannot be clearly linked to specific project outcomes and results (i.e. business expenses not including or related to direct labour, direct materials or third-party expenses that are charged directly to projects). Typically, they include overall management and employee costs, administration and support, equipment, space and premises costs, and activities that relate to the whole organisation. SouthSouthNorth receives funds from DfID for the Accountable Grant programme and is authorised to claim 18% of project funds per quarter on NPAC.</narrative>
