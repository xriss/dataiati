   <narrative xml:lang="EN">As a VCA Alliance member, SSN brings extensive experience and expertise on knowledge and partnership brokering for climate-compatible development, and on building unique relationships with decision-makers in various contexts. Through the Alliance, SSN aims to support the generation, dissemination, and brokering of information, building the capability of partners to enable them to respond innovatively to the challenges and opportunities that climate change presents. Knowledge intermediaries and knowledge translators are roles that we often refer to as part of &#x2018;Knowledge Management&#x2019; and are key roles that SSN provides in the VCA programme. Knowledge brokering, on the other hand, includes activities by knowledge/process brokers and innovation brokers, focusing on networks, relationship-building, and systemic change through knowledge co-production.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Voices for Just Climate Action (VCA) Programme is being implemented in 7 countries, including Indonesia. In VCA Indonesia, the programme has identified the Jakarta, Papua and East Nusa Tenggara provinces as target areas for programme implementation. This is because Papua and East Nusa Tenggara provinces have a high prevalence of exploitative practices without getting the required attention from the national government in both urban and rural areas. The programme will be rolled out in the three provinces to strengthen the capacity to co-create local climate solutions and amplify voices through storytelling and building the capacity of local actors. This will be complemented by national-level advocacy and influencing. The alliance partners will also scale up evidence to influence policy at the national level to demonstrate what is possible in other country regions. The focus of the Indonesian programme is to join civil society forces from these regions to influence at a national level. These connections are critical, relatively new and add value in the Indonesian context. The VCA programme has brought on board a number of contracted civil society organisations and coalitions to advance the project objectives and deliver on the programme.</narrative>
