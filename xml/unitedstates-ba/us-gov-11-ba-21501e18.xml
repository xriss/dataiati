    <narrative xml:lang="EN">Bosnia and Herzegovina&apos;s (BiH) advancement toward Euro-Atlantic integration, and the democratic, economic, and security commitments that this process entails, is essential to the broader stability of the Western Balkans and the shared objective of a Europe whole, free, and at peace. However, BiH remains ethnically fractured and challenged by poor governance, external pressure, and efforts to undermine the state, including a Republika Srpska (RS) effort to move toward secession. BiH continues to lag behind most of its neighbors on implementing the economic and political reforms needed to integrate into the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and European Union (EU), even as it has committed to an EU-driven package of socio-economic, rule of law, and governance reforms. U.S. assistance will help BiH implement this reform package and improve government accountability and efficiency, trade with Europe, and inter-ethnic dialogue and reconciliation. U.S. assistance seeks to bolster and irreversibly consolidate a multi-ethnic democracy that safeguards the rights of all citizens, values tolerance and diversity, and enables women, youth, and minorities to flourish. U.S. assistance will also support government institutions and civil society that enable active citizen involvement and combat corruption; effective and accountable law enforcement, judicial, and prosecutorial systems that uphold the rule of law; an integrated military that meets security needs and NATO membership goals; and an economic space that fosters private sector development and provides economic opportunity for all citizens. Continued U.S. assistance and active engagement will be crucial in order for BiH to achieve its integration goals and to ensure stability in the region. U.S. assistance will build resilience and reduce vulnerability to Russian aggression, increase European integration, and provide continued support for enduring programs.</narrative>
