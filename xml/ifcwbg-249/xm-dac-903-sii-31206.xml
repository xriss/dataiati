   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project consists of an IFC equity investment of up to $10 million or a maximum of 20% of total capital commitments in CoreCo Central America Fund I, L.P. (CCAF I or the Fund), a private equity fund that will invest in small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in Central America.  With a target size of $65 million, the Fund will focus on underserved sectors with high growth rates, such as healthcare, IT, retail, financial and business services.  The Fund will invest in 8-12 regional services-based businesses with an investment allocation of $1 million to $5 million per company.  Managed by CoreCo Management, Inc., a well-qualified fund management with presence and business networks across Central America, the fund management team sees an opportunity in the region considering: (i) there is an underserved private equity market in the region with growing demand; (ii) the region is attractive in terms of size and consumption; and (iii) there is a favorable competitive landscape where strong demand for independent capital with good corporate governance and financial standards are required.  The Funds investment thesis and exit strategy anticipate regionalization and cross-border exits.</narrative>
