   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project will have a significant development impact in Central America through:  - Demonstration effects: the project aimed at strengthening one of the few formal players in an otherwise informal sector - expected to lead to an increase in the quality and availability of services benefiting Transamericas customers;  - Trade and Economic Growth: Continued trade and economic growth in Central America is contingent on further investments and improvements in regional transport infrastructure and services. Transamerica&apos;&apos;s efforts are expected to result in increased efficiency and cost effectiveness of the logistics chain through   - higher freight consolidation across countries and clients; and  -higher frequency and reliability of transport services.   Such improvements will increase the competitiveness and attractiveness of Central American economies;  - The project is a South-South investment involving Nicaragua, one of the regions poorest economies.  While foreign direct investment and involvement in the Nicaraguan economy remains weak, Transamerica owns a large operation in Nicaragua and is committed to develop the business further.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Transamerica is the largest trucking company in an otherwise fragmented market. It owns and operates trucks and trailers and owns/leases container yards in Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala.  It has established itself in the market as being a reliable and efficient trucking company.  The company wants to position itself as a major player ahead of the expected consolidation of the Central American trucking/logistics industry. It intends to achieve this goal by growing its business organically as well as through selected acquisitions. By being able to offer better, regionally integrated services to its customers and by improving operational parameters through economies of scale, Transamerica expects to boost profitability and grow.  The project comprises an upgrade and expansion of Transamericas freight hauling capabilities through purchase of trucks and trailers, the construction of logistics infrastructure, the refinancing of existing loans and selected acquisitions.</narrative>
