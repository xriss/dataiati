    <narrative xml:lang="EN">In November 2015, following more than a year of political unrest, Burkina Faso elected a new president for the first time in almost 30 years. The election, determined to be free and fair by international standards, bolstered a commitment to democracy that Burkinab demonstrated in October 2014 when a mass citizen protest brought the resignation of long-standing President Blaise Compaore. This nascent democratic step is challenged by a lack of governmental checks and balances, and public perception of inequality before the law. U.S. assistance to Burkina Faso will promote engagement by civil society with responsive local and national governments; mitigate the adverse health outcomes of malaria and other health pandemics; and continue to support the professionalization of the Burkinab military. In addition, this assistance will be complemented by a range of regionally funded USAID activities in support of economic growth, health, and countering violent extremism (CVE) goals. Burkina Faso is a key member of the Trans-Sahara Counterterrorism Partnership (TSCTP) as well as a strategic partner of the United States, promoting peace and stability throughout West Africa.</narrative>
