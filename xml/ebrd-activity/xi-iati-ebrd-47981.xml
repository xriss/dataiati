  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">On 24 November 2016, the Bank signed a project with the City of Amman to  finance priority solid waste investments in Amman (the &quot;Project&quot;). The  financing is structured in two tranches:     * Tranche I, consisting of JOD 40 million, committed at signing and used to  refinance GAM&apos;s existing debt to release funds for a comprehensive solid waste  crisis response programme. Tranche 1 is co-financed by a GBP 5 million  investment grant by an international donor for urgently needed solid waste  investments.   * Tranche II, consisting of up to EUR 50 million loan from EBRD, remains  uncommitted and will finance a series of investments aimed at addressing the  City&apos;s urgent solid waste needs. Tranche II components are expected to be  co-financed by capex grants of up to 50 per cent, provided by international  donor(s) and the Bank through its Shareholder Special Fund (&quot;SSF&quot;). To date  (June 2020 update), the Bank has financed 5 sub-projects under this Tranche as  follows:   * Tranche II-A:  signed on 10 May 2017, for the construction of a fifth cell  at Al-Ghabawi Landfill and its associated leachate lagoons. The component is  financed by a JOD 3.25 million EBRD loan and a GBP 4.25 investment grant.   * Tranche II-B: signed on 9 May 2018, to finance the purchases of 75  compactors and other equipment to be used by GAM in solid waste operations. The  component is financed by a JOD 9.9 million EBRD loan and two investment grants  of GBP 5.63 million and USD 7.4 million respectively.   * Tranche II-C: signed on 29 November 2018, to finance the capping of cell 4  wells, drilling and installation of the Landfill Gas Recovery (&quot;LFG&quot;)  collection system, and connecting it to the existing LFG system for cells 1,2  and 3. This component is financed by a JOD 3.2 million EBRD loan and a EUR 3.8  million grant.   * Tranche II-D: signed on 19 December 2019 , to finance the upgrade and  rehabilitation of Al-Shaer waste transfer station. This component is financed  by a JOD 2.5 million EBRD loan and a grant of USD 3.5 million   * Tranche II-E: signed on 19 December 2019 , to finance the purchase of 25  sweeper vehicles for use in solid waste operations in Amman. This component is  financed by a JOD 2.4 million and a grant of EUR 3.0 million. In addition, in  the solid waste sector, EBRD provided GAM a USD 13 million sovereign-guaranteed  loan in 2015 to finance the construction of a landfill gas recovery system at  the Al-Ghabawi landfill site under a design, build and operate contract. The  loan was co-financed by an up to USD 5 million loan funded by the Green Energy  Special Fund (&quot;GESF&quot;) administered by the EBRD.</narrative>
