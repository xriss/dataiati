   <narrative xml:lang="EN">MR3: GAM Solid Waste Crisis Response - Cell 6</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">On 24 November 2016, the Bank signed a project with the City of Amman to  finance priority solid waste investments in Amman (the &quot;Project&quot;). The  financing is structured in two tranches:     * Tranche I, consisting of JOD 40 million, committed at signing and used to  refinance GAM&apos;s existing debt to release funds for a comprehensive solid waste  crisis response programme. Tranche 1 is co-financed by a GBP 5 million  investment grant by an international donor for urgently needed solid waste  investments.   * Tranche II, consisting of up to EUR 50 million loan from EBRD, remains  uncommitted and will finance a series of investments aimed at addressing the  City&apos;s urgent solid waste needs. Tranche II components are expected to be  co-financed by capex grants of up to 50 per cent, provided by international  donor(s) and the Bank through its Shareholder Special Fund (&quot;SSF&quot;). To date  (June 2020 update), the Bank has financed 5 sub-projects under this Tranche as  follows:   * Tranche II-A:  signed on 10 May 2017, for the construction of a fifth cell  at Al-Ghabawi Landfill and its associated leachate lagoons. The component is  financed by a JOD 3.25 million EBRD loan and a GBP 4.25 investment grant.   * Tranche II-B: signed on 9 May 2018, to finance the purchases of 75  compactors and other equipment to be used by GAM in solid waste operations. The  component is financed by a JOD 9.9 million EBRD loan and two investment grants  of GBP 5.63 million and USD 7.4 million respectively.   * Tranche II-C: signed on 29 November 2018, to finance the capping of cell 4  wells, drilling and installation of the Landfill Gas Recovery (&quot;LFG&quot;)  collection system, and connecting it to the existing LFG system for cells 1,2  and 3. This component is financed by a JOD 3.2 million EBRD loan and a EUR 3.8  million grant.   * Tranche II-D: signed on 19 December 2019 , to finance the upgrade and  rehabilitation of Al-Shaer waste transfer station. This component is financed  by a JOD 2.5 million EBRD loan and a grant of USD 3.5 million   * Tranche II-E: signed on 19 December 2019 , to finance the purchase of 25  sweeper vehicles for use in solid waste operations in Amman. This component is  financed by a JOD 2.4 million and a grant of EUR 3.0 million. The Bank is now  looking to sign Tranche II-F, which involves financing the construction of Cell  number 6 at Al-Ghabawi landfill and the supply and installation of a new gas  turbine, which will be connected to the existing landfill gas recovery system  at the landfill.  The Project will be financed by an EBRD loan of JOD 7.9  million accompanied by a EUR 5.0 million grant from the European Union.</narrative>
