   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Project impact
Economy-wide: The Project&apos;s contribution to value addition and both direct and indirect employment will be estimated using IFC&apos;s sector multipliers. The Project is expected to create between 200 and 250 jobs. 

Stakeholders (employee skills): The Project will support the continuous development of technical skills and the development of industry-relevant skills and adoption of superior production techniques, which will lead to an improvement of the human capital in these countries.

Environment: The Project includes several climate related components, including installation of solar panels on the Company&apos;s facility in Morocco as well as plastic recycling through Dolicen, its new subsidiary. 

Market impact
Competitiveness: The Project is expected to have meaningful impact in market-level dimension of
competitiveness (i.e. through demonstration and replication effects, as other players are considering investing in the automotive sector in Morocco). It will also promote the competitiveness of other related manufacturing sectors (e.g. automotive) which use the Company&apos;s output as their intermediary products. The plastic recycling plant (Dolicen) is a commercial approach to manufacturing that can be replicated by other players in Morocco. Installing solar panels may also set a beneficial environmental precedent in the market.</narrative>
