    <narrative xml:lang="EN">Despite experiencing the most severe Ebola Virus disease outbreak ever recorded, Sierra Leone has made significant gains in consolidating peace, promoting democracy at local and national levels, encouraging economic growth and facilitating overall engagement in development processes. Nevertheless, Sierra Leone continues to grapple with serious development challenges, such as entrenched corruption, weak governmental institutions, high unemployment, slow economic growth and inadequate social services, including water and electricity. U.S. assistance will improve the daily lives of Sierra Leoneans through strategic investments in agriculture and health services, including farmer training, nutrition programs and policy reform. U.S. assistance will also target civil society and media programming, security sector reform, and rule of law programs. The U.S. government will accomplish these goals through close collaboration with the Government of Sierra Leone (GOSL), other donors, local non-governmental organizations, and the private sector.</narrative>
