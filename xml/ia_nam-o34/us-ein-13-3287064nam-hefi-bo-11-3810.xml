   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Developing Food Systems for Small Farmer and Indigenous Families in the Bolivian Amazon (Oriente)</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Over the last several years, Heifer International Bolivia has been building strategic alliances with rural and indigenous organizations to implement projects oriented toward building sustainable livelihoods and food systems; creating a collaborative network supporting clean agricultural production; increasing access to and control over natural resources; increasing access to and interaction with markets; facilitating organization-building; shaping public policy; and improving gender equity. 

Indigenous and rural families in Bolivia&#x2019;s &#x201C;Oriente&#x201D; (eastern region), in coordination with Heifer Bolivia and other strategic allies have identified concrete problems affecting their food security and livelihoods. These problems are vulnerability to production systems; weak leadership in rural and indigenous organizations, limiting their ability to address new food security and climate change challenges; and lack of effective public policies assuring food security and adaptation to climate change. Heifer Bolivia and its partners will implement the Developing Food Systems for Small Farmer and Indigenous Families in the Bolivian Amazon (Oriente) Project to help address these issues.

Rural and indigenous communities in the Amazon-Chiquitana eco-regions, in the provinces of Velasco, Mojos, M Marb&#xE1;n, Cercado, Vaca Diez and Ballivian in the departments of Santa Cruz and Beni, respectively, are highly vulnerable to the effects of climate change on agricultural production, as well as on socio-cultural and environmental systems. Droughts, floods, changing agricultural patterns, and other effects of climate change distress agricultural and environmental resources. As a result, the food sources are compromised, exacerbating poverty and hunger for these communities. In the last few years, rural and indigenous people have begun to claim their individual and collective rights regarding access to land, natural resources and local power. These reclaimed responsibilities challenge them to develop integrated resource management strategies that will help advance their food security and sovereignty amidst the effects of climate change. Unfortunately, as stated above, limited organizational capacity hinders their ability to develop the necessary plans, proposals and other tools that will allow for the sustainable development of these communities.

This project will develop mechanisms to structurally address the causes of the above-mentioned problems and achieve the objective of improving sustainable food systems of indigenous and rural families by strengthening economic agricultural production and socio-organizational and advocacy capacities. The project will work with 2,783 families, of which 1,480 will receive original resources. The remaining 1,303 families will receive resources through Heifer&#x2019;s Pass on the Gift (POG) model. Through POG, original families share the offspring of animals or other resources received, including training, with another family in the project. 

Participating families live in the departments of Beni and Santa Cruz. By the end of the project, 2,783 indigenous and rural families will have diversified their food supply sources and increase their income generation by 20 percent, using 70 percent of their produce for family consumption. They will implement 1,484 acres of agroforestry systems (including 988 acres of wild cacao), 31 modules of hair sheep, 600 family units of hens and eight modules of fish (with additional support to 10 modules of fish previously distributed). Training will be provided in natural resource management, food security, climate change awareness and adaptation, new and ancestral farming technologies, and transformation and marketing. Seventy-one indigenous and rural communities will establish transparent and accountable systems, establish internal democratic mechanisms and have improved ability to represent their interest, allowing them to promote their food security agendas. Five indigenous and rural umbrella-community organizations will facilitate the adoption (at the municipal and departmental government levels) of public policy on food security and sovereignty and climate change adaptation.</narrative>
