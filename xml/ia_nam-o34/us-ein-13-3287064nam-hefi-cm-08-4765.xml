   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Sustainable Livelihoods from Integrated Livestock Farming in the Far North Province of Cameroon</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project will seek to reduce poverty in the Far North province of Cameroon by improving the farmers&apos; productivity in livestock and crop farming and establish viable marketing avenues for income generation. It is also expected that the levels of hunger will reduce by improving nutrition through the availability and affordability of protein in the diets of project beneficiaries. The five year project will benefit a total of 1270 farm families of 10160 people who are members of 30 Common Initiative Groups (CIGs). Within the target communities 195 farm families will be assisted every year for the first three years of project implementation. By the end of the fifth year the project will be working with 1270 families. The original placement of livestock will include 700 pigs and 1740 sheep. The 700 pigs will be distributed as follows: 100 families will receive 400 pigs (4 each) to engage in pig fattening for marketing and another 100 families will receive 300 pigs (3 each- 2 gilts and 1 boar) to engage in breeding. 1740 mature sheep will be distributed to 435 families (4 per family). All the original placement farm families will in turn pass on to the same number of families. In order to reduce drudgery in farming 339 families will receive one donkey each and the cost of each donkey will be repaid into the group revolving fund rather passed-on to enable them buy donkeys for the remaining group members. The expansion of the Heifer program into the Far North was first conceptualized in 2003 when the current strategic plan was written. It was determined at the time that in order for Heifer Cameroon to make real impact throughout the country it was imperative to work in the area that houses 40% of the country&apos;s population and the bulk of the nation&apos;s poverty. Sahelian in ecology the Far north poses a new challenge to Heifer Cameroon because of its geography and socio-ecological as well as cultural context. The Project will enable project partners to improve their organizational capacity and gender relations improve productivity of crops and livestock improve access to potable water for human and animal use improve storage techniques processing and marketing of products improve sustainable interaction with the environment enhance household food security and generate supplemental income. It will improve gender relations and mitigate the effects of HIV &amp;amp; AIDS at household and community levels in partnership with existing projects by providing training the gift of livestock and building capacities in project beneficiaries to improve their productivity and sustain the project&apos;s benefits beyond the active funded life of the project. The project participants will provide land labor and on-farm construction materials. Each beneficiary farm family will contribute 40% costs of agricultural supplies into the revolving fund of their respective groups to enhance its financial sustainability after external funding has ended. It is expected that through the POG approach more resource-limited families and community members will increase their food production and improve their security thereby contributing to the success of the Poverty Reduction Strategy of the Government of Cameroon for this area.</narrative>
