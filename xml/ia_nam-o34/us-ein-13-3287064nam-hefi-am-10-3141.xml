   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project is the second phase of the Beekeeping to Support Education Project. Within the framework of the first phase of the project, more than 110 families have benefitted from their involvement, which helped participant families increase their income and be able to pay for their children&#x2019;s education. The project participant families received beehives and established small bee farms. They have sold the produced honey, and the revenue was used to pay the tuition and fees of their children enrolled in Giteliq University. After the interim evaluation of the project&#x2019;s impact, Giteliq University proposed to Heifer Armenia the second phase of the project. The goal of this second phase is to support rural families in the Yeghegis, Getap and Agarakadzor communities of Vayots Dzor. Participants will be families who already have children enrolled or who have children planning to receive higher education during the project period, and the project will help insure a source of sustainable income that will allow a total of 150 resource-poor families&#x2014;both original and Pass on the Gift (POG)&#x2014;to pay the tuition and fees for their children. The project will also improve the nutrition of participating families. To achieve these goals, the university will provide the project with 250 bee families. In the spring of 2011, 50 families will receive 250 beehives and will establish small bee farms. The income from the production of honey will be directed to pay for the education fees of project participant students. Two cycles of POG (every two years) are planned for the lifetime of the project, which will add 100 new families to the project. The project will also serve as an educational center for rural youth/students to acquire hands-on knowledge and experience in beekeeping and honey production. The other students of the university will be actively involved in the regular activities of this project.</narrative>
