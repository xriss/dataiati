   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project &#x201C;Sustainable Livestock Development Project&#x201D; (SLDP) will be implemented in 20 villages of Kishangarh Bas Block of Alwar District, Rajasthan of India within Heifer India&#x2019;s program framework. 
Agriculture and animal husbandry are the main economic activities in the area. With high probability of drought and 60% of the working population dependent on agriculture, households are quite vulnerable. 
The condition of women is very precarious. Literacy levels are low. Women have limited access to income, health and other necessary services. They have poor status in family and society. Through this project the women will be organized into SHGs and given more opportunities for growth. It will build their capacity to participate and become owners in the socio-economic development process. Participating families will achieve sustainable livelihoods through joining Producer company/cooperative and participating in the goat and dairy value chains.  

This project will support 2,400 families (600 Original families and 1,800 exponential POG families.  The women will be organized into 160 SHGs with 15 members each. These groups will be engaged in savings of about $0.5 to $ 1.5 every month by every member. The groups will adopt all the good group management practices, like regular monthly meetings, regular saving and credit systems. In this project 550 OG families will receive goats (one through project and another through local leverage and another 150 families (OG and POG) will receive buffaloes through local sources. As supplementary income source the project participants will be provided with vegetable seeds, seedlings, fodder seeds and saplings. This project will also concentrate on providing trainings to the participants to improve their skills and knowledge. All the groups (OG and POGs) members will be given trainings on Heifer&apos;s Cornerstones, SHG management, Improved Animal Management, Gender Sensitization, Community Based Disaster Risk Reduction(CBDRR), Nutrition and Hygiene, Producer company/cooperative management, Kitchen Gardening and Fodder Production.

All the project families will be organized into community based institutions such as SHGs, Producer company/cooperative. There will be a business hub which will act as center for business transactions and strengthening farmers&#x2019; position in the value chain. These business hub will facilitate goat selling and other products to the market. Dairy families (150 families) will be linked with existing milk collection centers.</narrative>
