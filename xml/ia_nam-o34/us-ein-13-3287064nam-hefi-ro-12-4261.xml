   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The dairy cattle provided through the project will have higher productivity that will allow farmers to have enough milk for both family consumption and to sell the surplus. The extra income will allow families to purchase and consume more meat and vegetables, balancing their nutrition. All families involved have basic knowledge of milk processing. Women will be self-employed as they are traditionally considered to be in charge of milking and making the dairy products. The women will have a secure job in their own household bringing a contribution to the family&#x2019;s income and stability (an important element in a country that has had to deal with the negative consequences of emigration, which has had a significant impact on women who are often left behind to support large families).</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Widows, physically challenged, unemployed women, mothers with many children or single mothers will have priority for the distribution of heifers. Also wives, together with their husbands, will sign the contract for receiving the gift of livestock and will be encouraged to take decisions jointly. Through the Cornerstones training, a special emphasis will be given to gender equity and full participation. Women will be encouraged to attend the meetings and become actively involved in the life of the project. 

The basis of this initiative is the dairy cow, which will provide women with an occupation. Attending specialized training sessions, they will acquire know-how and competence. Their professional development and self-esteem will be strengthened, gaining respect and position within the community.

The lives of women will be easier as each participant family will receive milking equipment. The families will not have to work the land by hand anymore, as the group of producers will be equipped with the necessary agricultural machines to produce nutritious fodder for the animals. The workload will be significantly reduced, women will have more free time, and the quality of life will be improved through the project. The modern equipment will ease the work but also increase the income level (high quality and increased quantity of milk) so families and women will have better living conditions with modern commodities.</narrative>
