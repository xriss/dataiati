  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">There are two groups of beneficiaries for this project: farmers and orphaned children. Small farmers will receive Irish Friesian heifers. In addition to passing on the first female offspring, the farmers will also donate milk to orphan children. The project will serve children from orphanages located in the Central and Western part of Romania. Through Pass On Gift, every year more farmers will receive a dairy Friesian heifer. Coordinating the delivery of dairy products, Heifer Romania will bridge the two target groups. The project expects to feed more than 5,000 children.

A total of 140 Friesian cows will be airlifted by Bothar Ireland, 70 cows per year, during a two-year period. Through the project, high quality livestock and training will be provided to farmers in order to improve their nutrition, increase their income and improve local livestock.

The targeted communities are located in the hilly region near Cluj. About 60 percent of the families do not have consistent income. They are trying to establish small-scale private farming in order to earn their living. They are all accustomed to growing both grains and animals. The farms are small and livestock are mixed-breed. Some families have a horse used for transportation and for working the farmland. Similar to many other Romanian farms, cows are grazed on community pastures. The Irish Friesian breed is appropriate for the Transylvanian plateau because the cows have a dual purpose - milk and beef. By raising this type of cattle the pastures will be efficiently maintained with grazing being semi-intensive. The farmers are very interested in purebred cows and have committed to modernize their farm management and practices.

One hundred heifers will be distributed to small farmers in the hilly region near Cluj, Transylvania. The families that receive a heifer will Pass On the Gift (POG) of the first female offspring to another impoverished family along with 79 gallons of milk to the orphaned children. Each year more than 1,000 children will benefit from farmers&#x2019; milk donations.

Through this project, urban orphanages will receive milk and other fresh dairy products, collected and processed by the Animal Breeders Association in Corus, one of Heifer Romania&#x2019;s most reliable project partners. This association owns a small dairy processing plant, built and equipped with support from Heifer and will provide milk, yogurt, sour cream, and cottage cheese to orphanages and institutions for disabled children.</narrative>
