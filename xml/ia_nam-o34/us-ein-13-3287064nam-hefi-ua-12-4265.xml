   <narrative xml:lang="EN">For many areas in Western Ukraine strawberry production is the traditional business; in fact micro-farms produce around 50 percent of the country&#x2019;s strawberries. The main problems faced by rural farmers are marketing their crop yield and their limited knowledge about or lack of funds regarding modern farming technologies. The Strawberries Communities development project &#x201C;Ecofruit&#x201D; hopes to tackle these issues and take advantage of the opportunities for this type of farming, such as the favorable climate and soil conditions and the high demand for strawberries both on the fresh market and in processing. Currently, Ukraine produces 25-30 percent less than what the country consumes, with the rest imported. There are many challenges currently facing strawberry farmers in Ukraine. Some examples are, the current production practices are outdated, no irrigation system, growing the wrong varieties for the climate zone, fungal diseases, lack of skilled workers, low quality, unstable crops, and no strategy for future development. Once smallholders learn how to optimize the cultivation of the berries and find stable channels for selling, they can increase their strawberry production and, therefore, increase incomes. This project will help organize a cooperative to share equipment, access to technologies, and to organize joint selling of berries in bulk quantities.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project will provide 150 rural families, members of &#x201C;LosiatynskeMolochneDzerelo&#x201D; cooperative (an already existing agricultural cooperative), with high-quality strawberry frigo seedlings, drop irrigation system and all other necessary equipment for production, storage and transporting. Italian experts from &#x201C;New Fruit&#x201D; company will provide agronomical support of the project. Project partner AgroFruticaByshkiv will train cooperative members in best practices, including a demo-field.

After collections, the strawberries will be delivered to the processing plant for deep freezing and distribution among Danone production facilities. The cooperative&#x2019;s income will be distributed among its members (project participants)and added to a special account to ensure the Passing on the Gift(POG) and to attract more families to the project. An additional 100 families will benefit from receiving high-quality strawberry seedlings, selling their products through the co-op, receiving co-op services and trainings. The project will have significant social impact because it will positively influence the critical problem of unemployment in Ternopil Oblast.</narrative>
