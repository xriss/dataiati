  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Heifer India and its local NGO partner, URMUL-Setu, will work together to assist poor households in the Bikaner District of Rajasthan through applying Heifer&apos;s Values-Based Holistic Community Development (VBHCD) model.  Participants will be women in clusters of poor communities who are interested and committed in taking the initiative to improve their lives.  The project area is one of the poorest districts in Rajasthan, also  one of the poorest states in India.
The project aims to work toward the empowerment of women of scheduled castes, scheduled tribes, and other minorities who as a whole are very poor with low literacy levels, limited access to income, health and other necessary services.  They have poor status in the family or in society.  Through this project, women will be organized into Self-Help Groups (SHGs) and given opportunities for growth and for building their capacity to build social capital, participate in and become owners of the socioeconomic development process.  By the end of the project, 350 original and 700 pass-on families will have achieved sustainable income to bring them above the poverty line; increased solidarity and harmony within the community with empowerment to access other development programs; improved nutrition and increased hygiene and sanitation; and adoption of environment-friendly practices.
The project area has one of the highest rates of children&apos;s malnutrition in the whole country.  Specific trainings on nutrition, hygiene and sanitation will be provided and reinforced through the quarterly project self-review and planning (PSRP) by SHG members.  Through promotion of kitchen gardening, the participants will learn to grow and consume diverse, nutrient-dense vegetables.
To ensure successful livestock enterprise, participants will be trained in improved animal management and have the opportunity to learn through Farmers Field Schools.  Community Animal Health Workers will be trained and provide support to the families and supplement government services.</narrative>
