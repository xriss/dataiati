  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">&#x201C;Bihar Socio-Economic Development Project&#x201D; (BSED) will be implemented in 5 districts of Bihar: Samastipur, Vaishali, Dharbhanga, Madhubani and Purnia within Heifer India&#x2019;s program framework. 

Bihar is one of the poorest states of India and also ranks among the slowest growing regions of the country. The slow growth of the state along with the demographic pressure has led to its economic retrogression&#x2014;the per capita income not only stagnated during the 1990s but actually showed a decline during some of the years. Bihar&#x2019;s per capita income, which was approximately 60% of the Indian average during the 1960s, declined to approximately 40% in 1993-94, and further to about 30% during 2003-04.
Through this project the women will be organized into SHGs and given more opportunities for growth. It will build their capacity to participate and become owners in the socio-economic development process. Participating families will achieve sustainable livelihoods through joining Producer company/cooperative and participating in the goat and dairy value chains.  

This project will support 24,000 families (4,000 Original families and 20,000 exponential POG families.  The women will be organized into 1,533 SHGs (200 OG with 20 members each and 1,333 POGs with 15 members on an average). These groups will be engaged in savings of about $0.5 to $ 1.5 every month by every member. The groups will adopt all the good group management practices, like regular monthly meetings, regular saving and credit systems. 

In this project 4,000 OG families will receive goats (1 goat from Heifer and 2 through local resource leverage); 30% of POG families will receive 2 breeding does through local resource leverage. This project will be implemented by dedicated local NGO partners, who already have presence in these districts. The project will link up with Government or other agencies for support and services. 

As supplementary income source the project participants will be provided with vegetable seeds, seedlings, fodder seeds and saplings. This project will also concentrate on providing trainings to the participants to improve their skills and knowledge. All the groups ( OG and POGs)  members will be given trainings on Heifer&apos;s Cornerstones, SHG management, Improved Animal Management, Gender Sensitization, Community Based Disaster Risk Reduction(CBDRR), Nutrition and Hygiene, Producer company/cooperative management, Kitchen Gardening and Fodder Production.

All the project families will be organized into community based institutions such as SHGs, Producer company/cooperative. There will be 5 business hubs which will act as centers for business transactions and strengthening farmers&#x2019; position in the value chain. These business hubs will facilitate goat selling and other products to the market.</narrative>
