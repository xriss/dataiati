   <narrative xml:lang="EN">GANASOL 2: Sustainable Agriculture and Livestock on Hillsides in Lempira in Honduras</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This five year project is a partnership between HEIFER International (Guatemala and Honduras branch Offices) with the Association of Organizations of the Cuchumatanes (ASOCUCH) in Huehuetenango Guatemala and with the Rural Reconstruction Program (PRR) and the Beans Research Project of the Pan-American Agricultural School - El Zamorano both in Honduras. GANASOL 2 overall goal is to contribute to reduce poverty hunger and vulnerability of 1331 rural families living in the altiplano high plateau by recovering and conserving genetic resources (basic grains and potatoes) and sustainably growing foods in the middle highlands in Guatemala and Honduras. The project&apos;s specific objectives are: 1) Increase the resiliency to climate change by implementing agroecological practices and conservation of agro diversity 2) Strengthen food security through diversification by recovering conserving and strengthening the zone&apos;s genetic resources (corn beans manioc yams potatoes bananas etc. that will significantly decrease dependence on external seeds and adapted to the zone permanently. In addition families will increase their capacities in the production of plant and animal species (sheep for wool dual-purpose poultry) that will contribute to diversify the family diet and serve as an additional income from selling surplus production; and 3) Strengthen social capital of the producer organizations in Honduras and Guatemala to promote agrobiodiversity food security and organizational sustainability. The project will be located in the municipalities of San Andr&#xE9;s and Santa Cruz where the main livelihoods are basic grains (corns and beans) and small livestock. Meanwhile in Guatemala&apos;s highland region in the Cuchumatanes located at 2 500 masl the basic staple in people&apos;s diet is potatoes rather than corn. On the Cuchumatanes plateau for several generations the people have produced potatoes and sheep. This is their only livelihood and they face adversities including extreme climate conditions: killing frost drought changing rainfall patterns and hail. Farmers using this production system (sheep + potatoes + forestry) number about 4 270 families. The grazing area on the highlands plateau of the Cuchumatanes is quite large 78 000 hectares but threatens to encroach on the forest. In addition in both countries access to foods has been affected by decreasing purchasing power lack of employment and low wages. Heifer along with PRR Zamorano and ASOCUCH are bringing together their expertise in the GANASOL 2 Project. Heifer in its work in Central America knows the territories local partners as well as the municipal government authorities and community leaders. In addition Heifer has a vast experience in food security through family agriculture and livestock production with agroecological focus natural resources management and values-based development emphasizing the Passing-on-the-Gift and Gender equity. In Guatemala the producer organizations (associations and cooperatives) will be consolidated by setting up Biodiversity Management and Conservation Committees (CDMs) which will belong to the seven grassroots organizations of ASOCUCH who will promote the gender approach and adequate management of the environment and natural resources in the project&apos;s territory of intervention. ASOCUCH has broad experience in production to counteract the food deficit and develop the production system (potatoes+sheep+forestry) promoting the access and participation to men and women to make it more efficient to improve food availability and generate economic income to enhance access to foods by organizing sales of potatoes and sheep to supply the local market. ASOCUCH will implement and provide technical advisory assistance with ample experience in Conserving and Developing Agro biodiversity and create six corn seed banks with seeds available to begin the process of dissemination to increase production on farmers&apos; fields. In Honduras community organizations will be reinforced through the Local Agricultural Research Committees (CIALs) using the methodology developed by the Participatory Research Project (IPRA) by CIAT applying an 8-step methodology. During GANASOL 2 the Association of 15 CIALs in Lempira (ASOCIALEM) will be strengthened. The Rural Reconstruction Program (PRR) will be the Technical Advisor in this component due to its experience in basic grain production forming CIALs as a strategy in methodological management and conservation of agro biodiversity. They also have a strategic partner the Zamorano&apos;s Bean Research Project which has generated over 15 varieties of beans validated in the field under different agro climatic and soil conditions with educational and research leadership.</narrative>
