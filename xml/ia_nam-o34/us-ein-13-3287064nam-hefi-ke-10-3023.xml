   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Pastoralist Integrated Livestock Project (PILP) will improve the livelihoods of 600 families in Nyiro Division, Samburu District of Northern Kenya. The project will assist 300 resource-poor, women-headed families in nine self help groups through training and placement of 310 camels (one camel per family and one male camel per 30 placed female camels) and 4,500 local chicken and 300 cockerels (15 chicken and one cockerel per family).  These families will each pass on one camel, 15 local chickens, one cockerel and knowledge to another 300 families belonging to other groups. The group members and their families will receive training in camel husbandry and poultry management prior to receiving their livestock. Due to high illiteracy rates, the women will undergo adult literacy classes to facilitate adoption of technology. Because the project location is in an arid and semi-arid area, environment conservation awareness training and enforcement will be an integral part of the project. The most important component of environmental training will be water harvesting and management.  After animal placement, families will receive veterinary services on a regular basis. To ensure the availability of animal health services, 24 Community Animal Workers (CAHWs) will be identified, trained and equipped to provide animal health and environmental care extension services to the community in the nine project locations including the camel umbrella expansion project area in Ngurunit, Ilaut and Arsim. They will be provided with start up capital to purchase basic veterinary equipments and drugs under a revolving fund system. PEAR Innovations and Heifer Kenya will jointly operate the revolving funds account. The money will be used in the future as a financial boost during prolonged drought conditions.
Ultimately, through participation in this project, women will be empowered to have a greater positive impact in their households and communities leading to improved livelihoods and poverty alleviation through training and food and income generation from the productive resources.Ultimately, through participation in this project, women will be empowered to have a greater positive impact in their households and communities leading to improved livelihoods and poverty alleviation through training and food and income generation from the productive resources.</narrative>
