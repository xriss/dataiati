   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The goal of the Integrated Livestock and Agro-forestry (ILAF) Project is to mitigate environmental degradation in five chiefdoms, namely Maforki, Tainkatopa Makama  Safroko (TMS), Bureh Kasseh Makonteh (BKM), Marampa and Sanda Magbolonton, in Port Loko district by providing 1,800 farm families with alternative means of improving their livelihoods. The targeted families of this project are low income smallholder farmers, upland farm families, charcoal burners, wood cutters and hunters in predominantly savanna ecologies. The project will provide 24,000 cashew seedlings and 24,000 pre-germinated cashew seeds to 400 farm families in 20 groups at 60 seedlings (1 acre) per family. The International Institute for Tropical Agriculture (IITA) is providing gifts in kind in the form of 12,800 bundles of cassava cuttings to be distributed at 32 bundles per family to project families.  Cultivation of cassava which serves as both food and cash crop is very common in the district as it serves as a means of providing quick income for families while awaiting the maturation of the cashew nuts. For this reason, the project seeks to establish two cassava processing schemes in two of the five participating chiefdoms.  Cashew starts fruiting in three years and provides a long lasting source of income. Both crops (cassava and cashew) thrive well in the district and will generate higher yields with good management practices such as the application of manure.  As goats are the preferred livestock for the families, the project will place 1,600 goats at 4 per family (1 male and 3 female). Training in crops production and livestock husbandry practices, drugs and veterinary support services, sound agro forestry practices will also be provided. A large number of households in Port Loko district rely solely on farming for their livelihoods. But increasing environmental degradation over the years has been undermining the utilization of the full potential of arable land. These environmental threats impact heavily on rural livelihoods, food security and health, while exacerbating natural disasters such as floods and droughts. Integrating environmental concerns into livelihood enhancement initiatives is therefore a priority for any development intervention in Port Loko district. In addition to the integration of cashew trees and cassava cuttings, ILAF will seek to establish 10 hectares of fast growing trees in the communities where the cassava processing schemes will be operating. These trees will be harvested to provide fuel wood for the running of the processing equipment.In addition to the 400 original farm families, 1,400 additional families will benefit from pass ons over the five year period.  On the whole, 1,800 families will be assisted through this project during the five year period of implementation; an estimated total of 14,400 individuals (at an average family size of 8).</narrative>
