  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Copperbelt Rural Livelihood Enhancement Support Project (CRLESP), which is fully funded by Elanco, will serve the Masaiti, Luanshya, Kalulushi and Mpongwe districts in the Copperbelt Province of Zambia. The goal of CRLESP is to enable vulnerable rural farm families in the region to enhance and secure their livelihoods through integrated agriculture, promotion of health and enterprise development. Specifically, the project will address poor household food security caused by low agricultural productivity; poor nutrition, especially in children; limited ability of resource-poor families to own livestock; limited capacity of local agricultural and veterinary extensions to engage in outreach; poor health, hygiene and sanitation practices; inadequate capacity of official health and social services to engage in outreach; high levels of deforestation; and poor marketing structures. The high incidence of HIV/AIDS in these communities has also resulted in many households becoming more food insecure at a time when people require good nutrition, particularly high-quality protein.CRLESP will directly benefit a total of 37,260 individuals within 6,210 direct project households (average of six people per family). From this total, 680 families will be assisted through the placement of food- and income-generating livestock and training in integrated livestock management. Further, 5,530 families will benefit from other community interventions such as environmental and HIV/AIDS mitigation and better hygiene and sanitation awareness. Trainings will include Heifer&#x2019;s 12 Cornerstones, animal husbandry and health, gender equity issues and group organizational capacity. The project will implement integrated agriculture practices and vegetable gardens to improve nutrition among vulnerable groups such as children and people living with HIV/AIDS. Improved delivery of community-based animal health services will improve livestock health and productivity, thus safeguarding livelihoods. Linkages to viable markets and technical service providers will provide opportunities for the development of sustainable farming enterprises for the project members. Widespread use of energy efficient wood stoves in combination with agroecological farming practices will reduce deforestation in target areas. Further, the trainings and awareness-raising programs will significantly increase knowledge in HIV/AIDS mitigation and better health, hygiene and sanitation in all targeted communities.</narrative>
