   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project&#x2019;s main goal is to improve household nutrition and income of indigenous families in the Polochic river basin through the development of agroecological farming and sustainable management of natural resources. The project will assist 1,000 indigenous families with the following components: Conservation and restoration of natural resources, with emphasis on agroforestry systems and protection of water sources; food availability and utilization; and local economic development, using the model of community banks for women. This project involves men and women as heads of household who develop activities and will share the fruits of their labor with their families.

The strategy to strengthen conservation of biodiversity will be to establish agroforestry systems, integrating fruit trees, legumes, fodder bushes and pasture grasses that can improve soil fertility, pollination of crops and water quality, acting as carbon sinks and reducing erosion by water. The project will establish protection plans for nine water recharge zones and water sources identified as the most important. By the end of the project, 50 percent of the participating families will have water available to meet their basic needs. At least 595 acres will be under agroforestry production. The project will establish 1,000 family food gardens with diverse crops including basic grains, vegetables, fruits and bees to diversify families&#x2019; diets. Thirty-five families will engage in beekeeping, with inputs from the project. A total of 179 families will be trained to improve their poultry production (79 families with ducks and 100 with chickens). Field schools will be set up, as participatory learning is very successful in increasing availability of food in communities. Sixty promoters from 30 communities will be trained in animal husbandry, agriculture and agroecology. Increasing family income generation will be done through 20 organized women&#x2019;s groups by providing them with micro-loans. They will sell hone and other bee products, as well as agricultural surpluses. They will receive technical assistance to formalize small and medium enterprises.</narrative>
