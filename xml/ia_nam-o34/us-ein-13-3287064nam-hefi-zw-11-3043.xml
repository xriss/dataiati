   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Heifer Zimbabwe has implemented the Hope for the San People Project in the Bulilima District since June 2005. The focus of the project has been the integration of the nomadic minority hunter-gatherer San people into mainstream community life. The aim of the project is to improve the living conditions of the San people through diversification of their survival strategy by integrating them into livestock farming and vegetable gardening. This project is coming to an end in June 2011. However, due to the continued poverty in the community and the difficult socioeconomic circumstances in the entire country in the last couple of years, there were a number of hurdles in implementing the project, resulting in limited achievement of the project&#x2019;s objectives. Funds for livestock purchases were eroded by the hyper-inflationary environment that prevailed in Zimbabwe in the last decade, thus Heifer was unable to place all of the livestock as planned.Phase II of the Hope for the San People Project will target 200 original and 400 Pass on the Gift (POG) families, which will be organized in groups of 20 people. Four orginal groups of 20 people will receive 800 poultry, four original groups of 20 people will receive 400 goats, and two original groups of 20 people will receive 80 heifers and six bulls. The project will also support nutrition gardens. Two nutrition gardens that were already established by Heifer will be equipped with a borehole each. Another four nutrition gardens will be established and equipped with a borehole in the first project year, with an average of 80 families benefitting from each garden. Beneficiaries of the four gardens will receive starter packages with vegetable seeds for two years.</narrative>
