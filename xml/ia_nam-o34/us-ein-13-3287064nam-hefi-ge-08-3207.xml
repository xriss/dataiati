   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Kanobi village is located 20 km from the Russian border in Northern Georgia. For generations, agriculture has been the main source of income for this mountainous region, but its isolation, harsh climate and infertile land have made it difficult for people to make a decent living. For years, the nearest job market was located across the border in the Russian town of Vladikavkaz. As a result of the hostile political situation between Georgia and the Russian Federation in August 2008, the border was closed. Consequently, unemployment and poverty rates increased. This project, with the assistance of Heifer Georgia, will increase food production, improve nutrition and self-reliance, as well as ensure food security for 70 resource-poor families in Kanobi. In the first two years of the project, Heifer will provide 30 families with 30 local mountainous breed dairy heifers. The 30 families will pass on the gift of the first-born female animal to 30 new families in the village. All families, including an additional 10 families in the community, will receive training in advanced farm and animal management, as well as technical assistance and veterinary medicine to establish and run their own small-scale dairy farms. While the focus of this project will be on the establishment of small-scale dairy farms, long-term goals include developing ecological and mountain tourism in the area and reducing the number of youth leaving the community.</narrative>
