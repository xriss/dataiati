   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Strengthening the economic sustainability of Ivankivtsi&apos;s rural households through the development of an efficient milk processing facility</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project aims to strengthen the economic sustainability of the Ivankovetskyi Svitanok Agricultural Service Cooperative (ASC) by implementing an efficient milk processing apparatus for use by poor farmers in Ivankivtsi, Ukraine. The project will be implemented by the ASC, an emerging private membership-based collective ownership enterprise, which manages the profits of its members. This is the first attempt for poor rural households to unite not only for milk collection and marketing, but also for processing raw milk into value-added products by the ASC. Project participants will establish a &#x201C;production-processing-marketing food chain&#x201D;, which meets all requirements of the World Trade Organization. By doing so, they will also create competitive conditions for rural households due to an increase in the purchasing price for raw milk, thereby stimulating the development of small and medium dairy farms. The 126 participating rural households&#x2014;63 original families and another 63 who will benefit from Passing on the Gift&#x2014;are expected to see profits improve by 25 percent due to the increased purchasing prices when milk processing starts. Additionally, due to an expected subsequent 15 percent decrease in the price of milk, this project will create opportunities to improve the nutrition of children, people with disabilities, retirees and orphans, who will enjoy sufficient amounts of high-quality dairy products.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">To resolve the issue of purchasing a milk processing unit to process raw milk locally, the cooperative has approached the State Administration of Kirovohrad oblast with a request for funding to purchase the &#x201C;Kolax K 1.3000.24&#x201D; modular dairy processing unit. After learning the results of the &#x201C;Ivankovetskyi Svitanok&#x201D; activities and studying the cooperative&#x2019;s business plan, the State Administration has agreed to provide co-financing in the amount of $50,000 to support the purchase of the &#x201C;Kolax&#x201D; modular dairy processing unit, in addition to the $60,000 requested from Heifer. 

Purchasing and setting the &#x201C;Kolax&#x201D; modular dairy processing equipment into operation will be a considerable support for the future development of the &#x201C;Ivankovetskyi Svitanok&#x201D; ASC and, consequently, will increase the incomes of its members by implementing the complete dairy food chain &#x201C;from production to processing to marketing&#x201D;. The &#x201C;Kolax&#x201D; dairy processing module (certified ISO 9001) will enable the cooperative to collect, process, and pack 3,000 kg of milk per shift and receive natural and environmentally friendly dairy products: pasteurized whole milk, normalized pasteurized whole milk, pasteurized creams, and sour cream. 

This modern equipment and innovative technology will result in production of competitive products. It is important to note that dairy products produced using such equipment are especially popular among consumers due to the fact that dairy products are processed without adding artificial preservatives and chemicals, many of which are harmful to human health.</narrative>
