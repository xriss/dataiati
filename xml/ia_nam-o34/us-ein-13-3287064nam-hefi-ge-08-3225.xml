   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project will provide assistance to families living in Tkviavi village, which was greatly affected by the August 2008 conflict between Georgia and Russia. Many of the families in the area are former internally displaced people who fled to the cities of Gori and Tbilisi at the height of the conflict. Since returning, many families found much of the livestock in the village was killed or stolen, and many of the houses were burned. There is a shortage of fodder and most of the area&#x2019;s orchards were destroyed. Due to the threat of active landmines, crops cannot be harvested. It will take several seasons to restore agriculture production. Livestock and dairy production is one of the few jobs that offers returning farmers the chance for economic and social security. By becoming involved in dairy production, participants will gain access to much-needed nutrients and pursue opportunities to earn money. Farmers will also re-enter the market through production and sale of cheese and other milk products. In the first year of the project, Heifer International will provide at least 150 families with 150 local breed Caucasian brown breed heifers. An additional 150 families will benefit from passing on the gift in the third year of the project. An additional 25 families in the community will benefit from participating in project trainings. In addition to providing training to all project participants, GRM International will set up a winter-feeding program for all recipients of cattle, as well as provide instruction and necessary equipment to produce, market and sell cheese.</narrative>
