   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Livelihoods for Young People Affected by Conflict in Pader District of Northern Uganda</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">&quot;The 4-year project &#x201C;Livelihoods for young people affected by conflict in Pader District of Northern Uganda&#x201D; proposes to alleviate the problem of lack of viable sources of income, skills, self esteem and an effective voice/influence towards development initiatives. It will also increase participation of the young people in development initiatives thereby reducing their vulnerability. The project targets 400 households of young people resident in Pader Town Council and the adnexia areas, as well as Kilak Sub County in Pader District.The project will build on past HPI success in the region and will demonstrate successful approaches to achieve sustainable livelihoods based upon crop and livestock production, focusing on the youth.  600 young people(below 30 years of age), 60% of whom shall be female, and 100 households with vulnerable children (600 people, 60% of whom shall be female) will benefit from stable incomes and food security by the project end, with more households each following year benefiting through community extension.  These &#x201C;young role models&#x2019;&#x201D; success will be promoted, building inclusion and confidence in young people and their capacity to advocate for their needs.   At least 400 families will have direct access to skills, information, group support and development, and participate in local development planning.  Their influence and participation in mainstream poverty reduction programmes and community institutions will lay the foundations of increased resilience to violence and crime. Furthermore it will serve as a firm deterrent to returning to conflict. The project will be implemented in partnership with VEDCO, a local NGO and funding will come from APT.
VEDCO will take the lead in project planning and implementation (including monitoring and evaluation, budget management, compliance to internal controls and accountability, and reporting).   VEDCO will focus on their strengths: building livelihoods capacities by developing the value chains for crops produced (including farmer to farmer extension services, improving technologies and management practices, collective marketing and savings and credit schemes); strengthening groups; incorporation of specific relevant issues (e.g. gender, fuel-saving, peace building); linking groups to other service providers and local institutions; and building young people&#x2019;s capacity to advocate for their rights and inclusion in mainstream poverty alleviation programmes and extension services.
In this project, 200 needy families will receive 220 original Boer goats (200 nannies and 20 bucks) and assorted improved food crop planting materials. An additional 200 needy families will benefit through the pass on the gift process by receiving 220 off spring Boer goats (200 POG nannies and 20 POG bucks). Furthermore, all original beneficiary families will be supplied with assorted improved high yielding, early maturing, drought and disease resistant food crop seeds/planting materials. Vegetable seeds such as; Cabbages, tomatoes, carrots, indigenous vegetables and fruit tree seedlings that mature early like paw paws and passion fruits will also be supplied. These will serve to supply essential nutrients and boost the immunity of the beneficiary families. At the same time the surplus will be sold to the community for additional income. Each of the 200 needy beneficiary families will receive one Boer nanny. 10 families will share one buck which again will be kept by one of them. The family keeping the buck will be expected to pass on a buck as well. Beneficiary families and their neighbours will be encouraged to buy indigenous nannies for crossbreeding with the Boer bucks. All participating families will be expected to plant and maintain at least 500 fodder trees (especially Calliandra) and 1,000 other multipurpose tree species compatible with the ecosystem. The fodder trees will perform the twin functions of improving soil fertility and providing nutritious feed for the goats. The multipurpose trees will provide fruits, firewood and poles for construction. In the final year of project implementation, families will be encouraged to diversify into apiary production to make use of the established calliandra flowers. 
All beneficiaries will receive related training in animal husbandry, environmental protection and sustainable use of natural resources. Other initiatives will include training on values based planning, HPI Cornerstones, Gender equity and family planning, HIV/AIDS awareness, organizational strengthening, cooperative bulking and marketing of surplus produce.    
Additionally 100 young women shall be identified and assisted to acquire vocational skills through attachments or apprenticeship training. After the training, the young women shall be facilitated with modest start up funds or equipment to enable then to set up small functional businesses. Those with employable skills shall be connected to employers to secure jobs. For this to happen, potential employers will be mobilized and sensitized before hand so that wherever possible the training of the young women is tailor made to suit the available labour demand. All young women interested in setting up small businesses shall be trained in entrepreneurship and business management to equip them with the vital business skills. All young people who set up small businesses or get into formal employment shall be expected to train others as a mechanism to fulfill their POG obligation.&quot;</narrative>
