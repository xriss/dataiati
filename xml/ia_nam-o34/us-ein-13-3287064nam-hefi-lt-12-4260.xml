   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Sheep meat and poultry from small scale farmers are very marketable. Consumers from cities are interested in such production and even come themselves to villages to buy it there. The price of such production is by 1/5 bigger than in regular food stores. There is a lack of sheep meet in Lithuanian market (LRT Panorama research, 2011). Lithuanian rural people lack marketing, communication, selling skills and this problem will be addressed through the training in this project.
Raspberries and strawberries are popular among large Manufacturers of jams in Lithuania. They have Berries Collection Points in whole Lithuania that can be used by project participants. As well project participants-families will be trained of preparing marketable product &#x2013; jams, dried fruits etc. (package, labeling etc.). They will be empowered to produce high quality production for cities&#x2019; markets.
Crafts training will serve to rural people to use sheep wool for a felting works, such production is very popular in Lithuania now, and most used channel of selling such crafts is internet.

Communities&#x2019; groups by participating in training, learning from each other and joint work will achieve cooperation in selling production in bigger markets (closest bigger cities &#x2013; that are spread equally in whole Lithuania).
Input of tangible gifts in this project will be used as material, to practice knowledge and skills that participants receive during training and education process that is critical in this project.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Ministry of Social Affairs and Labor of the Republic of Lithuania together with EC is funding actions for Diminishing social discrimination and integration to social life and labor market. Social isolation is very common for rural people and the biggest problems are the lack of motivation and social/labor skills. This lack forces people out of society, and hard drinking becomes a huge problem of families. Families lack money for food and children&#x2019;s education. Most of the target groups in village communities have small plots of land, but lack knowledge and initial investments of seeds and animals.

The project empowers people with little education (systematic education &#x2013; planned in the project) and small material inputs to restore/create their professional skills and reintegrate to social community and local job market. Integration in job market is planned in such ways:
- Self-employment (registering as small-scale farmers and receiving income from selling production in market).
- Employment in Agriculture/Crafts sphere in village businesses (Cooperatives, Agriculture companies).</narrative>
