   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Government of Rwandas five year Education Sector Strategic Plan (ESSP 2006  2010) calls for increasing primary school enrolment rates and secondary school transition rates, currently 51% and 15% respectively.  In this context, an array of actions have been planned to expand education services to all levels, with emphasis on basic education and on improving the quality of its services.  These actions include; building and equipping classrooms, revising and adapting programs, training trainers and management personnel, providing textbooks, science and ICT equipment, with emphasis on science and technology education.  Encouraging the private sector to invest in education and expand opportunities for increased numbers of students, particularly at secondary and higher levels is one of the strategies that the GoR has formulated to realize its goals in education.  The proposed investment will contribute to GoRs development objectives by improving private Rwandan schools access to finance and terms of borrowing.  Business development and planning advice as well as skill training to improve schools financial and operational management will enable efficient assessment by the bank and reduce the risk in lending to schools.  In so doing, the facility will widen access and improve the quality of private schools in Rwanda.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This proposed investment involves the establishment of a risk sharing facility with the Banque Rwandaise du Developpment (BRD or the Bank) in Rwanda.  Under the facility BRD will make loans to eligible private education institutions (pre-primary through tertiary) and to companies which support the education sector, e.g. accommodation providers.  The project is a replication of similar facilities implemented in Ghana and Kenya and is in line with IFCs objective to adopt a wholesale approach through risk sharing to support education in SSA  Under the proposed terms of the Facility, BRD would be responsible for generating a portfolio of education loans.  IFCs participation would involve taking risk on 40 percent of the senior tranche of that portfolio.  This exposure would be protected by a first loss provided by BRD.    In parallel, PEP Africa will design, raise funds for and implement an advisory services (AS) program to assess the scope and funding needs of the education sector and to improve the credit quality of participating schools.  Education is a priority area for BRD.  The proposed facility will enable it to grow its portfolio at a faster pace than it would do on its own and provide the Bank and the borrowers with much needed advisory services.</narrative>
