1. Council to the Streets: Through 2 face-to-face dialogue spaces, held at 2 of the most critical points of the National Strike mobilisation.

2. &quot;Council to the House&quot;: Through 40 virtual meetings between 40 councillors and 360 citizens, to address the challenges of land use planning in Bogot&#xE1; and nurture the debate on the draft Land Use Plan.

3. &quot;Itinerant Citizen Assembly&quot;: 70 citizens, randomly selected, deliberated for 2 days, in 7 commissions and a plenary session, on the 7 thematic chapters of the draft Land Use Plan, to generate a report of recommendations that the Bogot&#xE1; Council used during the debate on this regulation.

The changes in context explain why 43 multi-stakeholder dialogue meetings were held, despite the fact that no targets were planned for 2021 for IO 3.1.</narrative>
