      <narrative xml:lang="EN">NIMD has not worked previously with women led CSOs at territorial levels. NIMD&#x2019;s interest for this first year is to build trust with these actors and consolidate a network of support and work that intends to develop L&amp;A initiatives for territorial implementation of peace projects.

As far as July 31 NIMD conducted a preliminary survey with partner CSOs of national coverage to measure their capacities to mobilize and position women and peace agendas in decision-making scenarios. This survey allows us to develop interventions more tailored to their needs and the expectations of NIMD. 9 actors from national CSOs were surveyed.</narrative>

      <narrative xml:lang="EN">NIMD has not worked previously with women led CSOs at territorial levels. NIMD&#x2019;s interest for this first year is to build trust with these actors and consolidate a network of support and work that intends to develop L&amp;A initiatives for territorial implementation of peace projects.

As far as July 31 NIMD conducted a preliminary survey with partner CSOs of national coverage to measure their capacities to mobilize and position women and peace agendas in decision-making scenarios. This survey allows us to develop interventions more tailored to their needs and the expectations of NIMD.

Among the main results, we find that only 44% of the CSOs work with topics related to gender equality and only 22% with political participation.
 
On the other hand, even though 100% of them promote spaces for dialogue and 88.8% consider that their advocacy strategies are effective, only 55% claim to have the capacity to mobilize relevant actors in matters of gender equity and peace.
 
Only 44% of the CSOs surveyed state that they prioritize participation at institutional spaces, which is related to the same percentage claiming to be recognized by institutional actors.</narrative>
