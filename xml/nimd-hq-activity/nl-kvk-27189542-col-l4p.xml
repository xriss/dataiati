As far as July 31 NIMD conducted a preliminary survey with partner CSOs of national coverage to measure their capacities to mobilize and position women and peace agendas in decision-making scenarios. This survey allows us to develop interventions more tailored to their needs and the expectations of NIMD.

Among the main results, we find that only 44% of the CSOs work with topics related to gender equality and only 22% with political participation.
 
On the other hand, even though 100% of them promote spaces for dialogue and 88.8% consider that their advocacy strategies are effective, only 55% claim to have the capacity to mobilize relevant actors in matters of gender equity and peace.
 
Only 44% of the CSOs surveyed state that they prioritize participation at institutional spaces, which is related to the same percentage claiming to be recognized by institutional actors.</narrative>

By the end of the program NIMD expects to increase the capabilities of 8 women led CSOs in the program activities. Considering the survey previously mentioned NIMD will promote CSO&#x2019;s capacities for them to be able to reach relevant actors to mobilize the agenda of equity and peace. NIMD will also promote L&amp;A strategies so CSOs increment their participation at institutional spaces and get recognition by institutional actors with the purpose to strengthen their collaboration on a joint agenda for women and peace.</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">Supportive policy environment for women&#x2019;s rights and political participation in peacebuilding (LTO2)

Programme contribute to this LTO by working through 2 pathways:

Pathway 3: Collaboration for better policies
and
Pathway 4: Lobbying &amp; Advocacy (L&amp;A) for implementation of UNSCR 1325 and SDG 5

Pathway 3: Collaboration for better policies

For women to participate meaningfully to sustaining peace, the policy environment must
support, respect and protect their rights, participation and representation. In Burundi,
Colombia and Myanmar, existing post-conflict legislative frameworks already provide some
guarantee of women&#x2019;s participation, on paper. However, implementation lags behind. Mutual
trust and dialogue are necessary ingredients in order to put these frameworks into practice,
and to improve them based on international best practice. For this to materialize, political
actors need to agree on minimum criteria and benchmarks, and collectively move forward on
these issues.

The Intermediate Outcomes (IOs) in this pathway, which contribute to LTO2 are:
Political parties develop joint gender-equality agendas (IO.3.1)
Political actors jointly advocate for the implementation of gender-equality legislation (IO.3.2)
Political actors collaborate for better policies (IO.3.3)

The programme aims to achieve these outcomes through the following set of intervention
strategies:

Interparty dialogue platforms/women caucuses
Existing dialogue platforms in all three countries will facilitate the development of interparty
agendas on women&#x2019;s participation in political and peace-making processes.
INSPIRED-method based multi-stakeholder dialogue
Through the INSPIRED methodology NIMD facilitates multi-stakeholder dialogue between
civil society and political actors in emerging democracies and post-conflict settings.
Peer learning and knowledge exchange across countries
Exposure of key duty-bearers and political actors to environments with good practices related
to women&#x2019;s rights and inclusion is a proven way to enhance understanding of, and openness
to, changes in domestic policy on gender issues.

Pathway 4: Lobbying &amp; Advocacy (L&amp;A) for implementation of UNSCR 1325 and SDG 5

At a time when the civic space to advocate towards governments is rapidly shrinking, CSOs
must work together and push back against this trend in a concerted lobbying and advocacy
effort. The Consortium will, therefore, engage in mutual capacity strengthening, and align with
like-minded women&#x2019;s organizations and CSOs in all three countries. The exact nature of the
CSOs&#x2019; lobby agendas will depend on the country context and available civic space.

Strengthening CSOs&#x2019; capacities is a pivotal enabler to reach LT02. While in-country CSO
alliances can function as important pressure points to change incentive structures, political
actors need to take the agendas of CSOs into account and reflect them in policy and practice.
Therefore, LEAP4Peace will also engage with political actors to stimulate their commitment to
the WPS agenda. Advocacy initiatives can help put positive pressure on national decisionmakers,
by connecting local- and national-level actors to international feminist agendas,
regional and international bodies, and women&#x2019;s rights networks. Therefore, the Consortium
will use its existing outreach and networks to promote women&#x2019;s participation in
peacebuilding. This outreach is based on both the experience in three countries in the
programme, and on international good practice and experience of Consortium Partners. This
Pathway aligns closely to the international frameworks and agreements around National
Action Plans and the fulfilment of UNSCR 1325, and SDG 5.

The Intermediate Outcomes (IOs) in this pathway, which contribute to LTO2 are:
Strengthened like-minded CSOs align for joint advocacy agenda (IO.4.1)
CSOs effectively monitor and lobby for policy change and implementation (IO.4.2)
International lobby and advocacy for supportive international and national policy environments (IO.4.3)

And the intervention strategies are:
CSO capacity-building assessment and strategy
We will build on our existing monitoring and evaluation tool that measures CSO performance,
based on the Five Capabilities model, and enables them to acknowledge their strengths and
weaknesses, and implement strategies for capacity improvement.
The &#x2018;10 Steps&#x2019; and &#x2018;Beyond Consultation&#x2019; L&amp;A tools
These GAPS tools helps governments and duty-bearers to get commitments on WPS and put
them into action.
Gender Policy Analysis tool
This tool, developed by GEN, analyses legal and policy documents in Myanmar and compares
them against international gender standards. This tool will be used also in the other countries.</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">Women are represented in decision-making roles for peacebuilding (LTO1)

Programme contribute to this LTO by working through 2 pathways:

Pathway 1: Women&#x2019;s empowerment for political leadership
and
Pathway 2: Creating space for women&#x2019;s participation

Pathway 1: Women&#x2019;s empowerment for political leadership
Women must be involved at each stage of the peacebuilding process. While presence at the
negotiation table is vital, involvement in the design, implementation and follow-up of peace
agreements and settlements is equally important. If women are to influence the direction of
post-conflict re-building and policymaking, we need a critical mass of capable and
representative women political leaders, active in both political institutions and overall
political and public life.

This long-term outcome targets women directly by building their capacity, reinforcing women&#x2019;s
agency, and strengthening their networks. By strengthening and building existing skills, and
by engaging men as ambassadors for women&#x2019;s political participation, the foundation is laid for
an increased role of women in peacebuilding and politics.

The programme&#x2019;s Intermediate Outcomes (IO) along pathway 1, which contribute to LTO1, are:
- Women&#x2019;s caucuses and networks are strengthened;
- Women nominate themselves for decision-making positions;
- Male and female (aspiring) politicians work as allies to enhance women&#x2019;s participation.

The programme aims to achieve these outcomes through the following set of intervention
strategies:
Democracy education: Female Leadership Academy
We will build on the existing experience, reputation and infrastructure of Democracy Schools
in the three programme countries, and integrate a Female Leadership Academy. We will rollout
and adopt specific curricula on gender-equality and conflict-sensitivity teaching methods.
Mentoring and networking
The programme will support knowledge transfer and peer support through women&#x2019;s networks
and caucuses, and motivate women to run for decision-making positions. We will support
(aspiring) women leaders to become (political) focal points within their communities, and
advance their position in peacebuilding processes.
Engaging men
We will work with male allies at all levels; support them to understand social barriers; and
empower them to enhance women&#x2019;s rights and political participation.

Pathway 2: Creating space for women&#x2019;s participation

Empowering women is a significant step, but it is not enough. Women also need to operate
in a conducive space in order to participate fully, apply their skills, and voice their rights and
needs. Therefore, it is vital to work with political actors to not only enable the
representation of (the interests of) women in political and peacebuilding agendas or
processes, but also to directly facilitate the participation of women in leadership positions
within political decision-making organizations.

Despite the important role political actors play in peacebuilding, they often receive little
international support or attention. Engaging with political actors is often perceived as a threat
to impartiality for international or multilateral organizations or donors. The key to creating space within the internal structures of political organizations is to have the political actors reinforce and institutionalize women&#x2019;s leadership and political participation themselves. By addressing and removing internal barriers for women, space is created for more diverse political organizations.

The Intermediate Outcomes (IOs) along pathway 2, which contribute to LTO1 are:
- Political actors develop internal gender-equality plans;
- Political actors implement internal gender-equality regulations;
- Executive leadership integrates and supports women&#x2019;s participation internally.

The programme aims to achieve these through the following set of intervention strategies:

Gender Roadmap for Inclusive Political Parties (GRIP)
NIMD developed the GRIP Methodology based on its Women Political Rights (WPR)
Programme (2014- 2017, financed by the Dutch MFA). The GRIPP is a method for political
parties to become aware of any barriers that limit women&#x2019;s participation within their own
party, and offers ways to overcome these barriers. The GRIP offers five steps for parties to:
&#xF0B7; engage party cadres in self-assessment of the inclusiveness of internal procedures;
&#xF0B7; promote ownership of the resulting analysis and addressing the identified barriers;
&#xF0B7; provide executive leadership with a structured pathway to overcome barriers.

(Social) media campaigns
We will collaborate with (social) media organizations to raise awareness of women&#x2019;s
leadership, overcome gender stereotypes and promote an inclusive democratic culture. This
will be done in collaboration with women politicians. This is because the use of social media
for online abuse and violence is often targeted at women politicians

Support to women&#x2019;s wings
We support the capacity and influencing role of party&#x2019;s women&#x2019;s wings so they can
mainstream a gender-equality perspective into (internal) policy development.</narrative>
