   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Linking Good Security Sector Governance to Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions: Practical Guidance for States on How to Implement SDG16</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">1.	Position SSG as a powerful policy tool at the national and international levels for realising SDG16, and in particular targets 16.6 and 16.7, which is a critical goal of the entire 2030 Agenda 
2.	Establish the linkage between oversight actors of the security sector and their contribution to good governance and accountability, within the context of SDG16, as well as providing these actors with the means to realign their strategic priorities with the 2030 Agenda. 
3.	Develop SDG16-specific guidance that supports states in the implementation of the 2030 agenda and its subsequent reporting.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The 2030 Agenda on Sustainable Development and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) offer enormous transformative potential. The Agenda has firm and established links with other global agendas and frameworks, such as the Sustaining Peace agenda to prevent violent conflict, and it has galvanized international structures and states to converge around the common purpose of sustainable development. Intrinsic to the 2030 Agenda is the recognition of security as an enabler of development as well as good governance principles imperative for the achievement of SDG16. SDG16 aims to promote peaceful, just, and inclusive societies by building effective, accountable and inclusive institutions through targets 16.6 and 16.7, which seek to strengthen good governance and accountability of public institutions. However, current implementation means lack an evidence base, robust reporting and assessment indicators, and insufficient attention toward the value of security sector governance (SSG) as a tool for realising the SDG16 targets.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project seeks to target key stakeholders at two levels:
1.	Those working at the global level, such as United Nations officials working on the 2030 Agenda, but also other actors working within the realm of development, security and human rights including donor organisations, think tanks, and development agencies.
2.	Those working at the state level, especially in the Global South and in fragile contexts. However, given that the 2030 Agenda and SSG are both cross-sectoral initiatives, this project will seek to engage more specifically with state-based actors such as:
a.	Policy makers in the development sector 
b.	Policy makers in the security sector, and
c.	National oversight bodies.
The above target audiences will also mutually reinforce one another. State level actors will provide evidence and expertise to global actors, who will impart international good practice to other state&#x2019;s actors. In addition, policy recommendations garnered from the project&#x2019;s outputs disseminated across target audiences on a national level will mutually reinforce one another &#x2013; policy makers that inform and develop policy on their country strategies and operational programmes will be monitored and reported on by oversight bodies.</narrative>
