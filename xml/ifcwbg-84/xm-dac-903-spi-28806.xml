   <narrative xml:lang="EN">CGCs investment capacity and operating know-how is expected to greatly benefit the investee companies.   In the specific case of Jordan, CMTCs fleet renewal and expansion project, funded largely by CGC, is expected to improve Ammans underdeveloped public transportation system. It is also expected to help reduce traffic congestion and user travel time as CMTCs increased presence will not only offer a comfortable alternative to individual or shared car use but also displace, replace and restrict the operations of minibuses.  Investments in the public transportation system such as the contemplated investments in Jordan and Lebanon in combination with a transfer of know-how is also expected to lead to higher bus frequencies, a better reliability and the use of more modern buses.   The project is also expected to positively affect the direct users of the public transportation system as well as the non-users due to the resulting easing of road congestion. Municipalities are also expected to benefit from lower roadway investment costs. The enhanced service levels are also expected to have a strong impact on the urban poor who traditionally live far away from their place of employment and rely on public transportation.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">City Group Company K.S.C. (CGC), a Kuwait-based listed joint stock company with core operations in urban bus transportation, has recently embarked on a regional expansion program. As one of the most successful listed public transportation companies in the MENA region, CGC is in a good position to acquire potentially viable public transportation businesses in the region, recapitalize them and improve their operations to restore profitability. Their move is well timed as traffic congestion in the regions capital cities has reached critical levels.  In December 2009, CGC agreed to invest JOD15 million (US$21.3 million) into the Comprehensive Multiple Transportation Company (CMTC), a listed, Jordan-based bus public transportation operator through a capital increase, making it the 1st foreign investor in the Jordanian bus public transportation sector. CMTC was established in 2005 and is the largest public transportation company in the greater Amman area, operating more than 75% of the citys bus routes. The capital increase will be used towards financing a comprehensive capital expenditure program of approximately US$40 million to fund, among other investments, the construction of a new, state-of-the-art central operations hub with modern maintenance facilities and a major fleet renewal and expansion plan.    City Group is also pursuing other investment opportunities in the region and is considering an investment in a public transportation company in another Levant market that would enable such a company to improve and expand its operations.</narrative>
