   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Headquartered in Amman, Jordan, the Nuqul Group is a leading regional manufacturing group primarily involved in the production of jumbo tissue rolls and their subsequent conversion into paper-based hygienic products such as facial tissues or diapers. The proposed project mainly consists of expanding the Groups conversion capacity in facial tissue, toilet paper, napkins and diapers in Egypt and Jordan. This Project is the continuation of Nuquls expansion efforts across the MENA region and will enable it to cater to the basic hygienic needs of populations in Jordan, Morocco, Egypt, Iraq, Syria, Algeria, Libya, Algeria and Tunisia. Additionally, part of the project funding may be utilized to support investments in energy and water savings as identified in the context of IFCs Advisory Services collaboration with Nuqul.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Improved economic resilience:
The expansion of conversion capacity in the host countries of the project (namely Egypt and Jordan), will help support the local economic environment by decreasing reliance on typically more expensive and volatile imported goods. Additionally, the manufacturing focus of the project will support diversification of the economy in the countries where the new capacity will be established. The project will also enable Nuqul to increase its internal consumption of jumbo tissue rolls and focus its sales on higher-margin finished products, thereby improving its operational performance and resilience.

Spread of world-class business practices:
Over the past years, Nuqul has made significant progress on the path to institutionalization notably in separating ownership and management as well as implementing world-class corporate governance and business practices. The Nuqul Group is a highly respected institution across the MENA Region and the project will enable Nuqul to spread its commendable business practices by expanding the Groups regional reach. 

Benefits of regional integration:
The project will facilitate increased trade linkages within the region and serve as an example to other players of the rewards available from global integration.

Improved living standards for the populations: 
The project will create sustainable employment opportunities in countries where youth unemployment is a major issue.  Domestic and efficient operations will enable the Nuqul Group to bring more affordable quality products in the market, thereby improving the local populations access to products catering to basic human needs.

Demonstration effect: 
By providing long term financing in markets where these types of financing are typically not available, IFC sets a long term interest rate benchmark for commercial loans of longer tenors. This may lead to the eventual development of a long term interest rate curve in the local market and enable local lenders to provide these types of financing.

Cleaner production support:
The project will support the Nuqul Groups efforts to move towards cleaner production, thereby contributing to decreasing the Groups environmental footprint.</narrative>
