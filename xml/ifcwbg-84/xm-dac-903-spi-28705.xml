   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Gulf Agency Company (GAC or the Company) is a global provider of shipping, logistics, marine and related services.  It has a fleet of about 50 vessels (tugs, barges, landing craft, etc.) that support the offshore oil industry and which are active from the west coast of India to the west coast of Africa including the Caspian Sea and Arabian Gulf. The Company is embarking on an expansion program to upgrade its fleet.  IFCs financing would be used to cover the costs of acquiring additional vessels, beginning with the purchase of two Anchor Handling Tug Supply (AHTS) vessels which would initially operate on the Caspian.  The expansion will help the Company optimize its fleet structure and expand its operations.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">While Kazakhstan is considered to have substantial oil (and gas) reserves including offshore, poor infrastructure and a lack of support services has prevented it from taking full advantage of these resources.  As a result, the development of such services is essential to the development of the country and would in turn unlock economic growth and job creation.  The project would also facilitate the export of oil from countries with excess supply (such as Kazakhstan) to countries with a shortage, allowing both sides to benefit and enhancing the efficiency of the global oil market.  By facilitating increased trade linkages between the MENA region and the rest of the world, the project would also provide a demonstration effect to regional players of the rewards available from global integration.</narrative>
