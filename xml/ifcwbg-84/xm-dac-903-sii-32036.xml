   <narrative xml:lang="EN">i. Development of the hydrocarbon sector in Turkey and Iraq: The Thrace Basin in Turkey is the country&apos;&apos;s largest producing gas province providing opportunities for gas exploration. Any gas produced in the Thrace Basin is going to be used domestically. Being the main private oil services company in Turkey, the company will help oil and gas operators develop indigenous hydrocarbon resources and thus contribute to the country&apos;&apos;s goals of reducing energy dependence and displacing other fuels with natural gas. As Iraq hopes to significantly boost its output capacity which continues to be crucial for the country&apos;&apos;s economic recovery, the company&apos;&apos;s oilfield services are an important contribution to sector development in the region it operates.  ii. Increased competition in the service sector: The company&apos;&apos;s competition in Turkey is generally of poor quality and high cost. Through establishing and expanding its operations, the company will aim to provide more competitive pricing for its services, and offering improved quality and response times in Turkey. iii. Employment and training: The company currently employs an international workforce of roughly 1,100,  almost 90% of which are local hires.   Viking has been actively developing local talent and hiring locally has been key in its community engagement strategy.  If it is successful in its expansion plans, it is expected to need additional employees in its markets of operations. Creating and preserving jobs in the sector that currently lacks qualified providers will have positive benefits for these markets in helping create local expertise through employment and training.</narrative>
