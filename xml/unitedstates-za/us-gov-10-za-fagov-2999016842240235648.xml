    <narrative xml:lang="EN">South Africa continues to be an important strategic partner of the United States. Although it is the second largest economy in Africa, South Africa struggles with serious socioeconomic challenges, including HIV/AIDS and other health concerns, mass unemployment, a failing education system, increasing corruption, poor accountability, and critical levels of violent crime. As South Africa continues to exert leadership in the region, it is working with the United States and other donors to address its social and economic challenges. U.S. investments, in line with South African national development priorities, will target efforts where funding can catalyze innovative approaches for reform and improve efficiency, helping South Africa sustain its democracy and improve the lives of its people</narrative>
