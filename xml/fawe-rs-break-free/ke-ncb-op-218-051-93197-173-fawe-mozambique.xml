   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Break Free! consortium goes with the strategic objective that adolescents exercise their right to 
live free from teenage pregnancy (TP) and child marriage (CM) supported by civil society. Civil society 
organizations, youth-led groups and networks will be strengthened to lobby and advocate for 
improved legislation and implementation to increase girls&#x2019; agency and to promote social norm change 
in favor of the prevention of CM/TP. Three pathways of change have been identified leading towards
the strategic programme objective: 
&#x2756; Pathway 1: Adolescent girls at risk of CM/TP access quality and safe education
&#x2756; Pathway 2: Duty bearers and decision-makers develop, resource and implement laws and 
policies that respond to adolescents&#x2019; needs
&#x2756; Pathway 3: Adolescents access quality SRHR information, education and services
To achieve these outcomes, seven key strategies have been prioritized:
1. Social movement/network building
2. Capacity building of (youth) civil society organizations (CSOs)
3. Network building of (youth) CSOs/NGOs
4. Promote access to lobby platforms
5. Lobby and advocacy campaigns
6. Research
7. Learning and exchange
The geographical focus of the programme is West Africa (Burkina Faso, Mali, Niger), East Africa 
(Ethiopia, Kenya Sudan) and Southern Africa (Malawi, Mozambique, Zambia). There will also be a 
programming component at Africa regional level, targeting institutions and other stakeholders 
operating at this broader level.</narrative>
