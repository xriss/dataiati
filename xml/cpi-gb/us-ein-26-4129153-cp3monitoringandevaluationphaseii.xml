   <narrative xml:lang="EN">CP3 is a programme jointly funded by the UK Government&apos;s International Climate Finance and managed by the the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, the Department for International Development, and the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. CP3 aims to increase low carbon investment in renewable energy, water, energy efficiency and forestry in developing countries, by investing in two private equity funds - the Catalyst Fund and Asia Climate Partners. CPI is one of the Monitoring and Evaluation agents providing an independent assessment of the relevance, effectiveness, efficiency, impact and sustainability of the programme.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The funds committed by the CP3 programme benefit a range of countries across multiple regions globally. The programme aims to increase low carbon investment in renewable energy, water, energy efficiency and forestry in developing countries, through the UK&apos;s investment in two private equity funds and subsequent investments made by those funds and their sub-funds. The precise geographical distribution of funds at the end of the investment chain varies over the programme&apos;s lifetime. For simplicity, Monitoring and Evaluation activities registered under this activity are recorded as benefiting the UK, in terms of assessing the progress of the programme against this theory of change.</narrative>
