   <narrative xml:lang="EN">&lt;p&gt;INGABO Syndicate is a Rwandan Farmers organization  created in 1992. The main mission of INGABO Syndicate is to improve the technical and economic capacities of its members to become competitive market actors. As a Farmers Organization  INGABO Syndicate focuses on advocacy  lobby and strategic partnerships to avail required services to its members.&lt;br&gt;Agriterra has been working with farmers organizations in Rwanda  including INGABO Syndicate since 1998. All projects aimed to empower farmers&amp;rsquo; organizations to be able to provide quality services to their members in order to support them to improve their livelihoods and get out of poverty. However  this partnership has suspended with the change of Agriterra&amp;rsquo;s intervention strategy and the institutional crisis the organization has faced with in the past 3 years.&lt;br&gt;In 2014  INGABO Syndicate has encountered an institutional crisis after some dissidents intended to change the syndicate&amp;#39;s legal status into a non-government organization. In May 2017 INGABO&amp;#39;s status as syndicate has been restored and it has approached Agriterra for support &amp;nbsp;in revitalising its agronomic services and technical support to its members specifically in the cassava value chain. Currently  Ingabo Syndicate has over 40 000 members of which 15 000 are active in the four districts (Kamonyi Muhanga Ruhango and Nyanza) of the Southern Province of Rwanda. In terms of organizatinal structure  Ingabo has 3 main organization levels (Gacaca (on village level)  zone (sector level) and Higher level at the Head Quarter). At every organization level you find 4 governance and support organs.General Assembly board of directors  supervisory board  arbitration committee. At the Head Quarter however  there&amp;rsquo;s an additional organ that&amp;rsquo;s made of Ingabo staff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since 2017 the relationship between Ingabo and Agriterra has resumed and Agriterra supports INGABO in the FFS trainings and farmer consultations and advocacy using the Agriterra FACT methodology. Besides these two main activities  Agriterra has supported Ingabo Syndicate in following up the conducted FFS training  informing its members about the agricultural laws and policies  doing the external financial audit of 2018 and participating in the 2019 MINAGRI Agricultural show. All these aiming to improve member production  policy changes and organizational outreach. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</narrative>
