   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Goals 2016
- improve capacities of BoD and staff in terms of business planning  marketing  monitoring- improve member commitment - improve internal capitalisation  Goals 2017
- increase active membership with 25% by doing Road shows
-increase youth and female participation in the chaing (increase to 30% youth). Goal: each BoD of RPO has 1 youth and 2 female members
- improving quality   products are monitored   by setting up quality management system
- getting the maize milling machine into production




  Goals 2018
-start maize processing facility 100gt,#/p###
-focus on marketing  sales
-clear UDBL loan  to create access to extra working capital in order to fully meet her potential  Goal 2019:
The cooperative has now in place a warehouse and maize mill. All the assets needed to add value to the produce of the farmers are in place. Now the cooperative is facing challenges in finding the right market for its produce. It is currently selling via different marketing channels but there is no clear marketing strategy in place.
In 2019 the budget of Agriterra will be used to fund some of the new activities but the majority will be contributed by the organisation itself. Focus this year will be on assisting TACE in developing their marketing strategy that is scaleable.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">TACE wants to develop  from currently exploiting successfully an agro-input shop and mobile money shop to a cooperative that is also procuring and processing maize in flour by investing in land  warehouse  maize mill etc. thus creating additional value on a large scale. Furthermore they want to provide farmers crop-financing (activity started in 2014). The goals 2020 are clearly set.
After preparing a listing of what is really needed for TACE to operate at high standards (quality  quantity  financial  logistics etc.) and analyzing the production chain and what is needed for a high quality in- and output (garbage inhellipis garbage outhellip,) a new investment plan was made with different options (invest in owned property  renting  outsourcing maize milling). The conclusion overall was that investing in property  a mill etc. is yet a step not to be taken right now. First of all the quality of input has to be 100 % as well as securing the proper quantities: basis are the members who need training  high quality input seeds and expertise  proper tools such as tarpaulins  cleaners   providing transport etc. TACE can ultimately obtain permanent commitment from members to purchase from the input shop as well as deliver crops of right quantities and qualities to TACE for just in time delivery to TACEs customers on a steady  growing basis. 
First off all the financial and organizational basis of TACE  training BoD and staff has to improve in which Agriterra can support before investing on a large scale.
Agriterra is advised to support the board  management and staff to develop the skills and deliver the proper tools needed for the TACE to develop and implementing a realistic investment plan ( = follow-up) to achieve their goals. 
The action plan contains clear milestones for all parties involved and address expectations  commitments and the level of involvement of Agriterra and most important of Twezimbe Area Cooperative Enterprise Limited.</narrative>
