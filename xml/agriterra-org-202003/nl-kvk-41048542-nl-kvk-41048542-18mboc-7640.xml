   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Mpongwe Bulima Organic Cooperative Society (MBOCS) was formed in 2000. Initially  with help of volunteers and support by VSO UK  groundnuts were grown organically amp exported and wild mushrooms (Cantharells) were dried and exported to the UK and Germany with organic certification. The business gradually stopped as mushrooms gradually disappeared due to deforestation and competition.In 2005  MBOCS received a grant from United States Africa Development Foundation (USADF) to establish a fulltime management team  move to a central place in Mpongwe and investments in office and processing equipment.In 2014  MBOCS received a SAPP matching grant for groundnut processing  following a market survey showing huge demand for peanut butter in the region. In 2016  ILO started supporting MBOCS in establishing marketing linkages for soybean and groundnut outgrower schemes for young farmers.Today  the cooperative has a membership of 410 members  a staff of 6 and half a hectare plot in Mpongwe town with a warehouse facility for their agro input supply. In the past  MBOCS offered warehousing to store seed and other inputs for government. But the change of system to e-voucher caused the cooperative to develop the idea for an agroshop to provide inputs to the outgrower schemes.In 2017  a solar-powered hammer mill was built on the plot through a countrywide Presidential Initiative to reduce cost and increase availability of mealie meal.Agriterra got introduced to MBOCS through ILO Zambia. In November 2017  an assessment of MBOCS was performed. The assessment team advised positively to Agriterra about a cooperation with MBOCS as it shows the right attitude to change  has growth potential  is large enough currently  has a solid reputation amongst members and other stakeholders and has the right entrepreneurial spirit. The cooperative has the ambition to grow to 1 000 members in 2022 and start processing and selling goods  which connects with the Agriterra ambitions. BHAG 2018: Increased production and productivity of maize  groundnuts and soy beans increased membership from 368 in 2017 to 500 in 2018 reduced side-selling.BHAG 2019: Increased production and productivity of maize  groundnuts and soy beans increased membership from 410 in 2018 to 500 in 2019 reduced side-selling.BHAG 2020: Increased production and productivity of maize  groundnuts and soy beans value addition of maize to mealie meal (180MT) and groundnuts to peanut butter (75MT) increased volumes of aggregation of soy beans (from 35MT to 150MT) and maize (from 800MT to 1500MT) increased membership to 685 increased services to members (timely payment of groundnut supplies  patronage bonuses  trainings in production improvement/RK/post-harvest handling  equipment provision eg shellers)BHAG 2022: Full processing of crops of 1 000 members into end products that have a strong brand in outlets in major districts in the region.The project will focus on Production  Business  Cooperative Governance  Financial Management  Marketing  Member Commitment and Strategic Planning.</narrative>
