  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Candax Energy Inc. (Candax or the Company) is a small independent oil and gas company mainly focused on Tunisia, and listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange. Candax owns an interest in five oil and gas fields in Tunisia, consisting of the El-Bibane (73.8% net interest), Ezzaouia (31.4%), Robbana (80%), Belli (50%), and Al-Manzah (75%) fields, and one exploration license in Madagascar. Candax seeks to raise funds in order to finance its investment program in Tunisia which aims to enhance production from its mature asset base (currently approximately 320 barrels of oil per day (bopd) on average) by improving reservoir understanding, drilling new wells, and executing other recovery techniques (the Project). With the proposed development program, the Company is expecting to increase production to approximately 700 bopd by the end of 2012, and keep growing at a similar trend over the following years from its existing base, in addition to any acquisition the Company may make.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Project is expected to have the following development impacts: 1.	Value extraction out of mature, marginal fields: The Project involves investments aimed at prolonging the life of mature fields which, given their marginal nature, would otherwise see production decline quickly and be abandoned within the next few years.  2.	Contribution to government revenues: The Project will generate fiscal receipts in the form of royalties, corporate taxes and participation in the production through the Tunisian national oil company (&quot;ETAP&quot;).   3.	Demonstration effect: The Project supports a junior oil and gas company with assets in Tunisia. Increase in     production and positive returns to shareholders should incentivize more investors to supply capital for similar ventures in the country that focus on marginal and mature field development.  4.           Preservation and creation of employment: By sustaining production for a longer period in the Company&apos;&apos;s mature fields, the Project will maintain current employment levels. Approximately 140 families rely on their income from jobs sourced on these fields. Furthermore, the Company is committed to create managerial positions in its Tunisian offices as well as operating positions for the development of the fields. 5.	Generating additional business for local and national suppliers: Candax&apos;&apos;s local procurement will have a positive impact on regional economic activity through the purchase of equipment, products and services. 6.            Improve Tunisia&apos;&apos;s energy account trading balance: Tunisia currently has a negative energy account trading balance. Production from the Project will help alleviate the energy trade deficit and raise foreign exchange earnings.   The following indicators will be tracked throughout the life of the Project: (a) Annual output levels; (b) Tax and other payments made to government; (c) Employment; and (d) Domestic purchases (US$).</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">Candaxs main oil and gas assets in Tunisia are mature oil and gas fields that were first brought into production 10-20 years ago. None of the assets involve a greenfield development.  The El-Bibane field is located 18km offshore in the Gulf of Gabes, in water depths of 2-7 meters. The field has been developed by installing three unmanned production platforms with 18km underwater pipelines to the shore.   The onshore Ezzaouia field is located in southern Tunisia, 12km north of the city of Zarzis in an agricultural area.  The central processing facility of the El Bibane field, as well as the storage and export terminal of the Ezzaouia field, are located in the area of the industrial port of Zarzis.  Robbana is an onshore field located on the island of Djerba, and production has been resumed in August 2011 following a successful workover of the well.  The field is in an agricultural area.  The non-producing Belli and Al-Manzah fields are located in the Cap Bon Peninsula of northern Tunisia, approximately 60km from the city of Tunis.</narrative>
