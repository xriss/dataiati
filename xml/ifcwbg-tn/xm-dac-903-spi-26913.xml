   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The proposed project is a central element of Tunisias growth strategy: by expanding and modernizing the airport infrastructure of Tunisia, the project is expected to directly contribute to the success of the Tunisias economic strategy, which is built on two pillars:   - export-oriented industrialization, in particular with a specialization in low cost light manufacturing and  - tourism development, with major efforts underway by the Tunisian Government to increase tourist arrival numbers and re-position Tunisia towards the higher end of the market.   The project furthers both those goals as:   - it will be critical to the development of the Enfidha industrial district and  - it will considerably expand Tunisias tourism capacity by offering a new gateway to Tunisia, as the Monastir airport has reached saturation.   The project, one of the largest private sector investments in Tunisia in recent years, will also be the 1st private airport concession in the Maghreb region and is a key factor in the success of the Tunisian Governments PPP strategy in infrastructure.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Tunisias existing airports are either already saturated (Monastir handled 4.2 mn passagers for a nominal capacity of 3.5 mn) or nearing saturation (Tunis Carthage airport). Due to growing tourism, further encouraged by the current negotiations on an open skies agreement with Europe as well as major tourism and industrial developments planned to sustain the countrys growth, the upgrade and expansion of Tunisias airport infrastructure is a key Government priority.   In 2007, the Government of Tunisia awarded two concessions to TAV of Turkey:   - a concession to upgrade and operate the Monastir airport, and  - a concession to build, finance and operate a new airport at Enfidha, also located in the Central Eastern part of Tunisia, 45 km away from the Monastir airport.   Both airports will serve the major tourism areas of Monastir, Sousse and Hammamet, located on the Mediterranean coast.  The decision to build a new airport at Enfidha stemmed from the fact that the Monastir airport cannot be expanded on site, owing to geographical and environmental constraints.  TAV created TAV Tunisie, a special purpose company which will be the concessionaire of the two airports.  The proposed project is to finance:   - the concession for the construction and operation of a new international airport at Enfidha, for an initial capacity of 7 million passengers and  - the concession for the operation of the existing Monastir international airport (4.2 million passengers in 2006).     The project, with total costs of approx EUR560 million (approximately equivalent to $840 million), will be one the largest recent private sector investments in Tunisia and the 1st airport private sector concession in the Maghreb region.</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">- Monastir Airport:   the airport is located 7km from the centre of Monastir, Tunisias 11th largest city in terms of population (41,000) located 160 km south to south-east of the capital, Tunis, and a major tourist centre. The city is in the centre of the Tunisian Sahel region, between Sousse to the north and Mehdia to the south. The city of Monastir is connected to the rest of the country through railway service, with multiple daily schedules to/from Tunis, Sousse, Gabes, Sfax and Djerba. The city and the airport are accessible from Tunis by highway (2 hours). The airport itself is close to the coast.  In terms of facilities, the airport has one runway, 2950 m long, one passenger terminal (capacity of 3.5 m passengers) and one main apron comprising 25 aircraft stands.  The airport is served mainly by charter flights bringing low cost tourists to the surrounding coastal area.  - Enfidha airport:   will be located in the Enfidha district, on the coast, 100 km south of Tunis, served by the Tunis-Sousse highway, a railway station and at a 35 km of the Sousse port (a new deep-water port is planned in Enfidha). The airport will be in the immediate vicinity of the Enfidha industrial zone, a 2 million square meters area earmarked for the development of an industrial zone aiming to attract industrial firms active in the automotive sector. Total airport area will be 5,788 Ha with an estimated total construction capacity of 130,000 square meters. The airport will have one 3,300m long runway and two apron areas, allowing for a total capacity of 32 aircraft stand. Upon completion of the 1st phase, the airports capacity will be 7 mn passengers.  Subsequent expansions will be realized as needed to satisfy traffic growth.  It is expected that the Enfidha airport will cater mainly to tourists.</narrative>
