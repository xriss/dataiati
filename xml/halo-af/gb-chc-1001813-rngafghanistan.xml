  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">HALO&#x2019;s work will offer four immediate benefits: physical protection, providing employment for the rural poor, assistance for victims of mine/ERW accidents, and improving rural livelihoods. Physical protection will be provided through three main activities: mine clearance, Mine Risk Education (MRE) and Weapons and Ammunition Disposal (WAD). These activities will be conducted by staff recruited from mine-impacted areas, who will be employed on a long-term basis to create security for their own communities, as specified in SRoL Sub-Goal 1.3.</narrative>
  </description>
  <description type="3">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project represents a significant investment in lives and livelihoods in rural communities neglected by many NGOs due to lack of funding and poor security, where all indicators for human security are poor, economic opportunities are few, and the government is unable to guarantee security. The project will also contribute to human security in a wider sense through increasing social stability and cohesion in the target communities. Migration from Afghanistan&#x2019;s rural areas, driven by unemployment and instability, can be reduced by addressing these two issues through large-scale mine clearance and WAD work. The project will offer livelihoods opportunities: the majority of land cleared will be used for grazing, foraging, or crop cultivation, representing a vital source of income for members of rural mine-impacted communities. Of the total funding requested, HALO will provide funding to a local partner organisation, Accessibility Organisation for Afghan Disabled (AOAD), in a project which will deliver critical assistance to victims of mine and ERW accidents in the target communities, who are often excluded from political, economic, and social opportunities due to their disabilities.</narrative>
  </description>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project will provide immediate protection from the threat of mines and ERW for 30,532 vulnerable Afghans living in five provinces of Afghanistan, directly contributing to human security in 24 mine-impacted rural communities (Dutch Government Security and Rule of Law (SRoL)Policy Sub-Goal 1.1). The project will clear 441.5 hectares of land, destroy 30 tonnes of explosive ammunition, and provide support to 144 mine/ERW accident victims. It will contribute to wider stability and human security in the surrounding areas and therefore to the stability of Afghanistan as a whole.</narrative>

These numbers are often several years old, resulting in recent population movements and growth not being taken into consideration. Additionally, as there were changes made to the workplan, different communities are being targeted. This will also result to changes in the beneficiary numbers. Therefore there were more beneficiaries of land released than expected in 2019.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">The target is set based on percentage of direct beneficiaries showing increased safe behaviour from a baseline of 38 sampled MRE participants in provinces where NL mine clearance is taking place. As such, the target was based on limited data. The provided output total percentage is derived from 742 sampled MRE participants. The target will be updated for 2018 as more data has been accumulated.

2018: This indicator is derived from behavioural questions posed in the pre and post MRE survey. There are two key questions focusing on changed behaviour: What should you do if you see a UXO? And what should you do if you find yourself in a minefield? 82% demonstrated increased safe behaviour when answering the first question and 61% demonstrated increased safe behaviour when answering the second question. An average of these two percentages was used (72%) to indicate an improvement in safe behaviour. The initial target was based on a previous baseline that involved relatively few participants and therefore did not reflect the wider population. The target may be revised for the next project year.</narrative>

This is due to the fact that most of the beneficiaries surveyed in 2018 live next to roads that used to be mined. After clearance, most beneficiaries were able to benefit from cleared roads and other beneficiaries had increased access to other services and infrastructure. The initial target was based on the number of beneficiaries that reported blocked access to services and infrastructure during the baseline. However, changes in the workplan occurred and different communities were included in the livelihoods survey. Likewise, even though direct access might not have been block by mines, they might have easier and shorter travelling distance to other areas.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">The original target of 40% was set based on percentage of direct beneficiaries showing increased knowledge from a baseline of 38 sampled MRE participants in provinces where NL mine clearance is taking place. As such, the target was based on limited data. The provided output total percentage is derived from 742 sampled MRE participants.

In 2018, the target was changed from 40% to 90%, based on data gathered in 2018.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">During April and May, MRE activities were suspended in Afghanistan, by order of the national authority, as a safety measure against the COVID-19 pandemic. Activities resumed in June, using indirect methods of delivery (including megaphone broadcasts and posters), in combination with safety messaging on COVID-19 prevention measures. Teams received training from a WHO-led initiative on how to provide this messaging. The number of beneficiaries reached through MRE going forward will be reduced due to these measures.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">As was the trend in previous quarters, the number of indirect beneficiaries significantly overachieved the overall project target. The reason is that the data of minefields and beneficiaries were collected several years prior to the actual mine clearance activities. The overall project target was thus based on outdated data. During the time gap between survey and clearance, the number of beneficiaries have increased (due to general population growth, IDPs, etc..). To better account for the number of indirect beneficiaries, the target for 2018 will be revised.</narrative>

Additionally, as there were changes made to the workplan, different communities are being targeted. This will also result to changes in the beneficiary numbers.

This double counting has been retrospectively corrected in previous quarters for both outputs and targets. Future targets have revised downward slightly to reflect the expected unique beneficiaries.

Activities resumed in June, using indirect methods of delivery (including megaphone broadcasts and posters), in combination with safety messaging on COVID-19 prevention measures. Teams received training from a WHO-led initiative on how to provide this messaging. The number of beneficiaries reached through MRE going forward will be reduced due to these measures.</narrative>

Starting in April, DMAC issued a stop order on all risk education activities, and EORE teams suspended their work. Between April and June, HALO worked with DMAC, the WHO, and other mine action partners to create a revised procedure for conducting EORE safely. This included social distancing and hygiene measures, reduced group sizes, and the use of indirect methods such as posters. Teams were able to resume sessions in June, and although these reached fewer beneficiaries, they had the added benefit of including safety messaging on COVID-19. The number of men reached exceeded the planned anual target, despite the two-month suspension.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">As was the trend in previous quarters, the number of indirect beneficiaries significantly overachieved the overall project target. The reason is that the data of minefields and beneficiaries were collected several years prior to the actual mine clearance activities. The overall project target was thus based on outdated data. During the time gap between survey and clearance, the number of beneficiaries have increased (due to general population growth, IDPs, etc..). To better account for the number of indirect beneficiaries, the target for 2018 will be revised.</narrative>

Activities resumed in June, using indirect methods of delivery (including megaphone broadcasts and posters), in combination with safety messaging on COVID-19 prevention measures. Teams received training from a WHO-led initiative on how to provide this messaging. The number of beneficiaries reached through MRE going forward will be reduced due to these measures.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">In 2020, EORE outputs during the second quarter were affected by the national response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Starting in April, DMAC issued a stop order on all risk education activities, and EORE teams suspended their work. Between April and June, HALO worked with DMAC, the WHO, and other mine action partners to create a revised procedure for conducting EORE safely. This included social distancing and hygiene measures, reduced group sizes, and the use of indirect methods such as posters. Teams were able to resume sessions in June, and although these reached fewer beneficiaries, they had the added benefit of including safety messaging on COVID-19. The number of sessions exceeded the planned anual target, despite the two-month suspension.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">In 2020, EORE outputs during the second quarter were affected by the national response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Starting in April, DMAC issued a stop order on all risk education activities, and EORE teams suspended their work. Between April and June, HALO worked with DMAC, the WHO, and other mine action partners to create a revised procedure for conducting EORE safely. This included social distancing and hygiene measures, reduced group sizes, and the use of indirect methods such as posters.

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">The CORE team provided more MRE sessions than anticipated. As a result of a large amount of ammunition being uncovered in Paghman district of Kabul province and accidents involving children occurring in this district, the CORE team carried out extra MRE sessions for the communities in this area. The mixed gender CORE team also provided several sessions at schools in these communities to ensure no children were excluded and that they are well informed of the dangers of mines/ERW.</narrative>

However, in Q4 and Q5, there were two mixed gender CORE teams providing MRE, thus enhancing the number of sessions. The target was also set too modestly. Thus the 2018 target has been revised to 240 sessions.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">As was the trend in previous quarters, the number of indirect beneficiaries significantly overachieved the overall project target. The reason is that the data of minefields and beneficiaries were collected several years prior to the actual mine clearance activities. The overall project target was thus based on outdated data. During the time gap between survey and clearance, the number of beneficiaries have increased (due to general population growth, IDPs, etc..). To better account for the number of indirect beneficiaries, the target for 2018 will be revised.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">As was the trend in previous quarters, the number of indirect beneficiaries significantly overachieved the overall project target. The reason is that the data of minefields and beneficiaries were collected several years prior to the actual mine clearance activities. The overall project target was thus based on outdated data. During the time gap between survey and clearance, the number of beneficiaries have increased (due to general population growth, IDPs, etc..). To better account for the number of indirect beneficiaries, the target for 2018 will be revised.</narrative>

In this quarter HALO identified a double counting of some beneficiaries as some people receive multiple services. Physical and emotional needs often require a multi-disciplinary approach that DAO can provide to accident victims. This double counting has been retrospectively corrected in previous quarters for both outputs and targets. Future targets have revised downward slightly to reflect the expected unique beneficiaries. The overall reduction in target beneficiaries is 7% for the entire project. DAO will still be working at the same capacity. This change has no budgetary implications.</narrative>

The overall reduction in target beneficiaries is 7% for the entire project. DAO will still be working at the same capacity. This change has no budgetary implications.</narrative>

The reason for this is that the population of female victims was higher than that of males in the selected communities. In total, 47 victims were assisted, which is slightly higher than the target of 45 victims assisted. In upcoming project years, the balance between male and female victims is expected to balance out.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">This target is based on the beneficiary numbers recorded in the IMSMA database. These numbers are often several years old, resulting in recent population movements and growth not being taken into consideration. Additionally, as there were changes made to the workplan, different communities are being targeted. This will also result to changes in the beneficiary numbers.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">As in previous quarters, the number of MRE recipients surpassed the target by a significant percentage. The over-achievement is caused by the MRE target being set too modestly. The target is based on 10 recipients attending a session. The results reveal that each session was attended by an average of 21 participants. To account for the higher number of attendees, the target for 2018 was revised to 4,800 beneficiaries. The new target is based on each session being attended by approximately 20 recipients.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">Boys and girls were prioritised as MRE recipients as they are most likely to handle unknown objects they come across and accidently detonate mines or other explosive remnants of war. In addition, as MRE sessions are delivered at times when men and women are often at work or busy with household tasks, the team could not easily reach adults for MRE resulting in a slight underachievement. Instead, attendees are encouraged to share their newly acquired knowledge with family members and friends.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">During April and May, MRE activities were suspended in Afghanistan, by order of the national authority, as a safety measure against the COVID-19 pandemic. Activities resumed in June, using indirect methods of delivery (including megaphone broadcasts and posters), in combination with safety messaging on COVID-19 prevention measures. Teams received training from a WHO-led initiative on how to provide this messaging. The number of beneficiaries reached through MRE going forward will be reduced due to these measures.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">In 2020, EORE outputs during the second quarter were affected by the national response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Starting in April, DMAC issued a stop order on all risk education activities, and EORE teams suspended their work. Between April and June, HALO worked with DMAC, the WHO, and other mine action partners to create a revised procedure for conducting EORE safely. This included social distancing and hygiene measures, reduced group sizes, and the use of indirect methods such as posters. Teams were able to resume sessions in June, and although these reached fewer beneficiaries, they had the added benefit of including safety messaging on COVID-19. The number of women reached exceeded the planned anual target, despite the two-month suspension.</narrative>

As a result of a large amount of ammunition being uncovered in Paghman district of Kabul province and accidents involving children occurring in this district, the CORE team carried out extra MRE sessions for the communities in this area. The mixed gender CORE team also provided several sessions at schools in these communities to ensure no children were excluded and that they are well informed of the dangers of mines/ERW.</narrative>

This quarter, changes to the workplan were made to accommodate the visit of the Dutch Foreign Minister. The number of tasks was revised to from 19 to 21. The tasks are larger than those on the previous workplan, resulting in approximately the same amount of land being cleared. As such, no adjustments to the clearance target are necessary.</narrative>

Although this was a lower number than the projected 19 tasks, it included tasks with a larger area which had been added during revisions to the workplan. Consquently the number of tasks was smaller, but the area cleared was larger, as evidenced in the other outputs.</narrative>

This double counting has been retrospectively corrected in previous quarters for both outputs and targets. Future targets have revised downward slightly to reflect the expected unique beneficiaries.

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">The number of beneficiaries is less this quarter because many of the tasks are in communities where NL funded clearance teams worked last year. To avoid double counting of beneficiaries, they were no counted for this quarter. More beneficiaries will be reached in future tasks.</narrative>
