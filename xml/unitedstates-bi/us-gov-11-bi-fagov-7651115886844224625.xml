    <narrative xml:lang="EN">More than a decade since the conclusion of ten years of civil war and five years of civil conflict, Burundi is one of the least developed and most fragile countries in the world, with alarming levels of hunger and malnutrition that have been exacerbated by the current political crisis that started in April 2015. An ongoing refugee crisis, with over 200,000 Burundians registered in neighboring countries, is separating people from their land during harvest time and refugee returns in the future will create an increasingly complex food security and land problem. The primary goals of U.S. assistance in Burundi are promoting peace, stability, and equitable economic growth while improving the health status and social conditions of the population, reducing the high rates of chronic malnutrition, mitigating the drivers of conflict, and enhancing democratic governance and human rights. Additionally, the United States will support the professionalization of Burundi&apos;s military, which helps maintain peace and security both at home and in the region.</narrative>
