Major considerations for ILO would be to guide PCMEA to ensure that the training institute is sustainable, accessible for vulnerable communities, offer equal opportunities for women and should impart &#x2018;competency-based training&#x2019;. It should have a close link with industries as well as relevant Government institutions for smooth transition of trainees into employment. Preferably, the training institute will be established in collaboration with an existing training institution in Punjab &#x2013; including P-TEVTA or PVTC and partnership would be developed with Ministry of Textile Industries as well as other development partners.
