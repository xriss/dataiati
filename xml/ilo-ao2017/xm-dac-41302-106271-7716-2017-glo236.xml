  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Better Work, a partnership between the International Labour Organization (ILO) and the International Finance Corporation (IFC), a member of the World Bank Group (WBG), has proven that it is possible to simultaneously improve working conditions and boost competitiveness in the global apparel industry. Building on its extensive experience and understanding of what drives change in supply chains, the programme now seeks to significantly scale its impact. Better Work&#x2019;s vision is of a global garment industry that lifts millions of people out of poverty by providing decent work, empowering women, driving business competitiveness and promoting inclusive economic growth. During its next phase, Better Work will leverage existing and new partnerships to expand its impact from 3 to 8 million workers and to 21 million family members. In addition, ILO and WBG will support garment producing countries to strengthen the policy and enabling environment for decent work and competitiveness to drive positive outcomes on a much larger scale. This will be achieved through two areas of intervention. Intervention 1 is focused on influencing business practices in the global garment supply chain to: build on what works best in garment factories by focusing on services with the greatest value add, tackling the root causes of non-compliance, redoubling efforts to build worker-management dialogue, improving business competitiveness and strengthening the role of women. Influence global brands and manufacturers to adopt the business practices that drive transformational change in labour conditions and competitiveness across their supply chains. Influencing global brands and manufacturers can impact supply chains beyond the garment sector and beyond those countries where Better Work has established programmes. Intervention 2 is focused on strengthening the enabling environment for decent work by: strengthening public institutions and advancing policies at the national level by leveraging ILO and WBG to improve the enabling environment for decent work, business competitiveness and inclusive economic growth. Influencing the global policy dialogue on decent work by providing credible data and evidence to influencers and policy makers concerned with decent work in global supply chains. Activities under intervention 2 can impact public institutions.</narrative>
