  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project focusses on the implementation of policies and programmes aimed at promoting decent employment for the Syrian refugees and host communities by enhancing local capacity and delivering initial crisis impact assessments. Interventions have been including the identification of employment and training opportunities and the promotion of fundamental principles and rights at work for both refugees and host communities. The project has been implemented to enhance decent work opportunities for both refugees and host communities. Tripartite consultations has also been facilitated to promote an employment-rich response with better working and living conditions and to protect vulnerable Syrian refugee population categories such as children and women. Women cooperatives&#x2019; interventions have been supported to increase formal employability and labour market access of Syrian women refugees in Turkey. Support has been provided to enhance the institutional and operational capacities of national and local public institutions as well as employers&#x2019; and workers&#x2019; organizations to better tackle labour market challenges. Other interventions focus on increasing formal employability and labour market access of Syrian refugees in Turkey, as well as raising awareness on public employment services and the new legislation on work permits. The ILO has been active in the implementation of the UN Turkey Regional and Resilience Programme (3RP 2016-2017) jointly developed by UN agencies, which has led to the establishment of more coordinated region-wide as well as nation-wide UN response to assist the millions of Syrian refugees and local host communities. Work under this project is expected to contribute to ILO&#x2019;s efforts in localisation of SDG 1, 4, 5, 8 and 10.</narrative>
