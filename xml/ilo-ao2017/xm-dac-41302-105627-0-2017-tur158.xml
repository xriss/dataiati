   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project aims at implementing Occupational Safety and Health (OSH) standards and establishing an OSH preventive culture in Turkey. Efforts in the field of OSH which have started in 2015 are pursued to improve the knowledge and capacity of the national constituents to use national standards on OSH rights, duties and responsibilities, taking into account ILO Conventions Nos. 81, 155, 161, 187 as well as the newly ratified Conventions Nos 167 and 176. The interventions focus on enhancing the national capacity to manage OSH in line with the relevant international instruments by monitoring progress in the area of OSH through indicators (line with the Promotional Framework for Occupational Safety and Health Recommendation, 2006 (No. 197); supporting the efforts to improve the national system for collecting relevant data particularly for recording and notification of occupational accidents and diseases; enhancing awareness of the lead role of employers in building a safety culture; clarifying the roles and responsibilities of OSH professionals including occupational safety experts and occupational physicians; developing promotional materials on the main features of the Safety and Health in Construction Convention, 1988 (No. 167) and the Safety and Health in Mines Convention, 1995 (No. 176); and strengthening the capacity of stakeholders at the enterprise level to apply OSH laws and regulations. Awareness-raising activities target the judiciary and legal educators and include training on international labour standards in general and OSH standards in particular. Another specific target is the Syrian refugees aiming the review of OSH training modules and their adaptation in a way to fit the needs of Syrian refugees.</narrative>
