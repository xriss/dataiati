  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">ILO is partnering with Central Administration of Statistics (CAS) to implement the first ever Labour Force and Living Conditions Survey that will address the significant demand for data from Government agencies, international and national partners. The results of the survey are of critical importance to contribute to better implementation of various projects and to ensure that potential policies and actions are designed in such a way that they are appropriate to the real effects of the Syrian crisis. Reliable survey results will also be vital in providing baseline data to support the monitoring of the actions included under the Stabilization Framework for Lebanon. The overall objective of the action is to improve the quantity and quality of statistical information in general with specific focus on the impact of the Syrian crisis on Lebanon and in particular to social and economic data. The LFHLCS survey will be designed to produce estimates not only at the national and governorate (mohafaza) levels, but also at the level of individual districts (caza) . The survey will thus yield statistical indicators on the conditions of work and life in Lebanon that highlight regional disparities and characteristics. Such indicators are needed for policy-making and will be useful for illustrating the situation at district level, particularly since Syrian refugees tend to be concentrated in particular districts (such as the Beirut urban agglomeration or districts close to the border with Syria). This will be the first time for the CAS to undertake a household survey aimed to provide reliable estimates at the level of cazas. As a result, the LFHLCS will be the largest household survey ever carried out in Lebanon. The planned LFHLCS survey will be conducted in four quarterly rounds. It will be implemented over a period of 24 months. This period includes several months for survey planning, design and preparation, as well as several months for analysis of the data cumulated over the four quarterly rounds, and drafting and dissemination of the final survey report presenting data at the caza level. The quarterly data obtained from the survey at the national and mohafaza levels will be analysed and disseminated as soon as available.</narrative>
