  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Moldova presents low employment rates, high inactivity rate of youth, and despite a high education level, high mismatch in skills. This problem is exacerbated by the presence of high outmigration, problems for youth to find jobs, and prevalence of gender gaps in the country. To address this, the government of Moldova has been designing a National Employment Strategy for the next 8 years, this with support from both ILO and UNDP. To aid in its monitoring and implementation, the ILO will carry out actions that strengthen the capacity of social partners and ministry to monitor and evaluate employment policies, as well as support the efforts to design specific actions to support the transitions to employment, particularly for youth. Target groups would be Ministry decision makers, as well as social partners, Directors of Employment-related issues in the ministries and the Public Employment Service. The Project addresses both the NES and DWCP, as well as generating outputs to report under CPO MDA130, which states &#x201C;The Activities will seek to achieve a higher level of understanding of the correlation between employment, demographic changes and economic growth, a particularly pressing situation in Moldova, where low growth has been occurring at the same time as decreasing fertility rates, return migration flows and falling remittances&#x201D;, as well s reporting on the implementation of the NES. The two objectives are 1.1.Moldovan constituents implement a NES with a clear youth and migration focus, as well as having strengthened their capacities on macroeconomic policies for promoting more and better jobs and for tackling inequalities and; 1.2. The capacity of labour market institutions to monitor and evaluate targeted youth employment services and programmes is strengthened.</narrative>
