  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project aims to contribute to the livelihoods of Syrian refugees and host communities through improving employability and enhancing decent work opportunities in Sanliurfa, Gaziantep, Hatay, Adana and Mersin which are hosting 50 % of the Syrian refugees living in Turkey. The project has 3 objectives: Objective 1: Strengthening institutional and technical capacities at local and national levels for provision of quality employment services for Syrian refugees and host community members. Objective 2: Enhancing labour market integration of Syrian refugees and host communities through improving the enabling environment for employability and job creation. Objective 3: Raising awareness of Syrian refugees, host communities, employers and wider stakeholders on relevant legislation and the importance of formal work and enhancing the knowledge-base. Interventions focus on improving skills, increasing formal employability and labour market access of Syrian refugees in Turkey, as well as raising awareness on public employment services and the new legislation on work permits. Among the key components are vocational training based on local labour market needs, language courses, vocational guidance and counselling services to facilitate post-training job placements, employer incentive support programmes to support formal employment, establishment of one-stop employment guidance and counselling services, development of a model for recognition of prior learning for refugees, assignment of Arabic speaking support staff and Arabic language courses towards staff of relevant public institutions. The ILO Office for Turkey is working in close coordination and collaboration with a wide range of public institutions at central and local levels. Effective collaboration is developed with the Ministry of Labour and Social Security, the Ministry of National Education, the General Directorate of Lifelong Learning, the South-eastern Anatolia Project Regional Development Administration (GAP RDA), the Eastern Mediterranean Development Agency, Gaziantep Chamber of Industry, Gaziantep and Sanliurfa Unions of Chambers of Artisans and Craftsmen, Harran Governorate, Municipality of Adana, Adana Branch of Foundation for the Promotion of Vocational Training and Small Industry (MEKSA).</narrative>
