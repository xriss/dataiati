  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The programme aims to reach a total of 700 children, Syrians and Jordanians, (at least 25% girls) under the age of 18 involved in the Worst Forms of Child Labour (WFCL) in the selected hosting communities and sectors will be rehabilitated among which 400 (again at least 25% girls) will be prevented from entering work. The targeting of vulnerable children will be undertaken in consultation with the ILO national survey currently being carried out by the Jordanian Strategic Centre for Studies and Research within the USDOL funded project. It focuses on both Syrian and Jordanian families. The project will aim also at reaching at least 300 families of the most vulnerable children working in WFCL in the hosting communities. Overall Objective: Reduce the number of working and dropout children among Syrian refugees and hosting communities through the provision of direct services. These services include educational, recreational, pre-vocational counseling and vocational training (See Annex 1 for details of Direct Services) Immediate Outcomes and Outputs Outcome 1:700 working children (25% girls), out of which 400 vulnerable children protected from early entry to labour market and 300 withdrawn from the WFCL. 1.1 Identify children and refer them to the service providers centres in the selected locations. 1.2Provide group based counseling services to the ex-child labourers and drop outs 1.3 Establish monitoring mechanisms at the workplace, in school and with families, to ensure sustainable withdrawal, and report progress on the database 1.4 Set-up recreational activities and art therapy activities and ensure children&#x2019;s attendance 1.5 Develop and operate the educational support programmes for children with different educational needs in the selected areas 1.6 Provide programs of Basic Life Skills, art therapy and SCREAM modules The project is expected to deliver the following measurable and sustainable results: 1. Sample based tracer study cases are organized with targeted children to identify the intervention with greater impact, and the best intervention model is documented for replication. 2. 400 vulnerable students will be prevented from dropping out of school. 3. 300 children involved in the WFCL will be provided with needed remedial services. 4. 700 parents will have their awareness raised regarding the OSH and WFCL and the importance of quality education as a long term investment and provided with socio-economical services through referral paths. 5. At least 100 school teachers and counsellors will have their capacity enhanced on how to prevent children from early drop out. 6. 1,000 of the children siblings and local communities will have their awareness raised on the negative impact of CL incorporating SCREAM modules who will act as advocates within their schools and local communities.</narrative>
