   <narrative xml:lang="EN">To ensure the relevance of skills training, involvement of industry and other stakeholders, necessitates facilitation throughout the development of all key features of that system, which is a slow and long process, as such process faces a wide array of challenges such as encompassing infrastructure deficiencies, industry relevance, professional development needs, quality assurance, low status and poor governance. In Myanmar&#x2019;s context, it is still at the very early stage of industry involvement, and the keystone to success will be to improve the capacity that industry has to provide inputs on the quality and relevance of skills trainings. The STED methodology supports this objective by firstly undertaking an in-depth mapping of where the industry stands and what it can offer in terms of skills training capacity, and also by providing practical interventions. The methodology targets to assess two sectors that have potential to make substantial contributions to export development and diversification, or need to improve competitiveness in the face of foreign competition. They can be sectors that are still in their infancy, or established sectors with potential to diversify, for example through better products or new markets. The process chain of the STED covers assessment and analysis of statistical data, collecting qualitative information through to building capacity on sector social dialogue and labor market information systems. At each step along the chain, the ILO will ensure the involvement of tripartite partners in order to lay a foundation for social dialogue on skills and better policy coherence based on a strategic vision for a sector&#x2019;s future. This will be done through the formation of a project committee and at a later stage, the enhancement of the sector-based body. In the end of the chain, a comprehensive assessment report will be delivered with recommendations on next interventions that are agreeable by all stakeholders</narrative>
