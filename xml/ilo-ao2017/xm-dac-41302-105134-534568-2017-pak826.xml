   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project will assist the workers and employers of selected target factories to work together to design and implement a workplace improvement plan, with the aim of achieving improvements in working conditions and productivity. This will be done through workplace cooperation i.e. social dialogue, building on existing bipartite structures at the workplace where they already exist. At the initial stage, the participating companies will create a workplace cooperation structure, i.e. the workplace improvement committee (WIC). The composition of WIC will be (i) the relevant managers; (ii) trade union representatives where the factory has union membership; and (iii) workers&#x2019; representatives, where they are elected by the workers. The WIC shall undertake an initial assessment of the issues that require improvement with regards to an array of labour laws, safety and health, and productivity matters. National Labour Laws compliance gaps and areas of improvement will be identified. Following this initial assessment, workplace improvement plan (WIP) will be designed for each participating company, with clear indicators of progress to measure improvement. A gender mainstreaming strategy within the context of the overall project goal will be developed. The concerns and needs of women workers&#x2019; will be ensured through training courses in proportion to their number in factories; issues such as sexual harassment, gender equality and discrimination would be part of training curricula; women will be part of workplace improvement committees; and will support factories in developing gender inclusive policies. In year-1, Minimum of 10 textile factories would be included in the programme, followed by 15 in year-2, 20 in year-3 and it will be gradually increased with every year to cover all member factories of PTEA. The number of targeted factories can be increased depending on the scope of work, recruitment of monitors and the baseline gap assessment.</narrative>
