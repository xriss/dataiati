   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project will be implemented by UNESCO, in close consultation with the Working Group on Human Rights &#x2013; a thematic WG of the UN Country Team that brings together most of the resident UN agencies as its members, and is chaired by UNESCO. The group will have quarterly meetings, which will be used to monitor the progress of the project and to explore possibilities of cooperation with the activities of the other UN agencies in this field. Through the Human Rights Working Group, UNESCO will work with two key partner agencies &#x2013; ILO and WHO, to add value to the capacity-building workshops for the local stakeholders: &#x2022; ILO, building on its previous achievements in increasing the institutional capacities of DPOs to promote the disability rights as enshrined in the UNCRPD, will provide expertise and resources for the training and open dialogue modules as part of the Network&#x2019;s capacity-building. The modules will focus on priority issues identified by the specific municipalities and local DPOs, such as: Disability and Employment; Finance and Budgeting for Non-Profit Organizations; Communication, Negotiation and Presentation Skills (Media Training); Project Cycle management (PCM); UNCRPD and Legal Framework for Disability in Indonesia. &#x2022; WHO, using its experience within the Phase I on strengthening the capacity of the national stakeholders for disability data collection, and developing a data collection module for national bureau of statistics (BPS), will shift the focus to the municipal level to build the capacity of local institutions and authorities in using data for effective policy design and implementation. Towards this end, it will develop a disability data module, based on the one developed for BPS and on the internationally standardized methodology, as part of the joint capacity-building interventions targeting the Network of Mayors for Inclusive Cities and the relevant local DPOs. UNESCO will liaise with the government of Indonesia at the national level, as well as with the municipal authorities on the local level. It will facilitate the consolidation of the network through the elements designed to ensure its cohesion and sustainability (such as the Charter, the Secretariat, and the Achievement Recognition Scheme). It will also ensure the expansion of the Network by assisting the newly established Secretariat in promoting the Network nationally, by organizing the High Level Meetings of Mayors and by inviting to them prospective new members. UNESCO Office in Jakarta will also work closely with the Headquarters (Section of Research, Policy and Foresight, Sector for Social and Human Sciences) on the incorporation of the policy outputs of this project into the global policy tool &#x2013; Inclusive Policy Laboratory.</narrative>
