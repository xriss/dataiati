  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Between 2006-2011, the ILO office was implementing an Education and Skills Training Project for Youth Employment (ILO EAST) in six provinces in Indonesia including West Papua. The project provided improved services to in-school and out-of school youth in the fields of life skills/ job and education counseling/ vocational skills/ entrepreneurship, in order to facilitate school to work transition and promote youth employment opportunities. As the ILO East and BP Beau Ltd shared some common vision for supporting the development of employment opportunities for out-of-school youth in West Papua through livelihoods promotion, both parties realized that collaboration between both the programmes implemented by ILO and BP would facilitate better delivery of the vocational and entrepreneurship programme in Bintuni Bay area where BP has operations and long term plans for human development. In 2011-2012, under the Agreement between The International Labour Organization and BP Berau Ltd. For Youth Enterpreneurship Development in Teluk Bintuni, West Papua on 30 May 2011, the ILO has successfully implement entrepreneurship development program in Teluk Bintuni. This new concept note will continue the work that has been done by ILO and BP in Teluk Bintuni Area. Referring the Agreement between The International Labour Organization and BP Berau Ltd. For Youth Enterpreneurship Development in Teluk Bintuni, West Papua on 30 May 2011 and based on recent discussion between the ILO and BP Berau Ltd, this ToR outlines additional outputs to be conducted by the ILO for the activities in Teluk Bintuni in West Papua, keeping the same outcome of the project: Outcome 1 &#x201C;Access of disadvantaged youth to relevant and market-oriented livelihood skills development opportunities and entrepreneurship development is increased.
