   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Formalizing Access to the Legal Labour Market Through Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) and Certification for Syrians and Jordanians Working in Construction, Confectionary and Garment Sectors</narrative>

  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This intervention will give 13,550 beneficiaries (80% Syrians and 20% Jordanians) in Amman, Irbid, Zarqa and Mafraq governorates the opportunity to access the formal labour market and decent work by: (a) facilitating the access of Syrian refugees to work permits (b) supporting job seekers to enhance skills or certifying existing skills through training and recognition of prior learning in construction, confectionary and garment sectors, and (c) addressing gender disparity in labour force participation through promote separate employment. As part of the implementation of the Jordan Compact, the project seeks to devise mechanisms whereby Syrian refugees and Jordanians will be better matched with available jobs, have access to work permits, and benefit from decent wages and working conditions. Construction, confectionary and garment have been identified as priority sectors for the project due to the large number of Syrians already working informally and their inclusion as eligible sectors under the EU-Jordan trade agreement. Based on past work, it is clear that the sectors need models to ensure Syrian refugees and Jordanians are formally employed under decent work conditions that promote their full development potential. Skills training will be provided to help Syrian refugees and Jordanians develop and accredit demand-driven skills and thus support better job matching. Competency standards, curriculum and training materials will be created and upgraded in close collaboration with the Center for Accreditation and Quality Assurance (CAQA), the National Employment and Training (NET) Company and other training providers. The project will support access of Syrian refugee beneficiaries to work permits through five Guidance and Support Offices (GSOs) distributed in five locations, namely; Amman, Irbid, Zarqa, Karak and Mafraq governorates. These GSOs will be equipped and staffed; the project will provide standard inception training for the new staff. The employment services that will be implemented included job placement, awareness about worker rights, decent work principles and occupational safety and health. The project will support both Syrian refugees and Jordanians through three types of training and certification: RPL programs, on-the-job vocational training programs, and Training and certification of technical trainers in construction occupations.</narrative>
