   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Poor and marginalised communities are vulnerable to a wide range of shocks and stresses. Growing inequality and the persistent exclusion of the poorest from the benefits of economic growth increases their vulnerability. A major cause of poverty and vulnerability is inadequate levels of income and persistent irregular employment. People at the &#x2018;bottom of the pyramid&#x2019; are often excluded from productive activities, and have limited access to essential public services. In Viet Nam, despite the economic growth in the last decades and an increasing trend to formalization, informal economy workers still represent about 70 per cent of the working group, and more than 12 million people living below the national poverty line. Poverty has a higher incidence in rural areas, particularly affecting ethnic minorities. The coverage gaps in terms of adequate social protection are still significant. For instance, around 70 per cent of people from the age of 60 to 79 still do not benefit from any social transfer from the Government. Besides no provision for families with children are in place. By providing poorer households with an income, social protection instruments and basic access for physical infrastructure, including access to markets, will enable people to obtain better prices and incomes and increase their productive investments notably in health and education. In addition, the ILO, over the last four decades, advocated for employment intensive investment approaches in job-rich sectors and has developed technical and managerial tools for effective adaption and rollout of these approaches including Employment Impact Assessment (EmpIA) tool, Integrated Rural Accessibility Planning (IRAP), Technical and Managerial guidelines (for programme managers, supervisory staff and local enterprises), Productivity norms for labour-based construction, Trainer&apos;s toolbox of training techniques, Rapid assessment of poverty impacts (RAPI) as well as the biggest depository/database for Innovative EI technology and works method. This programme will directly benefit poor and vulnerable communities in Zambia, Malawi, Mozambique, Tanzania and Viet Nam.</narrative>
