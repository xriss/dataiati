   <narrative xml:lang="EN">- Access to Broadband: The Project addresses the growing demand for fiber communications and its supporting infrastructure. - Shared infrastructure: As mobile operators are under pressure to improve their networks, niche operators like Internexa are well positioned to provide basic infrastructure services to such Mobile Network Operators (&quot;MNO&quot;). For telecom operators, infrastructure sharing benefits include reduced capex which translate into lower cost of service. Infrastructure sharing is critical in further fueling the evolution of the telecom market, indirectly assisting in the development of broadband services, content and applications, mobile finance and mobile advertising, as several industry segments begin converging. - Reduce Pricing / Increase competition: By supporting a small operator, IFC would be contributing towards fuelling competition and reducing communication prices. Today, a country like Brazil still has one of the highest tariffs for broadband services in the region.  - South - South Project: IFC would be supporting a Colombian Sponsor to undertake a regional Project, further contributing to regional integration. When fully operational, Brazilian operations for ITX may represent up to three times the size of their telecoms business in Colombia.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">As part of its ongoing regional expansion, Internexa S.A. (&quot;ITX&quot; or the Sponsor), a Colombian neutral carrier of carriers, has targeted Brazil as its main source of growth for the next five years. ITXs strategy is to expand its operations in the country through strategic investments in fiber optic network, equipment and operational assets that will complement an already existing operation that includes 3,300kms of fiber optic cable connecting Rio de Janeiro, Belo Horizonte, Sao Paulo, Curitiba and Porto Alegre. The latter also serves as connection point to ITXs approximately 22,000kms fiber optic network that provides fiber optic access to clients in Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Chile, Argentina and Brazil.   ITX has envisioned a five year multiphase project that seeks to increase supply, redundancy and competition for telecoms transmission infrastructure while offering connectivity opportunities to the Sponsors clients in Brazil and other Latin American countries. ITX&#xB4;s expansion brings additional connectivity and redundancy opportunities to smaller operators that do not have the capacity to build their own network.   Overall, the proposed project will help the Sponsor to ramp up operations by consolidating its position as backbone and metropolitan carrier. With the increased capacity and connectivity, ITX will be able to provide carrier services not only at Brazil level, but also to clients in the Southern Cone and Andean Region that are already using the Sponsors extensive fiber optic network.</narrative>
