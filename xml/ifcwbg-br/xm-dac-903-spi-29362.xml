   <narrative xml:lang="EN">- Poverty Reduction and Increase in Access to Finance: the project is expected to have a high development impact. It is expected to be significant in terms of its support for micro and small businesses and employment generation in areas and among populations that are underserved by the formal banking system. Tribanco follows Martins Group to the most remote and neglected urban and rural areas of Brazil, where many people (small shops and end consumers) have virtually no access to financial services. The proposed investment will support Tribanco&apos;s role as a pioneer bank that is widening access to credit in remote and under-privileged sectors of the economy. 

- Corporate Governance: the project is expected to contribute to the improvement of market governance standards, particularly as this is a family-held bank, in which IFC would become the first minority investor. This is a very important step for the Family and will represent an important contribution to the development of corporate governance standards in Tribanco.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Established in 1990, Banco Tri&#xE2;ngulo S.A. (Tribanco or the Bank) is a niche, medium-sized bank, which plays an important role in providing financial services to MSMEs and low income individuals. Its target market is mostly composed of clients that are served by the Integrated Martins System (IMS), which is a group of companies related to the Bank that provide wholesale distribution, training and financing services and represent the largest supply chain in Brazil. As of December 2009, Tribanco posted total assets of R$1.7 billion and credit portfolio of R$1.2 billion, with net income of R$42 million. In March 2010, the Banks total assets remained at R$1.7 billion, credit portfolio totaled R$1.1 billion and net income reached R$13 million in the first quarter of the year.

IFCs investment will comprise a financial package of up to R$38 million (equivalent to $21 million) equity investment in the Bank (the Project).  The Projects proceeds will help an existing IFC client, with a long and successful track record, to continue to expand its supply of innovative financial services for the MSME segment.</narrative>
