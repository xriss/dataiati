   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Affero Lab Participa&#xE7;&#xF5;es S.A. (Affero Lab or The Company), a Brazilian education company and the leader in the corporate training market in Brazil, provides training solutions for corporations through Business to Business (B2B) model. It was formed in 2013 through the merger of the two largest companies in the corporate education sector in Brazil, Affero, which was specialized in online training, content and knowledge management, and Lab SSJ, whose expertise was classroom/instructor led training.  Affero Labs is undertaking a 5-year Investment Plan (the Project), which comprises organic growth and expansion of current operations and the development of new vertical partnerships. In addition, potential acquisitions in the domestic and international markets are also a possibility but will depend on asset availability and valuation.</narrative>
