Technical Partner and/or Major Shareholders    	Fleury is owned by 19 physicians with approximately equal participation in the company&apos;&apos;s capital.  It is organized as a limited partnership under the laws of Brazil.  As part of its business strategy, Fleury  plans to incorporate and become a stock company (&quot;Sociedade Anonima&quot;) and eventually be publicly traded on the Sao Paulo stock exchange.  Seventeen of the Fleury partners are also quota holders of Transinc, a company which owns the land and building in which part of the existing operations exist.    Project Cost Including proposed IFC investment    	Total project cost is estimated at about US$58.0 million.  IFC&apos;&apos;s proposed investment is expected to be in the form of up to US$9  million in an A Loan and an equity investment of up to US$6 million.     Location of project and Description of site    	The project will be located throughout the metropolitan area of the city of Sao Paulo, in the State of Sao Paulo and in capitals of major States.     Description of Company and Purpose of Project    	Fleury is a fully accredited and certified clinical laboratory with extensive experience in clinical laboratory testing and diagnostic clinics.  It also has technical partnerships with prestigious international clinics, such as the Mayo Clinic, for exams which are not available in-house.    	Fleury plans, over the next 2 and a half years, to establish a new main laboratory center which will replace its existing laboratory. They also plan to build 8 new collection and diagnostic centers (CDC, or the &quot;units&quot;), in the city of Sao Paulo, in the State of Sao Paulo, and in capitals of major States, as well as to renovate their existing units.    Environmental Category and Issues    	This is a category B project according to IFC&apos;&apos;s environmental and social review procedure.  Environmental and social issues associated with this project include:  site selection and site environmental and social (including land ownership and land use) conditions, handling and disposal of medical materials including bio-hazardous waste, liquid waste treatment and disposal, air emissions from boilers and incinerators, solid waste treatment and disposal, employee exposure to toxic and/or radioactive materials, employee health and safety training, CFCs, power and water supply, and fire protection.&quot;   The sponsor has presented plans to address these issues and demonstrate that the proposed project will comply with applicable governmental and World Bank requirements.  The new laboratory facility will be constructed on an empty lot acquired on a willing seller - willing buyer basis.  The units will be located on rented property or Fleurys property.  Liquid effluents generated at Fleurys will be pre-treated prior to their discharge into the Sabesp sewage system.  Special collection of contaminated liquid effluents generated from the technical areas will have treatment of these waters provided by a private contractor.  Domestic solid waste will be collected by private contractors to be disposed at a municipal landfill.  The contaminated residues will be collected in white plastic containers according to ABNT standards and incinerated.  Fleury confirms that CFC based equipment will not be used.  Training programs to ensure employee safety will be held.  Fleury will incorporate fire safety measures in all its facilities including, automatic sprinkler system, signaling for area of abandonment, and manual fire extinguishers.
