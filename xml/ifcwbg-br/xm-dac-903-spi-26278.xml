  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Ruralfone is a Brazilian company which provides low cost basic telephone service to customers in small cities under the band name Local. The company launched operations in 2005 and has successfully implemented an innovative business model in two small cities in the state of Ceara in the northeast of the country. The company now wishes to expand its operations to cover more cities.     The project will finance the expansion of the Local services to an additional 10 cities. IFC has invited to participate in this project with an equity/quasi equity instrument.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project will have a significant development impact on the target areas:  - Increased connectivity: Ruralfone has already increased teledensity by 65% in the two twons where it is active, reaching 12% penetration. 75% of subscribers did not have a fixed line prior to acquiring service from Ruralfone. Further growth is still expected as national penetration average is over 20%. A repetition of these results in other cities is expected.  - Improvement of local economy and business environment: Small business entrepreneurs and service providers have seen an increase in productivity from better connectivity to the local population as a result of faster business transactions and better information. About one third of Ruralfone lines are taken by local SMEs as their business line.  - Local employment and skills generation: Ruralfone has a decentralized structure. It hires and train management from the local population, building important skills for the local people in the process.  - Improved social and government services:  In the towns where the company operates, the local government has been able to increase by more than ten times the number of telephone lines it operates, improving accessibility to the community and response times. Additionally, the cost effective service has allowed local governments to provide additional social benefits such as hot lines for violence against women and children, tourist information lines, etc.  - Increased local tax revenues:  Ruralfone has become one of the highest VAT contributors in the cities where it operates.  A repetition of all of these results in other cities is expected.</narrative>
