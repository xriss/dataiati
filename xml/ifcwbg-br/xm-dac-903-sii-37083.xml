   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Founded in 2003, GAEC Educa&#xE7;&#xE3;o S.A. (also known as Anima or the Company) is a publicly-listed Brazilian education company that operates private universities, executive education, and distance learning in various segments and regions of the national market. Its geographic focus for on-campus education is southeastern Brazil, principally the states of S&#xE3;o Paulo and Minas Gerais, but some of its businesses and products are national in nature. As of August 2015, it had 16 campuses under different brand names in different cities serving approximately 86,000 students. Their higher education brands are UNA, UniBH, Unimonte, and Universidade S&#xE3;o Judas Tadeu. In addition, Anima provides continuing and executive training through its brand HSM, and it is starting its distance learning programs under the brand UNA Virtual, already serving 384 students as of June 2015. The investment project with IFC intends to support the companys expansion plans.</narrative>
