   <narrative xml:lang="EN">(i) Foster competition: PTB becoming a scalable player in the region will promote competition in those markets currently dominated by large independent tower operators. Competition among the independent tower operators will allow smaller wireless operators to benefit from reduced barriers to entry as they will have access to leased tower infrastructure for more competitive prices, rather than incurring large capex for this purpose on their own. (ii) Increased wireless penetration in the region: The construction of additional telecommunication towers will allow mobile operators to expand the service both in terms of capacity and geographic coverage. In addition, towers sharing will drive down the incremental cost of expanding coverage for all carriers therefore allow operators to make the services more affordable. (iii) Access to ICT technologies: PTB tower network will support mobile cellular networks but also wireless broadband and backhaul networks, hence improving the penetration of ICT technologies. (iv) Mitigate environmental impact: IFC will ensure that PTB develops and implements proper E&amp;S policies and procedures as it continues to grow its footprint in the region. (v) Job creation: the project will contribute to both direct and indirect job creation.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Phoenix Tower do Brasil (PTB) is an independent wireless infrastructure operator based in Brazil. PTB is an affiliate of Phoenix Tower International, headquartered in the United States of America and with existing operations across several countries in Latin America. PTIs strategy and business plan is to own and operate strategic wireless infrastructure in those markets, which are characterized by strong wireless growth, strong underlying real estate rights, while leasing those towers to multi-national and investment grade mobile network operators, which face significant capital expenditure needs in order to enhance and grow their wireless networks.   PTB is seeking IFC debt financing of up to US$20 million on own account. The debt investment will support PTB to fund the acquisition and build to suit construction program of tower assets in Brazil, accelerating the growth of its footprint in Brazil (the &quot;Project).</narrative>
