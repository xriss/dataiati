  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">BBM has a widely acknowledged expertise in credit operations, particularly involving mid-sized corporate borrowers.  Furthermore, the Bank has targeted growth in credit operations as a strategic priority for the next several years.  Thus, given the success of BBMs credit expansion in the recent past, BBM II will play an important role in further broadening BBMs credit activities involving clients who may not currently have access to adequate funding from large banks or the capital markets.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Banco BBM S.A. (BBm, the Bank or Banco BBM), which was founded in 1858 and is the countrys oldest private-sector bank, is one of Brazils leading medium-size financial institutions.  It provides a range of credit, loan, and derivative products to smaller as well as mid-sized corporates; has an active  but prudently managed  proprietary trading business; and offers third-party asset management services to investors.  As a result of its long history and very conservative business culture, BBMs operations are characterized by robust credit structuring skills, as well as state-of-the-art risk management systems.  In June 2006, IFC committed and disbursed to Banco BBM the local currency-equivalent of US$50 million, in order to support expansion of the Banks credit activities involving mid-sized corporate borrowers (the Original Credit or BBM I).  This was the first, major, long-tenor credit transaction undertaken by IFC aimed at supporting the operations of a medium-size Brazilian bank.  It was also the first, significant, local currency-indexed debt financing executed by IFC in Brazil.  With an increase of nearly 100% from June 2005 to June 2006, the expansion of BBMs credit portfolio has exceeded expectations.  As a result of this growth, the Original Credit has been fully drawn down, and the Bank is currently seeking additional long-tenor funding.    The project involves a subscription by IFC of a second cross-border, local currency-indexed note to be issued by BBM, for an amount up to $50 million-equivalent. The relevant credit exposure will have a bullet maturity of 7 years.  Funding proceeds from the transaction will be used by the Bank to further expand its lending activities involving mid-sized corporates.  Furthermore, the project will require BBM to book a certain percentage of the transactions funding proceeds as loans with longer tenors than it extends on average at present, and to also on-lend a percentage of transaction funding proceeds to smaller corporates (with sales below a predetermined threshold).</narrative>
