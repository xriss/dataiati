   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Summary Of Project Information (SPI)       Project Name    BRAZIL:  Saraiva S.A. Livreiros Editores (Saraiva)            Region    Latin America and the Caribbean        Sector       Project No008141   Projected Board DateDecember 15, 1997   Company NameSaraiva S.A. Livreiros Editores (Saraiva)   Technical Partner and/or Major Shareholders    	Saraiva is a listed company on the S&#xE3;o Paulo stock exchange (BOVESPA).  The Company is controlled by the Saraiva family and the Companys management, who together own 96% of Saraivas common shares and 7% of the preferred shares.  Institutional and other local private investors own the remaining shares in the Company.    Project Cost Including proposed IFC investment    	The estimated project cost is US$42.6 million.  The proposed IFC investment consists of a US$10 million loan and a US$3 million equity investment, both for its own account.    Location of project and Description of site    	The project consists of the construction of eight new mega-bookstores which will be located in the cities of S&#xE3;o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro.  The project also contemplates upgrades of information systems in existing stores.     Description of Company and Purpose of Project   (include IFCs Role and Development Impact)    	Saraiva is a leading Brazilian publisher of educational and legal books.  In addition to book publishing activities, the Saraiva group owns a chain of bookstores and has a small but growing electronic data publishing business.                                                          Saraiva will be pioneering the mega-bookstore concept in Brazil.  The project will positively impact the educational sector in Brazil, which has some of the lowest educational indicators in Latin America.  Brazilian students and teachers will have better access to quality instructional and learning materials, both printed and electronic, which will complement Government of Brazil and World Bank initiatives aimed at improving education in Brazil.                                                With annual sales of US$151 million, Saraiva is a relatively small company by Brazilian standards. IFCs involvement is important as Saraiva is unable to raise the required long-term financing from commercial institutions to fund the project.         Environmental Category and Issues    	This is a category B project according to IFCs environmental review procedure because there are very minor environmental issues associated with the expansion and modernization of existing small bookstores or the opening of new bookstores in existing shopping malls in urban areas.  Environmental due diligence of the Sponsors publishing business, which is not part of IFCs investment, will be carried out during appraisal to verify that the corporate sponsor is complying with local environmental laws and regulations in related operations.  For the bookstores, the sponsors will be required to certify that the shops will be operated in accordance with appropriate fire codes and fire safety measures.
