   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Enel Wind Brazil (the Project) comprises the development, construction and operation of 12 wind power plants (the Sub-Projects) located in five clusters across three states of Brazils northeast totaling approximately 342MW of installed capacity. The capital expenditures required to implement the Project total approximately US $600 million. Enel Brasil Participa&#xE7;&#xF5;es (EBP or the Company), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Enel Green Power (EGP or the Sponsor), is developing each wind power plant through fully owned Special Purpose Entities (SPEs) and has successfully secured Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) in a blend of 20 year regulated market contracts (Regulated PPAs) and medium-term Free Market contracts (Free Market PPAs). The Regulated PPAs were awarded in the Brazilian power auctions of 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013. The off-taker in these PPAs is the Brazilian wholesale energy market, comprised of a pool of Brazilian distribution companies. The Company will also sell approximately a third of the energy production under contracts negotiated with large energy users/power distribution companies in Brazils free energy market. EBP has ordered the turbines from top-class manufacturers and started construction of the projects which are expected to become operational over the next 24 months.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Project fits with the WBG strategy of supporting greater private sector participation in Brazil&apos;&apos;s power sector as a means to improve its efficiency and long-term sustainable development. The Project will contribute to the development of wind energy in Brazil, which is needed to meet growing power demand, while at the same time reducing reliance on thermal energy and large hydro generation. The Project will also help the development of the poorer Northeast region of Brazil by installing 342 MW of power generation capacity in this region, contributing to job creation and climate change mitigation.</narrative>
