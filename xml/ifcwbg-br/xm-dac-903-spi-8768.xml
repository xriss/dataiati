RPs remaining common shares and its preferred shares are held by a number of Brazilian institutional investors.    Project Cost Including Proposed IFC Investment    	Total project cost is estimated at US$69 million. IFC is considering a total investment of US$25 million including an &quot;A &quot; Loan of US$7 million and a &quot;C&quot; Loan of US$3 million, both for its own account, and a &quot;B&quot; Loan of US$15 million, for the account of participating banks.    Location of Project and Description of Site    	The proposed project will be carried out at Randons existing sites in Caxias do Sul, a small city in the State of Rio Grande do Sul, and Sao Paulo in Brazil and in Rosario, Argentina.    Description of Company and Purpose of Project   (include IFCs Role and Development Impact)    	Randon is a Brazilian manufacturer of truck trailers and semi-trailers. The Company also produces axles and suspensions for heavy-duty trucks. Randon is a medium-sized company with estimated 1997 sales of US$252 million.  The Company is planning to undertake a modernization and expansion program in order to respond to anticipated growth in demand as well as the threat of new competition.  The Project will enable Randon to increase its capacity for the production of trailers/semi-trailers from 45 units a day to 70 units a day.  At the same time, the Company will double its capacity for the production of axles and suspensions.  Randon will also build a small new assembly plant in Argentina in order to better serve that market.  In addition to providing long-term financing which is not easily available to Randon from other sources, IFC will endeavor to introduce the Company to the international syndicated loan market through the proposed B Loan.  IFC will also advise the Company on corporate governance issues and environmental management.  The benefits of the project should include: (i) the creation of a stronger Brazilian company, better able to withstand competition from abroad; (ii) generation of new jobs as the Company expands its operations; and (iii) the provision of much needed additional transportation capacity for goods in Brazil.
