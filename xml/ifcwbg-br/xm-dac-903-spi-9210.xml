   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Summary Of Project Information (SPI)       Project Name:    Brazil -  Concession&#xE1;ria do Sistema Anhang&#xFC;era-Bandeirantes S.A.      Region:    Latin America and Caribbean        Sector:    Transportation      Project No:009210   Projected Board Date:June 17, 1999   Company Name:Concession&#xE1;ria do Sistema Anhang&#xFC;era-Bandeirantes S.A. (AutoBAn)   Technical Partner and/or Major Shareholders    The shareholders of AutoBAn are the following five companies: Camargo Corr&#xEA;a Transportes S.A., Construtora Andrade Gutierrez S.A., Odebrecht Servi&#xE7;os de Infra-estrutura Ltda., SVE Participa&#xE7;&#xF5;es S.A., and Serveng-Civilsan S.A.  Empresas Associadas de Engenharia.  Camargo Corr&#xEA;a Transportes S.A. is a fully-owned subsidiary of Camargo Corr&#xEA;a S.A., the holding company of the Camargo Corr&#xEA;a Group; Odebrecht Servi&#xE7;os de Infra-estrutura Ltda. is a fully-owned subsidiary of Odebrecht S.A., the holding company of the Odebrecht Group; and SVE Participa&#xE7;&#xF5;es S.A. is a special purpose company created by Servix Engenharia S.A. and Via Engenharia S.A. to invest in AutoBAn.  Camargo Corr&#xEA;a S.A., Construtora Andrade Gutierrez S.A., and Odebrecht S.A. are three of Brazil&apos;&apos;s leading construction groups.    Project Cost Including Proposed IFC Investment    	Project cost is estimated at approximately US$514 million equivalent for the 4-year period May 1998-June 2002.  IFC&apos;&apos;s proposed investment in AutoBAn consists of an IFC A-loan for the Corporation&apos;&apos;s own account of up to US$35 million, and an IFC B-loan of up to US$38 million for the account of participants.     Location of Project and Description of Site    	Located in the State of S&#xE3;o Paulo, the AutoBAn highway system comprises the Anhang&#xFC;era and Bandeirantes roads.  The Anhang&#xFC;era road is a 147-km highway linking the industrial cities of S&#xE3;o Paulo, Jundia&#xED;, Campinas and Limeira; the Bandeirantes road is a 89-km highway linking S&#xE3;o Paulo, Jundia&#xED; and Campinas.  The highway system under the 20-year concession also comprises the Don Gabriel Paulino Bueno Couto connection, linking the Anhang&#xFC;era and Bandeirantes roads over a 2.6-km distance near Jundia&#xED;.  The existing AutoBAn highway system comprises 238.6 km of roads and five toll plazas.    Description of Company and Purpose of Project    	The project consists of the rehabilitation and modernization of the existing Anhang&#xFC;era and Bandeirantes roads; the construction of a 78.5-km stretch extending the Bandeirantes road from Campinas to Limeira; and the installation of three new toll plazas, two on the extension of the Bandeirantes road between Campinas and Limeira and one on the existing Anhang&#xFC;era road between Campinas and Limeira.  At project completion, the AutoBAn highway system will comprise 317.1 km of roads and 8 toll plazas.     Environmental Category and Issues    This is an environmental and social review category A project.  Key issues associated with this project include: corporate environmental and social management program, siting and right-of-way for new alignment, including alternatives analysis, land expropriation causing physical and economic displacement, erosion and sediment control and watershed protection, environmental compensation  reforestation, air and noise impacts during construction and operation, operation of project-related maintenance shops and other facilities, monitoring programs during construction and operation, and safety and emergency preparedness.    	The Government in 1993/1995 prepared an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) for the Bandeirantes extension project, including an analysis of route alternatives.  Updated environmental analysis for the final configuration of the extension project is contained in an Installation License application that AutoBAn submitted to the Environmental State Secretariat of S&#xE3;o Paulo in November 1998.  AutoBAn must also submit smaller environmental documents for lane additions and intersection improvements that will be constructed within the current right-of-way (ROW) on the existing highways.  AutoBAn has prepared a comprehensive Environmental Management Plan (EMP) for the operation of the entire Anhang&#xFC;era-Bandeirantes concession.  AutoBAn has also developed a Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) to meet IFC&apos;&apos;s requirements under OD 4.30, Involuntary Resettlement, for land that is privately owned and must be expropriated and for relocation of fruit vending stalls occupying the ROW.     	The EIA Documents for the project were released to the InfoShop on April 3, 1999.  Consultation, mainly in the form of public hearings, with affected people has been underway since preparation of the initial EIA in 1993; the final alignment of the extension was developed through this process. The major documents were disclosed to the public in Brazil as part of the local process. Local disclosure has included newspaper publication of the Installation License in January 1999 and announcements of the availability of the EMP and RAP in AutoBAns newsletter which is distributed at toll booths.  Additional newspaper announcements were ongoing during April 1999.    	     Date SPI sent to PIC     May 18, 1999      This Summary of Project Information is prepared and distributed to the public in advance of consideration of the proposed transaction by the Corporations Board of Directors.  It is provided for the purpose of enhancing the transparency of IFCs activities and should not be construed as presuming the outcome of IFC Board consideration.
