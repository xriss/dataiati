   <narrative xml:lang="EN">IFC will support Daycoval to increase access to finance for SMEs including underserved segments such as Women Owned SMEs and Underserved Region SMEs. In Brazil, credit penetration has been one of the most important issues in financial sector development given the structural barriers and lack of incentives for banks to go down the market. There is a SME finance gap is estimated at $437 billion in Brazil (24.7% of GDP), 3x of the current stock of SME loans outstanding. The economic crisis of the last few years has further accentuated the already considerable finance gap as the MSME portfolio of the Brazilian banking sector has declined from $210 billion as of December 2015 to $124 billion as of September 2020, representing a 16% reduction in local currency. The Project will support Daycoval to continue addressing the financing gaps faced by SMEs in the country, through its targeted focus on underserved segments.

IFC anticipates that the Project will contribute to an increased inclusiveness of the SME financing market in Brazil. Historically, the SME financing market has been considered inefficient, due to a number of issues such as lack of financial infrastructure elevating the cost of lending, and the large presence of SOEs limiting competition. The Project ultimately intends to contribute to attenuating the potential flight to quality, or a retrenchment of banks from the SME financing markets, given the higher risk profile of the segment. Daycoval actively participates in the government programs to serve SMEs, while it especially tries to reach beyond general SMEs expanding into underserved segments. In particular, the Project aims to expand into the underserved regions, where the credit penetration was already lower than the national average in the pre-crisis period. The Project will encourage the other banks to go down the market to increase their exposure to SMEs from the underserved regions.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project consists of an A loan of up to US$130 million and mobilization from B lenders for up to US$270 million, to Banco Daycoval S.A. (Daycoval or the Bank). The proceeds will be used to finance small and medium enterprises (SMEs) enhancing their sustainability through financial inclusion (the Project). A portion of the loan will be channeled to specific sub-segments (i) a minimum of 20% of the loan will be on-lent to women-owned SMEs (WSMEs) and (ii) a minimum of 30% of the loan will be on-lent to SMEs located in financially underserved regions of Brazil (Underserved Region SMEs).</narrative>
