   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Satipel, a medium-sized, family-owned company, is one of Brazil&apos;&apos;s leading manufacturers of particleboard.  In 2001, the company produced 490,000 m3 of particleboard in 2001.  The proposed project will: refinance existing debt; make minor maintenance investments; finance environmental upgrades; and further invest in plantations.     IFC Role    IFC has three important roles to play in this project. First, IFC will provide the necessary term financing for a medium-sized Brazilian company.  The Brazilian economic crisis, the political uncertainty stemming from the upcoming presidential election, the current crisis in Argentina, and the September 11 events in the United States,  have made long-term financing difficult to obtain for Brazilian companies. The dearth of such financing has been a major constraint for the development of the private sector, hampering modernization and employment growth in Brazil&apos;&apos;s economy.  Under current conditions, both in international and domestic Brazilian financial markets, even large firms have difficult access to long term financing, driving a substantial consolidation in various industries. The only way for a commercially viable and otherwise efficient mid-size firm, such as Satipel, to compete is through the support of sources such as IFC.  Second, the IFC investment would introduce Satipel to international lending that would enhance its visibility and credibility preparing the company to go public in the next few years. Indeed, Satipel management intends to turn this family business into a large profitable public company. The owners have indicated their strong desire to have IFC as a partner in order to increase the chance of success of the companys upcoming initial public offering. Last, IFC&apos;&apos;s involvement would support an environmentally-sound-wood-products company.     Development Impact    The proposed investment would improve the operating efficiency of a medium-sized enterprise. Furthermore, the project will assist the country in maximizing its comparative advantage in the forestry products. Satipel utilizes low cost plantation pine and helps consumers avoid the high transportation costs associated with imports. In addition, as part of the companys investments in the forestry operations, Satipel will provide financing to local farmers to introduce them to the forestry operations. The program is expected to reach more than 20 farmers, and a total of 500 ha. per year.  The company will provide the seedlings and extensive training to the farmers. The farmers will benefit from the use of non-adequate land for agriculture, diversifying their activities, taking advantage of the use of current labor, and thus, increasing their annual revenues from the use of the land.</narrative>
