   <narrative xml:lang="EN">- Act as a catalyst for the professionalization of the private hospital sector in Brazil, through the implementation of Rede Dor&apos;s best practices in medical, E&amp;S and corporate governance standards into the newly acquired hospitals;
- Expand access to high quality medical care, as demand for high-quality tertiary care is increasing in Brazil, and international standards of care are still limited and insufficient throughout the country;
- Enhance  cost competitiveness by supporting a scalable business model in a very fragmented and inefficient sector;
- Potential for a climate friendly IFC investment, through the implementation of greenbuilding standards in the new greenfield facilities;
- Employment of local professionals, most of them women (75% of the Company&apos;s workforce);
- Address Brazil&apos;s important skill gap issue by providing adequate training to the workforce through Instituto D&apos;Or (IDOR). IDOR is also initiating an undergraduate education program and has also initiatives in specialization programs and partnerships with several national and international universities;
- Support Zika-related research undertaken by IDOR with results getting international exposure and similar research being extended into the future;
- Improve the quality of the public healthcare system, as Rede D&apos;Or has a partnership with the Rio de Janeiro State Government to manage a 80-bed pediatric hospital that has an average of 17 daily procedures, ranging from medium to high complexity surgeries such as transplants and cancer treatment.</narrative>

It has an impressive growth and execution history (Net Revenue CAGR11/15: 32.5%), with proven successful track-record of executing 7 greenfield hospitals and acquiring 27 hospitals since 2005, consolidating itself as the market leader in a very fragmented sector. The Company mainly serves patients with private insurance plans that today represents approximately 25% of the Brazilian population, operating on a fee-for-service basis, but pro-actively partnering with the payers to promote a more integrated solution. This will be the third IFC project with this client. The project consists of the support for the Companys investment program for 2016-2022 period, which comprises brownfield and greenfield projects to add approximately 3.5 thousand beds to the Companys network. Taking advantage of favorable market environment, the Company is also seeking for additional liquidity to pursue opportunistic acquisitions. The group has an active and expanding research focus plus undergraduate and graduate training initiatives. Rede DOrs research institute, IDOR, has been particularly active on developing cutting-edge research on the effects of the Zika virus on newborns and its studies have been published internationally.</narrative>
