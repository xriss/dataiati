   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project is to support Grupo Canopus (Canopus or the Company), to expand its focus on low-income housing developments under the Minha Casa Minha Vida or any follow on governmental program. Canopus, one of the largest real estate developers and construction companies in the state of Minas Gerais, Brazil, has invited IFC and the IFC African, Latin American and Caribbean Fund, LP, managed by IFC Asset Management Company LLC (ALAC Fund) to make an equity investment to support its corporate capital expenditure plan for the expansion of its footprint in the affordable housing segment specially in the 0 to 10 minimum wages segment (including underdeveloped regions such as Brazilian North and Northeast), as well as the consolidation of its current position in the mid-high income and commercial segments (the Project).</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The stability of the Brazilian macro economy during the last seven years coupled with the Governments agenda to prioritize the housing sector in a countercyclical effort, have boosted the demand for lower- and middle-income housing.  The proposed Project will support a reputable domestic housing company to undertake its growth plan in response to increasing demand for quality and affordable entry level lower-income houses in Brazil, thereby helping to reduce the current housing deficit in the country  particularly among lower-income families. Consumers will benefit from the expanded supply of residential units, while such housing developments will contribute to urban infrastructure development and community development around them, such as roads, electricity, hospitals, recreation areas, and so forth, thus also improving living standard of the population in the surrounding area.  Finally, in addition to promote significant job creation, the Project will also enhance local supply linkages through increased demand for construction and building materials in the country. Once construction is completed, the housing units will stimulate the use of local supplies of goods and services, supporting maintenance, retailing and wholesale operations.  In addition, local employment will be generated during and after construction.</narrative>
