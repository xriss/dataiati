Environmental, health and safety issues include air emissions, liquid effluent treatment and discharge, solid waste disposal, fire and dust explosion prevention, use of personal protective gear, and general employee health and safety.  Environmental reports submitted by Sadia indicate that operations are not in full compliance with the World Bank guidelines.  IFC has therefore required that, as a condition of first disbursement, Sadia submit a Corrective Action Plan (CAP) acceptable to IFC.  This CAP will identify the specific actions required, together with an estimate of the costs involved, to bring all operations in compliance with World Bank policies and guidelines.  Sadia has committed to bring all operations into full compliance with World Bank guidelines.    The Environmental Review Summary is expected to be available on October 18, 1996 from the Public Information Center.
