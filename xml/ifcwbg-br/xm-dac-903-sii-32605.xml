   <narrative xml:lang="EN">BI-Gender Inclusion (Project # 32605), consists of an A/B syndicated loan of up to US$ 65 Million to Banco Industrial do Brazil (BIB, Banco Industrial or the Bank), a midsized SME bank in Brazil, and an existing IFC client.     The above loan will support BIBs lending operations to the SMEs, with at least 50 percent of the total funds earmarked to funding women-owned businesses. Therefore, the above Project will assist BIB to promote financial inclusion of women entrepreneurs in Brazil.  The Project would include eligibility criteria on the use of proceeds related to the profile of the sub-borrowers (women entrepreneurs), as similarly done in other IFC projects in Brazil.</narrative>
