Its primary interface with users is through its smartphone app that connects independent motorcycle couriers with delivery assignments requested by end-users; Loggi retains a fee on each delivery and assists with other transactions (like payments for restaurant deliveries), also on a for-fee basis. It has recently launched a similar service for independent small delivery vans, focused primarily on next-day deliveries of package-sized e-commerce purchases. Its app-based delivery platforms currently regroup more than 2,600 motorcycle couriers and 140   van drivers (who also drive their own vehicles). Based in greater S&#xE3;o Paulo, Loggi also has operations in the cities of Rio (Rio de Janeiro state), Belo Horizonte (Minais Gerais state), Curitiba (Paran&#xE1; state), and Porto Alegre (Rio Grande do Sul state), with plans to expand to other states as well. In addition to administrative offices in the S&#xE3;o Paulo region, Rio, Belo Horizonte, and Curitiba, it also has a distribution center in S&#xE3;o Paulo for cross-docking purposes (repacking bulk e-commerce orders originating from clients warehouses into smaller batches for at-home deliveries by vans and motorcycles), with plans for adding others. The company is owned by its founders and initial investors, including Kaszek Ventures, Qualcomm Ventures, Monashees Capital, and Dragoneer Investment Group. IFC is considering an equity investment of up to $5 million. Funding will be used expand growth in 10 cities throughout Brazil.</narrative>
