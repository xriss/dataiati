   <narrative xml:lang="EN">At the end of 2020, cyclone Chalane passed over central Mozambique. Fortunately, this storm did not cause too much devastation, three weeks later, the cyclone Eloise made landfall on the night of January 22 in the province of Sofala.  The Eloise cyclone affected more than 250,000 people, including 20,000 displaced, according to data from the National Institute for Disaster Management and Risk Reduction (INGD), 32 accommodation centers were activated in Sofala province: Beira (14 centers, 9. 437 individuals), Nhamatanda (5 centers, 1,885 individuals), B&#xFA;zi (10 centers, 3,344 individuals), and Machanga (3 centers, 854 individuals), according to the IOM/INGD. INGD reported that over 18,000 homes have been destroyed, damaged or flooded, mainly in the province of Sofala, and over 160 classrooms and at least 26 health centers will require repairs. Some roads, mainly in the district of B&#xFA;zi, but also in the districts of Sussundenga and Macossa of Manica Province, are impassable, making access to some villages difficult. More than 142,150 hectares of crops have been flooded, which could have a negative impact on the next agricultural harvest. WFP reported that while more assessments will be needed to determine the full extent of needs, food assistance will be crucial in the aftermath of the storm.
It is a reality that as per WASH the most affected target group is constituted by women and children. With this project proposal our focus will be on the prevention of COVID19, due to the fact that many families have lost their prevention material on one side and on the other side because they are not able to buy new ones</narrative>
