  <description>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Mozambique is frequently ravaged by cyclones, floods and drought. However, a PDNA (2019) commissioned by the GoM found that the cyclones and floods of 2019 have been the most devastating in recent history in terms of human and physical impact, as well as geographic scale with 64 districts and six provinces directly affected. Tropical cyclones Idai and Kenneth struck central and northern Mozambique within a span of just six weeks in March and April 2019. The cyclones resulted in days of torrential rainfall and heavy winds, burst riverbanks that submerged entire villages and subsequent flooding spanning over 3,000 km2. Idai and Kenneth wreaked massive destruction of crops, assets and education and water infrastructure. The cyclones jeopardized the lives and livelihoods of more than 2.2 million people across Sofala, Manica, Tete, Inhambane, Nampula and Cabo Delgado provinces. According to the GoM, Idai and Kenneth killed at least 648, injured nearly 1,700 and displaced over 430,000 people. Nearly 277,000 houses have been partially or completely destroyed or flooded. Food insecurity will remain critically high this year. Idai alone damaged over 715,378 hectares of land, with agricultural losses up to $258M.
During the emergency response phase, Caritas has provided assistance through distribution of tarps, kitchen kits, hygiene kits and shelter kits to affected people in Sofala, Manica, Zamb&#xE9;zia, and Cabo Delgado provinces. These relief efforts were largely possible due to support from the initial EA. The national office of Caritas Mo&#xE7;ambicana, along with diocesan Caritas in Pemba, Beira, Quelimane and Chimoio, are shifting away from procurement and distribution of non-food items towards an integrated package of agriculture and livelihoods, WASH and shelter programming for early and longer-term recovery.</narrative>
