  <description>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Cyclone Idai hit Mozambique on 14-15 March, leaving behind a swath of destruction in Gaza, Inhambane, Manica, Sofala, Tete, and Zambezia provinces. The hardest hit area is the coastal city of Beira in Sofala Province where 90% of infrastructure is estimated to have been destroyed. Approximately 1.85 million are in immediate need, of whom 1 million are reported to be children and 740,000 are school-going children. 
The project will work on getting children (aged 6-13 years) back into schools by contributing to school rehabilitations 
The immediate phase will be informed and strategically linked with planning and investments for durable solutions in the form of quality, gender-sensitive rehabilitation/retro-fitting efforts following Cyclone Idai. The project aims to contribute to support children&#x2019; back to school after Cyclone Idai, and to improve access and completion of safe quality education for students and children in Nhamatanda district. The action will be led by CAFOD and implemented in collaboration with AVSI Foundation. CAFOD and AVSI Foundation are already involved in educational and protection responses to Cyclone Idai. In particular, the action will be complementary to other on-going initiatives and will strengthen the education system in the area of intervention:
- Islamic Relief - AVSI foundation &#x2013; 9 classrooms in 3 schools in Beira). MOZ382 is complementary to this project. 
- ECW (&#x201C;Education Cannot Wait&#x201D; project &#x2013; AVSI foundation, 6 schools).
The Action will focus the following areas specifically: 9 classrooms across 3 schools in Nhamantanda which have been identified as most in need by the local authorities (Direc&#xE7;&#xE3;o Provincial da Educacao and Ministry of Education)
