  <description>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Cyclone Idai hit Mozambique on 14-15 March, leaving behind a trail of destruction in 4 provinces. The hardest hit area is the coastal city of Beira in Sofala Province where 90% of infrastructure is estimated to have been destroyed. Approximately 1.85 million were in immediate need, of whom 1 million are reported to be children and 740,000 are school-going children. 
The project will work on getting children (aged 6-13 years) back into schools by contributing to school rehabilitations in the area of acessibility for children with disabilities. The project aims to contribute to support children&#x2019; back to school after Cyclone Idai, and to improve access and completion of safe quality education for students and children in Beira city and Nhamatanda district. The action will be led by CAFOD and implemented in collaboration with AVSI Foundation. CAFOD and AVSI Foundation are already involved in educational and protection responses to Cyclone Idai. In particular, the action will be complementary to other on-going initiatives and will strengthen the education system in the area of intervention:
- ECW (&#x201C;Education Cannot Wait&#x201D; project &#x2013; AVSI foundation &#x2013; 12 months, 10 schools, 55 classrooms).
- MOZ377 (Islamic Relief &#x2013; AVSI foundation &#x2013;  8 months, 6 schools, 18 classrooms).
The Action will focus the following areas specifically: improve acessibility for children with disabilities in 73 classrooms across 16 schools in Beira City and Nhamantanda which have been identified as most in need by the local authorities (Direc&#xE7;&#xE3;o Provincial da Educacao and Ministry of Education). The activities will be in accordance with UN Habitat guidelines. 
Outcome: 16.770 girls and boys (aged 6-13 years) affected by Cyclone IDAI improve their learning through access to an inclusive, relevant and quality education within a safe and protected environment
