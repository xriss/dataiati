    <narrative xml:lang="EN">In FY 2017, the United States will partner with Mexico to consolidate and institutionalize progress made as a result of ongoing bilateral cooperation, particularly through the Merida Initiative. By weakening transnational criminal organizations (TCOs), reforming the institutions that sustain the rule of law, protecting human rights, creating a 21st century border, and building stronger and more resilient communities, the United States and Mexico will ensure greater prosperity and inclusive economic growth on both sides of the border. To support the President&apos;s Global Climate Change (GCC) Initiative, a strong partnership with the Government of Mexico and other stakeholders will promote clean energy adoption, energy efficiency, low carbon development, and sustainable land use and forest management to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Mexico is a global non-proliferation partner and related assistance will focus on enhancing Mexico&apos;s capabilities and commitment. Mexico continues to be a strong partner of the initiatives that complement the United States&apos; programs to address the root causes of unlawful migration from Central America.</narrative>
