   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This award strives to conserve biodiversity and manage natural resources in ways that maintain their long-term viability and preserve their potential to meet the needs of present and future generations. Activities include combating illegal and corrupt exploitation of natural resources and the control of invasive species. This includes The Tehuacan-Cuicatlan Biosphere Reserve (TCBR) has a wealth of unique biophysical and cultural characteristics. The area is home to more than 130 species of fauna such as jaguars, green macaws and tapirs and 10% of the Mexican vascular flora. The TCBR is threatened by human &#x2013;wildlife conflict, poaching, unsustainable use of natural resources, inadequate management of solid waste, and urban development. These anthropogenic factors have also taken a toll on the cultural identity of the more than 8 indigenous groups that live in the area. The goal of this project is to develop the awareness of the community of the Canada Oaxaquena buffer zone about the importance of conserving their natural resources and making informed management decisions. Through this grant, CONBIODES will: 1) deliver an inquiry-based approach training program to 8 elementary school teachers and 80 school children, as a way to develop their critical-thinking, communication and research skills and enhance their ability to identify, plan, structure and resolve environmental problems affecting their communities; 2) follow up with teachers and students on the implementation of their environmental and education plans; 3) implement an environmental education and species identification training workshop for 10 local youth; and 4) implement multiple environmental education activities including talks, broadcasting of environmental documentaries and installation of wildlife photography exhibitions in each community..</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">In FY 2017, the United States will partner with Mexico to consolidate and institutionalize progress made as a result of ongoing bilateral cooperation, particularly through the Merida Initiative. By weakening transnational criminal organizations (TCOs), reforming the institutions that sustain the rule of law, protecting human rights, creating a 21st century border, and building stronger and more resilient communities, the United States and Mexico will ensure greater prosperity and inclusive economic growth on both sides of the border. To support the President&apos;s Global Climate Change (GCC) Initiative, a strong partnership with the Government of Mexico and other stakeholders will promote clean energy adoption, energy efficiency, low carbon development, and sustainable land use and forest management to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Mexico is a global non-proliferation partner and related assistance will focus on enhancing Mexico&apos;s capabilities and commitment. Mexico continues to be a strong partner of the initiatives that complement the United States&apos; programs to address the root causes of unlawful migration from Central America.</narrative>
