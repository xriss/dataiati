    <narrative xml:lang="SV">The third phase of the Sida funded project Good Water Neighbors (GWN) focused on up-scaling the activities and outcomes from previous phases. It went from focusing on a set of partnering communities (i.e. two communities across the border of Israel, Palestine and/or Jordan cooperating) to a model that addressed the larger picture of cross-border watersheds (i.e. a focus on the ecological water boundaries of a river, lake, water resource etc). The advantage of moving from partnering communities to a watershed approach included a greater number of stakeholders involved and an increased in actual size of the area encompassed. Moreover, EcoPeace reported that this change created a larger shared sense of identity within the area of shared environmental resources as well as more impact towards creating political will; both to advance more sustainable water resource solutions and also the broader Middle East Peace process.
Below are some examples of results including impacts from phase three:
Youth &#x201C;Water Trustees&#x201D; &amp; Teacher Training Program
The youth and education component of GWN involved and capacity built almost 3000 youth &#x201C;water trustees&#x201D;&#xA0;from the three countries by providing a larger sense of environmental identity and a mutual responsibility of their shared environmental future. The trustees enhanced knowledge was transferred to parents, friends and extended family and EcoPeace has estimated a 10 fold impact of outreach from each youth involved. Approximately 1500 of them participated in cross border visits or regional youth camps furthering their understanding by meeting neighbors across the border, an opportunity that is otherwise often not possible for youth in Jordan, Palestine and Israel. EcoPeace also trained over 200 youth water trustees as Alumni so they could assist EcoPeace&#x2019;s community coordinators in each watershed and advance on their own leadership skills. In addition, Ecopeace trained over 1000 teachers in using the Environmental Education Resource Guide develop by EcoPeace.
Phase four of the GWN, that was signed between Sida and EcoPeace in August 2018, has built on the Youth and Education component.&#xA0;After dialogue with Sida the new project has a much stronger focus on gender as well as monitoring &amp; evaluation with the aim to strengthen young women and men as leaders for environmental equality. The gender integration and added impacts will be measured consistently in the new phase. The Youth and Education component has also moved from working with individuals to aiming at integrating environmental education into the school curriculum in the three countries in order to increase the awareness of the local, national and regional challenges faced by the three countries. Phase three played an important role in paving the way for this work by planting seeds in the minds of participating teachers, students and building networks to the Ministries of Education in the countries. 
Community Involvement and Local Leadership Engagement
This component created 11 Watershed Forums for adults and municipalities that were essential in cultivating regional political will and cooperation to support improved water and sanitation services. EcoPeace was successful in engaging political and local leaders, environmentalist, heads of local museums and tourism, local businesses and other relevant stakeholders in order to develop a common vision for a shared watershed. In EcoPeace&#x2019;s final report for phase three there are numerous examples of results achieved in the forums. One examples is from Sorek/Sarar Watershed where after two years of deliberations and EcoPeace involvement the Israeli Hight Court of Justice denied the request of the Israeli military to build the proposed route of the Separation Barrier that was planned to cut through the unique terraced landscape Battir shared by Israel and Palestine. Under this component also three regional conferences were held with representation from high-level government officials from Jordan, Palestine and Israel. &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;
Phase four of GWN builds on this component by moving its focus to a regional perspective using the knowledge and networks created from the Watersheds to draw on a regional environmental political agenda. Phase four also enhance the cooperation with the private sector as they are identified as important stakeholders in sectors such as green technologies and renewable energy. The regional conferences are still being implemented under phase four and the latest one was held by the Dead Sea in Jordan in fall 2018.
Advancing Rehabilitation of the Lower Jordan River Basin
This project phase focused its efforts on engaging faith communities and leaders in raising awareness of the need to rehabilitate the Jordan River as well as to promote the Jordan Valley Master Plan (JVMP). The JVMP identifies the need for regional governance structure for the Jordan River Valley. Under the project a total of 78 tours and seminars were conducted to diverse groups of tourists and interested citizens; 10 additional partnerships were formed with other organizations, congregations and delegations abroad, helping to further raise awareness about the Lower Jordan River. EcoPeace also provided training to local tour guides in order for them to include the environmental cross boarder perspectives into their tours. An evaluation produced by the Zofnat Institute on the GWP phase three concluded that the tour guides benefitted significantly from the interaction with EcoPeace in terms of awareness of the environmental conditions of the river and its religious importance. Most of them showed a clear interest in putting the knowledge in use during their tours. &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;
Phase four of the project identifies the work created by phase three but has moved away from the engagement with local tour guides and instead focuses its efforts on political acceptance of the Jordan River Master Plan. EcoPeace is working with the World Bank to establish a trust fund around the Jordan River Rehabilitation building on EcoPeace&#x2019;s Master Plan. Political engagement from the three governments is necessary to move forward and the signing of an MOU between the parties is the first step of the process.</narrative>
