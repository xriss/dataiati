    <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project was implemented through a series of activities organised to achieve the four expected achievements, some examples of results are mentioned below: EA-1: Strengthening the capacity to assess impact of changing water availability on agricultural production in the Arab Region This pillar aimed to strengthen food security through informed agricultural recommendations that will increase the resilience of agriculture sector to climate change and improve the agriculture production and productivity. The capacity of 10 ESCWA&#x2019; Member States were improved to assess the impact of climate change on water availability and agriculture production, 9 assessment reports/ case studies have been developed and demonstrated that the rainfed crops are more sensitive than the irrigated ones. It&#x2019;s worth mentioning that the availability of national reliable data used on the development of the case studies was a major constraint. ESCWA, FAO and ACSAD provided a serios of training workshops to about 30 experts from the 10 nominated countries on the impact of climate change on the production of crops. As well as developed four training manuals in Arabic during the period of 2016-2019 and organized six sub-regional training workshops on applying agricultural production assessment methodology. 30 regional and national policy recommendations were prepared by the 10 countries aimed to increase the resilience of the agriculture sector to climate change through improved agriculture production and productivity. As well as policy briefs were produced for Jordan, Egypt, Tunis and Morocco to inform the decision and policy makers and other related stakeholders about the socioeconomic impact of climate change. EA-2: Enhancing the capacity for intra-regional coordinated policy development on food and water security in the Arab Region This pillar aimed to achieve greater institutional coordination between the agriculture and water sectors, in particular to improve intergovernmental coordination to support policy coordination and coherence to optimizing water use in agriculture sector. So, the consultations with member states, councils, organisations, in this regard, resulted in the establishment of a High-Level Joint Permanent Water-Agriculture Committee that acted as institutionalized intergovernmental coordination mechanism between the water and food sectors at ministerial level, and would support policy coordination and promote coherence to jointly address challenges, optimize water use and food production. In April 2019, the first joint meeting of Arab Minsters of Water and Agriculture was held at the League of Arab States in Cairo, which recommended developmed of a new generation of policies and investments to address the current challenges and future risks associated with water and food security, and concluded with a call for the effective integration of water and food security issues into the national sustainable development strategies. The joint ministerial meeting has been decided to take place every second years and will promote the cross sectoral exchange of information. The Cairo Declaration was adopted by the Arab Ministers of Water and Agriculture which calls for future consultations, collaboration and identification of joint areas of work paving the way to reaching coordinated and integrated policies between the two sectors. In 2019 ESCWA prepared a report on regional coordination between two sectors in the Arab region. This report based on three technical reports which highlighted the need for regional platform that represent the enabling environment that provides the infrastructure, all the necessary elements and tools and supporting factors. EA-3: Enhancing the capacity for efficient food production in the Arab Region  This pillar aimed at building capacity to ensure safety and quality of fruits and vegetables for local consumers. A ToT in the application of Good Agriculture Practices (GAP) with trainers was provided with certificates. The project supported the adoption of two national GAP schemes for Jordan and Lebanon to enhance the domestic quality and safety of food, and act as a catalyst for facilitating regional and international trade, while ensuring environmental sustainability and public health, which are waiting for official endorsement. A booklet on the application of GAP was issued in both Arabic and English. It provided explanation of the implementation modality, including the identification of schemes owners, certification and accreditation bodies and their respective roles. EA-4: Enhancing the assessment capacity of the status of food security in the Arab countries This pillar promoted the development of a region-specific monitoring system on food security, to be used as a tool to identify areas of intervention across the four dimension of food security, namely: food availability, access, utilization, and stability. ESCWA had extensive consultations with national focal points, experts from FAO regional office and Rome office, high-level panel of experts on food security and nutrition, academia involved in assessing the status of food security in the Arab region; who took into consideration regional specificities and its alignment with the integrated approach of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, that resulted in developing an Arab Food Security Monitoring Framework endorsed by the AOAD executive office on March 2019. Two training workshops took place in Tunis and Lebanon to train experts on how to use the monitoring framework, including its dashboard and indicators. A publication entitled &#x201C;tracking food security in the Arab region&#x201D; was co-published between ESCWA and AOAD to outline the framework&#x2019; development process and rationale for selecting the indicators and introduce an innovative way to show results in forms of a dashboard composed of a double doughnut chart visualizing performance and a table summarizing key statistics and trends. The development of FS monitoring framework and its report was considered a significant achievement to make the decision and policy makers better informed of hot spot areas to formulate strategies and development plans to improve food security in the region, regardless the several challenges have been faced in terms of data availability and variance of capacities amongst national statistical offices and accessibility of data and policies in some countries.</narrative>
