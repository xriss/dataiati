   <narrative xml:lang="EN">One World Foundation Africa (OWFA) is a small London-based NGO, founded by members of the African Diaspora. It works in Uganda to support children and families affected by HIV/AIDS. Their work appears to be yielding good results for the communities they work with in Uganda. That said, the organisation is small and there are significant areas where they lack capacity. These include their dependency on Comic Relief for funding, and their small and highly committed board, which needs to be expanded. Through this project OWFA will work to build its capacity in a number of areas, undertaking a holistic review of its organisational plans, strategies and capacity in key areas. These will include building the capacity and professionalisation of its board, developing a five-year strategic plan and building its fundraising and communications plans and capacity. As a result of this work, OWFA will review its growth opportunities and improve its work in Africa. The approach they propose for capacity building is thorough, relies on a trusted and tested consultant, and has been developed to support all areas of the organisation&apos;s development. They will start with governance and the development of a five-year strategic plan. Building on this, they will develop a fundraising and communications strategy, including a new website. All this appears necessary and well thought through. The support they have put in place for this process is well considered and the identified consultant possesses the skills to support them.</narrative>
