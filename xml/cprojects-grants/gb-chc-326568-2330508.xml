   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Pastoralist societies are patriarchal and women face inequalities at every level. Education is at the heart of transforming women&apos;s lives but girls face many problems in attending school. Nationally, girls&#xE2;&#x20AC;&#x2122; enrolment in secondary school is lower than boys, drop-out rates higher and their performance worse. Girls&apos; gross enrolment rate is 32% (boys - 40%, 2008). In pastoralist areas, this is far lower. Factors affecting girls include: teenage pregnancies; HIV/AIDS exposure; distance between school and home; and sexual violence perpetrated against girls in school and communities. Pastoralist girls experience further problems. Early and forced marriage means girls are taken out of school, often at primary level. It is not considered worthwhile educating girls; upon marriage they transfer to their in-laws homestead and her economic worth is lost to the birth family. This application seeks to establish the depth and scale of problems faced by pastoralist girls, including disabled girls and those affected by HIV/AIDS, and to seek key stakeholder&#xE2;&#x20AC;&#x2122;s views and consensus on actions that can assist in increasing the educational attainment of girls. This application will result in new work that seeks to increase the enrolment, retention and performance of pastoralist girls in secondary education, targeting the most vulnerable.</narrative>
