  </title>
  <description>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This is a research project to identify the priority healthcare needs in Heiban and surrounding localities. Healthcare provision in this area of Sudan is vastly weakened due to the fact that this region was the scene of fighting and human rights violations during Sudan&apos;s 20-year civil war. Violent conflict and lack of investment from central government mean that the people living in Heiban locality need to travel for 3 days to get to the nearest health facility. In Heiban in general there is a shortage of midwives, no availability of basic drugs and medicines and no qualified doctors. People living in Heiban have no access to information about nutrition and hygiene. High numbers of women die during child birth and the infant mortality rate is one of the highest in Sudan. This research project will commence with a conference in which our baseline study of healthcare needs of Heiban will be shared with participants. Other service providers such as government, UN and NGOs working in Kordofan will share information on the level of service provision they provide. This will be done in order to ascertain what needs are currently being met and provide Justice Africa and all other participants with information on the priority areas in which healthcare needs are not being met. Any research we undertake will use this information to address basic provisions that are not being met by government and apply for funding. As a result, projects for healthcare in Sudan can be coordinated and targeted to priority areas.</narrative>
