  <description>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">MASL supports access to health care and urgent medical treatment for communities and individuals in Sierra Leone. They worked with Basindon hospital to establish the first epilepsy service in Sierra Leone, supporting urgent spinal surgery for children with TB of the spine. To date they have relied heavily on the voluntary help and commitment of colleagues, including input from a Consultant Neurologist, which is unsustainable. They would now like to develop a strategic organisational vision that builds on their achievements and generates the resources to implement long-term sustainable partnerships, based on best practice. The scale of the need in Sierra Leone requires a coherent and strong strategy to maximise resources and impact. Access to the highest attainable level of healthcare will form the foundation of this strategy, with MASL offering support through information and partnerships, with an emphasis on working efficiently towards long term capacity-building and the establishment of sustainable in-country services.
MASL would like to use this grant to bring trustees together for two days, along with one person from the Epilepsy Association to undertake a SWOT analysis of MASL. This will then be used to develop their programmes and organisational strategies. Based on the priorities defined in the programmes strategy they intend to develop a five-year strategic plan to enable them to operationalise their vision. MASL would like to look beyond their current funding streams with a view to sustaining their current programmes. Once they have developed their strategic plan, they will use the remaining funds to contract support from an experienced organisational development mentor who will assist them to operationalise the strategic plan over a period of approximately nine months.</narrative>
