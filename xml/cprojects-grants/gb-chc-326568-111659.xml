  <description>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In Kenya, women offenders are enormously stigmatised and often discriminated against and rejected by family, friends and employers. A majority of these women spend months and even years awaiting trial and sentencing for petty charges. Poverty appears to be the main cause for engaging in criminality such as selling illicit brew, drug smuggling, hawking without licences and loitering with intent to engage in prostitution. There are existing opportunities within Langata Women&apos;s Maximum Prison for women to gain technical skills e.g. horticulture or furniture making, that could lead to self-employment on completion of their sentences. However, upon release women generally leave prison with no money and they lack access to the credit, business management skills and market linkages they need to turn their technical skills into a sustainable business. As there is no further support package after their release most of the women end up either engaging in informal hawking or re-offending. 

Using peer-led participatory approaches this research project will investigate the barriers faced by women ex-offenders in Nairobi, Kenya when accessing enterprise and employment opportunities and explore potential approaches to addressing these.  

As a result of this research relevant stakeholders will have the necessary information to inform the provision of programmes and services which support and enable ex-offenders to access secure livelihoods through employment or self employment and consequently reduce re-offending rates.</narrative>
