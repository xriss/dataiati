   <narrative xml:lang="EN">A pilot Project to Improve the Teaching of Reading in Ugandan Schools</narrative>
  </title>
  <description>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Universal Primary Education in Uganda has resulted in a 93% net primary enrolment rate, but its impact has been watered down by increased class sizes (often over 100), a lack of quality teaching, and the lowest primary completion rate in East Africa (30% compared to 80% in Kenya). This lack of attainment is reflected in a 2010 USAID report on early grade reading which found that in 2 areas of Uganda 55%-80% of students in grade 2 could not read a single word. Although there has been no quantitative study in the proposed project area, Masindi, anecdotal evidence points to the challenge being similar. RedEarth and the District Education Authority&#x2019;s own findings show that the low early literacy rate directly transfers to low attainment across all subjects, and subsequent dropout, in particular amongst girls. This pilot project tests methods of improving early grade literacy in the area, working in 5 schools with District Education Authority involvement, to train teachers in early grade literacy teaching, develop teacher training and classroom resources, and to prepare a costed plan for scale-up to other schools and teacher training institutions. Improvements in early grade literacy are evaluated in pilot schools themselves, and through work with nearby schools that will be covered in the scale up phase.</narrative>
