  <description>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The levels of maternal and newborn deaths in Ethiopia are amongst the highest in the world. The reasons are similar to many low-income countries: access to health care is challenging due to limited resources, weak infrastructure, and a shortage of health workers. In Ethiopia, this is magnified by decades of chronic underinvestment in the health sector, particularly in rural areas where health facilities are few and far between. In 2002, the government started a massive investment programme for primary health care, and trained over 32,000 HEWs to provide services in and around 12,500 rural health posts. However, this is not yet enough - the HEWs need more training and health facilities are poorly equipped. Community members also need to develop trust in the services available.|This project will train health workers to provide better maternal and newborn care. The project will establish women&apos;s and men&apos;s groups to improve health seeking behaviour and teach people how to prevent common illnesses and infections. The project will refurbish and equip health facilities so that health workers have the tools they need to provide better care. As a result, more women and newborns will seek and get care so that their health is protected and improved.</narrative>
