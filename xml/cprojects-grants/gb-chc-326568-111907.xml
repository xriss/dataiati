   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Strengthening Farming and Business Capacities for 200 Women in Cameroon - Research Project</narrative>
  </title>
  <description>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The number of people living in poverty in the rural areas of Cameroon is not decreasing.  Poverty is particularly acute in the west of Cameroon yet few NGOs work in this region. Rural women are heavily burdened by their double roles as workers and family care providers a situation increasingly compounded by HIV/AIDS. Underdeveloped physical and social infrastructure in remote areas increases women&#x2019;s family workload and restricts their access to skills training and financial resources. Their daughters experience unequal access to education and training and thus struggle to obtain decent and productive employment in their adult life. Women often work in jobs where there are low wages, they are open to attack and abuse, their rights are not respected and nobody listens to them.  Some women choose to be entrepreneurs but many others have little or no option. 
Through a process of research, consultation and planning in three areas (Limbe, Bui and Bamenda) in western Cameroon the project will identify the opportunities (e.g. gaps in the market, higher margin products) and challenges facing women entrepreneurs/farmers in sustaining and growing their enterprise (e.g. lack of business and technical skills; limited or no access to supplies, credit, business support services). It will identify and consult existing support services and key local stakeholders e.g. Chambers of Commerce, NGOs involved in income generation, local Government, media and convene a group of committed organisations to explore options and develop a plan of action. 
By undertaking this process the partners will ensure women&#x2019;s voices are heard at all levels and their challenges understood; approaches to enterprise development for women are shared; and a working group is formed with strategic and operational partners and a plan of action developed.</narrative>
