   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Pregnant mothers and children under five from isolated rural communities in Kaduna, northern Nigeria, are at risk of dying due to lack of primary health care. There are high levels of disease, dangerous delivery practices, and unacceptably high levels of infant and maternal mortality. This project will work with twenty rural communities to increase their access to primary health care. By supporting them to take responsibility for their own health needs and to prevent and treat illnesses themselves, we will save the lives of pregnant mothers and their children. We will: - Develop community health committees and support them to take responsibility for their primary health care needs through managing a drug revolving fund. - Train forty key community members as village health workers, able to give basic illness prevention, diagnosis, and treatment to pregnant mothers and children under five. - Work with forty traditional birth attendants to teach and promote safe delivery practices. - Partner with communities to advocate for increased government funding of rural health care. The result of this project will be twenty communities with improved access to primary health care. They will have better health, lower levels of disease, and fewer pregnant mothers and children will die from lack of access to health care.</narrative>
