   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project objective is for ACET to provide an independent, light-touch review of the CWA monitoring process that provides all CWA stakeholders insights into progress and possible options for improvements. In Q1, the ACET AAG draft peer review note was developed. The G20 AAG meeting has however been postponed to end-May due to the inability of the World Bank and AfDB to focus on the AAG report amid the Covid-19 pandemic. This implies that the ACET Peer Review note will also be delayed until end of May as it is based in part on the IO monitoring report.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Under this sub-component, ACET will collaborate with the IOs, to undertake a 



























high-level peer review of the CwA process, and particularly the CWA monitoring reports, while providing recommendations for improvement. In light of this, ACET is tasked to develop a review methodology and analysis of self-assessments and preparation, presentation and dissemination of consolidated CWA peer review reports. In March 2019 ACET prepared its bi-annual peer review for presentation to the G20 Africa Advisory Group meeting during the World Bank/IMF Spring Meetings. The peer review note focused on operations of, and recommendations for, CwA Compact Team operations. The peer review note benefitted from the February workshops and the Advisory Panel country visits. I n the second quarter, ACET submitted its peer review note to the Africa Advisory Group and presented it during the AAG meeting at the World Bank Spring Meetings. On the 10th April 2010, ACET presented its most recent peer review note to the G20 Africa Advisory Group (AAG) during the World Bank/IMF Spring Meetings. The peer review note drew upon two CWA workshops in February organized by ACET and the German Ministry of Finance as well as on the visits to four CwA capitals. During the visits to capitals, members of the CwA Advisory Panel met with senior government officials, development partners and the private sector with the objective to gain a representative view of the successes and challenges of the initiative. The peer review note focused on six key issues that are drawn from the workshops and country visits. These include: &#x2022; A need for all stakeholders to coalesce around the CwA model. &#x2022; A sustained communications and outreach effort. &#x2022; Further refined roles and responsibilities of Compact Teams. &#x2022; Systematic engagement with the private sector. &#x2022; Inclusion of regional integration dimensions for investment. &#x2022; And the need for additional resources for coordination and capacity building. The note emphasized the need to address the value proposition of the CwA and the perceptions, in some cases, of asymmetric expectations. While this needs to be further explored to fully understand the challenges in each country, there is a clear need for a process to enhance the ownership of the initiative by all parties. A second primary issue addressed in the peer review note was communications, marketing and outreach. The CwA is not sufficiently well known or understood &#x2013; not even by those who are supposed to be key stakeholders. There needs to be a &#x201C;promotional campaign&#x201D; around the CwA combined with significantly more public-private dialogue to build awareness. Thirdly, there is a need for additional resources for coordination and for technical assistance. There are a few models whereby this could be realized, of which country windows in existing multi-donor trust funds is likely to be the most cost efficient. in q3, ACET started preparing for the writing of the next coming bi-annual peer review of CwA, due in October 2019. In q4, ACET finalized its 4th  peer review in October 2019. The note intends to complement the assessment of progress under the Compact with Africa (CwA), particularly regarding cross border flows, engagement of Development Finance Institutions (DFIs) and the roles and responsibilities of the International Organizations (IOs).

For Q2 2020:
ACET&#x2019;s 5th peer review note was discussed at the G20 Africa Advisory Group meeting in May. The note has also been included in the CwA monitoring report. The peer review focused on key policy issues facing CwA countries in the context of the pandemic crisis, including policy and advocacy that can help ensure a strong economic rebound

In Q3, ACET focused on preparing a 6th peer review note for the G20 Africa Advisory Group meeting on October 27.

In Q4. The 6th peer review note for the October G20 Africa Advisory Group Meeting was finalized. ACET participated in the AAG and organized the private sector participants

Q1 2021
Work on the 7th peer review note was completed this quarter. ACET independently reviewed the monitoring report for the CwA Ministers and Governors on progress and future ambitions. The report was collaboratively produced by the World Bank Group (WBG), the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the African Development Bank (AfDB). 

Q2 2021
AAG Meeting: On 15th April 2021, ACET supported preparations for the G20 Africa Advisory Group meeting, including inviting a private sector special guest, Tony Oteng-Gyasi. The bi-annual peer review note of the Compact with Africa was presented at the African Advisory Group (AAG) meeting. 

Technical Working Session for CWA (Compact with Africa): At the AAG meeting in April, CwA stakeholders requested that ACET worked with the international organizations to convene a technical working session in September 2021 ahead of the next AAG meeting. The objective of the technical meeting is to begin discussions with CwA countries on updating their Reform Matrices and strengthening their investor outreach activities, including more robust efforts on digital infrastructure and green economy. Planning is underway. 

Q3 2021
Technical Workshop: Following the April Advisory Group Meeting, ACET was tasked with the coordination of a technical workshop to obtain informal country feedback on the CWA program and facilitate discussions around the next phase of reforms. On September 7th, ACET in collaboration with the World Bank organised a technical workshop with CwA countries to review progress to date, discuss country feedback on the effectiveness of the CWA and initiate discussions on the next set of country reforms. Five CWA countries participated - Tunisia, South Africa, Egypt, Ghana, and Rwanda - alongside a range of partners including colleagues from G-20 countries, the World Bank, GIZ, Global Infrastructure Hub, IFC, AfDB and AU-DA NEPAD.   
 
Survey: Prior to the meeting we conducted a survey among the CwA countries. The feedback from the participating countries indicated a general consensus that the CwA program has been a positive experience and has facilitated country reforms in key areas such as tax, SME development, the investment climate, and mobilize support from international partners. Countries have also experienced challenges such as political instability and reduced opportunities for investment promotion - especially over the past 18 months.  Two recommendations that stood out was the need for the CWA to consider the new challenges countries are navigating as a result of the pandemic as well as an assessment of the real impact of the CWA supported reforms on investment and growth in CWA countries.

There was also a consensus that for the CwA to remain relevant and useful, it should evolve along the following areas: 

&#x2022;	The updated matrices should support sector-specific policy reforms and actions to complement the macro and cross-cutting policy reforms it is currently supporting.
&#x2022;	More emphasis should be placed on the digital and green economies and regional integration - leveraging the African Continental Free Trade Area.
&#x2022;	G2O Partners should consider proving additional technical and financial support for feasibility studies and implementation of new reforms. This support can be provided either through bilateral grants or multilateral financing instruments such as trust funds.
&#x2022;	Countries also called for more regular peer-to-peer learning and ongoing dialogues outside of AAG meetings.
&#x2022;	The private sector should be invited to actively participate in the CwA process.
 

Peer Review Note: It was agreed that the technical workshop summary would serve as the 8th peer review note. This was included in the Monitoring Report developed by the World Bank ahead of the October AAG Meeting.
 
Africa Advisory Group Meeting: On October 1, the African Advisory Group will meet to discuss key updates to the program. ACET will present the results of the technical summary for feedback from countries and partners institutions.

Q4 2021
On 1st October, the African Advisory Group met to discuss key updates to the program. Prior to the meeting, ACET and the World Bank had organized a technical workshop on 7th September 2021. The summary report from the workshop was presented by ACET at the AAG meeting. All feedback from countries and partners institutions at the meeting has been incorporated into the report.</narrative>
