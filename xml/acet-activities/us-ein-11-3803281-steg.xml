   <narrative xml:lang="EN">ACET in March 2020 commenced a five-year research initiative funded by DFID. The primary goal of the project is to provide a better understanding of structural change, productivity and growth in low- and middle-income countries. 

Q4 2020
ACET convened four country specific virtual workshops for Ghana, Ethiopia, Zambia and Uganda between September- December 2020. These were Small-group engagements to present the STEG project to the participants, solicit their insight on the relevance of the research questions for their respective countries, as well as to garner any additional research questions that should be included. An additional objective was to bolster inclusive participation in framing of the research questions at the initial phase of the research for further engagement as the research progressed. The participants, who are our stakeholders in the project were enthusiastic about the project as evidenced by the insightful discussions that ensued and made commitments to stay engaged with the researchers</narrative>

In August, ACET hosted an online workshop targeted at policy makers and think tanks from the four African focus countries &#x2013; Ghana, Zambia, Uganda and Ethiopia. The aim of the workshop was to obtain feedback from the participants on the relevance of the research themes and research questions.
