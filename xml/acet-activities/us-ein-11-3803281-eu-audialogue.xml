   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Policy Brief: By May 13, 2020, ACET in partnership with the German Development Institute (DIE) and the European Center for development Policy and Management (ECDPM) had produced a policy brief on digitalisation to inform policymakers and decision-makers on the EU-AU Summit scheduled for October 2020. 
Expert Meetings: ACET has completed four virtual expert meetings with the goal of presenting policy recommendations for senior EU, AU and member state officials ahead of the October 2020 EU-AU Summit. All four meetings deliberated on the challenges and opportunities of digitalization with varying audiences. The discussions were structured along four central pillars: strategic investments and finance, education and skills, governance and regulation, and the implementation of existing agreements between the EU and the AU.
The first virtual discussion on digitalization and the AU-EU dialogue, held on May 28, was represented by 11 participants being researchers and thought leaders from Africa, Europe, and the United States of America. The second, held on 3rd June 2020, featured 11 national policymakers from Africa and Europe. ACET organized a third virtual discussion on June 11 ,2020, bringing together entrepreneurs, investors, and young innovators from Africa and Europe. The fourth webinar was undertaken on June 23. The meeting was attended by officials from the EU, African and international institutions.</narrative>
