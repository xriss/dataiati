   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This year 2017, we completed our 21-month multi-country study on Managing and Mobilizing Financial Flows for Development with funding from the Gates Foundation. The study  assessed the responses of  external development finance recipient countries and the issues they must address with development partners to maximize their future development outcomes in terms of inclusive growth and transformation. The study was timely considering the changing development finance landscape. The study &#x2013; which covered Burkina Faso, Ghana, Rwanda, Tanzania, Uganda, and Zambia - provided key policy lessons that will help improve the practices of national authorities and development partners. Completed activities included organizing a policy learning event in Accra, Ghana on 10-11 April 2017 to help countries develop a shared understanding of the critical changing
landscape in development finance and what it means for Africa and how they can collectively influence dialogues on financing for development. We also  collaborated with the Center for Global Development (CGD) and the
International Monetary Fund&#x2019;s Fiscal Affairs Department (FAD/IMF) to hold a peer learning seminar for selected sub-Saharan African (SSA) Ministers of Finance. The goal was to help shape the voice of African finance
ministers for upcoming meetings especially those organized by the G-20. Internally, these events also provided a platform to kick-start dialogue with countries about the Resource Mobilization and Management Chapter. We also
extended our influence beyond study countries and organized and or participated in international events. These include the third Development Finance Forum from 31 May to 1 June 2017 in Accra Ghana spearheaded by the
World Bank and an Economic Transformation Seminar hosted by Konrad-Adenauer-Stiftung in Germany on 10th to 11th May, 2017.</narrative>
