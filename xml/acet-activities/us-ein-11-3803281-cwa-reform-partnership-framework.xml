   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This program is an extension of CwA work, funded by BMZ to deepen ACET&#x2019;s work in reform partnership countries and investment promotion.
As a result of a CwA peer learning workshop in Accra in February 2020, a new subset of work was initiated within the CwA under the Reform Partnership Framework. This subset included studies on good governance and COVID-19; industrial innovation; and investment. 
This quarter, activities focused on the dissemination of our studies on Good Governance, COVID-19 and Industrial Innovation. 
(1) Good Governance &amp; COVID-19: We published two of our research papers produced last quarter: A &#x201C;Scan of COVID-19 Governance-Related Policy Actions&#x201D; and &#x201C;Responding to COVID-19: An Overview of Governance Issues.&#x201D; We also organized two COVID-19 recovery related events this period. The first, on January 28th, and a second on March 15 in collaboration with the World Bank titled &#x201C;Bringing Everyone Along: An Inclusive Recovery in Africa.&#x201D; 
(2) Industrial Innovation: ACET is conducting a scoping analysis of the seven Reform Partnership Countries for existing industrial innovation programs, including initiatives organized and/or sponsored by governments and development partners. The study includes an assessment of existing policies and programs; a stakeholder assessment, including private sector and academia; and identification of possible sectors of focus. The report is intended to be used for peer-to-peer learning among Reform Partnership and Compact with Africa (CwA) countries, to inform future country-specific analyses and to support the design of future industrial innovation policy in Reform Partnership or CwA countries. In Q1 the first draft of the paper was completed and submitted for review. 
(3) Investment: We initiated a seven-country study (Morocco, Tunisia, Senegal, Ethiopia, Togo, C&#xF4;te d&#x2019;Ivoire and Ghana), titled &#x2018;Pathways to Accelerate Investment&#x2019; which will inform German government decisions on the scope of its work in Reform Partnership countries. The study was completed and submitted to GIZ for feedback in Q4 2020.</narrative>
