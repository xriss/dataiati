   <narrative xml:lang="EN">These are core activities associated with organising events for projects,
 communication and disseminating reports. Since the launch of the African Transformation Report in October 2017, communications activities have focused on organizing mini-launch events. Two of such was organised in the United States of America. Across Africa, there were events in Ghana, Cote d&apos;Ivoire, Ethiopia and Botswana. Communication and event activities were also undertaken towards and during the African Transformation Forum in June 2018. During 2018, ACET was tagged on Twitter in a call for applications for the prestigious Prospect Think Tank awards and awarded Best Global Economic Think Tank. We also experienced a significant increase in ACET mentions in both traditional and social media. During the first quarter of 2019, the team uploaded ACET&#x2019;s 2016, 2017 and 2018 annual report on the website. Additionally, six (6) of our reports were uploaded or published together with the Brookings Institution&#x2019;s Foresight Africa 2019 publication. By close of March 2019, ACET had been referenced twenty (18) times in publications by the African Perspective on Global Development and the Institute for Global Dialogue in association with UNISA to mention a few.
