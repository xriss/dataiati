   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Myanmar Joint Peace Fund is a joint fund of ten countries and the EU to support Myanmar&apos;s efforts to achieve lasting and inclusive peace. The internal conflicts in Myanmar have lasted for over 70 years. The situation in the peace process is constantly 
unstable. Getting all parties involved in the peace process is extremely important to achieve lasting peace.The first period of the Peace Fund is six years but Finland divided funding into two parts. During the first period the Peace Fund was launched. By 
the end of 2016 the Fund opened an open financial search resulting in 129 applications. The projects funded by the search began to be launched slowly since mid-2017 so they have only been implemented for just over a year. A large part of the projects are t
wo-year-old so their results will only be evaluated next year. The evaluation of the first three years considers that the Peace Facility is relevant in the context of Myanmar. The Fund has been able to respond to a changing peace context and in particular 
the expert assistance provided by the Fund has proved to be extremely valuable in situations where external expertise and perspective needed to resolve various issues related to the peace process and to advance the debate.The long-term goal of the Peace Fu
nd is to achieve an inclusive and lasting peace. The achievement of this goal is supported through three immediate results targets: 1) formal and informal conflict management mechanisms; 2) increased stakeholder participation in formal and informal consult
ations dialogues and negotiations; and 3) increased participation awareness and trust in citizens&apos; peace process.There is an option to recruit an consultant to support Finnish vice presidency and presidency in the JPF.The budget for the project is EUR 5 20
0 000 for the years 2019-2021.</narrative>
