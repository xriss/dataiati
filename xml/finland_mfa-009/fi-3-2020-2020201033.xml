   <narrative xml:lang="EN">F.a: Small-farmers? improved opportunities for income generation in Ghana?s cocoa growing communities</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Although seen as significant livelihood opportunity for rural communities, cocoa growing is also a source of several development problems facing Ghana. The sector is notorious for being a perpetuator of worst forms of child labour. On average, cocoa farmer
s earn less than $2 per day, an income below the poverty line. Furthermore, increasing pressure from agricultural expansion, mining, timber extraction and other socio-economic factors have negatively impacted the biological resources of the country. Farmer
s are expanding their farms trying to overcome poverty ? the root cause of child labour ? forests are being cleared for cocoa cultivation. Illegal logging also gives much needed additional income for rural families. The majority of farmers use biomass ener
gy, and charcoal production is widespread and unregulated. Another major threat is climate crisis, which will make cocoa tree cultivation more difficult over the coming decades. Changes in seasonality, intensity and amount of rainfall could compromise agri
cultural production. The rising temperatures will push the chocolate-growing uphill into mountainous terrain, much of which is currently protected. Climate risks will perpetuate pressure on cocoa households to resort to negative coping mechanisms such as c
hild labour.#This new project complements our other cocoa sector project in Ghana by tackling the root causes of child labour. The project?s goal is to contribute to realization of child rights in cocoa growing communities. The project?s purpose is to redu
ce the risk of child labour in cocoa production in targeted communities. The project?s outputs:#1)	Fairtrade Carbon Credit projects in action (energy efficiency + forestry)#2)	Increased awareness of climate change#3)	Cooperative-specific plans for adaptati
on to climate change#4)	Dynamic agroforestry plots established#5)	Expanded knowledge of dynamic agroforestry and sustainable cultivation methods #The project will be implemented by Fairtrade Africa in cooperation with Gold Standard, World Resources Institu
te and Ghana Federation of Disabled Organizations.</narrative>
