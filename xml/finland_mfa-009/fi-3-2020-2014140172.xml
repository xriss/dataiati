   <narrative xml:lang="EN">F.a: Rights of domestic workers</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Domestic workers work mainly in informal and unstable working conditions. They often end up working in the sector due to lack of options and mass unemployment. It is very hard or even impossible to complain about the working conditions because domestic wor
kers are often made to believe that their job is a gesture of charity from the employer. Most domestic workers are young women or girls doing heavy work with minimal and unstable salary and they lack respect, overtime-pay, holidays, written job contracts a
nd social security. The level of rights awareness is low and the fear of losing one?s job makes it difficult to complain on bad working conditions - even violence at work and other forms of inappropriate treatment. The project will help to implement traini
ngs to the SINED activists and leadership, recruit new members, strengthen the union presence in all provinces of the country, develop the administrative systems, advance the registration of domestic workers in the social security and campaign about the ri
ghts of domestic workers to the general public as well as decision-makers. The project will also assist SINED to campaign on the ratification of the ILO convention 189 on domestic workers? rights as well as for improvement of the social security legislatio
n for domestic workers. As a result of the project the rights awareness and working conditions of domestic workers will improve and the trade union will become stronger both geographically and from the financial sustainability perspective. The union will a
ctively educate its members on workers? rights, improve their social security and campaign professionally and successfully for legislative changes. In the best-case scenario, the ILO Convention 189 will be ratified in Mozambique by the end of the project p
eriod. The exact number of domestic workers in Mozambique is not known but according to SINED the potential is around 35 000 people only in the capital area. By the end of 2017 SINED had 6000 members and it has gained credibility and visibility as the defe
nder of domestic workers? rights and promoter of their social security. In 2016 domestic workers in Mozambique got the right to social security. SINED is the official project partner of SASK. The union is affiliated to the national center OTM-CS and the In
ternational Domestic Workers? Federation (IDWF). In addition to domestic workers and their families, also the activists and leadership of SINED are beneficiaries of the project.</narrative>
