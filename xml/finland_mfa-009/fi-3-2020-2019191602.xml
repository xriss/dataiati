  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">1. Project: 12073 Skilling Refugee Youth for Immediate Employment in Kyaka II Refugee settlement2. Project area and Country: Kyaka II Refugee settlement, Kyegegwa District, Uganda3. Project justification: Uganda is the world?s second youngest country with 
the median age of just 15.9. The working-age population is growing fast: the growth rate was 3,92% per year between 2011 and 2017. Uganda?s working-age population will increase by 13 million people between 2017 and 2030. Financial dependency is very high i
n Uganda, with 1,42 dependents per employed person in 2017. To reach the same per capita income growth as countries with lower dependency, Uganda must increase average labour productivity faster in addition to create more jobs for new workers. Raising agri
cultural productivity is key in economic transformation, but in addition, there needs to be a faster movement in moving young workers from agriculture into higher productivity industry and service jobs. Uganda has received an unprecedented influx of refuge
es, and is now the largest refugee hosting country in Africa with 1,411,098 refugees as of February 2020. Out of this, approximately 60% are children and youth. Kyegegwa district, including Kyaka II refugee settlement, is one of the main refugee hosting di
stricts in Uganda. Most of the refugees in Uganda end up in self-employment opportunities or informal, low-skilled employment. The specific barriers faced by refugees are language skills (especially the refugees from DRC), legal issues, discrimination and 
lack of relevant documentation. Unequal opportunities to livelihoods can cause social exclusion, leading to negative coping mechanisms like crime, violence, alcohol and drug abuse. 4. The main objective and the expected results:The main objective is improv
ed socio-economic status of refugee and host community youth in Kyaka II refugee settlement contributing to increased self-reliance and social cohesion. In order to achieve the goal, the beneficiaries will receive training on marketable vocational skills a
nd working life experience to support employment or self-employment, and 250 of them will become trainees with strong entrepreneurship skills and mentoring support to start and sustain their own businesses. Right-holders/beneficiaries: 1,000 refugee and ho
st community youth. 5. Duty bearers: Local government?s agencies and private sector. 6. Implementing partner: FCA Uganda</narrative>
