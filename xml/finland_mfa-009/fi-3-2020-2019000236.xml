   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Global Dry Toilet Association of Finland together with its local partners continue to improve sanitation and hygiene in Zambia in the second phase of the project in years 2021-2024. The long-term goal of the project is to help Zambia achieve 100% sanitatio
n coverage by 2030 according to SDG 6. Currently only 26 % of Zambians have access to basic sanitation. The project includes four local partners ? GLM NECOS LGI and UIP ? and from Finland the Student Union of the University of Turku and Disability Partners
hip Finland. The project operates in close cooperation with the local Ministry of Water (MWDSEP) and other stakeholders working towards the common sanitation goal.The project benefits especially the inhabitants and stakeholders of the project areas but par
t of the operations cover the whole Zambia e.g. through media. The project strengthens the capacity of the civil society and partners to better influence sanitation issues and to improve the results&apos; sustainability (outcome 1). To improve the stakeholder a
wareness on WASH issues especially on dry toilets trainings and events are organised and information is spread. The raised awareness leads to a change for better in behaviour and customs in terms of environmental health attitudes towards dry sanitation and
 increased demand for sanitation (outcome 2). Relevant research is conducted in order to discover the best techniques and practises to increase the approval of dry sanitation as well as the acceptance and utilisation of the entire value chain and to gain r
esearch data to support the advocacy work (outcome 3). The goal of the project is to mainstream the climate change mitigation in WASH as well as the role of the vulnerable groups such as girls women young and disabled thus improving their knowledge and pos
sibilities to participate and to affect and to gain sanitation facilities meeting their special needs (outcome 4). The toilets and water and handwashing points built reduce open defecation and affect on the behavioural change and the improvement of health.
 Through the sanitation value chain new jobs and means of livelihood are created and climate change effect can be mitigated (outcome 5).</narrative>
