s. This goal requires strategic planning and a secure financial basis for the three-year period covered by the current proposal. By establishing YFS as a permanent school with a regular curriculum ideally within a national institution YFS will strengthen c
ivil society by creating a creative intelligentsia that promotes human rights by giving a voice to the voiceless documenting social iniquities but also finding positive narratives that will contribute to Myanmar?s transition to a democratic state. The Yang
on Film School&apos;s core activity is to strengthen film as a means of promoting diversity and democratisation. This continuation project comprises a programme of advanced filmmaking courses and outreach train-to-teach and on-the-job management training design
