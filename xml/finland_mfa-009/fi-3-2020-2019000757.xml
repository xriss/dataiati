   <narrative xml:lang="EN">GPE (Global Partnership for Education) is a World Bank trust fund that provides grants and technical assistance for developing country governments to develop and strengthen their education systems. It is the world?s largest fund to support solely education
. GPE provides funding primarily to least developed countries and fragile states where the need to develop education systems is the highest. GPE&apos;s focus is to support building equitable and inclusive education systems by advancing girls disabled and other 
marginalized children to access education. GPE also supports the rebuilding and strengthening of education systems in conflict areas. The COVID-19 pandemic has triggered an education emergency of unprecedented scale. It has deepened the education crisis in
 developing countries leaving over 800 million children cut off from schools and some of them risking never returning to education. GPE responded to the pandemic in April 2020 by allocating USD 250 million from the GPE Fund for the creation of a dedicated 
and accelerated funding window focused on COVID-19 response and early recovery (COVID Accelerated Funding Window). In June 2020 the COVID-19 AF was expanded to USD 500 million. The funding capacitates governments of GPE?s 67 partner countries to mitigate t
he impact of COVID-19 on their education systems and help recovery. By October 2020 66 grants had been approved totaling USD 467 million. This makes GPE the largest provider of funds dedicated solely to education in the global coronavirus response. GPE?s C
OVID-19 funding aims to mitigate the immediate and long-term impacts of the pandemic on education and to build more resilient education systems. The focus is to ensure that the most vulnerable children including girls and children of the poorest families w
ho are hit the hardest by school closures are not left behind. Together with supporting modalities of distance education the funding also focuses in the reopening of education facilities. Finland has funded GPE from 2013 to 2016 with EUR 6 million. The fun
ding ended due to budgetary cuts in 2016. We are proposing to fund the GPE COVID-19 Accelerated Funding Window with EUR 2 million.</narrative>
