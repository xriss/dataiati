  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project will build the capacity of the Latin American and the Caribbean network of small Fairtrade producers (CLAC) and its member networks to advocate on climate change issues. It will strengthen the national Fairtrade networks? relations with nationa
l governments and improve their capacities to design public policy proposals to mitigate climate change effects. The project is continuation to Fairtrade Finland?s previous programme, where CLAC prepared its first continental Advocacy Strategy. Climate cha
nge is one of the main concerns for small producers in Latin America and the Caribbean. Its negative effects are already evident in the quality and productivity of their crops, decreasing water sources, changes in rainfall patterns, average temperature inc
rease, droughts, and the spread of new pests and damaged crops proliferation. Small producers? organizations are left quite alone with their adaptation struggles. Latin American countries are not well prepared to respond to the climate crisis, and their na
tional development plans don?t include necessary measures of climate change adaptation, especially for the smaller and most disadvantaged agricultural producers. The project will increase the leadership skills and advocacy capacities of CLAC?s members, esp
ecially youth, so that they are capable of advocating on climate change issues. Support is given in designing and implementing national advocacy plans, to influence decision making processes and development plans, and raising awareness about the negative e
ffects of global warming on small scale agriculture. Apart from communicating about the challenges, the producers? will be promoted as the key agents for change. The goal of the project is increased awareness and empowerment of Latin American civil society
 to contribute to the climate change adaptation and mitigation. The purpose is strengthened capacities to advocate for social actions and public policies that promote climate change adaptation. Target countries in the region are El Salvador, Bolivia, Nicar
agua, Guatemala and Ecuador. Direct beneficiaries are the 100 representatives of the national producer networks who participate in the core activities of the project. Ultimately the project is expected to benefit up to 30 000 producers. Implementing partne
r organizations are Latin American and the Caribbean network of small Fairtrade producers, CLAC and its national producer networks in the five target countries. http://clac-comerciojusto.org/</narrative>
