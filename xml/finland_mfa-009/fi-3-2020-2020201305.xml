   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The beneficiaries of the project are the forest-dependent Mount Mabu and Muzo local communities in the province of Zambezia. Mabu is home to the largest mid-altitude rainforest in southern Africa, covering 7,880 ha. The local community in the area is organ
ized into 8 associations, including 4 women?s associations. Their livelihood depends on the forest, which they want to protect. They possess usufruct rights to the area. They have applied for a formal community-based protection permit for it, but the proce
ss has not advanced due to competing land use pressure. The rights of the community and the forest are threatened by the unclear land use plans of the new tea plantation owner, as well as the recently approved conservation project funded by Biofund and led
 by WWF, the planning of which did not involve local communities. Muzo, on the other hand, is Mozambique?s first community-based forest management permit area, covering 33,000 ha. The ACODEMUZO association is responsible for the protection and sustainable 
use of the forest and manages a sawmill. The operation of the association has run into great difficulties. In the uncertain situation, the area is exploited by illegal loggers and poachers with help of some community members. The project 1) provides techni
cal support to the Mabu and Muzo communities, 2) implements awareness and mobilisation meetings on forest protection and community solidarity, 3) carries out reforestation with local species in Muzo, 4) produces improved beehives, 5) trains the community a
ssociations in legal context and management issues to improve conflict resolution, planning and benefit-sharing 6) supports in planning activities and sound management of small grants, 7) advocates the authorities to grant community-based protection permit
 for Mabu and to protect Muzo forests from illegal logging, 8) organises exchange of experience between Mabu and Muzo communities, 9) supports in registering local community rights violations and reporting them to authorities and 10) produces two case stud
ies. As a result of the project, the local communities of Mabu and Muzo are expected to have strengthened their capacity to protect the forests and improved the well-being of the communities. The direct beneficiaries of the project are the 154 members of t
he 9 Mabu and Muzo residents&apos; associations. Indirect beneficiaries include the 135,881 residents of the 7 villages. The project is implemented by Justica Ambiental (JA, https://ja4change.org/).</narrative>
