   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Tanzania observes rights of disabled people in legislation, however these rights are not fully realized at grass roots level, and in particular the situation of rural disabled people is difficult. Reasons are lack of necessary knowhow and resources among m
unicipal decision makers, parents of disabled children, teachers, and other local community influential people. Additionally, schools are often inaccessible and teachers lack skills to work with disabled children. Many disabled children thus are left witho
ut possibility of studying. Additionally in traditional culture children are often isolated from all social networks and their development is thus slowed or prevented. The traditional operating model is contrary to human rights and through this project tra
ditional operating models are changed to realize human rights of disabled people. Expected development effects: realization of the human rights of disabled people in Lushoto province. Results of activities (i) community integration of rehabilitated disable
d people, (ii) growth in skills of kindergarten and elementary school teachers to work with disbled children, and disabled children are able to attend school, (iii) improved health status of disabled children, and (iv) local leaders and civil servants are 
aware of Tanzanian disability legislation and implement the rights of disabled people in education. There are 2520 beneficiaries of the project (1045W ja 845M as carers of disabled children, including disabled youth and children 300G ja 330B) and 792 beare
rs of responsibility. 6860 individual benefit from the project indirectly. The target groups are disabled people, key individuals of organizations, and civil servants. The project is implemented by the northern diocese of the Church of Tanzanie, which is a
 forerunner in advocating for the rights of disabled people in Tanzania. The know-how of two of the churchs institutions is joined in this project: the know-how of the Rainbow school for developmentally disabled children in detective and community based di
sability work and the know-how of the Sebastian Kolowa Memorial University in special education and advocacy. Through cooperation, the right to livelihood of disabled people are strengthened through  rehabilitation and education, because the project affect
s, in addition to families and local communitites, also the increase in know-how of realization of rights of disabled people among responsible authorities, teachers, and local community leaders.</narrative>
