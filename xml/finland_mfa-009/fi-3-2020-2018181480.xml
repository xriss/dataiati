   <narrative xml:lang="EN">F.a: Strengthening of small producer organizations of coffee</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project supports the climate resilience of small coffee producers in Honduras and strengthens the capacities of local coffee producer organisations. The project follows-up two previous project phases (2014-2016 and 2017-2019). Nearly 100 000 families i
n Honduras cultivate coffee and the sector employs up to a million people during the harvest. Coffee is the most important export commodity of the country. Climate change is one of the major driving forces of migration in Honduras. Many small-scale coffee 
farmers are forced to give up agricultural production and for lack of alternatives they migrate abroad. The first phase of the project tackled a plant disease caused by the climate change, coffee rust, that hit the whole Central America. The second phase f
ocussed on strengthening the cooperatives administrative capacity and management? knowledge on labour rights. Productivity and quality of coffee was improved by trainings on environmental sustainability and supporting organic farming. In the new phase of t
he project, support for the climate change adaptation and sustainable farming practices will be continued and deepened, while income diversification is encouraged. More focus will be put on empowering youth, women and other vulnerable groups, to increase t
heir participation throughout the coffee value chain, and to support their access to decision-making positions. The goal of the project is to contribute to sustainable livelihoods of small coffee producers and workers and their right to a living income. Th
e project?s purpose is to strengthen the coffee cooperatives organizational capacities and their economic, ecological, and social sustainability. The project also includes two pilots: 1) to tackle child labour exploitation in coffee farming, and 2) to esta
blish a strategy for a living income for coffee producers and workers. 16 coffee producer cooperatives in Honduras are targeted. Direct beneficiaries of the current project are 2,065 small-holder farmers (26 percent are women) and 551 workers (208 are perm
anent and 343 temporary employees). About 23 percent of these producers belong to indigenous people lencas. Implementing partner organization is the Honduran network of small Fairtrade producers, Coordinadora Hondurena de Pequenos Productores certificados 
por Comercio Justo (CHPP). Other partners include a German retailer ALDI SOUTH, Honduran coffee development and educational agencies, and local NGOs. http://www.comerciojustohonduras.org/</narrative>
