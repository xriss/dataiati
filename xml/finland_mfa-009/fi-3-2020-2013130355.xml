   <narrative xml:lang="EN">International Trade Centre (ITC) is a joint international organization created by UNCTAD and WTO and offering trade-related technical assistance. Its mission is to enhance inclusive and sustainable growth and development in developing countries especially 
Least Developed Countries and economies in transition through improving the international competitiveness of micro small and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs). The private sector creates more than 90 percent of new jobs in developing countries. Employment b
rings income to the people and tax revenue to the state to finance public services. Growth of business activity diversifies the economy and creates new opportunities for entrepreneurship through value chains.ITC&apos;s impact will be to contribute to SDGs 1 2 4
 5 8 9 10 12 16 and 17. ITC&apos;s outcome will be to strengthen the international competitiveness of MSMEs. The better competitiveness of MSMEs helps them integrate into the global economy and benefit from international trade. ITC&apos;s intermediate outcomes are: 
1) policymakers integrate business interests 2) trade and investment support institutions can better support MSMEs 3) MSMEs introduce changes in their operations and 4) market partners open up value chains for MSMEs.ITC operates widely in developing countr
ies. More than 80 percent of ITC&apos;s support goes to Sub-Saharan Africa and Least Developed Countries as well as heavily increasingly to fragile states and transit countries of refugees. In addition to MSMEs the ITC concentrates especially on supporting wome
n and youth entrepreneurs as well as developing the livelihoods of displaced people and the informal business sector.Finland is a long-term partner to ITC. MFA supports the ITC with 3110000 euros during 2018-2020. 1500000 euros is unearmarked core funding.
 1560000 euros is also core funding but softly earmarked to support MSMEs to help connect to global value chains and to promote and mainstream inclusive and green trade. In practice this means the strengthening of women and youth entrepreneurs&apos; trading opp
ortunities and that of marginalized groups&apos; livelihoods. 60000 euros of that is allocated to organizing SheTrades events. 50000 euros is reserved for the follow-up guiding and influencing of the project.</narrative>
