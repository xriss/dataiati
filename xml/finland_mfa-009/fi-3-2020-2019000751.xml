   <narrative xml:lang="EN">l Am European: Migration Stories + Facts for the 21st Century is a global education project funded by the EuropeanCommission (DEAR). The project is implemented in eight EU countries by six European CSOs and one media company. The project is expected to con
tribute to a more open inclusive and peaceful culture towards migrants and refugees in Europe. The main approach taken is awareness-raising among youth supported by engaging young journalists in creating balanced and fact-based media content on migration t
hemes. For a multi-pronged reach on the one hand youth will be engaged through a Pan-European social media campaign accompanied by empathy-increasing direct action content such as visual stories simulations virtual reality experiences etc. On the other han
d youth will be reached through global education activities where multipliers such as teachers and youth workers and grassroots sub-grantee organisations will be the key players. Young journalists and social media influencers will be engaged through nation
al and international trainings and study trips providing knowledge and first-hand experiences related to migration to enhance the understanding of the interdependencies and complexities of the world today. All project activities will have a special emphasi
s on including participants with a migration background and/or living in rural areas giving a voice to all stakeholders. ln total 2 500 000 youth will be reached by the social media campaign across project countries with 200 000 youth taking action within 
the campaign framework resulting in European youth who are more aware knowledgeable and engaged in migration issues and are taking action together with migrant youth to promote integration acceptance and tolerance within their communities. Journalistic act
ivities will reach 900 young people involved in media and social media content creation. Additionally 600 multipliers will be involved in global education activities. The Foundation of Media and Development Vikes is coordinating the project in Finland. Act
ivities in Finland include for example trainings study trips and scholarships for young journalists events for youth and videos on migration. ln addition sub-grants will be provided for Finnish small and medium scale CSOs for innovative global education ac
tivities on migration.</narrative>
