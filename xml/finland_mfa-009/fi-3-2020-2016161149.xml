an in 2013, the coping mechanisms of both IDPs and host communities living in the target area were eroded. The availability of food became a major issue, including for the host communities that welcomed the IDPs. IDPs were forced to abandon their farms in 
their areas of origin, only to be constrained to working in small gardens in their new area of refuge. Communities in the project area are dependant on general food distributions by WFP and interventions by the other NGOs. These interventions have mostly f
ocused on IDPs living in the camps, excluding those outside the camps. This project will therefore target IDPs living outside the camps, with livelihood activities focusing on fishing, animal husbandry and agriculture. When they fled, many IDPs also had to
 leave their livelihood assets behind. Without the necessary skills and assets, many IDPs are currently food insecure and unable to restore and develop their livelihoods in sustainable ways.#4. The main objective and expected results:#The projects main obj
ective is to rebuild the coping capacity of the targeted affected rights-holders, eroded because of conflict. This will be mainly achieved through skills training of the targeted pastoralists, farmers and fishermen. The project will also distribute  produc
tive assets and provide logistical and administrative support to the county agricultural extension office.#5. Right-holders/ beneficiaries: 280 beneficiaries, including women, farmers, youth and officials from an agricultural extension office.#Duty bearers
