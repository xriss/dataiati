  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Myanmar?s energy demand is growing rapidly and has driven the development of large scale investment projects without consideration of sustainable alternatives. On the other hand, regional MEE Net network has been playing a key role to building the capacity
 of civil society and local and ethnic communities to enable them for better participation in energy policy and decision making. In this project, Foundation for Renewable Energy and Ecology (FREE) will continue MEE Net?s nation-wide energy advocacy work, a
nd on local level, continues the community-centered strategic environmental assessment (C-SEA) work in Irrawaddy River in Basin and Shan State. As a new approach, FREE will facilitate the networking and cooperation of communities between the lowland Irrawa
ddy Basin area (Dry Zone) and the upland Danu Autonomous area in Shan State for their strategic joint natural resources management planning. These activities aim to produce alternatives (e.g. decentralized community power) to the push for large-scale dam d
evelopment in the Irrawaddy Basin. Outcomes of the project are 1) Active community grassroots networks in Irrawaddy Basin and Danu area are more capable of protecting local resources and livelihoods, 2) Civil society members, politicians and authorities ha
ve better understanding of energy legal and regulatory framework, energy sector planning and electrification, and alternative options through FREE?s work activities, 3) CSO/NGO and academic stakeholders have better knowledge of the dam politics and transbo
undary dialogue through FREE?s work, and 4) FREE has improved its own capacity in project management. Direct beneficiaries include about 5500 community members working on river-related energy issues, who receive information on their rights to sustainable e
nergy and natural resources, and tangible benefits on resource rights. Beneficiaries include also local CSOs with increased capacity in energy issues, as well as and international and local academics who participate in conferences and seminar after the res
earch done by villagers and local communities, and ethnic politicians participating in green energy workshops. Indirect beneficiaries are citizens who receive clean and locally produced electricity, supported e.g. by the new Shan energy legislation. Cooper
ating partner is Foundation for Renewable Energy and Ecology (FREE), a newly founded local organisation to continue the work of the Mekong Energy and Ecology Network (MEE Net) in Myanmar.</narrative>
