   <narrative xml:lang="EN">1. Project: 12005 IOPT Teachers Without Borders #2. Project area and Country: Occupied Palestinian Territory (West Bank) #3. Project justification: #The situation of Palestinian children living under the occupation is further undermined by the state of the
 education sector: in 2017, UNICEF estimated that the right to education of 1 million Palestinian children was at risk due to school demolitions, confiscation of equipment, double shifts, inability to prioritize education and underfunding. In 2016 alone, 2
56 education-related violations were documented in the West Bank, affecting nearly 30 000 students. An education assessment commissioned by FCA in 2017 identified a number of specific gaps and deficits in the sector including lack of inclusive education an
d integration of technical/vocational subjects in general education. It was recommended that FCA should deploy Teachers without Borders volunteers to support development of models and practices to implement inclusive and learner-centered education at schoo
l level, hence tangibly strengthening the capacity of the Palestinian education sector.   #4. The main objective and the expected results: #The main objective  is improved inclusive quality education and wellbeing of the most marginalized Palestinian child
ren. As a result of the project, the targeted schools in the West Bank are expected to have enhanced physical, social and pedagogical learning environment. The project aims also to build staff capacity in the targeted schools according to identified needs.
 The lessons learnt of the initiative will be shared with the Palestinian Ministry of Education to inform its policy decisions. #5. Right-holders/ beneficiaries: #Learners, teachers and school principals in the selected schools, school counsellors, communi
ties and parents. Supervisors from the Palestinian Ministry of Education in charge of overseeing primary and secondary schools#Duty bearers: # Palestinian education authorities who are responsible for providing quality education to Palestinian learners as 
well as for employing teaching staff for this purpose and ensuring their professional development.  #School staff can also be seen playing the double role of rights-holders entitled to professional on-job training as well as duty-bearers responsible for de
livering quality education.#6. Implementing partner: Finn Church Aid</narrative>
