   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Poverty instability and displacement of Syrians in Lebanon have led to the increase of child marriage among Syrian refugees as well as vulnerable Lebanese. This project implemented by Developmental Action without Borders (Naba?a) intends to contribute to t
he  reduction of early marriage in the most vulnerable and neglected communities (Lebanese and Syrian) in Akkar North Lebanon and providing a protective environment particularly for young and adolescent girls. The project is based on the recommendations of
 the previous project funded by the Finnish Embassy. This will be achieved through four main project components: 1) The first component aims to reshape the lives of the most marginalized Lebanese young and adolescent girls through enrolling them in a vocat
ional training center to study a vocational profession. This might help them to find better job opportunities and prevent their early marriage as they are able to cover their daily expenses.  2) The second component is working on empowering and enhancing t
he skills of the girls to be girls advocacy activists within their communities at the local and national levels. 3)The third component will be focused on the parents adolescent girls and Community Members whom will be empowered and Enabled to take Informed
 Decisions and to become Agents of Positive Change in order to prevent and Respond to Early Marriage. This will be achieved through awareness raising capacity development for parents particularly mothers and community leaders on the child rights protection
 and the risks of early marriage. 4)The fourth component will be focused on the advocacy and lobbying where the community Leaders and influential persons including religious leaders are aware about the risks of child marriage and agree that marriage should
 not be contracted before 18 years in any circumstances.  The direct project beneficiaries are 40 adolescent and young girls and 600 community members.</narrative>
