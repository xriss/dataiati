   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The goal of the Cambodia Country Programme is to contribute to the increase of justice, human dignity and peace. This is achieved through strengthening the fulfillment of childrens rights for health, education and adequate standards of living. In addition 
to the work at the community level, the Programme aims to increase the partners, Assemblies of God Cambodia, ability to bring change in advocating for the rights of the children. Special attention has been given to the most vulnerable people, such as peopl
e with disabilities, girls and women, and the sustainable development of the environment.##The Programme consists of integrated development programmes, focusing on least developed rural villages, and an urban youth programme, working with the vulnerable yo
uth in cities. The Programme has the potential of impacting the lives of vulnerable children and youth nationwide. The Programme aims to bring about change in the lives of almost 28 000 direct and 50 000 indirect beneficiaries. The implementing actors of t
he Programme are Fida International, a local NGO, Cambodia Global Action and the Assemblies of God Cambodia along with its numerous local parishes and national youth department.##The integrated community development work carried out in the villages focuses
 on training VDCs on issues such as preventative health, agriculture and livelihood, food security and childrens rights. In addition to this families are taught in the communities, such as building wells, water filters, home gardens, compost pits and latri
nes. Through youth centers, the vulnerable youth in urban contexts are provided facilities and opportunities for building social relationships, strengthening self-esteem, obtaining new skills and learning about issues, such as the effects of substance abus
e, sexual health and life skills. Youth centers also cooperate with local high schools and parents and leaders.##As a result of the work, the Programme expects to see change in the level of health, education and living standards of the vulnerable children 
and youth. Increasing the knowledge regarding preventative health and level of livelihood and food security of vulnerable families results in the decrease of sicknesses and increase of opportunities for education, safe childhood and a hopeful future for ch
ildren. Increased awareness among youth regarding socially important issues accompanied with strengthened relationships and self-esteem provide a platform for making healthier decision.</narrative>
