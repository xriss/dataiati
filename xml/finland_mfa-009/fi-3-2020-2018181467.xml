ate level of Myanmar, in 6 states/regions. The current programme of Myanmar School of Politics (MySoP) started in 2016. The basic element of the programme are core courses, oganized 2-3 times a year. The core courses are 4-week-long and all the parties in 
the particular regions/states of Myanmar send their participants into the course, according to criteria set by MySoP. Politicians gain practical experience in policy development, public consultation, strategic policy planning, human rights, gender equality
, debating, speech writing and multiparty dialogue. This contributes to a culture of dialogue amongst political parties, leading to the facilitation of dialogue. Moreover, a permanent Multiparty Dialogue Platform has been created in Shan State to support m
ultiparty dialogue in practise among 12 parties in a sustainable and participatory way. MySoP alumnis will receive specific support through tailor made workshops, focusing on enhancing skills in debating, advocacy and planning policies etc. In the election
 year 2020, focus will be on candidate training amongst MySoP alumni. Additionally, peer exchange between international and Myanmar politicians will create further support on multiparty co-operation on the basis of experience sharing and mutual learning. E
xpected outcomes of the project 2016-2020: 1. Safe space for dialogue btw. all relevant political actors 2. Political actors voice and monitor citizen&apos;s interests 3. Improved capacity of local partner 4. Increased interest in collaborating among and btw po
litical and civic actors, fostering inclusiveness of women and youth. The achievement of the outcomes and results are monitored against pre-set indicators throughout the project. The direct target groups are the state level politicians taking part in the M
