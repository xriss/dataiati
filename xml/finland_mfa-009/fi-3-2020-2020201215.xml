  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In Tanzania, Nigeria and Morocco, the effects of climate change are reflected in rising temperatures as well as increased natural disasters. The effects of climate change will hit hardest the most vulnerable citizens and workers, who may not have access to
 basic services. In the project countries, co-operation between public trade unions and governments on climate change mitigation and just transition is either completely lacking or very limited. The project will increase public sector trade unions knowledg
e of climate change and their capacity to act so that they can play a significant role in their countries climate change mitigation and adaptation plans. At the same time, the capacity of trade union leadership to engage in effective dialogue will be impro
ved. As a result of the project, public sector unions in Tanzania, Nigeria and Morocco will have a coherent and strong solution to curb climate change and ways to get workers to adapt fairly to the changes caused by the phenomenon. During the project, the 
unions will work with national governments on climate change and just transition measures. The project will benefit the citizens of Tanzania, Nigeria and Morocco, especially the disadvantaged. The project is being implemented by Public Services Internation
al PSI together with its Tanzanian, Nigerian and Moroccan affiliates. In Finland the project is supported by Trade Union JHL.</narrative>
