   <narrative xml:lang="EN">F.a: Enhancing Inclusive and Gender Sensitive Mediation Capacities</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">When conflicts are mediated, it is crucial to identify and address root causes that drive and feed the conflict, and to be aware of the gender-specific effects of proposed solutions. Mediators play a key role in translating this potential to reality: their
 ability to promote inclusive and gender-sensitive mediation strategies can harness the resources women and other excluded groups provide to achieve sustainable peace. While more gender expert advice has been provided to peace processes and a growing numbe
r of peace agreements have included gender-relevant provisions, the number of women involved in formal peacemaking processes remains low. Women and their views continue to be grossly underrepresented in peace processes. An increasing number of policymakers
 and mediation actors are normatively committed to increasing women?s participation in peacemaking but are only lacking support structures to do so. To bridge this policy-practice gap, CMI continues to reinforce the knowledge and agency of key actors in in
clusive and gender sensitive mediation. The intention is to continue equipping mediators and mediation actors and structures with relevant knowledge and strategies on multiple inclusion mechanisms and support them to seize political entry points to do thei
r peace-making work better.Importantly, CMI?s work in this area is based on the premise that women?s inclusion can take on many different forms that go beyond direct representation at the negotiating table. There is a need to advance more politically nuanc
ed mediation strategies that are tailored to context and its specific dynamics ? rather than merely enforce global prescriptions. It is also crucial to document and disseminate these efforts and experiences to enhance learning and keep the profile of the i
ssue high. To this end, CMI builds on its empirical track record and learning on strengthening women?s inclusion in mediation structures and specific conflict-affected contexts. Combined with in-depth context knowledge and longstanding partnerships with ke
y mediation actors such as the AU and the UN, CMI is uniquely positioned to support mediators in putting the Women, Peace and Security and inclusion agendas into play in the best interests of peace processes.</narrative>
