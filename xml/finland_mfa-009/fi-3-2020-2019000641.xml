gn policy. Demo Finland supports cross-party cooperation of parties in partner countries as in a genuine pluralistic political system problems can be solved in a peaceful political way based on open dialogue collaboration and participation. When supported 
political parties can improve their knowledge base accountability transparency inclusiveness and role as democratic actors in society. Programme&apos;s overall objective is a strengthened pluralistic and inclusive multiparty system in the programme countries. P
arties are gatekeepers of women&apos;s and youth&apos;s political participation.Demo Finland&apos;s Theory of Change is based on outcomes on three different levels: political system political actor and inclusive political culture levels. The outcome of the political syst
em level is that there are safe spaces for dialogue between all relevant political actors in Myanmar Tunisia and Zambia. To achieve this multiparty dialogue platforms are developed for the parties to collaborate together and make joint initiaves in relatio
n to current political issues or to the enabling environment of the parties in the democratic system. On political actor level the outcome is that political actors voice and monitor citizens&apos; interests into party policies. This is supported through capacit
y building and programmatic parties in all four programme countries. On political culture level the outcomes are that political actors and parties collaborate with each other in responsive manner and that women youth and disabled women participate actively
 in parties and political processes. Demo Finland promotes capacity building of Finnish politicians in development and democracy policies from a multiparty perspective. Demo Finland collaborates intensively with the Parliament. Demo Finland&apos;s Programme is 
cost-effective and unique: it is the only Finnish actor supporting democracy through political parties in developing countries.</narrative>
