   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Literacy for Women in Africa (LWA) programme is currently running in four countires in Eastern Africa and Namibia. It is  supported by FiBS and the British and Finnish Bible Society (BFBS). The United Bible Societies (UBS) are strategically committed t
o the LWA programme.The overall goal of this project is the reduction of female illiteracy in Kenya and Malawi through literacy classes in four minority languages. Classes are open to men and also to the physically disabled. The plan is based on a pilot pr
oject run by the Bible Society of Malawi (BSM) in 2019-2020. To date primer materials for the Yao and Lomwe languages have been developed and BS staff and teachers have been mentored and trained. The pilot project will be evaluated in the autumn of 2020 an
d the report&apos;s findings integrated into the programme plans.Each ethnic group&apos;s unique language features and culture are the starting point for each project plan. Joint training workshops mentoring and exchange of experiences will be utilised within Kenya 
and Malawi and across countries and languages groups to facilitate the whole programme.The target group are non-literate women who are doubly marginalized due to their gender and mother tongue.The goal is that by 2024 7200 women will have learned to read. 
200-300 facilitators will be trained.The 360 literacy classes take the learner in reading to Basic User level of A2 using familiar cultural themes. Further reading materials are then devised on relevant topics enabling the learners to learn new skills thro
ugh the functional literacy activities (Post Literacy).The second goal is by using Gender analysis studies and led by a local Gender Consultant to ensure that the suplementary reading materials also broach questions of inequality within the language groups
. Materials produced with MFA funds do not contain religious content.The third goal is to integrate the literacy materials and classes into the Adult Literacy activties of both the Kenian and Malawian government programmes. The materials will be approved b
y the relevant authorities and the leaners can then continue their studies through the various Adult Learning activities available.</narrative>
