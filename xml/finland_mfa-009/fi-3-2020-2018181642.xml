  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The specific objective of the project is to promote an understanding of Community Based Rehabilitation in South Africa as a means of including people with disabilities in development and to advocate for implementation of CBR in both government and civil so
ciety initiatives in order to improve the situation of people with disabilities#In South Africa many people with disabilities are poor + marginalised.  Policy makers + other stakeholders do not understand Community Based Rehabilitation (CBR) as a means of 
disability-inclusive development.  The purpose of the project is to promote + advocate for CBR in South Africa so that people with disabilities are included in development.#The project begins with a baseline study of CBR in South Africa.  CREATE will then 
run workshops on CBR for therapists, disability NGOs and government officials.  CREATE will attempt to improve health outcomes and reduce poverty for people with disabilities by forming and supporting savings groups and running workshops on HIV, sexuality 
+ disability for youth with disabilities + HIV counsellors. CREATE will also attempt to change the attitude of church leaders towards disability by launching an advocacy initiative together with KZNCC (KwaZulu-Natal Christian Council). ##The project is imp
lemented both in rural and urban areas of KwaZulu-Natal province. The beneficiaries of the project include people who can influence decision-making concerning the development of policies and programmes that may include CBR or have an approach to the inclus
ion of people with disabilities based on CBR principles.  These people include government officials, members of the provincial legislature, senior members of staff of disability-related NGOs and therapists. Teenagers and youth with disabilities, as well as
 their parents or care takers and other community members, will be beneficiaries of the part of the project that focuses on disability, sexuality and HIV. #The project is implemented by CREATE (CBR Education + Training for Empowerment). CREATE focuses on r
ights-based CBR in South Africa.</narrative>
