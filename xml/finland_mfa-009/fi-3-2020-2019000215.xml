   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Fifteen years back Mufindi was one of the most HIV/AIDS infected area in Tanzania. Mortality rate and the number of children living without guardians or with one guardian only became extremely high. This increased poverty and social problems and created la
ck of hope among children and youth in the villages. Through an intensive programme which improved access to free HIV testing and care the situation slowly improved HIV prevalence being currently 9% among the population. The road to poverty reduction is ye
t to be paved in the area. Policy actions should focus on developing of financial mechanisms to help households to gain more sustainable income. Promotion of accurate education for rural youth would help to equalize opportunities and break the development 
which keeps majority of youth in informal employment sector only. More efforts should be made to better target access to basic services especially for chidren with disabilities. This project aims at ensuring that the most vulnerable youth in the target are
a are better equipped to take charge of their own lives as a result of improved motivation skills and opportunities. The project will provide youth with psychosocial support as well as equip them with skills and knowledge to act as successful entrepreneurs
 in their environments. Moreover the project will offer a specific employment program for disabled youth. In order to build sustainable solutions in realities of disabled children and vulnerable youth the project aims at influencing the functionalities of 
village child protection committees (VSPC). VCPSs are provided with trainings and structures to become financially more sustainable in the future.The project will be implemented in cooperation with the local organization Foxes Community and Wildlife Conser
vation Trust (FCWCT).  FCWCT has experience in working with health social and environmental issues as it has worked in the area since 2005 and has focused on vulnerable children and youth as well. In capacity building activities the project will mostly uti
lize the local expertise and actors. One of those is a known higher education institute from the same region University of Iringa (UoI)</narrative>
