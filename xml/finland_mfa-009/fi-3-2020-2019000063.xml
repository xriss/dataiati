   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Do you remember your first day at school? For most of us it was daunting and even scary. Now imagine if everything was being taught in a language you don&apos;t understand. Many people in the rural communities of Ethiopia do not speak a national language and so
 education has long been inaccessible due to the language barrier. Following the recent (2016-2020) development of primary school materials in the local languages of Ale and Konso this project aims to ensure a widespread and quality offering of mother tong
ue based preschool education to the local communities. Through the sustainable provision of quality mother tongue preschool classes we aim to see children in the Ale and Konso communities being well prepared for a successful entry into primary education.Th
e project will take preschool teaching materials currently (2020) being developed in the local languages and bring them into the classroom. Local teachers will be taught to read write and teach in their language. Local language teacher guides and story boo
ks will be provided additional school classrooms will be built or refurbished and basic preschool classroom equipment will be provided. From a small number of pilot classes a wider local government-run expansion program will be started through the training
 of additional teachers teacher-mentors/-trainers and school directors. At the end of the three year project the initial group of trained teachers will have gained vital experience and there will be a wider pool of trained teachers and education officials 
ready and able to train others. All printed materials are available as soft copies and vital skills in reading and writing will have been imparted to education actors. Children parents teachers and education officials are all direct beneficiaries of the pr
oject. Indirect beneficiaries will initially be families of the preschool children and ultimately all rural communities of the Ale and Konso areas will enjoy sustainable mother tongue based preschool education - a vital key to wider societal development. S
IL Ethiopia will be the local implementer in Ethiopia. The implementation of the project is not dependent on Finnish personnel.</narrative>
