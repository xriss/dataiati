   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project aims to empower young women who are suffering from Conflict-Related Sexual Violence Trauma in Damascus. This is done by improving access to needed services including MHPSS medical care livelihood and economic assistance.The intention is to help
 them to overcome the trauma and move on with the psycho-social help. The project has both psychological aspects as well as vocational training and cash-off type material support. The purpose is to give the beneficiaries tools to improve their livelihood e
.g. via small-scale businesses. The beneficiaries who are the sole breadwinners of their family and have little children are selected from Rural Damascus are. The center for the activities is in the middle of the old Damascus. During the training and suppo
rt sessions the children have their day-care program in the same compound. While SGBV is underreported in this region due to cultural and social stigma there are many documented cases of women and girls being raped by government forces and Organized Armed 
Groups (OAGs) other combatants during home raids while in detention and even on the streets. Sexual exploitation has also increased dramatically due to declining economic conditions whereby the HNO Overview 2019 highlights that 45 % of assessed communities
 identify early marriage as a way to ease the stress of not only family economic decline but as a way to protect their daughters. The deteriorating socio-economic situation has left many women and girls particularly vulnerable to sexual exploitation. With 
few economic opportunities available many are forced to engage in survival sex and/or serial marriages to support their families. Many women are forced to assume the role of the head of the household. The positive impact of the project is optimized by assu
ring that activities are complemented with interventions that aim to empower the beneficiaries especially women and girls. For example integrating a vocational training program and cash assistance will protect the GBV survivors and those at risk from havin
g to integrate into the same environment where all the social and economic circumstances lead her to become a victim once more.</narrative>
