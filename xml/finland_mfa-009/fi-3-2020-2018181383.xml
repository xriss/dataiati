   <narrative xml:lang="EN">1. Project: 11864 Empowering Women and Girls to Excel in Business in Informal Settlements / Slums in Kampala and Wakiso Districts #2. Project area and Country: Kampala and Wakiso districts, Uganda#3. Project justification: #Despite the impressive economic 
national performance indicators, sustained high GDP growth rate of 7.8%, low inflation and stable exchange rates, the number of poor people has not significantly decreased in Uganda. In fact, in Kampala and Wakiso, which have a population of about 3.504.49
8 million people constituting 25% of the countrys total urban population, districts poverty has increased. Urban population represents 18% (6 million) of Ugandas total population of which 60% live in slums and informal settlements. 38.9% of the residents i
n Kampala and Wakiso live in absolute poverty (under $2 a day) and 5.7% in abject poverty. Close to half of women and young girls of the informal settlements of these areas are unpaid workers or employed at the lowest levels of the value chain, where they 
earn less than $1 a day. This has generated grave effects that include, women trafficking into prostitution, ill health (high prevalence of HIV/AIDS at 37% amongst commercial sex workers), loss of lives due to unsafe abortions, malnutrition, mental health 
disorders, lack of basic needs of life, insecurity (for both food and life) and suicide. Due to a lack of employable and/or entrepreneurship skills, access to credit facilities/resources, to productive assets and a lack of awareness about their rights, wom
en and girls are trapped into the vicious cycle of chronic poverty.  #4. The main objective and expected results:#The main objective of the project is to contribute to the social economic well-being of women and girls in informal settlements of Kampala and
 Wakiso. This will be accomplished through enhanced capacities of the beneficiaries to initiate, plan and manage businesses, improved access to funding to acquire the productive assets to start their businesses as well as through increased capacity to lobb
y and advocate for their rights. #5. Right-holders/ beneficiaries: 3750 Women and girls in Kampala and Wakiso districts#Duty bearers: Districts Local leadership (Commercial Officer, Community Development Officers, District probation officers etc.), politic
ians and religious leaders, and other development partners/NGOs in the project area.#6. Implementing partner: Development and Relief Initiative -Uganda (DRI-Ug)</narrative>
