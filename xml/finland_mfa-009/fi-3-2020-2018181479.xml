   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project supports sustainable livelihoods of Haitian small producers of coffee and cocoa, strengthens their capacities to adapt to climate change, and improves the inclusion of women and youth in the producer organisations. Haiti is the poorest country 
in the Americas, and it is the only LDC in the Western hemisphere. 72 % of the total population live in poverty, with 29 % living in extreme poverty and half of the adult population is illiterate. More than 50 % of Haitians are under 25-years-old, and many
 young adults migrate to the neighbouring Dominican Republic in the hopes of a better life. The country is very exposed to natural hazards and extreme climatic events. Haiti has also been facing great political and economic instability in the recent years,
 which accentuates further the violation of human rights. Small agricultural producers are often the most vulnerable as they do not have the technical resources nor capacities to mitigate these risks, to adapt to changes or protect their livelihoods. The c
offee exportations have declined for decades and the cultivations are old, while cocoa producers lack the capacity to meet the markets? quality expectations. The project will support the producers in analysing their climate risks and developing adaptation 
plans. Capacitation on sustainable agricultural practices and income diversification will be provided through establishment of demonstration plots. These activities will also enhance food security and offer alternative income, especially for women and yout
h, whose participation in all activities is encouraged. Women and youth are also trained on leadership and organisational development to increase their inclusion in the activities and decision-making processes of the producer organisations. The goal of the
 project is to contribute to the sustainability of the small cocoa and coffee producers? and their families? livelihoods. The purpose is the improved organisational capacities of small producers of coffee and cocoa, and their ability to adapt to climate ch
ange. Direct beneficiaries of the project are around 557 members (45 % women) of two small producer organisations. Final beneficiaries are 10,602 producers belonging to two producer federations in the area of Plaisance. Implementing partner organizations a
