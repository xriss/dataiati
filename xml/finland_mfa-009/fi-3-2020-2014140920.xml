ing the potential of religious and traditional actors for peace.The work of the Network in 2019-2020  is carried out under three thematic clusters: (1) Peace Support (2) Inclusivity and (3) Thematic Expertise on Preventing Violent Extremism. In addition to
 networking the cross-cutting work modalities are research and training. The work of the Network is carried out through the members and for example in Central African Republic Kenya Somalia and South and Southeast Asia.The project has been supported since 
2014. The initiative is internationally innovative and has received good feedback on its active approach. The project supports both Finland&apos;s development policy and mediation goals. For Finland it is important that the Network works in close cooperation wi
th the UN and supports its activities thus contributing to both achieving sustainable development goals and enhancing mediation. The project also contributes to increasing Finnish mediation capacity. Gender equality and the participation of women in peace 
processes are key objectives although religious and traditional actors are often a challenging reference group. The Network also works to prevent violent extremism.The evaluation of the Network funded by the Ministry for Foreign Affairs was completed in 20
18. It was positive and noted e.g. the relevance of the Network internationally. The results of the Network include i.a. involving religious and traditional actors in peace processes and strengthening dialogue. In 2018 priorities included peace work in Som
alia and dialogue between Buddhists and Muslims in South and Southeast Asia.</narrative>
