  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Mekong region is one of the global biodiversity hotspots. The Greater Mekong is home to some of the planets most endangered wild species, including the tiger, saola, Asian elephant, Mekong dolphin and Mekong giant catfish. Biggest threats in the area are r
apid deforestation, habitat destruction, hydropower, climate change, illegal wildlife trade and overfishing. The unprecedented social and economic development of the Greater Mekong makes conservation work here especially urgent, significantand hugely chall
enging. Only about half of the Greater Mekong land area is currently forested, with only 13 per cent of primary forests remaining. Rapid deforestation threatens forests and species and peoples livelihoods.##Programme works with the local communities, gover
nments and private sector in order to protect natural forests and encourage sustainable forestry. The programme will empower communities to implement sustainable natural resource management in forest corridors. It also provides capacity building and techni
cal training for communities and form private sector partnerships to develop small-scale forest and agroforestry enterprises. Programme engages financial institutions to provide access to finance for community based enterprises. We also develop community-b
ased agroforestry practices and enable community participation in forest corridor monitoring.##Expected achievements by 2021 are#-Deforestation is addressed at the project sites#-Biodiversity, connectivity and ecosystem services are secured in the landscap
e of natural forests, production forests and plantations#-Food security is improved through agroforestry##Beneficiaries: Local communities##Implementing partner: WWF Greater Mekong (greatermekong.panda.org) / WWF Laos (www.wwflaos.org)</narrative>
