  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">During the first project phase a research exploring women?s status in media in Nepal and Tanzania clearly revealed that achieving gender equality in media sector requires structural changes in newsrooms. These changes are now targeted by influencing media 
managers and gatekeepers (e.g. managing editors) and by enhancing gender equality through in-house training in media houses. Research also revealed that women journalists widely face gender discrimination and sexual harassment at work. During this project 
women are provided with knowledge and tools for handling discrimination and harassment they may face. Activities also include influencing employers and organizing male-only training for journalists.Women?s salaries are also lower and they have reduced care
er development opportunities. During this project women journalists are provided with mentoring and training in topical fields of journalism and management skills. Attitudes are changed through campaigning and media education.Gender inequality on media sec
tor also affects media content. Men are dominating the news agenda as media managers journalists and sources. Hence strengthening the status of women in newsrooms has extensive social significance; gender equality in media will lead into more diverse and e
qual reporting. Expected outcomes; 1) Women in the newsrooms have the required professional skills and confidence for journalistic work 2) Women in the newsrooms and journalism schools have the knowledge and skills to act against gender discrimination and 
sexual harassment and journalism is seen as a suitable career choice for women 3) Media houses are providing training for their staff and are using gender policy and reporting system as tools for gender equality 4) Gatekeepers? see female journalists as ca
pable and divide tasks equally 5) Civil society promoting freedom of press and information has the capacity to successfully advocate for a gender-sensitive pluralistic media and gender equality for women journalists.Project partners are Media Council Tanza
nia Women&apos;s Media Association and Media Institute of Southern Africa in Tanzania and Center for Investigative Journalism in Nepal.</narrative>
