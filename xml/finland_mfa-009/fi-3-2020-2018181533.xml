  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Through the project Alianza Biodiversidad wants to contribute to the discussion and the construction of new paradigms to shift away from the current model based on over-utilisation of natural resources. Agroecological small-scale production, revaluing trad
itional knowledge, defense of native seeds, strengthening of local markets and building of food sovereignty are seen as the new paradigm&apos;s foundations. The project supports adaptation to climate change and its mitigation for instance by nurturing crop vari
ety, shortening crop transportation distances as well as by avoiding packaging and food waste. It enhances human rights by empowering discriminated indigenous and small-scale female farmers. The project will produce educational and information material in 
electronic, print and multimedia formats to strengthen the social movements of the region, analysis and research material on strategic themes, trainings and local workshops on different levels and in different environments based of community needs. Concret
e outputs include, for instance distance learning courses on urban agroecology, environmental public health and project planning, four annual issues in Revista Biodiversidad in Spanish and Portuguese, maintenance of Biodiversidadla.org site and its content
&apos;s active sharing in social media, as well as maintenance of campaign and multimedia sites. Project beneficiaries consist of social movements aiming at an agroecology based food production model in Latin America. During the project period 100 peasant commu
nities and 20 native seed networks will be targeted. Most of them belong to the regional peasant movement CLOC-Via Campesina, which forms part of Alianza Biodiversidad. Regarding the website, beneficiaries also include the general public, whose view on dev
elopment based on mainstream media is aimed to be widened (150,000 monthly website visitors). Another target group is political decision-makers, which will be advocated to support legislation in line with peasant organizations&apos; proposals (75 policy initiat
ives targeted during project period). Women&apos;s leadership, rights and work against gender based violence are at the heart of Alianza Biodiversidad&apos;s work, as CLOC-Via Campesina is a social movement with major participation by women.</narrative>
