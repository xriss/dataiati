   <narrative xml:lang="EN">#Reconciliation ? towards transformative processes and outcomes - works to increase the ability of individuals and communities to work for reconciliation and connect them with national and international processes. The project provides ongoing support for l
ocal solutions and key actors related to these reconciliation processes. It will geographically focus on the Eastern Africa/Horn of Africa. The project is developed with local actors based on evidence gathered by participatory action research advancing wid
er and deeper knowledge creation on reconciliation.The overall objective of #reconciliation is to advance the state of reconciliation by enhancing the effectiveness of multi-track inclusive and locally led reconciliation efforts.Therefore this program  has
 three key goals:1. Strengthen locally led reconciliation processes in the Greater Horn of Africa towards creating pathways to inclusive peaceful and just societies. This will be accomplished by: (a) setting up a virtual hub to serve as a knowledge and exc
hange hub for reconciliation-related resources expertise and peer learning (b) facilitate peer learning exchanges to make reconciliation more effective by e.g. combining universal and global knowledge with evidence and regional experiences (c) improving th
e impact of reconciliation with sharing and documenting ?the best? of reconciliation led by local reconciliation actors.2. To develop the psychosocial reconciliation/peacebuilding to integrate psychosocial and socio-emotional aspects better in peace- and r
econciliation processes.The local scope of reconciliation can be widened by integrating social healing psychosocial needs of individuals families and communities into the processes. 3. Support advocacy and policy for reconciliation to become an integral pa
rt of the Sustaining Peace agenda by a) ensuring reconciliation is included in policy institutions? strategies and policies  (b) initiating a joint international steering board and (c) offering reconciliation process design support to focus institutions.Th
e programme will be preceded by a project phase 1 carried out in 2020 which also serves as a platform to design this programme further.</narrative>
