  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">SENTRO is the most dynamic Conferederation of the Philippines. The project will improve SENTRO?s and its member unions&apos; capacity by implementing a systematic training module, as well as enhance workers&apos; rights and well-being through advocacy work related t
o political decision-making and implemented jointly with the trade union coalition NAGKAISA. In addition, the project will support organizing workers in trade unions in the textile factories in Mactan Export Processing Zone. 

Central problems in the Phili
ppines labour market are the extensive use of contracted labour force, outsourcing and the big share of informal sector among workforce (38 %). Union density is not high in Philippines, and country?s labour legislation rather hinders trade unions? to opera
te and grow, instead of facilitating them to expand. So-called yellow unions are common. Trade unions are enterprise-based, and unions&apos; joint representation and advocacy power at national level is limited, making it difficult for them to confront the chall
enges in the labour market. Collective bargaining is done on enterprise-level and minimum wages are set on regional level, not nationally. These ?divide and rule? politics weakens workers&apos; negotiation power and makes the movement more scattered. Union&apos;s do
n&apos;t have adequate capacity to respond to the multiple challenges that the workers&apos; face. 

As a result of the project, 75 new trade union leaders in the regions of Luzon, Visayas and Mindanao have been trained with the multilayered training module and they
 are able to respond to the challenges in the labour market. SENTRO together with other trade union actors has promoted legislative reforms and measures that improve workers&apos; rights, such as the Security of Tenure law, extension of Maternity Leave and soci
al security reforms. In addition, at least 4 trade unions have been established in the textile factories in Mactan Export Processing Zone to protect workers&apos; rights. 

The beneficiaries of the project are the trade unions who will benefit from the training
 given to trade union activists and leaders, and the unorganized workers in the textile factories, who will be informed about their rights, and have opportunity to join a union. Legislative measures and social security reforms will in the long run benefit 
all Filipinos. 

The project is implemented by the Confederation SENTRO, which is the youngest and most dynamic central organization in the country, but also the fastest growing in terms of member</narrative>
