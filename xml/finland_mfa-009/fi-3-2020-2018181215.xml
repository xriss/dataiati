   <narrative xml:lang="EN">F.a: MENA: Fostering Regional Dialogue</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The MENA region is faced with a complex regional conflict system. The MENA region?s conflict system is characterised by mutual suspicion between key regional actors, uncertainty about the region?s future, concerns about weapons proliferation, and marked by
 high levels of opportunism by powerful states. Currently regional rivalry is playing out in several theatres throughout the region causing instability, conflict, displacement of peoples, increased authoritarianism, and stemming economic development. Under
lying this, differences on specific issues (such as the spread of political Islam, refugees, sectarianism, the role of former regime members, terrorism, human rights, and economy) foster sub-conflicts, which play out at a national level in Libya, Yemen, Sy
ria, Iraq among others. Regional conflict in the MENA region is largely proxy in its manifestation, with an evolving character and emerging challenges. However, the MENA region lacks mechanisms?integrated or ad hoc?for effectively managing emerging politic
al crises and escalation at a regional level. There is a need to develop approaches to emerging challenges to peace and stability within the context of mediation. CMI seeks to advance this goal through supporting officials, influential policy figures and o
ther relevant regional stakeholders to be better equipped to propose solutions to managing crises. CMI also seeks to enhance awareness of consensual regional responses to crisis management in the MENA region. This is done, for instance, through organizing 
policy discussions in different forms, supporting dialogue between key conflict actors and producing analysis, publications and briefings, when possible jointly with national stakeholders and other partners.</narrative>
