   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The 5-Year Program 2017-21 will focus on fragile states and the most vulnerable children especially girls and ethnic minorities. Gender equality enhancing child participation and especially girl participation disaster preparedness and strengthening of civi
l society are Save the Children Finland?s cross-cutting themes. Our programme focuses in two themes child protection (CP) and child poverty. The aim is to enhance access and quality of these services. In child protection we emphasize the development of CP 
structures which support children and families receiving quality services in a timely manner. We support families and caretakers so they can better take care of their children. We seek to influence decision-makers and authorities so that CP issues are take
n into account in legislation and implementation.Save the Children Finland aims to strengthen national and local CP structures. When these are functioning properly they reduce the vulnerability of children and protect children from various risks (child tra
fficking harmful work violence and exploitation child marriage). The aim is to strengthen cooperation between all stakeholders involved in child protection authorities local and international organizations and sectors and develop services with them. Invest
ments in the well-being and social security of children and their families will contribute to the achievement of sustainable development goals and reduce the financial vulnerability of poor people.Save the Children Finland aims to enhance the opportunities
 for households living in extreme poverty to use the existing government social protection schemes by raising awareness among parents and caregivers and by training authorities. We are working at national level to collaborate with other organizations on be
half of a more child-friendly social security policy. The project partners will receive capacity building on child sensitivity.As a third intervention area we will also invest in the involvement of the private sector in development co-operation and private
 sector activities by promoting child rights and business principles through liaising with corporates.</narrative>
