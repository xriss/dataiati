   <narrative xml:lang="EN">South Asia?s religious diversity has often been manipulated by increasing extremist narratives feeding worrying escalations from opposite sides. The majority of the region?s population is young (over 55% under the age of 30) many in fragile and violence-af
fected contexts. The increasing recruitment of youth into extremist groups has particularly come into focus in the last few years as well as religious and cultural framing of conflict fault-lines and escalations based on nationalistic or extremist narrativ
es. In consultations with youth and youth-led CSOs in the region 4 needs have been identified 1) Prevention of Violent Extremism (PVE) strategies and current resource allocation do not utilize the most out of the youth networks and movements in reaching ou
t to peers and developing innovative approaches. 2) Lack of context specific resources on PVE as existing resources are fairly Euro/America-centric. 3) Lack of possibilities for regional exchanges peer-to-peer learning and action planning. 4) Lack of a cri
tical mass to amplify PVE voices allowing wider society consensus particularly on social media. In response the Action explores the potential for increased PVE through development of diverse youth-led approaches to PVE from Bangladesh India Pakistan and Sr
i Lanka. It amplifies youth?s role as strategic ally in PVE while emphasizing a nuanced understanding of the role of religion ideology and identity and its impact on communities. Through this Action a multi-country network of active youth promotes PVE acti
ons and strengthens civil society and its impact against extremist narratives. The Action addresses the gap of context specific resources and collaborative regional actions on PVE in South Asia strengthening not only regional but also national networks and
 youth movements potentially contributing to the development of inclusive national and regional PVE strategies and global knowledge on effective PVE strategies. Youth leaders? and youth-led CSOs? capacity is strengthened to conduct research training media 
outreach and innovative incl. inter-faith approaches to PVE enabling strong local ownership and sustainability and feeding broader youth-led advocacy regionally and internationally. Addressing various dimensions of violent extremism further contributes to 
short and long-term peace building through context specific approaches.</narrative>
