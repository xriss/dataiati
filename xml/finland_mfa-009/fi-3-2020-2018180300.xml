   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In Peru 400000 women are employed in exploitative domestic work exposed to high levels of psychological physical and sexual abuse. Many receive wages below ?5 per day well below the Peruvian minimum wage and insufficient to meet their basic needs and take 
care of their children. They are not aware of their rights or do not demand them out of fear of reprisals from their employers. State institutions are not yet able to ensure compliance with their labour rights. Reaching domestic workers to inform train and
 improve their living conditions is a necessity. Their ability to negotiate better terms of employment with a written contract and in accordance to the law is a fundamental requirement for the respect of their rights. Likewise it is essential that these wo
men gain greater self-confidence to face situations of conflict. AGTR?s solution to these issues consists of an innovative proactive and A-to-Z approach. It is proactive because it reaches out to domestic workers instead of waiting for them to take the fir
st step and get in touch with institutions and organisations providing counselling. By setting up a mobile information and engagement unit(van)AGTR aims at overcoming the lack of means experienced by domestic workers to obtain basic information guidance an
d training. This also represents a solution to the isolation and invisibility of many women due to discrimination based on gender class and ethnicity issues that deny them the chance to improve their livelihood and social status. The project is a comprehen
sive process because it consists of several stages leading to higher female employment rates and living conditions. It spans from the detection of exploited domestic workers and women wanting to access the labour market to their engagement in activities to
 increase their awareness of fundamental human and labour rights to training sessions to make them better candidates and ultimately to their placement through AGTR?s employment agency. This proactive plan improves the engagement of women in their own empow
erment and emancipation. It also increases the impact of the movement for domestic workers? rights on public institutions and society.</narrative>
