   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Country Program of Bhutan is supporting the vulnerable Bhutanese women, especially the victims of domestic violence. The beneficiaries benefitting from the vocational training will be around 600. Fida is working in Bhutan with the local CSO called RENE
W  a well-known and appreciated organization due to its preventive work on domestic violence and the comprehensive support system to the victims and their children. There are in total 4000 direct beneficiaries and 14 000 indirect ones.##The Country Program
 works in areas where previously there have been no skills trainings for women. They are rural areas where the income comes from agriculture. However, the income is hardly enough for basic needs of the family. The education level is low: the older women ar
e mostly illiterate, the younger ones have some years of education. The women dont take part in decision making in the community. The biggest problem in the communities is the harmful use of alcohol, which increases domestic violence. Besides rural communi
ties, the Program also provides training in RENEWs Head Quarters in Thimphu and in the Shelter Home and its Vocational Training Center situated near Thimphu.##The Country Program supports RENEWs comprehensive service concept by providing skills training, e
specially tailoring, to women, who are members of RENEWs saving and loan schemes. The aim is that each participant of the training can get income through the new skills. Therefore, the trainings also include training on finance and on how to start a small 
business. The income will reduce the risk of domestic violence and increase the possibility to be a part of decision making in the family and in society. The women mainly use their income for the education of their children.##The Country Program of Bhutan 
is doing preventive work on the harmful use of alcohol and domestic violence with families and communities. Themes of Childrens Rights, equity, gender equality and environment are also part of the Program.##As a result of the Country Program, 600 Bhutanese
 women get better income and the anxiety over money and the future of children diminishes in the families. The communities profit from the skilled women and their increased activity in social issues. RENEW develops as a Civil Society Organization: its skil
ls on project management improve and activities to support vulnerable women and their families expand.</narrative>
