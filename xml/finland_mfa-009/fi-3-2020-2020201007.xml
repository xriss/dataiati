  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Digital technologies have become a vehicle for hate speech, disinformation and other actions exacerbating conflicts. The current fragmentation of social media platforms used by conflict stakeholders for example, can only be expected to further polarize pol
itical positioning globally, further feeding conflicts and rendering mediators? efforts more difficult. To remain relevant in the digital era, peacemaking actors ought to invest in both their capacity to leverage the potential of digital technologies and t
heir skills and expertise in addressing the negative impact such tools have had in fuelling tensions and continuing war in the digital realm.##CMI is well-placed to play a leading role in identifying, developing and integrating digital technologies in dial
ogue processes. Not only has CMI experience with the use of such tools, but the organisation also benefits from a solid network of existing and prospective strategic partners with expertise in digital technologies. With a presence in MENA, Sub-Saharan Afri
ca, Eurasia and Asia, and a wide network of conflict stakeholders and peace mediation practitioners, CMI is well-placed to also explore ways to mitigate the negative impact digital technologies have played in fuelling conflicts and disrupting peacemaking e
fforts.##The overall objective of CMI?s project is to leverage the full potential of digital technologies to improve the practice of mediation and mitigate their use to fuel conflict and jeopardise peace processes, and directly benefit those affected by co
nflict as a result. More specifically, CMI seeks to a) identify, develop and integrate digital technology-based methods and tools to enhance CMI?s conflict analysis, engagement with conflict stakeholders, inclusivity of peace processes, communication, as w
ell as the security of CMI?s operations, b) increase and disseminate knowledge of relevant digital solutions among mediation actors by sharing experiences and best practices with stakeholders, and c) assess and develop CMI?s ability to prevent and mitigate
 the role digital technologies play in exacerbating armed conflict and jeopardizing peacemaking efforts.</narrative>
