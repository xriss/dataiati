 are an integral part of the program. The work is established on the rights needs and priorities of the youth. The program seeks to support social change in which young people with the help of duty-bearers are active members of society and participate in c
reating a sustainable and just world.Taksvarkki ry supports local youth organizations in the program countries e.g. in Guatemala Kenya Malawi Nepal Sierra Leone and Zambia. Partnering with the local organizations also the civil society is strengthened and 
spaces for civil society actors created. Every year over 2 000 vulnerable youth learn skills needed for active participation in their societies. The common objectives for all the partners are active involvement of the youth in the society and advocacy for 
the rights of the youth. The key actors of the program are girls out-of-school youth living on the streets and rural school students. The participation of the youth with disabilities will be a special focus of the program.The program supports the readiness
 of the Finnish youth to take action for the global goals. Global education and development communication provide information about development related issues and the need for equality and respect of human rights in the world. It awakens the youth to think
 about the stereotypes and the prejudices that exist about the developing countries and gives a possibility to take action through volunteer work. Every year approximately 26 500 Finnish youth participate in the program through workshops projects with the 
partner schools and through the Taksvarkki campaign.The program relates with the Agenda2030 universal development goals. Increased well-being and participation of the youth in the developing countries is an advantage for the Finnish citizens. Moreover Taks
varkki ry?s program encourages the Finnish youth to understand their role as global citizens.</narrative>
