   <narrative xml:lang="EN">F.a: Inclusive Dialogue for Regional Peacebuilding in the Lake Chad Basin</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Armed conflict and humanitarian emergency are impacting the four Lake Chad Basin (LCB) countries of Cameroon, Chad, Niger and Nigeria. The transnational dynamics of the conflict and its underlying root causes have highlighted the need for a regional respon
se that goes beyond a purely military or humanitarian approach, including inclusive dialogue that can address these challenges. Women have been central actors in the region, both for peace and conflict, as perpetrators and victims of violence. The interlin
ked root causes of the crisis also include, inter alia, resource scarcity resulting from poor resource management, climate change and a growing population, as well as extreme poverty caused by a lack of educational opportunities and little economic develop
ment. ##Addressing this type of regional crisis requires comprehensive, multi-sectoral, coordinated efforts, accompanied by inclusive dialogue initiatives beyond national borders. Apart from a fundamental need for policy coordination, there is much to be g
ained from sharing of different national and local experiences. However, until shortly such cross-border dialogue efforts have not been undertaken in a strategic and continuous manner, and channels or platforms of communication are lacking or weakly establ
ished.##CMI has been engaged in the LCB region since 2018. #The overall objective of CMI?s current work is to improve effectiveness and inclusiveness of regional peace and stabilisation efforts in the region by fostering inclusive regional and cross-border
 dialogue and cooperation to address conflict dynamics and their root causes. To reach this goal, CMI seeks to support the improved quality and effectiveness of peace and stabilization mechanisms and initiatives led by regional actors such as the Lake Chad
 Basin Commission and the African Union, enhanced ownership and engagement of state actors in regional and local peacebuilding and stabilization efforts in line with their mandate, and enhanced capacity and agency of key civil society actors, especially wo
men and youth, to engage at local and regional level and contribute meaningfully to peacebuilding and stabilization efforts.</narrative>
