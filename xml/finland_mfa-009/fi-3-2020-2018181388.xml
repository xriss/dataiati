   <narrative xml:lang="EN">1. Project: 11875 Institutionalization of Career Guidance and Counselling at Secondary Education level  #2. Project area and Country: 25 provinces in Cambodia#3. Project justification: #In Cambodia, many young people choose career paths based on advice and
 guidance from family or friends, and do not know where to access the necessary information to get prepared and set their career goals. Besides the students, also parents and education professionals have limited knowledge of different professions and lack 
easily-accessible information on different career options, their requirements, places to study or labour market information. The lack of education and career information and poor quality of education lead to a mismatch of skills of the graduates and the re
quiremenets of the labour market. The Ministry of Education, Youths and Sports (MoEYS) plans to expand the CGC services to the whole country. MoEYS has asked FCA and other development partners for technical support to improve teaching, teacher training, co
ordination, and thus ultimately to bridge the skills gaps and evolving labor market needs. #4. The main objective and the expected results:#The main objective of the project is to contribute to right to quality education and right to work of Cambodian adol
escents and youth in order to build an equitable and resilient society. The project will contribute to youth and adolescents having access to improved quality teaching and counselling services, and sufficient information to make decisions on their future c
areer choices and the transition to the next education level and/or work life. The project will expand Career guidance and counselling services availability and enhance its quality at secondary level including general and technical streams. It will provide
 technical support to the development of CGC teacher training, CGC curricula and manuals/materials at different education levels. The link between CGC and labor market will be improved by training Youth Centre staff on CGC to link education and work life. 
The project aims to ensure ownership, commitment and capacity of government of Cambodia on CGC implementation.#5. Right-holders/ beneficiaries: 8,000 beneficiaries (youth and parents)#Duty bearers: Ministry of Education, Youth and Sport, Ministry of Labour
, National Employment Agency#6. Implementing partner:  FCA Cambodia in close cooperation with Ministry of Education, Youth and Sport</narrative>
