  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The specialized Climate Risk and Early Warning Systems (CREWS) initiative saves lives assets and livelihoods through increased access to early weather warnings and risk information for people in Least Developed Countries (LDCs) and Small Island Developing 
States (SIDS) ? the world?s mostvulnerable countries. CREWS contributes to the goals of the Paris Agreement the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction and Agenda 2030.The risks associated with extreme weather events and the losses and damage they cau
se can be effectively reduced by anticipating preparing for and strengthening climate resilience. According to several socio-economic studies (including the Global Adaptation Commission) the economic benefits of investing in weather and climate services ar
e 4-20 times higher than the costs depending on the destination country.CREWS was established in 2015 as a financing mechanism leveraging the expertise and specialist networks of its Implementing Partners the WorldMeteorological Organization (WMO) the Worl
d Bank Group / Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery (GFDRR) and the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNDRR). As of December 2019 the CREWS Trust Fund has invested US$ 37 million in projects in 44 LDCs and SIDS ? and has mob
ilized an additional US$ 270 million from public funds of other development partners. More than 10 million people are benefiting from the new early warning systems launched in 2019 in Fiji Burkina Faso and Papua New Guinea.Australia France Germany Luxembou
rg Netherlands Switzerland and the United Kingdom contribute to the pooled CREWS Trust Fund and provideoversight to CREWS operations through the CREWS Steering Committee which is currently chaired by Luxembourg. Canada supports CREWSobjectives through WMO.
Funding for the program is in line with the Finnish government&apos;s goal of increasing climate funding and directing half of it to adaptation to climate change as well as targeting funding to Least Developed Countries (LDCs). The initiative complements Finlan
d&apos;s long-term cooperation in the field of hydrometeorology.</narrative>
