c. Currently, petrol lamps are being used and batteries are charged in the municipality centre 10 km away. Village people?s capacity to participate in and monitor the installation and take care of the maintenance will be strengthened. The selected electrif
ication council will prepare the technical agreement between the village and the responsible government authority and make the regulations for the use of the street lamps together with the municipality. Villagers will participate in the maintenance costs o
f the solar systems. Street lights will benefit all villagers (over 2000 people, of which 420 are school children), and via electrification of the women?s cooperative, all villagers will benefit from open charging points for mobile phones and other devices
 (up to 100 devices at time). The women?s cooperative has 367 benefiting members, but in addition, another 400 women from nearby villages use the cooperative space and equipment for the handling of gathered forest products. The project implementor is the M
alian NGO ?uvre Malienne pour le Developpement des Zones Arides (OMADEZA).</narrative>
