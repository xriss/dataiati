  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">1. Project: 11683 Preventing Violent Extremism Among the Youth in Uganda#2. Project area and Country: Eastern and Central Uganda#3. Project justification: #The eastern districts of the country and the urban centre of Kampala are characterized by the lack o
f educational and livelihood opportunities and growing extremism. Unemployment is higher than the national average (83%) and recently the government closed a number of madrasah schools, resulting in religious teaching moving further into the informal areas
 of the society and with no oversight by the formal educational institutions. Overall, there is a growing recognition of violent extremism as a highly complex and evolving phenomenon that takes various forms and is fuelled by context specific drivers. With
 an increasing radicalisation, the government is yet to develop a strategy to prevent violent extremism (PVE). All indicators point to a worsening situation in Uganda if the dual threat of youth discontentment and the spread of radical ideologies fail to b
e addressed. #4. The main objective and expected results:#The main objective of the project is to contribute to a peaceful Uganda by strengthening individual and community resilience to violent extremism. This will be accomplished through increased employm
ent opportunities for the targeted youth and enhancing their access to information and relevant conflict sensitive approaches. The project will provide them with training in vocational skills and in managing small businesses. The youth will be organised in
 groups and linked with government programmes for youth employment opportunities. Youth Peace Leadership Camps will also be organised. Additionally, communities will be mobilised around the prevention of violent extremism, through the promotion of particip
atory knowledge and learning to influence policies in CVE. #5. Right-holders/ beneficiaries: A total of 1000 youth in school and out of school#Duty bearers: Office of the Prime Minister (OPM), Kampala City Council Authority (KCCA), District Education Offic
ers (DEOs), District Community Services coordinators, Ministry of Internal Affairs, Ministry of Gender.#6. Implementing partner: Uganda Muslim Youth Development Forum</narrative>
