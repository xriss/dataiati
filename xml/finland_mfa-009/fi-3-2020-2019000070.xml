areas. One of the goals is to reduce the pressure on the forest by creating alternative livelihoods for the residents of target village Jiffarong which is located in the buffer zone. This will also improve food security and help the locals adapt to climate
 change. Planned activities will be carried out with the local partner organization Freedom From Hunger Campaign and Gambian NGO Beecause including beekeeping setting up a tree nursery and planting seedlings (reforestation) establishing a vegetable garden 
and setting up a revolving fund. The use of efficient cook stoves and planting fast-growing tree species saves the existing valuable trees. Educating local communities on environmental issues as well as climate smart agriculture agroforestry entrepreneursh
ip and extinguishing and preventing wildfires is one of the activities. Women farmers will be organized into kafo (womens group) and linked to the market federation to protect their rights. One of the main goals is to train local environmental officials NG
Os and community representatives to use the forest monitoring tool with the aim of providing an interactive map covering all forest areas of the Gambia to enhance forest protection. The aim is to enable the local actors to better participate in decision-ma
