   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project strengthens the strategic UNI sectors in Colombia: commerce, security and ICTS. The problems of these sectors are bad working conditions, weak union cooperation and very anti-union employer side. There are many multinational companies in these 
sectors that make union work very difficult, even with the threat of violence. The project trains union activists and leaders in collective bargaining and organizing so that they would be able to negotiate good collective agreements and have a solid member
ship base. Recruitment campaigns are implemented in target companies. Social dialogue in many of these companies is still developing and there is a lot that the unions can learn from each other. Cooperation between UNI affiliates is promoted so that they c
an jointly take action if and when needed. UNI invests significantly on organizer training in Colombia also directly. As a result of the project unions have solid action and presence in the key companies. In commerce the companies are for example Cencosud 
and Sodimac, in security they are for example G4S, Prosegur and Atlas, in ICTS Claromovil. The expected result is that the unions have a good membership base and dues payment and they succeed in collective bargaining. Global framework agreements between UN
I and the companies are used and promoted. Solidarity between unions increases especially in cases where threat from the employer side require a joint front. The long-term objective is that the UNI affiliates in Colombia have a joint agenda that they stron
gly promote together. Beneficiaries of the project are the workers in commerce, security and ICTS sectors in Colombia, especially in the target companies. The project is implemented through UNI and its Colombian affiliates in each sector. The cooperation b
ases on good project experiences in Colombia both in commerce and security. Now ICTS comes as a new sector and the project is done as one joint multi-sectoral initiative.</narrative>
