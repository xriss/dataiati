ental degradation. Due to lack of knowledge of efficient and sustainable agricultural practices and land-tenure rights the communities are practicing unsustainable agriculture and animal husbandry which aggravate soil erosion that causes regular landslides
 that destroy agricultural fields and threaten the lives of people and animals. To improve access to remote villages local government has started infrastructure development projects without proper social and environmental impact assessments.The objective o
f this project is to uplift the livelihoods and food security of the Chepang and Tamang communities through agro-forestry development and developed market access strenghten community-based natural resource management sustainable land use and climate change
