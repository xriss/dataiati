  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The ?Vutomi? project works directly with girls and boys, families and communities, civil society and duty bearers for the fulfilment of sexual and reproductive health and rights of young people aged from 10 to 19. It challenges gender inequality and social
 norms, including gender based violence. This includes ensuring accessible comprehensive sexual education to gain knowledge, exploring values and attitudes, and developing the skills the adolescents need to make conscious, healthy and respectful choices ab
out relationships and sexuality. Mozambique has the world?s 10th highest rate of child marriage, with 48% of girls married by the age of 18, and 14% by 15. Adolescent girls face the threat of gender based violence at schools and their communities, and both
 girls and boys often lack the skills and the knowledge to make conscious, healthy and respectful choices about relationships and sexuality. The project aims for the empowerment of adolescent girls to enjoy their sexual + reproductive health and rights, fr
ee from harmful practices in societies where gender equality is realised. The Project will enhance adolescent girls, including those vulnerable to exclusion, and boys, to increasingly adopt knowledge, attitudes and behaviours supporting informed decision m
aking and realising their SRH rights. Families and communities are also supported so that they adopt better knowledge, attitudes and behaviours that value girls equally, condemn child marriage and all violence against girls and enable better economic and s
ocial support for them. Plan supports also civil society to mobilise support for the realisation of girls? SRH rights through advocacy. Duty bearer capacity is improved for better policy implementation, and provision of quality services and interventions t
o realise girls? SRH rights. The main beneficiary group is adolescent girls and boys of the project area. Local communities, schools, health services and partner staff also benefit from the project. The implementing partner, Associacao Mahlahle, based in M
axixe, Inhambane in 1997, works holistically through developing close relations with government at district and provincial levels, and integration into the community, working closely with schools, health posts and key community members for promoting the ri
ghts of women and children, with an increasing focus on youth. Important government partners include the local representatives of Ministries of Health, Education, and Gender and Social Action.</narrative>
