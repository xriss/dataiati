   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In August 2007, the Millennium Challenge Corporation signed a five-year, $697.5 million compact with the Kingdom of Morocco to reduce poverty and stimulate economic growth through investments in five projects. These strategic investments will increase productivity and improve employment in high potential sectors such as fruit tree productivity, small-scale fisheries, and artisan crafts. Small business creation and economic growth will also be supported by investments in financial services and enterprise support. The compact in Morocco entered into force (EIF) in September 2008, formally initiating the five-year timeline for project implementation.</narrative>
