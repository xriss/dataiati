  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">One of the main concerns is the deteriorating livelihood situation for vulnerable families no longer able to prioritize their children&#x2019;s education to engage them in child labour and child marriage. Being out of school is associated with heightened risks of protection concerns (violence, abuse and exploitation) for girls and for children with disabilities.
Children with disability run a greater risk of dropping out. For children with disabilities as well, being out of school often means either having to stay at home with no interaction with their peers, and at risk of neglect and domestic violence, and no prospects to learn skills for their future livelihoods, or being exploited for begging, or married off early for fear of not finding a suitable partner. 
Out of school girls are more likely to be considered by parents for child marriage which has adverse impacts on the life and wellbeing of these girls. Girls married at such young age are more likely to have birth complications, give birth to premature babies, as well as be subject to domestic violence. Alternatively, they may get engaged in child labour, including worst forms of child labour which puts them at risk of further abuse and exploitations.
Children and young persons with disabilities, particularly intellectual, are at high risk of experiencing violence, both within the home and in the wider community. Family members reported that they are facing increasing stress and pressure without appropriate financial and social support, which may place these individuals at risk of abandonment and/or institutionalization. Some families are using physical and medical restraint to prevent their family members from leaving the shelter and/or harming themselves and others. Stigma and fear of exploitation may also contribute to families hiding their relative, adding to the isolation of the individual.  

The project targets 5,540 most vulnerable refugees and members of the host communities with Education engagement.</narrative>
