   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Based in Dushanbe, the Tajero Group of Companies (the Group) is composed of three related but separate companies:  Tajero LLC, Tajero-Sugd and Amal Industry.  It is the leading nationwide importer and distributor of food and beverages with exclusive contracts from 16 International Fast Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) companies.  Tajero distribution currently covers 70% of sales points in Tajikistan.

Tajero is exposed to volatility in global prices as a distributor of imported food, which makes up 80% of food in Tajikistan.   Increasing food prices coupled with currency depreciation have limited Tajeros ability to further expand the operation, particularly as access to affordable capital has diminished in Tajikistan. To sustain stable volumes and further grow the business, Tajero seeks more affordable sources of financing and has approached IFC to reduce refinancing risks.   

Tajero has approached IFC for a 3-year working capital line to refinance a current loan and reduce financing costs (the Project). This would be IFC&apos;s second investment with Tajero.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Through this Project, IFC will be supporting a local sponsor that has built a distribution business in a challenging environment.  The project will have strong development impact:  i) in the business community where Tajero will serve as an example of the benefits to be gained through improved transparency and corporate governance; ii) for consumers, as  the affordable financing that Tajero will obtain from IFC will help mitigate the price increases it is passing on to its customers, which are also as a result of global food price increases; and iii) for investors and exporters to the region, as IFC&apos;s involvement with Tajero adds comfort in identifying potential partners in Tajikistan,  a country with few foreign investors outside the resource sectors and microfinance.</narrative>
