   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Madagascar is the major producer and exporter of vanilla in the world. Although its vanilla is highly sought after over the world, the majority of the 80,000 small-scale farmers who produce the vanilla experience food insecurity. This is caused by the fact they do not earn sufficient income to adequately provide food for themselves and their families throughout the year. About 75% of the small farmers in Madagascar&#x2019;s SAVA region &#x2013; the main vanilla producing region &#x2013; live below US$1 a day.

Fairfood works on having solid methodologies in place for assessing a fair price. Furthermore we engage with multinational brands and flavour houses sourcing vanilla from Madagascar to increase their awareness on the issues farmers face, and to ensure that these small farmers receive a fair income. These companies can and should help farmers to break out of the cycle of poverty by ensuring that these smallholder farmers are paid a fair price for their vanilla. A fair price covers, amongst other things, a living wage for farmers, any other labour either from family members or hired labourers, plus all costs and risks involved in the production, and ensures a certain degree of stability over time.</narrative>
