   <narrative xml:lang="HA">Covering a total population of approximately 19 million in four states of Northern Nigeria, the Partnership for Reviving Routine Immunization in Northern Nigeria / Maternal Newborn and Child Health programme (PRRINN/MNCH) was an innovative programme, combining health systems strengthening with Routine Immunization (RI) and Maternal, Newborn and Child Health (MNCH) interventions. Working in states which have some of the world&#x2019;s worst indicators for maternal, newborn and child health, PRRINN-MNCH aimed to revitalize Primary Health Care (PHC) and improve the availability, quality and utilization of maternal, newborn and child health services, including ante-, peri- and post- natal care, emergency obstetric and newborn care (EmONC), essential care for newborns and infants, young child feeding and nutrition, and routine immunization against preventable diseases.</narrative>
