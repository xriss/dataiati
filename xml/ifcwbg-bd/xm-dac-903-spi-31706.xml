   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Project is expected to have the following specific development impacts: -     Financial Market Deepening: By providing local banks with much-needed FX liquidity and facilitating their access to the commercial loan market, the Facility will help deepen the financial sector by establishing a level playing field between local banks and foreign banks operating in the local market that have an advantage due to support of parent funding.    -	     Demonstration Effect: The demonstration effect of the IFC funding will encourage international banks to finance the local banking sector and increase the range and availability of funding options in the market.   -  	Economic Growth Acceleration: The Facility will help accelerate economic growth in Bangladesh by providing SMEs and exporters with trade finance solutions to finance their working capital needs and pay for critical value chain imports.   -	      Job Creation and Job Loss Prevention: By providing much needed working capital support to SMEs, the Facility will help create new jobs and also prevent job losses resulting from business interruption, particularly in an economy where the poor are mainly employed as daily wage workers.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Until recently, foreign exchange (FX) liquidity funding for banks in Bangladesh was provided only by Bangladeshs Central Bank  Bangladesh Bank (BB) - through the countrys robust reserves.  However, since the beginning of 2011, as part of the pre-conditionality for a US$1 billion program from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), BB has ceased to provide direct FX liquidity support to banks.  This development has resulted in an acute systemic FX, mainly US Dollar (US$), liquidity squeeze in the banking system.    The lack of FX liquidity has negatively impacted the timely issuance of L/Cs by banks, particularly for small and medium enterprise (SME) clients.  Since the bulk of the Bangladesh economy is value-added (imports, processed then re-exported), the ability to issue L/Cs on a timely basis is critical to the well-functioning of the economy.  Hence, to mitigate the adverse impact of the US$ shortage on the countrys trade flows and the SME sector, BB is now permitting select local banks with licensed offshore branches, to meet their short-term FX requirements from the international market.   The proposed project is a direct response to the prevailing FX liquidity crisis and is in line with the World Banks and IFCs strategy of promoting economic growth by providing access to finance to underserved market segments and promoting international trade. The Project consists of a short-term loan and a participation in IFCs Global Trade Finance Program (GTFP) to The City Bank Ltd.s (City Bank or the Bank) offshore unit to support foreign currency trade and working capital financing for the Banks SME clients.</narrative>
