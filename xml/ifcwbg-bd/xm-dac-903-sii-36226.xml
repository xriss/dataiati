   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Bangladesh RMG Sector Fire &amp; Safety Program</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">IFC proposes to establish a comprehensive sectorial program to strengthen safety infrastructure in the ready-made garment (RMG) sector in Bangladesh. Under the program, IFC would engage with selected local banks (Partner Banks) to provide financing to RMG enterprises to implement structural, electrical and fire safety (SEF) retrofitting/ civil works and renovations upgrades and essential for worker safety (the Program).  This is fundamental not only from an environmental and social perspective but also from a competitive angle as the RMG sector accounts for significant employment, export earnings and manufacturing in the country.   The SEF safety necessary upgrades are identified in the corrective action plans (CAPs) carried out by (i) the Alliance for Bangladesh Worker Safety (Alliance) (ii) the Bangladesh Accord on Fire and Building Safety (Accord) and similar credible institutions such as National Tripartite Plan of Action on Fire Safety and Structural Integrity in the garment Sector of Bangladesh (NTPA).</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Support for the backbone of Bangladesh Industry and economy: RMG sector represents 78% of exports (2nd largest exporter after China) and 15% of GDP (15 to 20% annual growth rate). Any disruptions to the RMG sector would stall progress on alleviating poverty. The proposed safety upgrades are a vital element in helping Bangladesh to maintain its global market position in the RMG sector.  Improve all workers (including women) working conditions: about 90% of RMG sectors workers are women from poor backgrounds and families at the base of the pyramid with limited or no financial safety net. Improved SEF standards will help save lives and protect the livelihood of families relying on the income from RMG sector employees.  Enhancing E&amp;S capacity: Utilizing IFC&apos;&apos;s in-house E&amp;S expertise to help create capacity in Partner Banks to monitor E&amp;S standards and compliance, which would contribute to improving the overall working environment of Bangladesh RMG sector.  Establishing a prototype to engage other donors and development agencies to support worker safety in Bangladesh. Job Creation: RMG sector has been the largest employer in Bangladesh, employing 3.7 million workers. By some estimates, it has the potential of generating 10.6 million additional jobs in the next 10 years.</narrative>
