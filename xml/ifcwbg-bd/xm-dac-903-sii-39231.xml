   <narrative xml:lang="EN">-	Employment creation and knowledge transfer: The Project will create approximately 450 permanent jobs (including ~20% female jobs), as well as approximately 1000 temporary jobs during construction. It will also promote knowledge transfer to local staff through training in all areas of hotel operations, management of the residential tower, and operations of the commercial building. 
-	Indirect job creation and local supply chain linkages: The Project will generate incremental business and indirect jobs for domestic Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) in the value chain, construction material supply and services during implementation and  transportation, F&amp;B suppliers and other service providers during operation. 
-	Increase in domestic revenues and foreign exchange: The Project is expected to contribute to the domestic economy through increased tax revenues and foreign exchange earnings from overseas travelers.
-	Competitiveness: The Project will increase the supply of business infrastructure, and given the high existing demand for it and lack of adequate similar property developments, has the potential to have demonstration effects in the sector and contribute to driving growth in the export sector and other economic activities in Bangladesh.</narrative>
