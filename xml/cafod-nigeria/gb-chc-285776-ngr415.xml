  </title>
  <description>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project is basically about promoting peace in West Africa. RECOWA intends to achieve this objective through the participation of the Catholic Bishops within the region in organizing, facilitating and moderating mediation, dialogue and reconciliation amongst conflicting parties in West Africa. The political instability has the capacity to affect the entire West Africa if it is allowed unchecked. ECOWAS region has experienced relative peace since 2000s after the end of Liberia and Sierra Leone wars. The region, apart from the Ivorian crisis (2001 &#x2013; 2011) has not experienced another civil war though there has been many cases of insurgencies in Nigeria, Burkina Faso, Niger and Mali through the rise of armed militia across the Sahel.
A Cursory glance at the political context of West Africa reveals cases of poor democratic transitions, non-respect for the rule of law, weak democratic  institutions, shrinking space for political participation or engagement, with human rights violations; the arrest of persons and the abuse of their rights, especially those in the opposition parties, civil society organisations. There are violations of treaties and laws which member &#x2013; countries had vowed to observe. Politicians are taking advantage of treaties of ethnic and religious divisions to achieve their personal desires. The huge cost of elections in the region due to bribery for voters and post-election arbitrations. Such negative acts must stop in the interest of all. As religious leaders, Bishops of RECOWA do not want to live behind a curtain of silence; for this reason, there is the need to meet the political leaders from time to time for joint reflections and action.</narrative>
