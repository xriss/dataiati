   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Action for Better Female Inclusion and Participation in the Electoral Process in Nigeria (ABIPIN)</narrative>
  </title>
  <description>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Nigerian population continues to increase as that of youth between the ages of 18-35 years being 52.2 million (i.e. about 28% of the total population). Despite the huge number, young people particularly women and girls in Nigeria are largely marginalized from governance, leaving them helpless to pawn their continued exclusion from political activities.
It is important for more actions that would increase the participation of women and girls in the electoral process to be taken, particularly trying to catch the interest of these young females early. This will also encourage the young women and girls to have trust in the electoral system and increase their participation. 
The Project Goal: Increase young female&#x2019;s participation in the electoral process, by 2023. (Ages 18 -35).
This will contribute to this goal by mobilizing youth through active engagement in the social media space and through religious organisation to play a more prominent role in the electoral process, targeting the 2023 elections. This will cover their Registration, voting, and standing to be voted for.  In the long run, women that have been voted for and other women would participate in the governance process (by holding their leaders accountable).
Short Term Goal: To mainstream young female awareness, and active participation in the 2023 election process in Nigeria.
Long Term goal: To develop a cohort of advocates championing accountability, gender inclusion and good governance in Nigeria
Increased women&#x2019;s participation in the electoral process will lead to increased participation and representation of women in the governance process. When young women with enhanced capacity participate in the registration, voting and governance process.
The funds will be channeled through Caritas Nigeria. However, the implementation will be done by CWSI. Caritas will transfer all the funds to CWSI. CAFOD will monitor and accompany CWSI throughout the project.  Kindly find link to the email;
