  <description>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Since the beginning of 2014, north eastern Nigeria has experienced an escalation of the Boko Haram (BH) led insurgency. This Islamic sect has engaged in repeated shootings, bombings and burning of property, including attacking schools and killing or kidnapping students. Over 1500 persons have been reported killed in BH attacks in the first four months of 2014. The conflict has led to displacements, loss of property, loss of means of livelihood, violations of human rights and a high level of fear and insecurity. Many families have fled the worst affected areas of Southern and Central Borno and Northern Adamawa to neighbouring communities, while some have crossed the state boundaries into neighbouring states and into the neighbouring countries of Niger, Cameroon and Chad. 
The crises in north eastern Nigeria is set against the background of a region already noted to have the poorest maternal and child health and nutrition indices in Nigeria. Two out of the three SoE states, Borno and Yobe, fall within the Sahelian zone, an area that is already prone to food insecurity. Household resilience has been eroded in the affected areas by protracted violence and disruptions to the predominantly agricultural livelihoods. Access to the rural parts of the north eastern states is also limited by the threat of violent attacks, thus restricting the delivery of humanitarian interventions. 
In north central Nigeria, endemic conflicts involving Fulani herdsmen and local farmers have escalated in many parts of north central Nigeria in the last six months, resulting in large numbers of internally displaced persons. There are currently 100,000 IDPs from Benue State alone as a result of the Fulani Herdsmen conflict. Other severely affected states include Plateau and Taraba States. 
The three states under the SoE are Bornu, Adamawa and Yobe States. Between January and May 2014, Gwoza, Konduga and Bama Local Government Areas (LGAs) in Borno State have been the worst hit by insurgents. Other areas that have been attacked are Maiduguri Municipal, Kaga, Dikwa, Gala and Damboa LGAs. In Adamawa State, Madagali and Michika LGA have been the worst hit, while in Yobe, attacks have been recorded in Buni Yadi LGA and around the state capital, Damaturu.
Clashes between Fulani herdsmen and local farmers, as well as inter-ethnic conflicts have been recorded in Benue, Plateau, and Taraba states. The Diocesan Caritas office of the Catholic diocese of Katsina Ala in Benue State has documented 10,347 persons  from 3,800  households, the majority of whom are taking refuge in schools and churches, while some are living with their relatives in nearby villages. The Caritas Office of the JDPC in the Catholic Diocese of Shendam in Plateau State, has registered a total of 7,378 persons from 1,095 households. The JDPC of the Catholic Diocese of Jalingo in May 2014 reported, based on figures provided by the Taraba State Emergency Management Agency, that 1,348 persons and 192 Households were displaced by the conflict in Gassol, Wukari, Ibi, and Bali. The clashes have destroyed farms and the Fulani herdsmen are still occupying some of the farmlands.  The farming season is underway  and the displaced are unable to recommence farming as many are still in the camps, while those that have returned home lost their seed stock in the violence. 

1. Based on the assessment findings as reported, cash transfers seem not to be the ideal strategy in this situation. Meanwhile  the IDPs are living in rural host communities with no banks; security is not guaranteed for them to travel to the towns, and banks in the towns are not even working well, while many have closed. It does not seem viable to implement cash transfers. 
2. Assessment report also revealed that there are big markets within the various locations of the project which  can meet both demand and supply that the project is meant to generate.
3. The various JDP/Caritas offices have warehouse facilities  that can store the large volume of grains that the project hope to distribute to the potential beneficiaries.
4. The local Caritas offices have a very strong network of volunteers that are trained and well motivated to carry out food distribution in an efficient and effective manner.
The key project activity is divided as follows;
Food Distribution
The project will distribute only food items to the most vulnerable households to enable them meet their food needs. An initial market assessment was done in northern Adamawa and Central Borno states in March 2014 which revealed that the minimum amount required to cover the food and non-food needs of a family of six persons would be as much as 25,000 Nigerian naira. However, the Project will distribute food items valued at 10,000 Nigerian Naira (approximately 65 US dollars or 50 Euros). 

The initial goal is to make three monthly distribution of food items per household, while working with government and other organizations on longer term recovery or resettlement options. 

The project will also utilize partnerships with the relevant government agencies such as NEMA, SEMA and the local government social service departments, as well as local civil society organizations and community based organizations who will offer experienced staff to contribute staff tome to the intervention. 
Implementation of actual project activities will take a period of four months, while follow up narrative and financial reporting and project closeout activities will take an additional two months. We are therefore envisaging a total period of four months for the intervention, from 1st November 2014 to 28th February, 2015.</narrative>
