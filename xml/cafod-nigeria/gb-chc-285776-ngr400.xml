  </title>
  <description>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The problem of low participation of communities and women in governance and poor service delivery in Plateau state has far reaching negative implications on the state, for growth and development in Plateau; available basic social services like water, electricity, schools and hospitals must be commensurate to population size especially in rural areas and in some urban communities, but unfortunately this is not the case.  The problem is compounded by lack of legislators not pushing for policy implementation at executive level. This situation has further deepened apathy for participation in election by citizens especially women.
Lack of accountability and transparency on the part of government especially with respect to the implementation of budgets, non-accessibility of budget document has made it very difficult to track down budget implementation which had led to poor budget performance over the years. 
The relationship between the citizens and their elected representatives and other government officials has been that of public mistrust, alienation and consequently political apathy. The gap between the rich and the poor has continued to widen. 
There is therefore a need for a total change to a system where the people are not only involved in the preparation of budget which reflects their basic needs and aspirations but also in the implementation of the budget as a means of promoting accountability and transparency. This can be achieved through a system where community people develop score cards for accessing the performance of members representing their constituencies, as well as act as monitors that will ensure that elected representatives at the state house of assembly perform their responsibility with a high sense of responsibility, accountability and transparency. These at the end will go a long way in improving the lives of the rural populace especially women, children and physically challenged who are the most vulnerable.</narrative>
