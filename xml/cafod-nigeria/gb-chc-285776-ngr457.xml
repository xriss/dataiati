  </title>
  <description>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Plateau State in central Nigeria &#x2013; is situated along the major religious Faultline in Nigeria. The geographical location is dividing the largely Muslim North from the predominantly Christian south and have witnessed an increasing trend of horrific internecine violence, killing over 10,000 people since 1992 alone (HRW, 2013). Inter-religious conflict has been tearing Nigeria apart in recent years fuelled by the conflict with Boko- Haram in the North of the country as well as the broadening conflict between pastoralists and farming communities all over the country.  This latter conflict has been exacerbated by population increases and climate change, with increasing struggles over depleting natural resources. All of these have been made worse by an increase in criminality in the form of armed robbery, cattle rustling, an increase in drug consumption and increasing distrust and communal alienation following devastating communal riots in 2001, when the two main religious communities sought sanctuary in their own largely segregated communities for safety.  
There has been an increase in the number of IDP informal camps developing as a result of ethnic and religious conflicts which claim hundreds of lives each year.  Both religious communities harbour huge pain as a result of the loss of lives and property in ongoing conflict over the last 18 years with religious leaders often contributing to harmful discourse and xenophobia. 
This action addresses these immediate threats through establishing strong peace architecture in Jos South Local Government Area. Furthermore, the action would actively promote interreligious and tolerance and rebuild relationships among communities in Jos, Plateau state. The objectives of the action would be achieved through the strengthening of community leadership structures, establishment of peace vanguards, strengthening of platforms for meaningful reconciliation dialogues and supporting alternative viable and sustainable livelihoods.</narrative>
