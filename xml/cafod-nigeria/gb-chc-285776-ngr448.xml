   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Nigeria Joint Response (NJR) is being delivered by a consortium of 5 Dutch Relief Alliance (DRA) member organizations and five national partners who work together to provide life-saving humanitarian assistance to the affected population in Borno state of the northeastern region of Nigeria.  
NJR partners are striving to provide integrated humanitarian assistance in FSL, WASH, Protection, Health and Nutrition sectors to affected population of Konduga, Mafa, Dikwa, Monguno and Gwoza LGAs in Borno state, with financial and technical assistance provided by DRA, an intermediary body between Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs and its partner organizations.
The DRA has four pillars on which it targets to enshrine in all its interventions, they are Innovation, Collaboration, Localization, and Accountability. This mentorship program comes under its localization component.
The Nigeria Joint Response (NJR) has requested CAFOD to support with providing Capacity Strengthening support to five NJR local partners.  The capacity strengthening support is a step towards the Localization Agenda which aims to have the local partners at the forefront of humanitarian response as the first responders in Nigeria.  
CAFOD in partnership with JDF will facilitate a self-assessment for the five NJR local partners (JDF inclusive). This will be for a duration of three days for each partner. The assessment will be done in the partners&#x2019; field offices in Maiduguri and is expected for staff involved in HR, Finance, Logistics, Program and the Leadership to fully participate. This capacity self-assessment will be the starting point of an organisational change process. I</narrative>
