   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project will respond to WASH, Cash, Health, Protection and Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) and NFIs. The response will reach beneficiaries experiencing health emergencies including Covid 19 and Yellow fever which are both WASH related emergencies to be addressed through an integrated risk communication and community engagements, local and mainstream approaches to WASH to maximize community participation and sustainability. Households and health facilities will be supported with Covid 19 WASH kits to strengthen infection prevention control (IPC) for Covid 19 to reduce community and facility transmission. WASH activities will mainstream yellow fever specifically with the provision of mosquito nets for households and facilities and also risk communication and community engagement activities including capacity building activities and Information Education and Communication (IEC) dissemination activities through local town criers for local reach and radio jingles for posters for wider reach. The project will train community volunteers who will track false information and myths at community levels and will urgently to address this false information using various channels such as door to door sensitisations, IEC materials and mass media engagements. 
Yet, there is high number of people dying from illness with symptoms like COVID.  False and inaccurate information among young people is quickly being driven by
- Low level of trust in authorities, particularly among IDPs due to lack of access to health services and information.
- Traditional and beliefs and practices, such as traditional healing solutions, which can lead to increased exposure.
- Fatalist attitudes closely linked to religious doctrines and practices.
- Generic messaging that does not address gender, age, and geographically specific contexts.
- Slow identification of misinformation, meaning that measures to combat it lose potency once it spreads within communities
Water treatment kits will be provided.</narrative>
