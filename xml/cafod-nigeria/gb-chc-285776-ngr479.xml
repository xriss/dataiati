   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Communities in Kaura Local Government Area of Kaduna State were attacked by an unidentified gun-wielding livestock militia on the night of March 24, 2022, according to a statement released by the Kaduna State Government. For unclear reasons, residents of the communities of Adan, Agban, Kagoro, Tsonje, Katanga, and Kadarko were attacked. The government of Kaduna State has enforced a 24-hour curfew. On March 25th, despite the curfew, enraged adolescents in Agban stopped a key highway heading to Jos and other regions, killing travelers of many nationalities, including women, girls, children, and elderly indigenous people.
At least 13 localities have been impacted by the attacks, with an estimated 40,000 people displaced. There have been 67 individuals dead and 2,677 dwellings destroyed. Farmlands have also been targeted, with armed men chopping down crops. Many people (including women, children, and the elderly) have fled to IDP camps in neighboring places such as Zonkwa and Kafanchan in search of safety. Food was the most important need for 61 percent of IDPs in these camps, according to a Red Cross fast assessment, followed by housing, NFI, psychosocial needs, and medical care. The surge of displaced persons has overwhelmed Zonkwa and Kafanchan, with the bulk of those displaced being women, children, and the elderly, while men and youths have remained, taking shelter in the woods and keeping guard at night. 
   This intervention is planned to serve as a lifesaving first step in stabilizing survivors during the initial period before they feel safe returning, as is typical of those in Nigeria&apos;s middle region. According to the assessment completed thus far by the Red Cross and local partners in the area, the requirements are fairly diverse due to the nature of the displaced households. The primary needs identified in the assessment findings were food, non-food items, and water and sanitation. The NFIs required include blankets, hand sanitizers, face masks, mattresses, toiletries, mosquito nets, and hygienic supplies such as sanitizers, to name a few. There is also a need for psychosocial/trauma counseling intervention, particularly because the targeted population is regarded as more traumatized and vulnerable in the context and reality of the attacks and their consequences.  The project will consist of supporting 2000 households (14,000 individuals) with multi-purpose cash transfers, NFI procurement and distribution, and psychosocial support.</narrative>
