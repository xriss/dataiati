   <narrative xml:lang="EN">West Africa has experienced lots of post-election crisis in the past decade which lead to loss of lives, properties and delayed development. The phenomenon has continued in many countries without concrete prevention measures by the government or regional bodies. Also, this trend has led to elections been bitterly contested and perpetrators of violence are equally not brought to Justice. Coupled with the above challenges, West Africa has been more peaceful that other regions in Africa because of nature and nurture. Violent conflicts in West Africa are occasioned by systemic variables conditioned by decades and centuries of interactions regarding external, regional and internal power relations (global and local governance); fault-lines in the architecture of the post-colonial African States; and the vulnerability of the continent to the vagaries of global processes and nature, such as the region&#x2019;s disadvantaged position in the world market and environmental degradation. The effects of post-election crisis have resulted in displacement of persons, instability of governance structures and generally under-development. 

Free and fair election is one of the cardinal pillars of democratic governance. Elections provide citizens with the opportunity of exercising their constitutionally imputed sovereignty over those responsible for the exercise of executive and legislative powers in the society. 

RECOWA through this project will work towards the establishment of a High-Level Conflict Prevention, Mediation, Resolution and Transformation Committee (HLCPMRT) to address the political crisis within the region before it escalates to major conflict. This project is geared towards identification and selection of competent technocrats and Faith leaders across West Africa Region. The proposed project will serve as the initial entry actions towards building a sustainable, effective, broad-based and erudite HLCPMRT.</narrative>
