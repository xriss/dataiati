   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Situation we are trying to change is gross under-representation of women in governance and decision-making in Kogi state of Nigeria. Without the active participation of women and the incorporation of women&#x2019;s perspective at all levels of decision making, the goals of equality, development and peace cannot be attained. Kogi women face huge challenges in entering into politics and occupying leadership positions as a result of gender restrictions. This project is aiming to empower Kogi women to further and better organize and develop their capacities, participate in political processes and claim their spaces to have more women in governance and decision making. The project will be projecting Kogi Women Empowerment Coalition (KWEC), the organization which has become the living testimony of the CAFOD-CCFN-CWSI gender intervention projects in Kogi state to perform the leveraging function of mobilising Kogi women towards achieving increased inclusion of women in politics and decision making in Kogi state. 
The second ambit of this project will carry out a data analysis the Catholic Diocese of Lokoja and Idah which will provide a ground to determine gender intervention towards equality, development and peace. 
The main thrust of the gender and good governance projects has been intervention to address exclusion of women from politics and decision making. This has remained a burning issue since women are still visibly absent in all levels of governance with only 8% representation in Kogi State governance where women are about 50% or more of the population of the state.. The result of the 2015 general election shows that not a single woman was elected into the legislature and the executive arm of government. Constant and exclusive over representation of men in political decision making is antithetical to democracy and good governance.
Women have the capacity to empower themselves to overcome the challenges posed by gender inequality constraints. In this project, KWEC is already positioned as a catalyst to the abysmal exclusion of women in Kogi State decision making. Against this background, the current project will consolidate on the gains of the previous gender projects in Kogi State by galvanization of KWEC to implementing actions such as advocacy, influencing and organizing women towards active participation in political processes.</narrative>
