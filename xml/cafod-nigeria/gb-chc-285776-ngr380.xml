  </title>
  <description>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project is a social accountability project that aims to promote citizens participation and inclusive governance in the decision making processes of Kogi State.  Since participation is a function of response, it is absolutely necessary for the Church to increase participation by providing platforms for citizens (right holders) to engage with public officers (duty bearers).  To galvanize Kogi State citizens, JDPC together with CCFN deemed it vital to support the citizens in demanding for improved service delivery, based on the social contract (State Budget) between the Government (duty bearers) and citizens (right holders). According to the 1999 Constitution of Federal Republic of Nigeria (as amended), &#x201C;The primary responsibility of the government is to provide security and basic welfare of the citizens&#x201D;. The constitution is the highest law in the land and has given sovereignty to the people. In order to exercise that sovereignty, JDPC intends to revive and mobilize citizens/ communities into making demands for improved service delivery in the Water and Sanitation Sector. 

This project links to previous CAFOD&apos;s supported governance work in Nigeria through the application of a different medium to expand citizens&apos; platform to rightfully make demands on duty bearers. In addition, the Church leaders within the targeted locations would serve as the voice of the poor to influence the duty bearers. The Church leaders will also call on prominent members of the Church whom are government officials to become more accountable and respond to the needs of the people.</narrative>
