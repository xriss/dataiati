  <description>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The protracted nature of the crisis in the North-east has made over 3 million IDPs food insecure in just 3 states of the northeast (BAY). If nothing is done to this population hunger and starvation is eminent. According to food security Sector dashboard of North-eastern Nigeria, May 2021 about 4.3 million people (in IPC 3-5) are in need. Out of which 3.5 million people are in need of food assistance. We also conducted a rapid need assessment on the proposed location for this project to identify the gaps and needs of the people (IDPs).Hunger, food insecurity and under-nutrition and malnutrition are the serious consequences of the humanitarian crisis in the North-eastern part of Nigeria, especially in Borno, Adamawa and Yobe (BAY) States. Humanitarian food assistance contributes to combating these negative effects and represents thus a priority for us as one of the partners of food security sector (FSS) in Borno state. To contribute to combating hunger, food security and nutrition, we will be supporting households with cash to meet their immediate food needs and livelihood option to boost their resilience. Where people are forced to leave their homes as internally displaced persons (IDPs) and losing their means of livelihoods, humanitarian assistance ensures their survival, dignity and security.  The assistance will help in minimizing negative coping strategies (such as selling of productive goods, keeping children out of school to beg for arms, sex for money) and contributing to restoration of livelihoods. Due to this Covid-19 pandemic, humanitarian bodies have greatly adjusted their programming. In this project, all covid-19 prevention protocols and guidelines will be put in place to ensure that project participants and staff are not infected or affected in any way.</narrative>
