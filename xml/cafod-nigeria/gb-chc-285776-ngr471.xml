   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This 4-month project will seek to improve food security and to reduce negative coping strategies in Biang community in Michika LGA, Adamawa State. The project will target 3,420 IDPs and Host community members (approx. 570 households, 6 people in each household).  Outcome 1, the project will disburse cash for food assistance in 2 tranches of N 4,500 each in the second and third month of the project. In total each beneficiary will receive N 9,000. Each tranche has been calculated as the 70% of the Minimum Expenditure Basket (MEB) for food emergency needs per capita/per month. Each household will be given a pre-paid card that will act as an e-Wallet. Tranches for each household will be calculated depending on the number of people in the household, this is N4,500 * N household members = transfer value. The Food Consumption Score (FCS) will be used to capture progress. 

Outcome 2: The project will also aim to improve livelihoods by diversifying income sources of displaced and host community members. To achieve this, the project will train 150 beneficiaries on Income Generating Activities (IGA) who will later be given start-up kits worth N 70,000 each. Baseline and initial project assessments will confirm the specific activities that are more profitable and procure start-up kits accordingly. Training provided by the project will cover petty trading, business management and financial education. Target beneficiaries are vulnerable HHs currently not receiving any food assistance or livelihoods support in this location</narrative>
