   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Firstly, it has been observed that laws and government policies play active role in determining the well-being of the society. An institution that is at the forefront of enacting laws and giving shape to the policies of government is the National Assembly. The composition of members of the national assembly is such that a sizeable number of them are Catholics. It has also been observed that majority of them are not conversant with the elements of the Catholic Social Teaching. This will be done by organizing them into a caucus for proper orientation, information sharing, collaboration and advocacy.

Secondly, the 2016 Federal Government of Nigeria appropriation is being implemented. In the past, when budgets are passed, ministries, department and agencies kick-start the implementation of the budget by awarding contracts running into billions of Naira which most times end up being abandoned or  the funds siphoned without the contracts being executed. It is in line with this and in the resolve to promote the practice of Social Accountability in Nigeria which involves the monitoring and tracking the execution of projects. 
This agency is called the River Basin Development Authority. Nigeria has 11 River Basin Development Authorities, RBDAs, created in 1976 by the Federal Government to harness the country&#x2019;s water resources and optimise Nigeria&#x2019;s agricultural resources for food self-sufficiency. The river basins authorities were also expected to bridge the gap between the rural and urban centers by taking development to the grass roots and discourage migration from the rural areas to the urban centers. These RBDAs have been turned into amorphous establishments with all manners of items and projects inserted into their budgets. This has resulted into poverty and its attendant consequences of increase in crime rate and anti-social behavior among the citizens.
To kick-start the monitoring and tracking of contract awards and budgetary releases in the RDBAs, the capital expenditure projects in two of the RBDAs, the Upper Niger River Basin Development Authority (UNRBDA) and the Lower Benue River Basin Development Authority (LRBDA) will be monitored as a pilot programme. This will be done by partnering with the Justice Development and Peace Commission (JDPC) of Abuja Archdiocese and the Diocese of Makurdi to mobilize existing communities structures like the Town Unions in 5 Local Government Areas to monitor the actual implementation of the budget for the 2016 fiscal year.</narrative>
