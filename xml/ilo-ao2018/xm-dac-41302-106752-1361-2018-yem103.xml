   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Countering the Recruitment and Use of Child Soldiers in Yemen</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project aims at preventing the recruitment of children and youth and to sustainably reintegrate children formally associated with the conflict in Hajjah, Sanaa and Lahj governorates in Yemen (Specific Objective). The socioeconomic integration of children associated with armed forces and armed groups (CAAFAG), vulnerable youth and marginalized groups will contribute to stabilization and security of the targeted areas (Overall Goal). As a first outcome, targeted children and youths will have better access to services and facilities for their social and economic integration. Existing resources around children will be strengthened: labour inspectors at Ministry of Social Affairs and Labour, local councils, members of Social Committees, members of the Higher Council for Childhood and Motherhood, staff of NGOs, and community leaders will be capacitated to educate, inform and change their attitudes and behaviors towards children&apos;s use in armed conflict. Four child-friendly spaces in central locations will be created, to mobilize communities around the protection and wellbeing of children while providing recreational, psychosocial and life-skill education support. Four youth clubs will be created to engage target children in recreational activities. Coordination and referral mechanisms will also be set up to provide specialized mental health care support to CAAFAG and to reduce their vulnerability. As a second outcome, former CAAFAG and other children at risk of recruitment above the minimum working age will be reintegrated through access to employable skills for improved working conditions and sustainable income. Three hundred CAAFAG and children at risk (CAR) will be assisted and oriented in matching their skills/aspirations to labour market needs, based on a labour market assessment in four selected communities in the three Governorates. Two-hundred CAAFAG and CAR will acquire vocational skills through ILO upgraded informal apprenticeship system, consisting on on-the-job training in firms and workshops and theoretical training. Where possible, beneficiaries will be linked to ILO&#x2019;s existing programme on improved informal apprenticeships. Three-hundred CAAFAG and CAR will be empowered with functional literacy and numeracy skills and will be equipped with essential life skills for personal and community development. For youth who demonstrate the potential for entrepreneurship, the project will provide business development services (BDS) with the view of empowering them to set up and run their own small businesses. For the special needs of adolescent girls at risk, the project will roll out a successfully developed and pilot tested &#x201C;Women Business Owners Training programme in the selected governorates.</narrative>
