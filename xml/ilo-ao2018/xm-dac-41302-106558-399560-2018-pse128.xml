   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Promoting Women&apos;s Equal Access to Economic Opportunities and Decent Work in Palestine</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Palestinian economy is one facing a variety of challenges through economic dependence on Israel and high dependency on foreign aid. The lack of economic growth combined with the Israeli closure policy and restrictions of movement, heavy reliance on the Israeli labour market and lack of viable alternatives have weakened the Palestinian labour market, with low participation of women in the labour force. Palestinian women&#x2019;s limited access to decent work opportunities is a manifestation of the discrimination they face in labour markets. Research has also shown that deficiencies in skills training of educated and uneducated women hinder their access to decent jobs; where there is a mismatch between the skills needed and labour market requirements. The low participation rate of women in the labour market is further exacerbated by the absence of effective law reinforcement mechanisms by the government particularly through inspection of workplace conditions, policies against violence and sexual harassments in the work place and having in place mechanisms for holding employers accountable towards ensuring safe and decent working conditions for women in all economic sectors. Empowering women in the economy and closing gender gaps at work are central to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (leaving no one behind) particularly goals 5 (Gender Equality) and 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth), CEDAW, and UNSCR 1325. Within this context, the overarching goal of this joint programme between UNWOMEN and ILO is to enhance women&#x2019;s economic empowerment in Palestine through promoting their equal access to decent work opportunities. The programme works towards enhancing the protection women&#x2019;s labour rights through reinforcement of equitable laws, legislations, policies and active labour market programmes, while engaging public, private and community actors. Outcome 1: Increased employment of women workers and access to decent and productive jobs - achieved through market-oriented skills trainings and it deals with strengthening the capacities of young women (employed and self-employed) in West Bank and Gaza Strip through equipping them with market oriented skills and confidence to enhance their livelihood potential and access to decent jobs. Outcome 2: Promoting an environment that enables women&#x2019;s labour market participation on the basis of equal opportunity and non-discrimination, focuses on supporting national efforts and effective policy dialogue amongst the governmental, private, and non-governmental bodies to mainstream gender in West Bank and Gaza Strip, including unions, to promote gender responsive policies related to the world of work.</narrative>
