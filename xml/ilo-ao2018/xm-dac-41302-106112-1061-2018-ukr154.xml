  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Ukraine is facing huge challenges in the area of occupational safety and health (OSH). In particular, the mining industry in Ukraine is among the most hazardous industrial sectors which require a special and priority attention. Safety and health risks in the mining industry are numerous and diverse. Many workers are working in an extreme environment. Urgent action is required to improve the current situation. Moreover, the continuing conflict in the East has seriously affected the mining sector of Ukraine. Several mines in Eastern Ukraine were closed while others are operating in non-Government controlled area. Despite these adverse effects, the mining industry remains major contributors to Ukraine&#x2019;s economy. There are still many workers and their families who rely on mining to support their lives. Following the earlier ILO-EU global OSH project in 2010-12, and the training by ILO-ISSA mining experts in 2013, the ILO proposes a technical assistance project to support Ukraine&#x2019;s national effort to improve the safety and health conditions in the mining work. The overall objective of the proposed project is to reduce work accidents and occupational diseases in the mining industry of Ukraine through a systematic development of modern OSH policies supported by an enhanced capacity of social partners. The project aims to achieve this objective by (i) assisting the development and implementation of modern OSH policies in accordance with the international labour standards and EU directives, (ii) strengthening the capacity of social partners to implement practical OSH management measures at the workplace level, and (iii) promoting a safety and preventative culture through effective knowledge-sharing on tools and good practice on OSH. The project will cover the mining industry throughout the country. The scope of the project in the Eastern part of Ukraine will remain within areas controlled by the government.</narrative>
