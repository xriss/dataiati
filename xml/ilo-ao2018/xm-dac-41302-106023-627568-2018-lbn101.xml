   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Creating Decent Work Opportunities for Syrian Refugees and Host Communities Through Infrastructure Improvement in Lebanon</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project aims at creating short- to mid-term employment opportunities for Lebanese host community members and Syrian refugees through infrastructure works. At the centre of the project are labour-intensive infrastructure rehabilitation and improvement measures such as rural road rehabilitation, water catchment cisterns and terracing. The project will be implemented in the most vulnerable municipalities of Bekaa, North and Mount Lebanon that host most of the deprived Lebanese and refugees. The infrastructure measures will be complemented by trainings, on employment intensive methods for contractors and capacity building for public institutions. Especially the Ministry of Labour will be supported in order to promote a system for speedy and transparent issuance of work permits to Syrian refugees in Lebanon, allowing them to legally and formally take up employment. The project has four module objectives. The first two objectives are 1) to improve access to decent employment of Lebanese Host Community Members and Syrian refugees and 2) to improve infrastructure and public assets for Lebanon. The proposed project will directly create mid- to long-term job opportunities for Lebanese (in particular skilled labour in the construction sector) as well as temporary work opportunities for Lebanese job-seekers (semi-skilled) and Syrian refugees. Objectives three and four concern the legal employment of Syrian Refugees and an institutionalization of employment intensive investment programs in Lebanon: 3) enhanced capacity of the Ministry of Labour to facilitate the implementation of employment intensive programs and issuance of work permits; 4) MoSA capacity strengthened as the lead Ministry of the Crisis Response and labour-intensive approaches institutionalised. Beneficiaries are Syrian refugees and Lebanese women and men in the most vulnerable areas of North Lebanon, Bekaa and Mount Lebanon. The project will focus on villages, municipalities and neighbourhoods that host a high ratio of displaced Syrians to Lebanese population. These communities are at high risk of tension and conflict due to the lack of services and the competition over job opportunities and other factors.</narrative>
