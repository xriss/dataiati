  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">As with most destination countries in the region, labour migration in Malaysia is managed through temporary programmes, and primarily for &quot;low-skilled&quot; work, sometimes characterized as &#x2018;3D&#x2019; -dirty, dangerous and degrading. There have been many abuses faced by migrant workers in Malaysia,1 committed by recruitment agencies and employers, ranging from excessive recruitment fees, to serious violations of the terms and conditions of employment, among others. These highlight the gaps between existing labour laws and policies and their implementation, and, likewise, differential treatment of nationals and migrant workers. The proposed project intends that, after 3 years, more migrant workers are empowered, and their rights are better protected in law and practice. Towards the achievement of this goal, the following outcomes/results are expected: Outcome 1. The capacity of trade unions, CSOs and migrants&#x2019; associations to deliver higher quality assistance to migrant workers is enhanced. Outcome 2. Migrant workers better understand their individual and collective labour rights, and how to safeguard their rights. Outcome 3. Enhanced coordination and dialogue amplifies the work of trade unions, CSOs and migrants&#x2019; associations in advancing migrant workers&#x2019; rights. Outcome 4. Increased public awareness of migrant workers&#x2019; rights, and more positive attitudes towards migrant workers. The project intends to reach out to a cross-section of the migrant worker population in Malaysia -women and men, of different nationalities, in different sectors, with regular and irregular status. However, noting the gravity and magnitude of violations faced by migrant workers in certain sectors, the proposed project will, through its partners, be mainly targeting men and women migrant workers in manufacturing, construction, palm oil plantations and domestic work. Geographically, the proposed project will focus on Peninsular Malaysia, particularly around the hubs of Penang in the north, Kuala Lumpur/Selangor in the center, and Johor in the south.</narrative>
