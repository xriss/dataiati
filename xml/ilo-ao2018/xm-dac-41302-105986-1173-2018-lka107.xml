   <narrative xml:lang="EN">ILO has been implementing the Local Empowerment through Economic Development (LEED) Project funded by the Department of Foreign affairs and Trade (DFAT) of the Government of Australia since 2011. The focus of the project has and continues to be on contributing to a more inclusive and equitable post conflict recovery and development. This is an ILO response to the need to reduce fragility in the post conflict setting in Sri Lanka by creating decent work opportunities and support inclusive growth and reconciliation. The project is considered to have been successful on a number of levels. At a national level it has built awareness of the north south development gap and created examples and avenues through which responsible investment partnerships can be created between the private sector and primary producer communities. As a result of project interventions the project has been able to support more than 100,000 families with various income generation and employments related opportunities and has been able to support more than 35,000 individuals gaining direct employment and self-employments activities. As a result of concerted efforts to include more Female Headed Households (FHHs), the project has been able to support more than 10,000 FHHs to access direct and improved income generating opportunities. The income generated while exporting of crops by the individuals who have been linked with various fruit and vegetable value chains have already exceeded 2 MN USD. Income from the fisheries for individuals also have exceeded 1.5 MN USD. Income from other interventions such as MSMEs and Other field crops also has recorded 0.5 MN USD. As a result of these interventions, the individuals who had no access to such income generating opportunities prior to the project, are now in a better position to invest in improving housing, give their children a better education, access to better health facilities and improved life styles. Building on these successes the project will continue to scale up on the current activities in the Fruit &amp; Vegetable and Fishery sectors and continue to contribute to a more inclusive and equitable post conflict recovery and development in the Fruit and Vegetable and Fishery Sectors. The project will also continue to strengthen the current partnerships and develop new partnerships through new business models that not only will create jobs and incomes but address the power relationships between rural vulnerable producers and large agricultural and fishery companies. On a national basis the project will continue their work in the fishery sector to support the implementation of the National Fishery Improvement Plan for blue swimming crab so as the interests and concerns of the fishing communities are protected and realized. The project will respond to the need to reduce fragility in the post conflict setting of Sri Lanka by creating decent work opportunities and supporting inclusive growth and reconciliation.</narrative>
