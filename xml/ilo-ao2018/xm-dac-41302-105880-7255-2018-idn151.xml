   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The International Labour Organization (ILO) is requesting $1 million over 24 months to implement a regional occupational safety and health project targeting young workers and employers in Indonesia, Myanmar, the Philippines and Viet Nam. The goal of the project is to reduce workplace injuries, fatalities, and occupational diseases through increased preventative safety actions by young workers and young employers. The project will develop and pilot test various tools, methodologies and strategies to raise workplace safety awareness and to generate public demand for improvements in national OSH systems. It will focus on young workers and young employers working in the construction and manufacturing supply chains. Networks of intermediaries will be activated and equipped with the tools and skills to promote OSH awareness and action. Increased public demand for workplace safety, together with greater public awareness of OSH rights and duties, will help to build a preventative safety culture. By the end of the project, young workers and young employers targeted by the project are expected to take action to reduce workplace injuries, fatalities and occupational diseases. They will be able to develop initiatives such as communication campaigns in various environments including vocational training institutions, develop their own training programmes on OSH at enterprise level, enhance fire and building safety measures at their workplace etc. The key components of the project are as follows: 1) Create tools and communication materials to educate young workers and young employers on OSH issues and pilote them in one or more sectors. 2) Collaborate with national and regional partners to develop and activate networks of intermediaries -- including young workers and young employers -- to effectively promote OSH awareness and action in their workplaces and communities. 3) Empower young workers and young employers through their representation at the XXI World Congress on Safety and Health at Work to promote public engagement on OSH issues and increase popular demand for safer and healthier workplaces.</narrative>
