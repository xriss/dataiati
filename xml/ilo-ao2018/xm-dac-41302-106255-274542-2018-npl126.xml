  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This is a technical and financial proposal for the ILO&#x2019;s Technical Assistance component of the Nepal country office of the United Kingdom&apos;s Department for International Development (DFID)&apos;s Skills for Employment Programme (SEP). SEP aims to provide Nepali workers with more productive domestic employment opportunities by filling skill gaps in both formal and informal sectors, with a focus on sectors that are instrumental for transformational economic growth in Nepal. SEP will also increase incomes for migrant workers (through reduced cost of migration and increased incomes in employment) and facilitate higher savings and more productive investment of remittances. The overall aim of the programme is to support domestic employment creation and reduce long-term dependency on migration, whilst recognising the importance of migration as a source of work for Nepali workers. Promoting employment-centric and inclusive growth through skill development, increasing formal sector employment, and maximising the development impact of labour migration are cornerstones of the ILO&apos;s Decent Work Country Programme for Nepal (2013-2017). Some achievements as part of this work include the formulation of the Labour Law, the Social Protection Act and the National Employment Policy, as well as technical support provided to the Government to conduct Labour Force Surveys. On migration, the ILO in Nepal is providing technical assistance to Government through labour migration projects, including the DFID-funded Work in Freedom (WiF) programme, and the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC)-funded Integrated Programme on Fair Recruitment (FAIR). The ILO is currently piloting an intervention to design and operationalize a system for skills and prior-learning recognition for Nepali returnee migrant workers employed in construction sectors in receiving countries. These areas of work are also a crucial aspect of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Goal 8 on decent work includes specific indicators on creating policies for job creation, formalisation, the promotion of safe employment for migrants and the eradication of forced labour, modern slavery and trafficking. The Technical Assistance component of SEP aims to achieve results in the above areas of work by supporting the Government of Nepal in creating partnerships with key stakeholders, increasing coordination, developing research and evidence, and implementing relevant policies, to create domestic jobs and enable a higher development impact from migration.</narrative>
