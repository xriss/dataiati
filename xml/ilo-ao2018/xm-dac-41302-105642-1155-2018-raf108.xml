  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">A Regional Integrated Child Labour Resource Centre (CLIC-Africa) established in November 2012, to support the development of national capacity (including on labour inspection and child labour monitoring), ownership and commitment on child labour issues. The CLIC-Africa, besides supporting the development of National Action Plans, aims to produce training and advocacy materials and disseminate to ILO constituents to support their efforts in implementing NAPs. As a regional knowledge hub, CLIC-Africa also aims at facilitating knowledge sharing on child labour and related issues, including national and regional good practices. In this regard, the CLIC-Africa will serve as an information clearing house on child labour issues. It also provides technical support for mobilizing resources. This &#x201C;virtual&#x201D; technical support facility is composed of a small core team based in the Regional Office for Africa, and specialists from ILO technical teams at regional and headquarters levels. In view of the above, the setting up of a system that is considers legal compliance, meanwhile improving wages and working conditions for better productivity and gains (versus a system only based on low labour cost and productivity) is both important and necessary in guiding the sourcing decisions of private companies. Complying with the International Labour Standards - such as conventions related to Occupational Safety and Health (OSH), Minimum wage, Child Labour and other fundamental principles and rights at work - is instrumental to protect workers (including working children and youth) in Africa and ensure fair and sustainable growth in Africa. To that effect, raising awareness on the core labour standards and highlighting issues such as occupational safety and health, the importance of labour inspections, and the importance of setting and enforcing the general minimum age to employment and the age for hazardous work as stipulated in ILO Convention 138 and 182, are really beneficial and will be supported to enhancing the fair competitiveness for the investors and also a conducive labour environment in Africa region and in the core country.</narrative>
