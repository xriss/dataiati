   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Support the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs in Kurdistan to develop an action plan for the implementation of the Employment Policy</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project is based on a direct request from the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs (MoLSA) in Kurdistan Region. It aims to develop an action plan to implement the employment policy in order to promote productive employment and an inclusive labour market for all citizens in Iraq- Kurdistan. The project will provide the framework for policy implementation which includes an action plan, the required capacity building for an enhanced tripartite support to the implementation of the policy. Further it will focus on two priority areas for implementation and put in place the needed capacity for improving the quality of the skills development system and the employment services structure. Implementing the employment policy will play a key role in promoting social cohesion and poverty reduction in Iraq by generating employment with a particular emphasis on youth and women. The Project also aims to assist the Kurdistan region to implement its developmental vision as foreseen in the Development Strategy as well as the Employment Policy. The project will provide specific assistance to Kurdistan-Iraq in the implementation of the Regional Employment Policy with an emphasis on increasing the employment opportunities for Iraqi youth. The project strategy is to work in three parallel tracks: &#x2022; Establishing employment policy implementation mechanisms: A tripartite body and focal points; &#x2022; Developing capacity for employment policy implementation and monitoring through capacity building activities and establishing a structure for monitoring and evaluation &#x2022; Supporting key initiatives in the EP which are a skills development strategy as well as reforming the employment services (practical outputs from the policy) These three parallel tracks include developing a detailed action plan and putting structures and systems in place for its implementation, ensuring that there is capacity by national and international experts to lead the process of developing the NEP Action Plan, for implementation and having a demonstration effect through practical outputs. A backbone of the project is the strengthening of social dialogue and the promotion of ILO international labour standards that are an integral part of the EP. One of the main outputs will be establishing a tripartite committee which will oversee the policy implementation, labour standards and labour and employment issues. The committee (High committee for employment) will be headed by the minister of Labour with representatives from line ministries at a level of deputy ministers in addition to the workers union president and employer&#x2019;s organisation&#x2019;s president. The capacities of the technical unit within MOLSA and the networking of the ministries through the focal points will be strengthened to ensure continues coordination among the national stake holders to oversee the integration of the action plan of the EP within the ministries, sectors and national plans</narrative>
