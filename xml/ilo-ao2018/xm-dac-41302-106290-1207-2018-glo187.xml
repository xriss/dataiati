   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Sida-ILO Partnership Programme has supported a portfolio of strategic interventions under Outcome 8 in Bangladesh, Bolivia and Guatemala to strengthen the protection of workers from indigenous communities, with a focus on indigenous women. Across continents, indigenous workers share common experiences of high exposure to unacceptable forms of work, which is linked to historic and persisting discrimination and marginalization of their communities on social, economic, cultural and political dimensions. Due to pressures on traditional livelihood activities and lack of income-generating activities in their communities, indigenous women and men increasingly migrate to urban areas. Indigenous women, who are experiencing discrimination and disadvantage on account of gender and indigenous identity, tend to find work in sectors that are informal, badly regulated or where labour law enforcement is weak. Indigenous workers&#x2019; lack of access to skills and training, exclusion from decision-making and policy debates and low level of collective organization, are among the underlying factors. Leveraging an integrated approach that addresses equality, freedom of association and the right to collective bargaining, occupational safety and health, wages and other basic working conditions, as well as taking into account the rights of indigenous peoples&#x2019; and respect for their cultures and identities, the Programme is aiming to advance indigenous women&#x2019;s voice and economic empowerment. Interventions are targeted to selected economic sectors with high prevalence of indigenous workers, such as domestic work, construction, tea plantations or work in the urban informal economy. Further, the Programme supports interventions in Ukraine to address discrimination and other working conditions deficits of persons living with HIV and AIDS and working in the transportation (railway, ports) and health sectors. Similarly, as in the case of indigenous workers, tackling discrimination is a key entry point for preventing and addressing exposure of workers living with HIV and AIDS to unacceptable forms of work. The final evaluation aims at assessing the relevance, coherence, efficiency, effectiveness and sustainability of the interventions carried out in the four countries and the results achieved, in addition to providing key recommendations on the way forward.</narrative>
