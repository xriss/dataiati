   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Enhancing occupational safety and health standards in the construction sector in Cambodia</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Occupational accidents and diseases have an impact not only on the lives of individual workers, but also on the productivity and profitability of businesses, the sustainability of social protection systems and ultimately on the welfare of the whole society. The project aims to address the need to improve occupational safety and health of workers and workplaces in Cambodia&#x2019;s construction sector and will focus on the construction of commercial and residential buildings. To improve occupational safety and health of workers and workplaces in these parts of the construction sector, the project will support Cambodia in strengthening its OSH laws and regulations as provided for in the activities and targets set out in its 2nd National OSH Master Plan 2016-2020. The project will also support initiatives that are intended to secure a higher level commitment by government agencies and social partners to collaborate and to create broader based awareness of safety and health measures in general as well as in the supply chain and chemical usage for construction of commercial and residential buildings. These initiatives will focus on building greater collaboration among relevant government agencies who are in a position to support improvement in the quality and delivery of OSH services and to increase their scope of coverage, including the Ministry of Labour and Vocational Training, Ministry of Land Management, Urban Planning and Construction (MoLMUP), the National Social Security Fund and other relevant agencies. ILO&#x2019;s key OSH standards such as Promotional Framework for OSH Convention (No 187, 2006), Safety and Health in Construction Convention (No. 167, 1988), Asbestos Convention (No.162, 2006), Guidelines on Occupational Safety and Health Management Systems (ILOOSH 2001), and the ILO Code of Practice Safety and health in construction will be fully applied as sound guidance to strengthen national concerted actions. This project will be implemented in the framework of the ILO&apos;s Global Action for Prevention on Occupational Safety and Health (OSH GAP) Flagship Programme. This programme seeks to foster the creation of a global culture of prevention, with the objective of achieving real reductions in the incidence of work-related death, injury and disease.</narrative>
