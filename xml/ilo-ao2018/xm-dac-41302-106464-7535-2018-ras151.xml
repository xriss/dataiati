   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Women migrant workers are subject to multiple and intersecting forms of discrimination that limit their access to safe migration, fair recruitment and decent work throughout the migration cycle, as well as their ability to have a positive migration experience. Women have fewer options than men for regular migration, and are often employed in lower paid informal sectors with few if any labour protections. In particular, women migrant workers are over-represented in domestic and care work, an occupation which is not covered by many labour laws in the region. Women migrant workers are also found in large numbers in other sectors including construction, agriculture, manufacturing and food processing, the service industry and entertainment. Given the current situation, and in recognition that migration will continue to increase, there is the need for a project that addresses both the need for stronger gender-responsive migration governance in order to increase better and regular migration opportunities for women into protected labour sectors; and the need for improved information and services for women throughout the migration cycle to prevent VAW and trafficking and responsive services to those who experience it. This project will promote gender-responsive labour migration laws, policies, practices and services, and support the organization and representation of women migrant workers. It will address the legal, policy and institutional gaps and barriers faced by women migrant workers, as well as enhance their access to fair and safe migration by addressing exploitation, forced labour and trafficking. To prevent VAW, communities will be mobilized, and service providers will be supported to provide coordinated services. The overall objective of this project is: Safe and fair labour migration for all women in the ASEAN region. Specific objective 1: Women migrant workers are better protected by gender-sensitive labour migration governance frameworks; Specific objective 2: Women migrant workers are less vulnerable to violence and trafficking and benefit from coordinated responsive quality services; and Specific objective 3: Data, knowledge and attitudes on the rights and contributions of women migrant workers are improved</narrative>
