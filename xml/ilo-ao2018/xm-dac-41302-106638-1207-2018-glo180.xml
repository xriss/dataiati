   <narrative xml:lang="EN">More and better jobs for inclusive growth and improved youth employment prospects: Delivering global products for Outcome 1 under the SIDA-ILO Partnership programme</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This new ILO/Sida Global Product will support the overall Outcome 1 strategy and will build on the work of previous biennia. In this area, support is focused on youth employment, employment diagnostics and Skills for Trade and Economic Diversification. For this first phase of the partnership, the strategy is premised on the need for a comprehensive approach, including sound labour market analysis, coordinated demand and supply side measures, tripartite consultations and social dialogue, with emphasis on clear mechanisms for policy implementation, monitoring and evaluation &#x2013; coupled with targeted actions to address the youth employment crisis through a balanced approach of activation policies and protection of the rights of young women and men, as well as generating income perspectives for those that have fewer opportunities in the labour market. Tackling the needs of the working poor is an intrinsic part of the overall effort to address global poverty as reflected in the 2030 Agenda. The new partnership would focus more on enabling the global capacity of constituents (and the Organization) to achieve improved youth employment prospects and more and better jobs for inclusive growth for all. In this Phase, ILO will develop notably diagnostic and policy analysis tools and contribute to finalize national employment policy implementation guidelines. The intervention will also enhance the global and national capacity for rolling out and sustaining the Skills for Trade and Economic Diversification methodology as a way to anticipate skills demand in sectors with high potential for jobs growth. The interventions will be planned and implemented in an integrated and mutually reinforcing way across the policy cycle and in selected countries. The STED work supported by SIDA in last three years demonstrated the importance of focusing on delivering systemic change through capacity development, collaboration and knowledge sharing with STED partners, and mainstreaming activities. This work will contribute to further conceptual development and new knowledge generation in the ILO&#x2019;s approach to trade and skills; the global coordination and technical backstopping function will further develop the capacity of ILO staff and partners to undertake this work at country level, focusing on supporting the implementation of recommendations from STED analytic work, particularly through scalable measures that will benefit productivity of firms, improve export performance, target youth, women and support poverty reduction. Focus of interventions: - Strengthening employment policy diagnostic and implementation - Targeted policies and programmes on youth employment, with focus on vulnerable youth - Sectoral focus for skills anticipation through the strengthening of the STED programme</narrative>
