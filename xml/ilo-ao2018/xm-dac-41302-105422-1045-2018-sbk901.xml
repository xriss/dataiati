  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Australia provided A$9.4 million to support TRIANGLE I, implemented by the International Labour Organization (ILO) from 2010-2015. As a result of the relevance and strong performance of TRIANGLE I (as evidenced in DFAT annual reporting and an independent mid-term evaluation), DFAT received endorsement in January 2015 to begin a partner-led design with the ILO for a long-term project that builds on the lessons learned during implementation of TRIANGLE I. The ILO provides specialist technical advice at the request of ASEAN Member States and social partners as well as the ASEAN Secretariat to shape their individual labour migration policies and the broader agenda in ASEAN. TRIANGLE II will shift the practice in the region on the protection and governance of labour migration to reframe it in terms of its potential, for development, for growth and for economic and human security &#x2013; ultimately increasing the number of migrant workers that have an overall positive migration experience. There is considerable convergence between the priorities of the ASEAN Member States and Australia in the outcomes of the project, including shared goals of increasing stable, inclusive economic growth and development. The proposed project will be implemented over ten years. A ten-year period is likely to achieve best results and value for money given the ability for long term planning and addressing systemic challenges. The proposed project would invest across six countries (Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam, Myanmar, Malaysia and Lao PDR) and engage with all ASEAN Member States with the overall goal of maximizing the contribution of labour migration to equitable, inclusive and stable growth in ASEAN (see Theory of Change in Annex A). By the end of the proposed project period in 2025 migrant workers will be better protected by national and regional governance frameworks. The potential of women and men migrant workers to contribute to economic and social development will be harnessed through improved policies and programmes. The efficiency of labour markets in ASEAN will be increased through improved systems that govern and facilitate labour mobility across the region. The project will lead to increased use of regular migration channels by women and men; and greater returns for migrant workers by way of economic and social remittances, especially women. This Project Design Document (PDD) outlines the rationale for the TRIANGLE II project at the outcome and output level across the six target countries. During a twelve-month inception phase, detailed activities will be determined, and the Theory of Change (Annex A) and the Monitoring and Evaluation (M&amp;E) framework (Annex B) will be further developed in consultation with project partners. Gender, Communications and Sustainability Strategies will be developed during the inception phase to guide DFAT, the ILO and national and regional implementing partners in identifying activities of highest priority in project countries to achieve maximum impact. Activities and approaches will also be shaped by the final independent evaluation of TRIANGLE I (to be finalized by 30 September 2015), as well as a decision by the Canadian Government on future funding of TRIANGLE I&#x2019;s sister project, the ASEAN TRIANGLE project, scheduled to end in March 2016. The PDD is the result of findings from the design missions (see Annex S, Key findings of the design mission), analysis of lessons learned by the ILO and key partners and a review of the regional political, economic, development and migration context. The design team spent four weeks in March and April 2015 consulting over 300 stakeholders in Cambodia, Lao PDR, Malaysia, Myanmar, Thailand, and Vietnam and at the Sub-Regional Advisory Committee (SURAC) workshop. Consultations were held with additional national, regional and international stakeholders by teleconference. A list of members of the design team, and the individuals and organisations consulted is in Annex T.</narrative>
