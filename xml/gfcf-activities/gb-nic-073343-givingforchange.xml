   <narrative xml:lang="EN">To influence and partner with international development actors to appreciate, support and promote the development of community
philanthropy as a central pillar of broader efforts to shift power and resources closer to the ground, to strengthen local ownership of development processes and to amplify the ability of citizens and communities to be heard and to claim rights and entitlements.

Specific objectives include: 
- Build on, engage and collaborate with other sector-based initiatives aimed at addressing long-term systemic reform of the international development system.
- Grow the visibility, voice and influencing power of southern civil society actors and leaders in the #ShiftThePower movement so that they can participate more fully and have greater voice in conversations and processes aimed at reforming aid.
- Promote and foster new ways of working that leverage actors and assets on both emergent (community philanthropy, #ShiftThePower) and mainstream (funders and INGOs) sides of the system.</narrative>

- Funding from Save the Children Denmark / NEAR Network to test nationally/locally rooted mechanisms which can release funding to local actors efficiently, transparently and flexibly in West Africa and Somalia. 
- Consultancy with Open Society Foundations Human Rights Initiative around the intersections between local human rights funders and local resource mobilization.
- Funding from European Union to support GFCF small grants programme looking at community philanthropy&apos;s response to COVID-19 (primarily focusing on Africa).
- #ShiftThePower Treehouse launched, with support from Humanity United.
