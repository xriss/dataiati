   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Retail finance needs to be structured in line with the needs of the rural poor and not hidden behind assumptions and excuses for high transaction costs driving high interest rates and weekly repayments. Few banks have seized the opportunity to restructure delivery channels or adapt products. Bank Asia is amongst those few, piloting agent banking, which is taking true retail finance deep into rural Bangladesh. However access to retail finance alone is not the answer to thriving rural , ,. : -.. ... economies and MSE&apos;s. . !dqd$qe,. Business finance is one key catalyst but equally so is the transformation of farming itself which makes micro-holder farming commercially viable and helps to develop inclusive and collaborative value chains. lt fundamentally recognises that investment in farmers and farming communities is central to the sustainability of those value chains themselves. ln isolation, financing cannot help enterprises rise out of the cycle of debt. This is where VSO and Syngenta together have co-created the Growing Together project which Bank Asia has joined as a new partner. The cross-sector partnership strengthens communities to learn, grow and selltogether.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project addresses the window 2 challenge by establishing a smart agent banking channel for rural Micro and Small Enterprises (MSEs),using technology coupled with a robust business support system that builds capacity of the participating enterprises to ensure their maximum economic success. One of the fundamental challenges for small holder farmers in Bangladesh is access to business finance. For too long the development sector has assumed that access to micro-finance benefits farmers. Often NGO led micro-finance offers more choice and reduced interest rates against the appalling interest rates charged through money lenders in the black market, a source of debt financing farmers have historically resorted to in the absence of retail opportunity and asset collateral. Traditional micro finance does not however move farmers and micro entrepreneurs away from cycles of short term debt and into cycles of long-term investment. lt doesn&apos;t sustainably change their finances to manage cropping seasons.</narrative>
