  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Shelter City Costa Rica is an integral protection project for Human Rights Defenders in Central America. It&apos;s a temporary relocation Programme for Human Right&apos;s Defenders (HRDs) at risk, who are invited at the Integral Protection Center, located in Costa Rica, for for approximately 3 months (in some cases up to 6 months maximum). HRDs participating of this program will have &quot;stay plan&quot; in which they will strengthen their protection&#xAD; related skills, and have the possibility to exchange experiences, develop research, implement internships, or courses during their stay, as well as social or community exchanges available through alliances and agreements with different public institutions and NGO&apos;s. At the same time, work will be carried out from the beginning on a return plan to their home country, which will include a security plan, following up once it has been finalized. If it is evaluated that the return is not a safe option, Shelter City will provide advice in the search and specification of other relocation programs.</narrative>
