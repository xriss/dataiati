   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Seeing Is Believing SCALE - Strengthening Capacity and Learning to Effectively Deliver Quality Eye Care</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">India has the largest population of people who are blind in the world - an estimated 12 million people. 80% of these people could have their sight restored with cataract surgery or glasses. If the number of cataract surgeries performed each year were to double, cataract-related blindness could be eliminated. Through SCALE, we will increase the number of cataract surgeries performed and strengthen participating hospitals&apos; ability to provide quality eye care services. 


The Seeing Is Believing programme was established by Standard Chartered in collaboration with leading eye care agencies with the object of contributing to sight restorations and eye health care worldwide. Seva Foundation partners worldwide to create self-sustaining, locally-based programs that preserve and restore eyesight. Seva has globally scaled sustainable eye care services to reach people in more than 20 countries, resulting in nearly 4 million individuals receiving sight-restoring eye surgeries. Seva Foundation has actively worked to end needless blindness in India since 1978.
