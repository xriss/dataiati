   <narrative xml:lang="EN">&lt;b&gt;Problem and context description&lt;/b&gt;
	  &lt;p&gt;In Indonesia, millions of people living in and around crucial ecosystems depend on natural resources as a basis for their livelihoods. As people depend on forest resources for a living, rights and access affect their income stream. In this respect, many indigenous and local communities, and women, are particularly vulnerable. While natural resources like timber, forest products, fish and sea products and other resources are abundant, tenure local elite capture, overexploitation of resources and degradation, and unfair distribution of benefits and power have plagued natural resource management. The conditions of poor management of natural assets have in turn caused enduring poverty and erosion of the resource bases through the pursuit of short term economic benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
	  &lt;br&gt;
	  &lt;p&gt;It is important to go beyond general poverty data to identify the key dimensions of poverty that affect the areas of the project. Basic education and health services are available in rural areas of Sumatera, HoB and Papua but overall quality is poor, teachers are often absent for long periods of time and teaching resources are also limited. Food security at local level is not a major problem as long as the communities have access to forest and other important ecosystems where they find resources upon which their livelihoods depend on. However access to market and market links are still weak for some of the key products that would create and keep good economic value in the communities. Nowadays with the opening up of vast areas of Sumatera, HoB and Papua to investment, concessions, and food estates tenure insecurity threatens the welfare and livelihoods of many communities.&lt;/p&gt;
	  &lt;/br&gt;
	  &lt;br&gt;
	  &lt;p&gt;In the Heart of Borneo there is still inadequate recognition of native customary rights in practice, and limited level of consultation with communities on governance models that more effectively and consistently involve local people in the management of natural resources. Organisations and local constituencies are emerging, but they are still fragile political constellations that need to be supported and strengthened to increase the level of full accountability in the sustainable natural resource management.&lt;/p&gt;
	  &lt;/br&gt;
	  &lt;br&gt;
	  &lt;p&gt;Sumatera is located within a Ring of Fire where an active volcanic activity with enormous potential of geothermal energy lies beneath. Due to the expansion of timber and palm concessions in the last three decades, Sumatera has lost most of its forest cover, which threatens the sustainability of the environmental foundation of well-being and sustainable development for the island. Communities and other local stakeholders in and around geothermal development areas are for the most part directly affected by the management of these areas. However, they are currently not effectively nor fully informed about energy plans  and not receiving full benefits from natural resources.  Civil society has been mostly reactive to cases, not working as a movement but individual organisation hence the collective voice has been weak. In many areas, the number of civil society organisations is limited.&lt;/p&gt;
	  &lt;/br&gt;
	  &lt;br&gt;
	  &lt;p&gt;Papuan culture is rich and represented by numerous ethnic communities intimately connected to nature. However, large tracts of forest are being licensed as concessions and may soon be converted to plantation.  Seas are overfished.  Immigration, both planned and unplanned, risks to disenfranchise indigenous Papuans on their own lands and seas.  The number of civil society organisations and their capacity is limited.&lt;/p&gt;
	  &lt;/br&gt;
	  &lt;br&gt;
	  &lt;b&gt;Programme goals&lt;/b&gt;
	  &lt;p&gt;The desired outcome of the programme is that civil society including communities in programme areas are effectively exercising their rights, controlling decisions and receiving fair benefits from the equitable management of natural resources, and contributing to sustainable development.&lt;/p&gt;
	  &lt;/br&gt;
	  &lt;br&gt;
	  &lt;b&gt;Programme activities&lt;/b&gt;
	  &lt;p&gt;Programme activities will be aimed at:&lt;/p&gt;
	  &lt;ul&gt;
	  &lt;li&gt;&lt;u&gt;Capacity to drive change&lt;/u&gt;: Programme will be focusing on building CBOs and CSOs capacity to drive change towards responsible and inclusive NRM. Capacity will be built through the development of appropriate tools and modules for utilization of sustainable renewable energy and facilitation of a series of training for CBOs/CSOs on governance, communication, conflict resolution, and the implementation of Free, Prior, Inform, Consent (FPIC) as the main principle of this intervention. Capacity of CBOs and CSOs will also be built in regard to more technical skills (agroforestry, fair trade, ecotourism, community mapping, renewable energy, etc).&lt;/li&gt;
	  &lt;li&gt;&lt;u&gt;Equitable benefits to rights-holders&lt;/u&gt;: Creation of benefits and fair distribution will be achieved by strengthening livelihood schemes and linked to clear village development plans, and by designing and implementing community programmes related to sustainable and renewable energy (SRE) utilization for livelihood improvement.&lt;/li&gt;
	  &lt;li&gt;&lt;u&gt;Laws and policies&lt;/u&gt;: Building stronger coalitions at local (district, province) and national levels to more effectively drive reform and advocacy for recognition of indigenous peoples role and rights in conservation, good environmental governance, and energy legislation.&lt;/li&gt;
	  &lt;li&gt;&lt;u&gt;Political spaces and conditions for participation&lt;/u&gt;: The facilitation of public consultations by CSOs on SRE, land use plans and tenure security, and multi-stakeholder dialogues to monitor achievements on key SDGs.&lt;/li&gt;
	  &lt;li&gt;&lt;u&gt;The role of cultural traditions and NR practices&lt;/u&gt;: Mapping and appropriate recognition of Indigenous territories and areas (ICCAs) and traditional management and zoning systems, and the promotion of traditional crop varieties will be a priority in HoB.&lt;/li&gt;
	  &lt;li&gt;&lt;u&gt;Social norms and habits&lt;/u&gt;: The ESD team will focus on the Youth Programme and &#x2018;nature schools,&#x2019; especially in Papua. Innovative learning exchanges that go beyond the school complex to engage directly the youth as agents of change will be implemented.&lt;/li&gt;
	  &lt;li&gt;&lt;u&gt;Champions promote best sustainable practices&lt;/u&gt;: The work with the youth in the schools and at village level will be strengthened by a specific strategy to identify champions and grow future leaders through thematic and motivational trainings on topics like SDGs, climate change, sustainable development, renewable energy, human rights and the environment.&lt;/li&gt;
	  &lt;/ul&gt;
