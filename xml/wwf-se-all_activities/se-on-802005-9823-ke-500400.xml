   <narrative xml:lang="EN">&lt;b&gt;Problem and context description&lt;/b&gt;
	  &lt;p&gt;Kenya is extremely rich in biodiversity, which is a key driver of national development supporting critical sectors such as agriculture and tourism, accounting for 30 % and 10 % of GDP respectively.  However, these natural resources are under threat from anthropogenic pressures including (but not limited to) habitat conversion and fragmentation, deforestation, resource over-extraction and, more recently, climate change. Additionally, high dependence on biomass: charcoal and fuel wood, as the main source of energy for rural households is exerting a lot of pressure on dwindling forestry resources. The ramifications of this resource degradation goes beyond threatening vulnerable habitats and biodiversity to impacting on livelihoods and long-term food security, thus exacerbating poverty in rural areas where about 80% of the population depends directly on natural resources for their livelihoods. Other socio-economic consequences of this continued degradation include resource competition, social disenfranchisement and conflicts. The current drought epitomizes the impacts of climate change as manifested by widespread livestock and wildlife deaths, resource-use conflicts and severe food insecurity in most parts of the country including Mara and Naivasha Basins.&lt;/p&gt;
	  &lt;br&gt;
	  &lt;p&gt;The Kenyan constitution sector legislations provide for community participation in Natural Resource Management (NRM), but there are still glaring challenges around resource access and benefits sharing. The main challenges facing lead resource management agencies in effective NRM are attributable to weak institutional arrangements and capacities. Lack of political goodwill, poor governance and unsustainable exploitation of natural resources are manifestations of misplaced priorities for a country like Kenya which is largely dependent on natural resources for social economic development. Kenyans&#x2019; desired benefits from natural resources cannot be realised without active participation of the right holders.&lt;/p&gt;
	  &lt;/br&gt;
	  &lt;br&gt;
	  &lt;p&gt;There are several kinds of CSOs at the national and county levels (NGOs, INGOs, FBOs, CBOs) spread across different NRM sectors. CSOs have varyingly influenced governance on NRM in Kenya, such as participating in formulation of policies, sensitizing the public on rights and holding the government accountable. However the spirit and letter of legal provisions on civil society involvement in NRM are yet to be achieved, a scenario attributable to limited CSOs technical, governance and coordination capacities and push back by duty bearers in complying with these legal provisions. CSOs therefore continue to experience various challenges including lack of sustained sources of funding, political interference and weak governance ostensibly making them ineffective as the voice of the people and a public watchdog.&lt;/p&gt;
	  &lt;/br&gt;
	  &lt;br&gt;
	  &lt;p&gt;Despite some good progress over the years, the linkages between public institutions and civil society groups on the ground are relatively weak. There is need to empower CSOs and CBOs to ensure accountability of public institutions; access to information about government programmes and entitlements; advocacy to influence government policy and facilitating private sector investments to promote economic growth. As it stands now, there is still a long way to go to fully achieve the aforementioned changes. Communities still do not have a strong enough voice for the duty bearers to take their ideas and decisions into consideration.&lt;/p&gt;
	  &lt;/br&gt;
	  &lt;br&gt;
	  &lt;b&gt;Programme goals&lt;/b&gt;
	  &lt;p&gt;The desired change of this program is that people in the African Rift Lakes region (Mara and Naivasha landscape) in Kenya are effectively participating in decision making participating in  and receiving full benefits from natural resources and exercising their responsibility for ensuring that key ecosystems and habitats are sustainably managed.&lt;/p&gt;
	  &lt;/br&gt;
	  &lt;br&gt;
	  &lt;b&gt;Programme activities&lt;/b&gt;
	  &lt;p&gt;The programme will partner with diverse but strategically selected CSOs with common interests and shared NRM goals, to develop their institutional/governance and technical capacities. At inception, a 5-year programme with annual work plans and budgets with key CSO partners will be developed. This will secure long-term commitment, build CSOs capacity and ensure that the funding is strategically directed towards delivery of agreed objectives right from the onset. The programme will also include activities aimed at:&lt;/p&gt;
	  &lt;ul&gt;
	  &lt;li&gt;Empowering the communities and civil society groups to understand their constitutional rights, and to remain vigilant and hold the government accountable. This will be done by for example training in advocacy and lobbying, as well as understanding existing policies and laws and the role of the communities in these.&lt;/li&gt;
	  &lt;li&gt;Developing a participatory dialogue platform through policy dialogues between right holders and duty bearers.&lt;/li&gt;
	  &lt;li&gt;Empowering the people for a common and stronger voice by strengthening natural resource management stakeholder platforms both at County and National levels.&lt;/li&gt;
	  &lt;li&gt;Supporting and sharing knowledge on best natural resource use practices to enhance resiliency and improve livelihoods through equitable access and benefits accrued from the natural resources. This will entail influencing of policy development to provide mechanism for benefits sharing and strengthened market linkages to support small holder farmers, and livestock owners.&lt;/li&gt;
	  &lt;/ul&gt;
	  &lt;/br&gt;</narrative>
