   <description>
    <narrative xml:lang="EN">The official name of the Kingdom of Swaziland was changed to the Kingdom of Eswatini, or Eswatini, in April 2018. Although Eswatini takes pride in its status as a stable monarchy, the country is beset by a range of development challenges, including minimal economic growth, the prevalence of HIV/AIDS, weak government institutions, human trafficking, porous borders and transnational terrorist threats, corruption, limited media freedom, labor disputes, and high levels of gender-based violence. A lack of fiscal transparency, increasing expenditures allocated to the royal family, and questionable capital projects have increased the call for reform by donors and domestic groups. U.S. foreign assistance to Eswatini focuses on addressing the key health threat of HIV/AIDS and support for the professionalization of the Eswatini security forces through the promotion of democratic values, including respect for human rights.</narrative>
