   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Strategic planning at the PCC takes place every five years, and is based on the project cycle management as a methodology. The PCC has recently completed its new five-year strategy plan for 2016 &amp;ndash; 2020. The PCC&amp;rsquo;s planning process was based mainly on the findings and recommendations of an external evaluation of the PCC&amp;rsquo;s last strategy plan for 2010 &amp;ndash; 2014, the full participation of the main stakeholders in the field of mental health, the PCC&amp;rsquo;s governing bodies, staff and volunteers and most importantly the PCC&amp;rsquo;s main target beneficiaries. Additionally and due to the deteriorating political situation in the occupied West Bank and its devastating implications on the mental health of large numbers of Palestinians, the PCC has decided to intervene in the current emergency by formulating and emergency response contingency plan that is expected to require about 20 % of the PCC&amp;rsquo;s resources.
The PCC works on four inter-related strategies through the following mechanisms: direct intervention, prevention, capacity building, and advocacy. Each of these are reflected in four primary strategic objectives, complemented by an additional strategic objective that pertains to internal organisational development. Together, these objectives seek to respond to the problem of mental health struggles in the occupied Palestinian territories through a holistic approach that addresses needs on both individual and communal levels. Namely, the strategic plan reflects the PCC&amp;rsquo;sefforts to provide individualised psychological care to those in need; to deter those most vulnerable from developing psychological problems; to strengthen the skills and develop the resources of Palestinian civil society organisations and national agencies working in the field of mental health; and to advocate for the end of the Israeli occupation, identifying its perpetuation as the primary cause of psychological and community suffering within the oPt.
The PCC&amp;rsquo;s strategic objectives are as follows:1.&amp;nbsp;To improve the performance of individuals psychologically/emotionally, occupationally, productively, socially, and educationally and help them adapt to different social systems (family, academic institutions, work, and community/society).2.&amp;nbsp;To reduce the danger of developing psycho-social problems among individuals and groups in marginalized areas.3.&amp;nbsp;To develop capacities and upgrade performance of individuals and institutions working in mental health in the West Bank including Jerusalem.4.&amp;nbsp;To improve policies, procedures, systems and practices related to the mental health of individuals and the Palestinian society at large5.&amp;nbsp;To develop the capacities of the center in order to abide by good governance principles.
These strategic objectives are then each supported by specific objectives that correlate to the PCC&amp;rsquo;s activities for implementation, of which more detail is provided in section 6 of this proposal.</narrative>
