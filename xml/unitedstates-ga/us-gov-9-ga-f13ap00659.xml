   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The purpose of this project is to conserve Gabon&#x2019;s wildlife heritage by transforming the Gabon National Parks Agency (ANPN) into a premier African parks agency within five years, with adaptive capacity thereafter. Through this Agreement, ANPN, FWS, and government and non-governmental organization (NGO) partners aim to safeguard Gabon&#x2019;s large forest elephant population; ensure a future for humankind&#x2019;s closest relatives, the great apes of the Congo Basin; maintain the ecological resilience of tropical rain forests and forest biodiversity; and preserve the ocean giants and protect ecologically important marine ecosystems. To help conserve Gabon&#x2019;s rich heritage, results-oriented, field-based objectives and activities have been developed to enhance capacity for adaptive park and peripheral zone management; create and secure parks and reserves; and set and enforce standards to reduce the impacts of extractive industries. The project will: &#x2022; Enhance ANPN&#x2019;s ability to establish itself as a premier African parks agency by achieving sufficient organizational capacity so that management systems meet international best practice standards, including ISO certification, by 2019; implementing key components from National Park management plans; garnering support by communities for ANPN conservation activities at local and national scales; and developing a sustainable tourism sector that contributes to the national economy and promotes long-term political support for conservation at local and national scales. &#x2022; Help to support a protected area system dedicated to wildlife security and ecosystem health and diversity by establishing new protected areas where the existing conservation landscape does not provide sufficient protection coverage for Gabon&#x2019;s natural heritage; securing protected areas from poaching, encroachment, and other forms of illegal activity; and providing leadership for the development of inter-ministerial and regional wildlife security, natural resource management and capacity building initiatives. &#x2022; Reduce pressure on parks, buffer and peripheral zones from extractive industries (including forestry, mining, hydrocarbon exploration and production, and commercial fishing) through defining and enforcing best practice guidelines for extractive industry operations in proximity to protected areas developed by the Environmental Evaluation and Compliance Division (EECD) of ANPN. As part of this government-to-government agreement, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) will provide guidance, technical expertise, and financial support to ANPN. Specific activities for USFWS include: &#x2022; Provide hands-on participation in strategic planning for the implementation of this agreement &#x2022; Participate in regular communications &#x2022; Identify potential contacts and provide background on similar programs &#x2022; Provide technical assistance and oversight to the program &#x2022; Make joint decisions on program&#x2019;s management, support, leadership and future growth &#x2022; Publicize the program &#x2022; Leverage potential collaboration and partnerships. USFWS will also support the participation of specific USFWS technical experts to provide direct support to ANPN on: &#x2022; Integrated data management systems, including Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and databases for law enforcement monitoring, and monitoring and evaluation. &#x2022; Environmental impact assessment, including the development of policy and best practice guidelines for extractive industries (e.g., mining, offshore hydrocarbon development, forestry). &#x2022; Delimitation of protected area boundaries, including marine protected areas. &#x2022; Integrated management in watersheds, in zones peripheral to protected areas, and in multi-use landscapes. &#x2022; Law enforcement. &#x2022; Infrastructure development in protected areas, including trail and road system planning and development. &#x2022; Communications.. &apos;The purpose of this project is to conserve Gabon&#x2019;s wildlife heritage by transforming the Gabon National Parks Agency (ANPN) into a premier African parks agency within five years, with adaptive capacity thereafter.

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">Gabon is an active contributor to conflict resolution and regional security efforts in the Central African region, hosting, and acting as a driving force behind the Economic Community of Central African States, which is establishing a regional standby peacekeeping brigade under the auspices of the African Union&apos;s Africa Standby Force. U.S. security assistance to Gabon is aimed at professionalizing the small armed forces (fewer than 8,000 armed service members) by providing training, which will create a force able to operate effectively in regional peacekeeping and maritime security efforts. Gabon has roughly 500 troops participating in U.N peacekeeping efforts in the Central African Republic.</narrative>
