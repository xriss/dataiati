    <narrative xml:lang="EN">Gabon is an active contributor to conflict resolution and regional security efforts in the Central African region, hosting, and acting as a driving force behind the Economic Community of Central African States, which is establishing a regional standby peacekeeping brigade under the auspices of the African Union&apos;s Africa Standby Force. U.S. security assistance to Gabon is aimed at professionalizing the small armed forces (fewer than 8,000 armed service members) by providing training, which will create a force able to operate effectively in regional peacekeeping and maritime security efforts. Gabon has roughly 500 troops participating in U.N peacekeeping efforts in the Central African Republic.</narrative>
