The project intends to address the impacts of poaching and illegal activities in the park by acting as a deterrent and detection system for park authorities, providing baseline information, and generating revenue. Specific activities include: (1) continued habituation of one group of western lowland gorillas for tourism and monitoring of the impact of tourism; (2) assessment of behavior change, ranging patterns, diet, and stress levels on gorillas to monitor impacts of habituation and initiation of tourism; (3) use of non-invasive techniques to systematically sample population-wide genetic census; (4) use of camera traps to record presence of gorillas, chimpanzees and other large mammals in the study area; (5) collection of data on diet, habitat utilization and social behavior to enhance understanding of the behavioral ecology and population dynamics of western gorillas; (6) regular surveillance and routine data collected to serve as an effective deterrent to poaching; (7) training of Gabonese field assistants, gorilla trackers, and national park staff to develop national capacity for science-based conservation and adaptive management. &apos;.

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">Gabon is an active contributor to conflict resolution and regional security efforts in the Central African region, hosting, and acting as a driving force behind the Economic Community of Central African States, which is establishing a regional standby peacekeeping brigade under the auspices of the African Union&apos;s Africa Standby Force. U.S. security assistance to Gabon is aimed at professionalizing the small armed forces (fewer than 8,000 armed service members) by providing training, which will create a force able to operate effectively in regional peacekeeping and maritime security efforts. Gabon has roughly 500 troops participating in U.N peacekeeping efforts in the Central African Republic.</narrative>
