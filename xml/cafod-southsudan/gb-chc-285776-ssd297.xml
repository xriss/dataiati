  <description>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Passionist Community located in Coventry made available &#xA3;50,000 towards the Food Crisis in South Sudan. In accordance with the St. Joseph&#x2019;s Province Mission Statement, the aim of a Passionist grants is:
1.         To reach out to the poor and excluded, and to those living  on the margins of society
2.         To reflect the commitment to &#x201C;welcoming the stranger&#x201D;
3.         To promote protection of the environment.
4.         To be in solidarity with the work of the Passionist Congregation globally in tackling poverty and exclusion, promoting social justice and climate justice. 

This project will be implemented by CTP partner HARD. It will complement other ongoing work funded through the Trocaire Church Appeal where HARD are working with 800 HH smallholder farmers who are Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) and host community Households (HHs) to be supported with farm inputs (seeds and hand tools) in the coming agriculture season (2022). 

On the Trocaire church Appeal project, 250 elderly and people with disability including pregnant and lactating mothers will be supported through social Protection program (SPP) with unconditional cash transfer to enable them have access to food and other basic needs. Sixty (60) of the selected farmers will be provided with assorted vegetable seeds and will be trained to engage in vegetable production in the areas to diversify their dietary intake and income generation. About 60 female headed households will be provided with small ruminant for rearing and sale during the hunger gap for income generation. It is envisioned that through this project about 400 IDPs HH will also be provided with a dignified NFI Kits and 30 HH will benefit from the fishing equipment (hooks and twines).

Funding from the Passionists will specifically be used to support 500 vulnerabale households to access food and other basic needs through distribution of cash grants, provision of plastic sheeting to 400 households to provide shelter, and incentives for 15 hygiene promoters.

The project will be implemented in Tonj North.</narrative>
