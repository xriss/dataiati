   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Phase VI Multi-Sector Response for IDPs and Vulnerable Host Communities in Yirol East, Lakes State</narrative>
  </title>
  <description>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The ongoing conflict has given rise to many challenges in South Sudan, not least food insecurity and displacement. Women and girls are affected in particular, with protection issues and sexual and gender-based violence faced by many women, who are disproportionately affected by conflict. This is true in Yirol East, the proposed project location of this intervention. A multi-pronged approach is required to address the challenges. Women, men, girls and boys require lifesaving interventions to meet their food, protection, water, sanitation and hygiene needs and to build resilience to reduce future vulnerability. CTP, in line with our commitment to localisation, with its local partners who are respected by local people, authorities, and those on all sides of the conflict, are well placed to intervene and respond to the immediate needs of such communities. Host and IDP households will be targeted based on needs and identified by local committees made up of host and IDP women who are best placed to identify those in need. Households selected will be verified through public validation meetings and community agreement. Based on assessments, households will be provided with food and non-food items, trained in agriculture and empowered to increase economic capacity, communities will be equipped with psychosocial support skills and empowered with access to safe water sources. Those implementing the project will be trained on key principles such as Core Humanitarian Standards on quality and accountability, and a do no harm approach. Women and girls will be empowered to engage in decision making and the project will work with communities to improve their protective environment. The programme will work within the principles of humanity, impartiality, independence and neutrality in order to save lives, alleviate suffering and protect human dignity in South Sudan. This SCIAF funding will contribute towards the provision of vegetable and standard seeds for farming households and provision of emergency food rations which is an extension to the Phase V response to the still critical food security situation in Yirol East. Primary focus will be given to pre-existing groups, such as the Women&#x2019;s Groups, as they are already part of community structures and are most active &#x2013; working through such groups allows cooperation and the sharing of resources, and is a move towards greater community resilience. CTP will implement this project through Caritas Diocese of Rumbek.</narrative>
