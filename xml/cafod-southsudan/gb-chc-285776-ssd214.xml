  </title>
  <description>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project employs a multi-phased, human-centred design approach that centres front-line GBV and MandE practitioners as end-users of MandE systems and reduces access and capability barriers by creating easy to use data collection and decision-making tools for frontline and local humanitarian agencies to assess their progress on implementing the MS (Minimum Standards).
First, we will work with agencies represented on the MS Task Team and local partners to develop a simple and easy-to-use MandE Framework for the Minimum Standards. At present, 4-6 indicators signal whether each MS has been achieved and is of adequate quality. The GBV AoR recognizes the need for a framework that goes beyond these few indicators and provides a cohesive framework that includes both output and outcome-level indicators related to each MS.
Second, we will pursue sense-making exercises with identified end users (local and national actors) to understand which aspects of the MandE Framework are useful, further adapt others, and identify opportunities to design new tools or adapt existing tools to accompany the framework. This will capture existing innovations at local levels and test which are scalable. We will prototype possible solutions that meet MS measurement needs while also addressing the barriers identified. We will utilize an iterative approach of user-focused design, testing, and revision to ensure that the developed prototypes are relevant and accessible for a variety of front line GBV and MandE practitioners. End-users from two humanitarian contexts will participate in design workshops and test prototypes of these new/adapted tools to iteratively identify which of the resulting tools are fit for purpose and under what conditions.  
At the end of this process, a package consisting of a simple and useable MandE Framework and field-tested tools/guidelines  (for select indicators) will be made available to the international community on both digital platform (through open-source data collection modalities) and paper (for low-connectivity settings) formats. The data collected through this system can be linked to indicator dashboards that will help staff interpret key data and make informed, evidence-based decisions. The hope is that this system could be used by humanitarian actors at various capacities (from small local NGOs with limited technical capacity to large international organizations) and would allow for humanitarian actors to add further complexity to their analysis and visualization as their capabilities and contexts change.  
This framework would serve as a complement to the MSs and be a reference point for GBV measurement in emergencies.</narrative>
