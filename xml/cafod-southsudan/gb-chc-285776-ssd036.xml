  <description>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In December 2013, a power struggle within the ruling political party mutated into an armed conflict, first on the streets of the capital Juba, then spreading across the country. During the first six weeks of the crisis, Central Equatoria, Jonglei, Unity and Upper Nile states saw heavy fighting between Government and opposition forces.  According to UN OCHA, by March 27th, approximately 803,000 persons have been internally displaced and 254,600 have been made refugees1. The majority of these IDPs are seeking shelter, protection and assistance in UN bases and in churches where no UN bases exist.
 
CAFOD&#x2019;s local church partners, including the Sacred Heart Sisters and DONBOSCO in Juba as well as Sacred Heart Sisters Malakal and Caritas Malakal in Upper Nile and a number of members of the regional Caritas Confederation; such as Caritas Yei, Juba, CDO in Maban etc. have been receiving traumatized IDPs in their churches since the very beginning of the crisis, offering shelter and any basic assistance they could with the available resources. When listening to the horror stories of what happened in the town of Malakal, it would be unthinkable to imagine someone who went through the ordeal going back there.   Apostolic Administrator of the Diocese Msgr. Roko Taban Mousa said that generally the Diocese is operating from Juba where they have a small liaison office (located in CAFOD) compound, from where they coordinate some activities of the diocese in collaboration with some catechists who are in the villages with the people.
 
A needs assessment was conducted by CAFOD during February 2014 in the target area in Upper Nile State and an urgent need for Food, Non-Food Items (NFI), Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) and medical supplies was identified. As a result, the proposed project is intended to support 1,500 Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) with multi-sector humanitarian assistance in the Malakal and Melut Counties of Upper Niles state of South Sudan. All 1,500 targeted IDPs are currently camped in different locations in Melut and Malakal, having fled recurrent armed conflict. The target beneficiaries will be provided with Food, NFI, WASH and Health assistance.</narrative>
