  <description>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">More than two decades of civil war did not only cost the life of millions of South Sudanese but it has contributed to the unequal distribution of resources between the urban and rural areas, inadequate community building and exclusion of local communities, especially women from the decision-making process. The long history of violence, injustice, exclusions, bad governance, ignorance of people&apos;s rights and conflict remains visible contributing a great deal to the poverty in the country. As a result of the long war, many people and communities still suffer from trauma but are not provided a platform to heal. Many communities continue to use violence as a way to resolve conflicts. Furthermore, due to lack of marketable skills and high unemployment, the idled youth risk engaging in alcohol and drug abuse which ultimately resorts to violence.

Local farmers, IDPs and traditional authorities plays a key role in the well-being and stability of their communities, yet they have limited understanding of trauma, human rights and often lack the skills to resolve community conflicts fairly.

The project sites (Juba, Yirol East and Yei River) counties have encumbered with conflicts that relate to access and control over land and natural resources, land grabbing, conflict between farmers and nomads, border issues between tribes, gender based violence, deforestation, negative cultural practices such as forced marriages, amongst others. These issues are hindering the smooth implementation of sustainable livelihoods and humanitarian programmes and this is the main objective of this project to get amicable solution to the challenges facing the livelihoods and humanitarian sectors. 

The challenges will be addressed by doing a study that will focus on gaining a better understanding the partners&apos; working environment and issues facing them. IDO will be working closely with the partners to better understand the issues/challenges facing them and work towards resolving the issues at hand.</narrative>
