  <description>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Long misunderstanding between two clans of Aguok and Apuk of Gogrial started since 2004 before South Sudan&apos;s referendum and independence mainly over border disputes, grazing land and water points for their animals. Despite several efforts to bring both communities into peaceful coexistence through dialogues and reconciliations, tension continued and yet worsened in the recent years claiming dozens of lives and displacing several people. An estimated 13,000 households have been displaced since the violence started with majority of the IDPs being women and children. Many people have been seen to have left without basic survival needs like food and shelter. CTP recent needs assessment conducted in July 2017 in Gogrial indicated food being the most immediate need and of course the need to bring both communities to peaceful coexistence. Since 2012, CAFOD&#x2019;s sister agency in Ireland, Tr&#xF3;caire  has been supporting The Society of Daughters of Mary Immaculate (DMI) implementing peacebuilding programme in Gogrial and this continued after the two sister agencies merged operations in April 2015. DMI has got rich experience in the field of social work and in carrying out women empowerment and peace building programme work since it commenced its ministry at south Sudan in 2012. Since its inception in south Sudan, DMI has facilitated many programmes in the areas of education, women empowerment as well as peacebuilding. Over the years in the selected intervention areas, DMI has mobilised women folk and formed Self Help Groups at each village and initiated village level federations. DMI had series of meetings and discussion with village leaders, women leaders and village chief which has helped to understand in depth needs of the people and continued to bring the conflicting communities into peaceful coexistence. This project will therefore address the most immediate humanitarian needs of the crisis-affected population and will complement the ongoing peacebuilding work in Gogrial.</narrative>
