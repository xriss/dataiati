   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The current scale and coverage of the humanitarian response in Upper Nile remains inadequate to meet humanitarian needs with 47.8 percent of its total population in emergency humanitarian catastrophe.  Insecurity, with inter-communal violence has caused displacements, death and suffering of people with adverse impacts on women, children, elderly persons and people with disabilities. The insecurity also interrupted livelihood activities particularly agriculture production, fishing and domestic livestock productions.  Upper Nile State was much affected by the conflict which displaced 147, 450 individuals from Malakal town in 2014. The people have been camping at POCs located at the outskirt of Malakal town and some were displaced to various locations and even to foreign Counties. People in the POCs have completely been depending on relief foods from the WFP. FAO and other organizations have been implementing FSL, protection and peace building interventions in Malakal and its nearby Counties/Payams. However, the gap has been widened by the influx of returnees who were displaced by the conflict.  They are currently reoccupying Malakal town and its surrounding villages after having lost all their livelihoods. The IDPs in POCs sites receive insufficient relief food which does not at all cover their diverse dietary needs and no sustainable food security impacts benefited from it. 
Living conditions of IDPs, returnees and host community populations are exposed to risks, deepened by the inaccessibility or lack of farm inputs, poor agronomic and post-harvest handling practices and in agricultural extension services, inadequate protection services and mistrust among communities in Malakal County. In addition, there remain significant protection concerns in Malakal due to inter-communal conflict inflicting fears to return to abandoned residents in Malakal town. Proximity of military cantonments and existence of landmines in most parts of the town are also protection concerns. Protection risks including intercommunal violence, recruitment, psychosocial distress, and exploitation are factored in this intervention. Community awareness and sensitization in peaceful approaches are needed when integrating the communities and when organizing them for implementation of the project.</narrative>
