   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project will target highly vulnerable households and individuals including women, older people, children, adolescents and young people, PLWD. IDP, households from host community hosting large number of IDPs and facing similar level of vulnerability, and individuals with low economic status who experience a greater level of risk. Children, women, and girls who lost or are separated from primary caregivers due to conflict are at increased risk of neglect, abandonment, health risks, violence, and exploitation, and are more likely to suffer mental health and psychosocial distress, and malnutrition; as such, they will be targeted for intervention. At least 10% of the targeted beneficiaries will be people living with disabilities. Targeting will be based on humanitarian principles of humanity and impartiality, to save lives and alleviate suffering with aid being provided based on need, in proportion to identified needs. 
A participatory and consultative approach will be used to agree targeting criteria that ensures the most vulnerable individuals/households are identified and benefit from this support, building on the methodology used in previous CTP interventions. Clear vulnerability criteria will be set and during the process. This project will target individuals/households highly exposed to life-threatening health, protection, and malnutrition risks since they are the one most affected by Acute Watery Diarrhoea, Acute Respiratory Infections, malnutrition, Gender Based Violence, and general protection issues. Cognisant of these facts, the households with malnourished children admitted to nutrition centres or supported through outreach therapeutic treatment will be supported through standard hygiene NFI kits and home takeaway food. This will also be supplemented with promotion of improved hygiene and sanitation measures.</narrative>
