  <description>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Only two years into independence, Our vision of a liberated nation in which all people will be equal and live in peace appears to be shattered when Supporters of the President and that  of the former Vice President  on 15th December 2013 fought against each other which  quickly escalated to Inter- ethnic killings in Juba, Bor, Malakal, Bentiu and Akobo  with so much unnecessary death and displacement of individuals and communities, with many fleeing as refugees to neighbouring countries, and the most appalling destruction carried out on human beings, personal property, and on social infrastructure which has forced many South Sudanese to seek safety in UNMISS Protection Of Civilian  Camps ( POC)  and elsewhere around the World.
Militarization 
 It has become clear to most South Sudanese that the Government of Republic of South Sudan is run by army generals that have neither the training, nor the formation or the vision and ability to lead a nation. The orders it uses cannot be applied to citizens. The discipline it follows cannot be reconciled with democratic practices of good governance and the rule of law. South Sudan faces the problem of Leadership and democracy and democratic practices.
Tribalism
The majority of South Sudanese take their tribal Identity as their national identify which political leaders manipulate and use to incite their tribes against the national interest, and use divisive languages against other tribes as a weapon to mobilize supporters. The majority lack education which makes them underestimate their ability to hold political leaders and Government accountable and  contribute to the good leadership of the country and to effectively say &#x2018;no&#x2019; to dictatorship and its accompanying ill-effects and to challenge their representatives in the Legislative Assemblies..
Corruption
The Government of Republic of South Sudan repeatedly declared zero tolerance against corruption and corrupt officials. But the same government promotes and practices corruption and fails to bring corrupt officials to court and. Corruption has become domesticated.</narrative>
