   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project is raised to support the delivery of CN projects for 2022/2023 financial year.  Caritas Norway is supporting a 4 year projects in Gogrial and Yirol East, currently in it 3rd year.  The projects are designed to target highly vulnerable households and individuals including poor female headed households, households with persons living with disability, those with low income, and the most food insecure with malnourished children in Gogrial East and West of Warrap State. Women and youths will be at the center of this project.  Targeting will be based on humanitarian principles of humanity and impartiality to save lives and alleviate suffering with aid being provided based on need, in proportion to identified needs. To achieve this, the CTP protection and safeguarding framework will be used which considers safety, meaningful access, dignity and inclusivity.  A participatory and consultative approach will be used to agree targeting criteria that ensures the most vulnerable individuals/households are identified and benefit from this support, building on the methodology used in previous CTP interventions. The project will target at least 10 percent of the beneficiaries based on the membership of person living with disabilities. After setting out the criteria, women groups containing 5 members each are established as targeting committees (3 from host, 2 from IDP HHs) in different locations. These committees will identify and present a list of potential beneficiaries who meet the criteria. Following this, mass verification and validation will be conducted. The final list will be presented and posted at community level for further verification as well as to give an opportunity for residents to raise any grievances which will be handled in accordance with locally established complaints handling mechanisms. The process promotes active participation, inclusiveness and ownership of the project by the community.</narrative>
