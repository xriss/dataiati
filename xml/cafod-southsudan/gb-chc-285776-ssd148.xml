   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The prolonged war in South Sudan has denied its citizens and communities a chance to live together and enjoy peace thus continued cases of violence. 90% percent of the current South Sudanese were born in war and have never experienced peace and love, their minds are stocked with war memories and many of them are traumatized. The Gogrial west county community in Warrap has never experienced peace which makes them suffer from peace deficiency and they are not able to demonstrate peace to their neighboring communities, this has contributed to an increase of community clashes especially in the areas inhabited by Apuk and Aguok tribes.
This project is aimed to conduct activities to reduce inter-clan violence by creating awareness on the importance of women empowerment and peaceful coexistence among the communities, and creating a friendly village forum where people discuss issues related to violence which causes insecurity in the area. By the end of the project the village forum will be empowered to establish the village help desk where by violence cases will be reported and handled. The project activities will also provide the traumatized community with healing process through village public debates and drama where the community will freely discuss their differences and solutions, and as such establish a peaceful society where people live in harmony and perfect peace.</narrative>
