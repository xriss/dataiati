   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The current crisis in South Sudan, which started on 15 December 2013, has affected huge population movements and displacements in the country. Close to half a million people are believed to have been displaced as a result of armed conflict with many more believed to have fled their homes or lost lives of dear ones in the course of the conflict. There are further reported cases of thousands of South Sudanese who have fled to the neighboring East African countries.   The UN Bases across South Sudan have continued to cater for thousands of South Sudanese population who sought for shelter and protection across the ten states of the nation.
  
As the crisis struck, the affected population experienced difficulties due to lack of many basic life needs which among others include shelter, access to basic health care, food and none food valuables, water, sanitation and hygiene related challenges. 
On Dec 17th 2013, St. Vincent De Paul first received a batch of 230 IDP families (mostly women, children and elderly people) whom the parish was able to support with food and none food items, shelter (in the secondary school blocks), medical care, water and spiritual support to overcome the challenges of the conflict. 
 
Later on as more and more people flocked in, the parish run short of capacity to harbour all of them hence it decided to transfer a total of 300 IDP hhs to the UN compound in Juba town, however their welfare remained the responsibility of the parish to date. The parish has also supported the relocation of 80 IDPs to Nadafal IDP camp in Kapoeta East County, Eastern Equatoria State with the support of UNHCR.
 
On January 30th 2014, the parish again received a total 30hhs of IDPs who claimed to have arrived from Jonglei state following the aftermath of the recent clashes between the government forces and the opposition which led to the retake of Bor town by the government forces. This new group greatly encroached on the already scarce food and non food items reserved in the stores to save lives of the people whom the parish caters for since mid Dec 2013.
 
Don Bosco Selasians are international congregation working for education and youth projects in supporting the needs of the most vulnerable societies across the world. St. Vincent De Paul Parish of the Selasians of Don Bosco located 4km south east of Juba town has started its operations in South Sudan in 2005 with operations in four states, namely Central Equatoria, Western Equatoria (Meridi), Western Bar El Ghazal (Wau) and Warrap States. The parish in Juba runs education and health programmes of technical and women vocational institution, a youth centre, secondary and primary schools, a health centre and kindergarten. 
 
 
This project therefore seeks to support the 105 households with provision of emergency food, non food items, medical care and cash grant support to the targeted households camped in the compound at Gumbo and this will support the procurement of NFIs (bowls, plates, buckets, blankets, soap and mats) as well as food and cash grant support and procurement of medicine for curing opportunistic infections mostly among children and adults in the new camp established within the parish/church premises in Gumbo-Juba.</narrative>
