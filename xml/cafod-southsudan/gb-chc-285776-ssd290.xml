  <description>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">CTP is working with TOCH to implement Caritas Norway project in Gogrial East and West.  The project which is in its 3rd year is to support communities improve their food security status.  This small project is to complement the food security component by introducing community seedbanks and IGAs.  This is a 3rd of the 4 years Caritas Norway funded project.  The project is designed to target highly vulnerable households and individuals including poor female headed households, households with persons living with disability, those with low income, and the most food insecure with malnourished children in Gogrial East and West of Warrap State. Women and youths will be at the center of this project.  Targeting will be based on humanitarian principles of humanity and impartiality to save lives and alleviate suffering with aid being provided based on need, in proportion to identified needs. To achieve this, the CTP protection and safeguarding framework will be used which considers safety, meaningful access, dignity and inclusivity.  A participatory and consultative approach will be used to agree targeting criteria that ensures the most vulnerable individuals/households are identified and benefit from this support, building on the methodology used in previous CTP interventions. The project will target at least 10 percent of the beneficiaries based on the membership of person living with disabilities. After setting out the criteria, women groups containing 5 members each are established as targeting committees (3 from host, 2 from IDP HHs) in different locations. These committees will identify and present a list of potential beneficiaries who meet the criteria. Following this, mass verification and validation will be conducted. The final list will be presented and posted at community level for further verification as well as to give an opportunity for residents to raise any grievances which will be handled in accordance with locally established complaints handling mechanisms. The process promotes active participation, inclusiveness and ownership of the project by the community.</narrative>
