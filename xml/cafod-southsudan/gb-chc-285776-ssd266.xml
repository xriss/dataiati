   <narrative xml:lang="EN">TOCH designed to implement this project through two approaches
 risk communication strategies including.
The use of the media to provide reliable accurate information on COVID-19 Vaccines. A set of radio programs including jingles messages, radio talk show and callers&#x2019; feedback will be used for information sharing on COVID-19. Radio messaging has been chosen because its coverage is wider and its reliable source of information to the community. TOCH will use Kuajok FM because it has coverage of 20,000 People/Audience and can reach locations at the border with Western Bhar el ghazal State, Northern Bhar el ghazal State and Unity State.

Further TOCH will adopt risk communication and community engagement strategy. Risk communication is a recommended approach to community engagement during disease outbreak especially communicable diseases. It entails taking up activities that does not promote gathering. TOCH will therefore conduct awareness creation at household level and to self-mobilized community audience. These groups will be mapped and targeted by awareness creation session, Information sharing, civic Education, and communication materials (IEC). TOCH plans to print IEC materials and display them in public places to pass information to those marginalised groups of people such as the deaf and those who cannot read and write. TOCH will use the guidelines provided by WHO but Translate it into local language, Print and distribute to the community. The project will recruit, train, equip and deploy community health worker to sensitise the community.
Mainstreaming COVID-19 preventive messaging in all ongoing project activities implementation. This will promote the uptake of the preventive messages by project participant&#x2019;s thus behavioural change.</narrative>
