   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Ongoing food support for vulnerable IDPs sheltering in Don Bosco Compound, Juba-South Sudan</narrative>
  </title>
  <description>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Since December 2013 crisis, Don Bosco, St. Vincent de Paul Parish is sheltering thousands of internally displaced persons from different parts of Juba and outside Juba displaced during the December 2013 and July 2016 crises. Don Bosco compound is hosting an estimated 3000 households majority of whom are women and children. Many of the displaced in Juba crossed the Nile to seek shelter in the relative safety of the compound of the Salesians of Don Bosco in Gumbo, some 3 km from Juba Town.  
During an assessment visit by CTP to the site in October 2016 after the July crisis, IDPs described their living conditions as dire and many families were surviving on one meal per day and have no shelter materials (sleeping mat, blanket and mosquito net) and basic cooking equipment. CTP in partnership with the Salesians of Don Bosco between November and December 2016 provided three months emergency food support to 520 most vulnerable households and this is just a small fraction of the total population in need. Each family received 15 kg of maize flour, 15 kg beans, 2.5L of cooking oil and 1 sacket of 500 g of cooking salt to meet their food survival need. The humanitarian situation of the IDPs has not changed and has further been exacerbated  by the increased prices of basic commodities in the market as a result of devaluation of the South Sudanese Pounds against the US Dollars. Currently, many families are struggling and surviving on wild fruits and vegetables and are in dire need of humanitarian food assistance.  In view of the appalling situation, CTP in partnership with the Salesians of Don Bosco will provide another three (3) months emergency food support to the 1,000 most vulnerable households. Beneficiary targeting will be community-based and done through a Vulnerability and Inequality Analysis (VIA) process, to ensure that the most vulnerable people are targeted. The beneficiaries selection criteria will include elderly people, those with chronic sicknesses, female headed households, child headed households and unaccompanied children.</narrative>
