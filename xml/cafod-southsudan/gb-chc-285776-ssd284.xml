   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Yirol East:Strengthening Self-sufficiency for 4800 people, Empowering women to improve social status</narrative>
  </title>
  <description>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project will be implemented by both TOCH and CDOR and will cover selected payams of Yirol East county in former Lakes State. TOCH have been operational in Yirol East since 2015, and their role in the project is to strengthen the protection and GBV response.  
The project will take a nexus approach, combining both humanitarian, development and peace approaches to address food insecurity, strengthened by improved coping mechanisms for women and girls, and safe water access. In Yirol people have traditionally produced the bulk of their own food; this project will enable communities, directly affected by conflict and displacement, to do this again. The project will equip communities with climate sensitive agroecological skills, tools and technology for long term food security beyond humanitarian food aid. An agroecological approach will help build on traditional knowledge including context specific practices that regenerate the environment, improve biodiversity, increase resilience to shocks and manage pests at low or zero cost to farmers, combined with tools and seeds to increase productivity and production of diverse foods. 
A survivor-centred and women&#x2019;s empowerment focused approach will support women to secure their safety and wellbeing, to enable them to recover, and provide for their families and become food secure. To tackle poor access to safe water and poor hygiene and sanitation practices in the community the project will provide safe water through borehole repair, establishing water user committees and training pump mechanics and distribution of sanitation items along with hygiene messaging. These activities will complement food production activities by improving health, absorption of nutrients, and productivity.  Peacebuilding committees will work to promote peaceful
resolution of conflicts, peaceful coexistence and negotiate access to communal resources, in turn helping to better
ensure food security measures are well received and sustainable. WUC&#x2019;s will work to resolve water point access
issues or conflict. Activities will also bring together diverse groups of IDP&#x2019;s and hosts to work together, share
knowledge and experiences during the project.</narrative>
