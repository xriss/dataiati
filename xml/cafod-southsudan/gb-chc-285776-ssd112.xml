   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This is the CTP Operational Budget for support of the Partner Project with Caritas Diocese of Rumbek in Yirol East (SSD107).

The situation in South Sudan remains one of the world&apos;s biggest humanitarian crises since the escalation of differences between SPLA and SPLA-IO. While there is no active conflict In Lakes State, some counties of the state such as Yirol East County that border Unity and Jonglei States are affected by insecurity and have received a number of IDP influxes. This conflict which has since transitioned into an inter-ethnic conflict, has resulted in the internal displacement of an estimated 11,627 people (2,269 households) living in 4 payam areas of Yirol East County; Malek, Adior, Pagarau and Lekakudu. The population of Yirol East is estimated at 67,402; with about 90% of them leaving in rural areas (NPA livelihoods baseline survey, Oct 2014).   The effect and impact of this conflict on the displaced persons in their areas of origin was mostly in form of threat to and loss of lives, deprivation of social protection and rights, psycho-social trauma due to fear and torture (through various forms of abuses), the loss, destruction their livelihood assets (importantly livestock) and disruption of their livelihoods e.g. pastoralism, fishing and crop farming systems. CTP&#x2019;s recent assessment revealed that 90% of the IDP and host communities access water from unprotected water sources. Insufficient hand pumps coupled with lack of ownership and/or poor management of existing water points has resulted in poor access to safe water supply. The assessment also shows that the average per capita water use is very low with households spending up to 4 hours travelling to and queuing at the nearest water point, posing protection concerns especially for women such as random attacks, sexual violence and abduction of children.  Latrine coverage and hygiene knowledge are extremely low as evidenced by unsafe disposal of human excreta and poor hand washing practice at critical times. 
A total of 800 households (80% IDPs and 20% extremely vulnerable hosts) will be targeted for this particular project. 800 households (extremely vulnerable) will be targeted for monthly cash-for-food transfers using a food vouchering system) over a period of 6 months. 800 HH will be targeted for provision of WASH NFIs (jerry cans, buckets, and laundry and toilet soaps) and Cooking NFIs (sauce pans, cups, plates/bowls, spoons etc.).  500 HH will be targeted for communal latrines (10 HH per latrine block, 2 stances disaggregated to male and female), and 800 HH will be provided with clean and safe water supply.</narrative>
