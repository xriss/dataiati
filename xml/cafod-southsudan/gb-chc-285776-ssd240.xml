   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project seeks to ameliorate the suffering of displaced persons and returnees with a focus on women and children who constitute the bulk of the displaced persons and at-risk host families. The project will provide lifesaving assistance to 1,500 (655) households who have children suffering from malnutrition and preventable communicable diseases due to poor access to safe water, hygiene, and sanitation practices.  It will strengthen the capacity for food self-sufficiency for 1,500 households (80% women headed households) as primary beneficiaries and 7,500 (3,276) individuals, as secondary beneficiaries in Owach and Nyiluak payams of Panyikang County in the former Upper Nile State. Amongst the indirect beneficiaries of food and vegetables production will be under 5-year-old children who suffer the most from high levels of malnutrition in the area. The project will reduce dependency on handouts by providing training and resources for agriculture, access to clean water, hygiene promotion and specific support for women and girls to overcome gender-based barriers and improve coping strategies. In addition, peace is indispensable to successful project implementation and hence the project will mainstream peacebuilding and promote peaceful co-existence amongst the different ethnic communities in the project area.
This intervention will cover Owach and Nyiluak payams of Panyikang County in the former Upper Nile State. The project will work with both host and IDPs and refugee populations. Hosts have received IDPs well; community leaders have shared communal cultivation land with IDPs. The settlements where IDPs mix with the host population require a balanced approach in providing or maintaining the existing services to encourage peaceful co-existence between IDPs and the hosts who are equally underserved. Host communities will constitute about 25% of the beneficiaries. 

Besides providing lifesaving support the project will enable communities to transition to recovery through a) reducing dependency on humanitarian relief support; b) increasing self-reliance and resilient food production systems; and c) promoting gender equality amongst the communities and d) peaceful co-existence.  To address these, the project will pursue the following objectives:</narrative>
