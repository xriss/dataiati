       <narrative xml:lang="EN">Guatemala (7, 6g)
Result 4.1
(1) In 2021, the business sector&#x2019;s representative GREPALMA (1), organized a meeting with the Dutch Embassy in Costa Rica to question and delegitimize our report &#x201C;Women&#x2019;s rights violations in Dutch palm oil supply chains: The case of Guatemala&#x201D;. In the opinion of the business sector, the report is harmful for their activities.

Result 4.2
(1) The Feminist for a Binding Treaty and ActionAid Guatemala were invited for a meeting with the Guatemalan delegation (1) in Geneva after they shared their recommendations. These were written down in collaboration with other Guatemalan CSOs and focused on how to improve the treaty considering women&apos;s and indigenous rights. Unfortunately, due to a lack of time the meeting was cancelled. The delegation is very interested to hear our perspective. (1g)

Result 4.3
(1) ActionAid Guatemala and ActionAid Netherlands received an invitation from the Dutch Embassy in Costa Rica (1) to present our report &#x201C;Women&#x2019;s rights violations in Dutch palm oil supply chains: The case of Guatemala&#x201D;. Representatives of the Embassy promised to learn more about the differentiated impact on women in the Northern Lowlands (TBN) through a visit to the territory in 2022. (1g)

Result 4.4
(4) Four universities (Rafael Land&#xED;var University (URL), National Autonomous University of Mexico (IIS/UNAM), University of San Carlos de Guatemala (USAC), University of Pennsylvania Press) invited ActionAid Guatemala to write and publish their article and speak during webinars and seminars. Through these activities and knowledge products we have started the debate about the differentiated impacts on women in the Northern Lowlands of Guatemala caused by palm oil plantations, among teachers, researchers and academics. (4g)

Netherlands (18, 4g)
Result 4.5
(4) Based on the results of ActionAid Netherlands&#x2019; research report on human rights violations in the manganese supply chain, four companies (Tata Steel, Vattenfall, Eneco and Orsted) held internal consultations and engaged in conversation with ActionAid and each other to work together on realizing responsible manganese supply chains.

Result 4.6
(2) Media-coverage about ActionAid Netherlands&#x2019; &#x2018;Manganese Matters&#x2019; report, linking human/women rights violations to our electrical vehicles, on national radio, in Trouw newspaper, Zembla website and Reformatorisch Dagblad strengthened the agenda setting with Parliamentarians about responsible supply chains for a just transition and the need for gender-responsive due diligence. Particularly, the articles in Trouw prompted one Parliamentarian to ask questions in Parliament based on the report&apos;s findings (2g).

Result 4.7
(1) During COP26 in November, ActionAid managed to set the agenda of the media on the need for climate justice and fair climate finance. Media coverage included an interview on France 24 TV, national radio (Radio 1), articles in Telegraaf and Trouw, and an interview for a specialist climate podcast. Several media outlets approached us proactively for these interviews.

Result 4.8
(1) For the first time De Telegraaf addressed the issue of climate finance by interviewing ActionAid Netherlands following their work at COP26. In the article the ActionAid perspectives and views were accurately reflected to an audience we normally don&#x2019;t reach.

Result 4.9
(1) As a result of two ActionAid reports on the need for fair tax and digital tax policies, ActionAid generated a lot of media attention. We were invited for an interview on national television (RTLZ) and on the radio, and over 20 newspaper articles appeared.

Result 4.10
(1) As a result of intensive lobby over the past years, the Ministry of Finance invited ActionAid Netherlands for regular meetings to discuss our priorities and position on Dutch tax treaty negotiation developments and planning prioritization.

Result 4.11
(1) The Social Economic Council (SER) invited ActionAid, WO=MEN, WomenWin and Partnering for Social Impact to organise a workshop on gender-responsive due diligence (GRDD) as a result of frequent engagements with the SER on GRDD and the relevance of gender. More than 20 employees from the sectoral agreements on Agrofood, Extractives, Textile and Financial Sector participated in the workshop (1g).

Result 4.12
(1) At the initiative of the academics participating, Asser Institute published an academic brief with a legal analysis of the draft UN Binding Treaty on Business and Human Rights as the result of an expert workshop in October 2021, organised by SOMO, ActionAid, IUCN, Milieudefensie, WO=MEN and the Asser Institute together with 17 academics, litigators and civil society representatives to jointly analyse the third draft of the UN Binding Treaty on Business and Human Rights with respect to Prevention, Access to Remedy and Liability (possible double counting SOMO and Milieudefensie). 

Result 4.13
(1) Two political parties (GroenLinks and D66) jointly organized the first roundtable on climate finance for the Committee on Foreign Trade and Development following several reports (including 1 by ActionAid Netherlands) and lobby on the failures of climate finance.

Result 4.14
(1) VVD called for a technical briefing from the Planbureau voor de Leefomgeving (PBL) to address questions about the Netherlands approach to climate finance following a conversation with ActionAid raising concerns about the Netherlands not living up to their fair share and a lack of transparency. 

Result 4.15
(2) Based on a joint Food4All lobby letter ActionAid Netherlands has been invited by and met three times with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Agriculture to discuss our recommendations in relation to the right to food, Agriculture &amp; Food system transition, the Dutch UNFSS agenda and agroecology promotion.

Result 4.16
(1) Mining company South 32 invited ActionAid South Africa and MACUA/WAMUA to discuss their recommendations as outlined in the &#x2018;Manganese Matters&#x2019; report, especially to see how the situation for women in mining communities in South Africa can be improved and how they can put in place gender-responsive due diligence measures (1g).

Result 4.17
(1) The United States and other like-minded states intended to derail the UN Binding Treaty on Business and Human Rights process. This was blocked as a result of the joint efforts by the broad CSO movement present including the Treaty Alliance, Feminists for a Binding Treaty and ActionAid&apos;s delegation (Bangladesh, Ethiopia, France, Ghana, Guatemala, Kenya, Netherlands, Nigeria, Uganda, and Zimbabwe) supporting several rapid response letters to the US government, the EU and through a broad CSO statement with joint key recommendations on the treaty text.

Kenya (4, 1g, 1x)
Result 4.18
(1) The Ministry of Petroleum and Mining (1g) visited mining sites in Kitui, Kilifi and Taita Taveta from where artisanal miners, most of whom women, had organized a press conference and presented demands in response to new draft regulations affecting their situation. The Ministry had drafted new regulations seeking to give large scale miners (such as multinational firms) more power and much of the mining rights and take away powers of the communities&#x2019; and the Community Development Agreement Committees (CDACs). 
AA Kenya and partners supported the artisanal miners to jointly analyse the newly drafted regulations, develop their demands, and present them through a press conference and to the Ministry of Lands. Their demands included: to be engaged in the drafting of policies relevant to them, that formal registration for artisanal miners&#x2019; associations should be more easily arranged, that the percentage of the mining benefits destined for community development be increased from 1% to 5%, that large scale miners stop exploiting artisanal miners and using them for exploration services then ultimately take over the mining stages, that artisanal miners should be allocated special mining zones with financial stipends as is the case with large scale miners and extractive sectors and that the government should provide gender responsive public services such as separate washrooms for women and dispensaries within the mining sites.
The Community Development Agreement Committees (CDACs) are envisaged as tools to engage mining affected communities in development decisions within their areas and to have these communities receive and manage a percentage of the benefits of mining for community development. In response to the demands formulated by the artisanal miners, the Ministry committed to constructing washrooms and dispensaries as the miners had requested, as &#x2018;quick wins&#x2019;, while noting that the other demands would require more negotiations to develop consensus. In addition, the partner demanded for the adoption of the Taita Taveta Artisanal Miners Association as members of the County Artisanal Miners Committee as stipulated by the Mining Act. The County Artisanal Miners Committee advises the Director of Mines in the granting, renewal or revocation of artisanal mining permits and is chaired by the respective County Governor (1g).

Result 4.19
(1) The Taita Taveta county government (1) sent a government surveyor to two communities for fact finding and establishment of boundaries of their community lands to aid the process of formal identification of the land as community land. This happened after the two communities had been trained on their request by AA Kenya&#x2019;s partner and had formed community land management committees (CLMCs). They had written demand letters to the Ministry of Land and Physical Planning for their lands to be registered as community lands. Earlier in 2021, AA Kenya&#x2019;s partner and respective communities had identified five unrecognised community lands after two successful road shows on community land, supported by FGG. These unrecognised community lands might have otherwise been left out of the county community land inventory and would therefore have remained at risk for land grabs in the future. The CLMCs are structures that help in the management of community lands on behalf of the wider community. They are selected and/or elected by the community as guided in the Kenyan Community Land Act from 2016.

Result 4.20
(1) In 2021, the Kenya National Commission on Human Rights (KNCHR) (1x) sent a delegation for a fact-finding mission to Taita Taveta on mass threats of evictions and land grabs. This happened after appeals by AA Kenya and its partner. It was extremely important that the matter was put on the agenda of the Kenya National Human Rights Commission and that they set up a fact -finding mission because the report will give policy implementors guidelines and indicate who owns the land in contestation. Their report on the mission is yet to be finalized (1x).

Result 4.21
(1) In 2021, the Ministry of Land and Physical Planning (1) sent surveyors to Taita Taveta and Kilifi on fact finding missions aimed at inclusion of unrecognized community lands into their respective county community lands registers. This was an important step for protection of the communities living in those areas against land grabs and evictions, i.e. safeguarding community land rights. The sending of surveyors was a recommendation from AA and partners. This happened after two of AA Kenya&#x2019;s partners had worked with the respective communities, supported them to organize and to act. AA Kenya supported the initiatives with activity funding and joint strategizing.</narrative>

(1) The Community Development Council (COCODE / local authority) (1) structurally includes women in their meetings about water and land, as a result of women demanding their participation in these discussions. These meetings about land take place every 2 months, and the meetings about water take place when a problem occurs. ActionAid Guatemala and their implementing partner CONGCOOP contributed with trainings and strategic support. We provided space for the women, to learn how to advocate at the local level. In the communities, information about the situation of the land and other natural resources is usually handled by community authorities, which are mainly men. This is why women and the differentiated impacts they face are not considered. Therefore, it is relevant that women demand their inclusion in discussions and action strategies to resolve the land and water situation in their communities. This is an important first step towards justice and gender equality. Unfortunately, the perspective of women is still not taken into account when making decisions. (1g)

Netherlands (2)
Result 6C.3 (policy change)
(1) The new Dutch tax treaty policy &apos;Nederlands Fiscaal verdragsbeleid&apos; has been adopted and is being implemented by the Dutch Ministry of Finance. This policy contains improvements for countries in the Global South when it comes to source taxation, derived from the UN model treaty convention. ActionAid Netherlands has advocated for adoption of the UN model treaty as a minimum for years.

Result 6C.4 (policy change)
(1) The European Union has adopted and started implementing the Country-by-Country reporting in 2021. ActionAid Netherlands, together with Tax Justice Network Netherlands and Europe, actively lobbied for public Country-by-Country legislation in the EU. This legislation will improve fiscal transparency of multinational companies, important in the fight against tax avoidance.

Kenya (6, 3g)
Result 6C.5 (practice change)
(1) In Marereni in Kenya, the Kilifi Magistrate court issued a moratorium (1) to salt firms stopping further developments in any lands they had claimed. thereby stopping an eviction threat in Kinyauel village. This happened because community groups together with AA Kenya&#x2019;s local partner had been successfully undertaking a public interest litigation process against the salt firms, despite attempts by the companies to intimidate the community and HRDs. The litigation process seeks to address a variety of injustices over the years, such as land grabs, forced eviction, denying fishermen access to landing sites and blocking access to the beaches, and environmental violations including air pollution, pollution of fresh water sources, and destruction of natural fish breeding sites due to the operations of the salt companies. The community is supported in this process by the partner through trainings, joint strategizing, and hands-on advice. After the partner had hosted an interactive talk show on the matter in early 2021, 10 community members came forward and wanted to become witnesses in the process and three advocates who come from Marereni showed interest into the matter and requested to be part of the legal team.
The community indicated that it is because of their constant engagement with AA Kenya and the partner that they have the knowledge and capacity to speak out against the injustices caused by the salt firms and to defend their rights. This result is significant in a country where land grabs are rampant and increasing, with devastating impacts on often poor communities, and where corporate impunity for such acts is rife.

Result 6C.6 (practice change)
(2) The Ministry of Education (1), Ministry of Land and Physical Planning and the County Government of Kilifi, land department (1) have changed government bureaucratic practices of withholding information by issuing data as requested by ActionAid Kenya&#x2019;s partner and sending surveyors for factfinding into the field as requested in Taita Taveta and Kilifi counties. This happened after the partner&#x2019;s request for information in the context of their anti-land grab campaign. The information concerned a school which would be affected and the partner requesting on behalf of 4 communities that the Ministry and County government send government surveyors to work with the communities on identifying their lands.

Result 6C.7 (practice change)
(3) In 2021, 3 local land governance bodies in Taita Taveta and Kitui (3g) counties actively safeguarded women&#x2019;s rights to land. The women held women sensitization trainings for a in communities and offered mediation services. In Taita Taveta, women members of these bodies were able to stop land transfers where women had been left out of the sales transaction by their husbands. In Kitui, the bodies assisted to resolve land conflicts where widows were being disinherited by their in-laws. This happened after AA Kenya&#x2019;s partners had supported and trained the women on women&#x2019;s land rights. The women said that they had earlier lacked the courage to speak out against injustice to protect women&#x2019;s land rights but now felt confident. AA Kenya contributed including by jointly strategizing with and providing activity funding to the partner organisations (3g).

Uganda (1)
Result 6C.8 (policy change)
(1) The parliament of the Republic of Uganda adopted a CSO recommendation (1) shared by the tax justice alliance during the process of reviewing the annual Tax Bills for FY 2022/23. The Parliamentary Committee on Finance, Planning and economic Development adopted a CSO recommendation for Government to study the tax exemption proposals with the objective to establish criteria for companies to qualify for tax exemptions. This will help the country to reduce revenue losses due to the many tax exemptions, especially those given to foreign investors. This measure is important as this is expected to contribute to increasing Government revenue and ensuring that revenues that would have been lost through tax exemptions are secured and re-directed to sectors especially health, education, water and sanitation that are critical for the wellbeing of women. This outcome was as a result of the CSOs tax justice alliance retreat to review the annual tax bills for FY 2021/22 which was organized by SEATINI and funded by ActionAid Uganda.

Zimbabwe (1, 1g)
Result 6C.9 (practice change)
(1) The Mutoko Rural District Council (RDC) improved its social service delivery by providing gender-responsive public services as a result of active lobby by ActionAid Zimbabwe, partner ZELA and other CSOs. The RDC requested devolution funds from the national government as part of revenue sharing arrangements put down in the government, which AA and ZELA had brought under the attention of the RDC. The RDC used these funds to construct a clinic for maternal healthcare, among others. The efforts received national media attention and praise from the Deputy Minister of Information (1g).</narrative>

Result 5C.1
(1) Four political parties (SP, GroenLinks, PvdA and PvdD) invited ActionAid Netherlands for meetings to discuss the recommendations that we put forward in a position paper ahead of a debate on tax avoidance. The parties raised questions to the Minister of Finance during the debate and put forward our recommendations on additional unilateral measures as well as a more progressive position of the Dutch government in international tax revision processes.

Result 5C.2
(1) The Commissie Doorstroom Vennootschappen, an official commission of external experts and one expert from the Dutch Revenue Services, invited ActionAid Netherlands to compose a discussion paper and present it during a hearing. As a result, the Commission wrote and presented a paper to the government that includes several of ActionAid&apos;s recommendations on limiting shell companies in the Netherlands. 

Result 5C.3
(1) The evaluation department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (IOB) invited ActionAid Netherlands and Southern partners to provide input for their research on the impacts of Dutch tax policies on countries in the global South. The report that IOB sent to the Dutch government reflected a lot of the recommendations made by ActionAid and partners to better reflect the position and needs of countries in the Global South.

Result 5C.4
(1) Seven political parties (PvdA, GL, SP, PvdD, CU, Volt and Piratenpartij) signed the tax manifest of Tax Justice Network, including ActionAid, committing themselves to putting forward progressive measures in the government formation process to curb tax avoidance.

Result 5C.5
(1) Six political parties (GL, PvdA, D66, PvdD, Volt and SP) filed a motion calling on the government to investigate how to adapt the current climate finance systems to maximally benefit the least developed countries. This motion was adopted. This flowed from a series of email exchanges with ActionAid and conversations with some of the filing parties. 

Result 5C.6
(1) Following a joint meeting of NGO&#x2019;s (including ActionAid) addressing the lack of access for civil society and marginalized groups (especially women from the global South), the Dutch delegation at COP lobbied the COP presidency to improve this (1x).

Result 5C.7
(1) Following prolonged efforts by ActionAid and others calling for the need to increase climate finance, the new government has pledged a structural increase of 500 million per year for foreign aid targeting climate change and Covid-19.

Kenya (7, 5g)
Result 5C.8
(1) The Environment and Land Committee of the Taita Taveta County Assembly (1) indicated in a report that the Zunglukani Community should not be evicted and that the land should be given to the community. This was a result of their meeting and factfinding mission with AA Kenya&#x2019;s partner on the threats of land grab in the county. The partner had requested to meet the committee to share with them a report on the evictions and land grab threats in the county. This report was adopted by the Assembly and the report&#x2019;s recommendations integrated into its policy plans.

Result 5C.9 
(1) The Taita Taveta County Assembly issued a position against evictions in the county (1) when they adopted recommendation made by AA Kenya partner on the issue. This was incorporated into the Assembly&#x2019;s order paper and debated during the Assembly&#x2019;s sessions. With local politicians being against land grabs, communities will have their support and protection whenever such matters do happen, and it is a first step to making the county government even allocate resources for communities&#x2019; victims of eviction. This happened after AA Kenya&#x2019;s partner had shared a report on the topic with the Assembly during an awareness raising meeting on evictions with the Environment and Land Committee of the Assembly, who later requested them to share the same report with the entire Assembly.

Result 5C.10
(1) In Nyokal, the local administration (1) supported a process in which a group of women attempted to secure their tenure rights to land. The women had been facing evictions by their in-laws and ultimately disinheritance. The local administration had worked together with the council of elders and AA Kenya&#x2019;s partner to support the women in so called alternative dispute settlement processes. The fact that the local administration collaborated in this process is significant because those that perpetrate and condone such behaviours will know they risk being arrested and charged (1g).

Result 5C.11
(3) Three land governance structures in the Mui Basin in Kitui accepted to conduct elections aimed at electing more women to leadership positions. They are Katikoni (1) and Malatani (1) Land Survey Committees in Zombe, and Kaliku Land Survey committee (1) in Mutitu/Kaliku ward. This happened after AA Kenya&#x2019;s partner&#x2019;s advocacy work and capacity building of 16 women from various land governance structures (including the County land department, National Land Commission, Ministry of Land and Physical Planning, and various community land adjudication committees), with technical support from AA Kenya and the Kenya Land Alliance. Land Survey Committees are community structures set up by the government to assist and work with government surveyors during land adjudication and allocation procedures. It is significant that these governance structures aim to have more women in leadership positions, as this is expected to contribute to safeguarding women&#x2019;s land rights (3g).

Result 5C.12
(1) The County Government of Kitui, department of land (1) approached AA Kenya&#x2019;s partner to jointly organize awareness raising fora in communities on women&#x2019;s property rights. This is a result of the partner&#x2019;s sustained awareness raising work on this matter over the past years. It is significant that the county government approached the organisation, and this demonstrates their real intention to work for promoting women&#x2019;s land rights in the county. Three joint forums were held in Kaliku, Kimongo and Mwitika villages (1g).

Uganda (2, 1x, 1g)
Result 5C.13
(1) The Ministry of Lands, Housing and Urban Development and Ministry of Gender, Labour and Social Development on 30th June, 2021 adopted a &#x2018;women land rights agenda&#x2019; (1g) that civil society and women&#x2019;s groups had jointly developed, with 10 demands to safeguard land rights for women. The Women Land Rights Agenda also contains recommendations for the actions the government should take to protect the affected communities. The Minister of Land committed to implement and fund the recommended actions for the next 5 years. ActionAid Uganda provided inputs on issue 3 on Illegal land evictions (Pg20-22) related to land grabs in relation to large scale plantations, as well as information for the demands focusing on corporate accountability, free, prior, and informed consent (FPIC) in land deals, and compensation; funded the launch of the agenda during a Women Land Rights conference that brought together all land actors in Uganda. ActionAid Uganda will work closely with the Ministry to track progress of the demands as formulated in the Agenda (1g).

Result 5C.14
(1) In 2021, 5 members of parliament in Uganda committed to voting for the passing of the Human Rights Defenders bill (1). This happened after AA Uganda&#x2019;s partner held a meeting with members of parliament from the sugar cane plantations areas and lobbied for the passing of the Bill. This Bill will help protect civic space and the freedoms of human rights defenders across the country. This is relevant in Uganda&#x2019;s plantations where various rights violations have been observed, such as grabbing of land and eviction of communities to make way for the plantations, destruction of houses and crops, intimidation and harassment of those trying to protect their assets and stand up against these practices, but also exploitation and harassment of workers in the plantations. After the meeting, It was through the training that the MPs came to appreciate the essence of the Bill. They also requested the partner to train them on the UN binding treaty on Business and Human rights which will help them advocate in parliament for the passing of the HRD bill. This training was undertaken and AA and the partner will follow up with the MPs in 2022. AAU contributed to this activity through funding the partners of the partner organisation (1x). 

Guatemala 5C (1g)
Result 5C.15
(1) The office of the Human Rights Ombudsman (1) visited the Northern Lowlands (Guatemala) as a result of the communities, organized in CTM, the Movement in Defense of the Water, and AAGua recommending this visit to discuss the differentiated impacts on women caused by palm oil plantations in the region. In 2022, we expect the launch of the report containing their observations and recommendations to improve the situations. Especially considering land and water rights for women. This result is a major win for women and their communities in the Northern Lowlands. The dynamics of forces and power in this region are very complex, but bring to light how no official institution is interested in (women) human rights violations and negative impacts of (transnational) corporations. The Ombudsman and his team visiting the area show, for the first time, serious interest in the challenges (indigenous) women and their communities face. It also shows support of the work we are doing and are planning to do. (1g)</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">Uganda (2)
Result 6D.2 (policy change)
(1) The Ministry of Gender, Labour and Social Development together with the Uganda Human Rights Commission for the first time approved and launched a National Action Plan on Business and Human Rights. The National Action Plan on Business and Human Rights is an important 5-year plan designed to protect citizens against increasing abuse of human rights by investors. (1)
ActionAid and its local partner in Uganda contributed to this process through the Uganda Consortium on Corporate Accountability (UCCA), a platform bringing together several civil society organisations that jointly advocated for the development of the plan. ActionAid&#x2019;s partner took part in various strategizing and advocacy sessions organized by the Consortium, both within civil society and with the Ministry. https://globalnaps.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/uganda_approved-national-action-plan-on-business-and-human-right

Result 6D.3 (practice change)
(1) A foreign investor in central Uganda was stopped from grabbing land for a so-called &#x2018;conservation&#x2019; project from a community. In 2012, the investor forcefully took away land from the communities using cruel ad harsh methods including killing of landowners and evicting others.
Various bodies of the Mubende district leadership (1), i.e. the local government&#x2019;s Natural resource unit, the police, District Local Chairman (IV), district councillors, Local Council chairperson 1, Member of Parliament had summoned the investor to engage in a dialogue with the community threatened by land grab (1). This happened after AA Uganda had presented a draft report to the local leadership based on a fact-finding mission in the community in December 2021. The fact-finding mission had demonstrated that human rights violations, illegal land evictions, destruction of property and crops, illegal arrests, and detentions of the community members and forceful taking of land. 
Following the community dialogues which confirmed the above allegations and brought massive evidence of human rights violations and land grab by the investor from the community, the investor was summoned by the district Local Council 5 and Member of parliament of Mubende district to stop the evictions and carry out an environmental impact assessment. In addition, upon further calls by the authorities, the investor agreed to register all the tenants on the land and compensate those that allow; secondly, that they were not to grow any other trees on the land until an environmental assessment was done; thirdly, that in any further plans for lands to be sold, the Local Council Chairman should be engaged in the process; fourthly, hey also agreed to collaborate on an assessment of the exact demarcations and squatters on the land. This matter became a nation concern and was aired on Nationwide television (NBS).</narrative>

Result 5D.1
European Parliamentarians (1) supported and promoted our recommendations in an announcement towards the European Parliament. We recommended to include FPIC in the nickel mines in the Northern Lowlands of Guatemala, owned by corporate FENIX. This is a result of ActionAid Guatemala working together with Protection International (European CSO) and Fundacion Guillermo Torriello (Guatemalan implementing partner). We worked together on the dissemination of information, knowledge, and analysis of what is happening in El Estor community regarding the consultation on the operations of the mining company.

Netherlands (13, 7g)
Result 5D.2
(1) As a result of ActionAid Netherlands&#x2019; active involvement and engagement, the Social and Economic Council included our recommendations on gender-responsive due diligence in the official text of the multistakeholder sector agreement on Renewable Energy (1g).

Result 5D.3
(1) In March 2021, four Dutch political parties (ChristenUnie, GroenLinks, SP and PvdA) submitted an initiative legislative proposal on mandatory human rights due diligence in Parliament. This legislative proposal is the result of the long-term joint advocacy efforts of ActionAid Netherlands together with a coalition of CSOs through the MVO Platform. In the last consultation round on the proposal ActionAid made concrete recommendations on the inclusion of the gender dimension in the proposal, leading to the inclusion of differentiated impacts of human rights abuses on women as overarching principle in the guidance note (1g).

Result 5D.4
(1) On the 10th of March 2021, the European Parliament voted in favour of the Due Diligence &amp; Corporate Accountability Legislative own-initiative report. The report recognises the need to include a gender-perspective due diligence. This report is the result of the long-term joint advocacy efforts of ActionAid Netherlands together with a coalition of CSOs in Brussels. ActionAid actively reached out to Dutch MEPs to gain support for the report (1g).

Result 5D.5
(1) The Dutch Minister of Foreign Trade and Development Kaag published her appreciation of the 2nd revised draft of the UN Binding Treaty on Business and Human Rights. In the appreciation Kaag commits to actively push for the EU&#x2019;s involvement in the treaty process and positively evaluates the gender dimension in the treaty draft text. As a follow-up on this commitment the Minister send a letter to the EC together with 15 like-minded EU member states to request a joint EU negotiation mandate. ActionAid Netherlands together with SOMO, IUCN, Milieudefensie and WO=MEN ensured a request for the appreciation was submitted by Parliament (1g) (possible double counting SOMO and Milieudefensie).

Result 5D.6
(1) The new government&apos;s coalition agreement between VVD, D66, CDA and ChristenUnie includes a commitment to develop national due diligence legislation. As a result of ActionAid Netherlands&#x2019; continued campaigning and lobbying together with MVO Platform and other CSOs, we generated public pressure by publishing several op-eds to support this ask and a joint petition with more than 40,000 signatures was handed over to parliament (ActionAid contributed over 1,200 signatures from its Manganese campaign to this petition). This led to the Dutch Minister of Foreign Trade and Development publishing progressive Building Blocks for mandatory due diligence legislation, the Minister committing to develop national legislation, culminating in the inclusion of national due diligence legislation in the new government&#x2019;s coalition agreement (possible double counting SOMO and Milieudefensie). 

Result 5D.7

(2) In March 2021, the OECD and the FAO published the guidance &#x201C;INTEGRATING A GENDER PERSPECTIVE INTO SUPPLY CHAIN DUE DILIGENCE&#x201D; in relation to the OECD-FAO Guidance for Responsible Agricultural Supply Chains. ActionAid Netherlands in collaboration with OECD Watch actively encouraged the production of this note and provided comments and edits on the integration of a gender lens in due diligence. The note references the ActionAid publication &#x201C;We Mean Business&#x201D; for further reading on the topic (2g).

Result 5D.9
(1) The Ministry of Foreign Trade and Development included a strong gender lens within pillar 1 of its draft revised National Action Plan on Business and Human Rights. This was recommended in the National Baseline Assessment after ActionAid Netherlands participated in the consultations on this and stressed again during the Ministry&#x2019;s consultation round in July by ActionAid together with WO=MEN (1g).

Result 5D.10
(1) FMO, following a consultation with civil society including ActionAid, strongly improved their proposed policy for divesting from fossil fuels. These improvements included aligning their investments with the Paris Agreement and significantly stricter regulations for when gas investments can be labeled as a transition fuel to green energy systems. They also limited the implementation time to 5 years (possible double counting BE and/or others).

Result 5D.11

Kenya (2)
Result 5D.12
(1) In Siaya County, the Lake Basin Development Authority (1) requested the Environment and Land court to look into the wrongful allocation of land in the Yala Swamp by the National Land Commission and the County Government of Siaya. This happened after AA Kenya&#x2019;s partner shared with them a petition against the allocation. Lake Basin Development Authority also wrote to Lake Agro ltd and National Land Commission urging them to resolve historical land injustices issues that had impacted heavily on the Yala Swamp community. Lake Basin Authority is a government organ that identifies agricultural and other investments potentials in the western part of Kenya. The community had given it the Yala Swamp to utilize and manage it on their behalf, in the early 1970s.
In 2021, the community was notified through a gazette notice of 3,700HA of land being awarded to a large-scale investor for a sugar cane plantation, constituting a massive imminent land grab. AA Kenya partner in the area and other local CSOs acted swiftly, and lodged petitions intended to stop the matter. The communities living around the swamp with the technical and financial assistance of AA Kenya petitioned the NLC and CGS demanding that they stop the award and work towards registering the swamp as community land. The petition was also shared with several government entities as interested parties like the Ministry of Agriculture, Ministry of Water, Ministry of Land and Physical Planning and the National Environment Management Authority. The community also filed a case in the environment and land court seeking for an injunction on the notice and award of the land, a prayer which the courts agreed to &#x2013; The matter commenced full hearings on 31st January 2022. AA Kenya and members of the Land Non-State Actors, (former members of the Friends of Yala) also met with the CSOs at the community level to further understand the underlying issues and develop joint campaign strategies. 

Result 5D.13
(1) In Homabay county, the county government held talks with the Sukari Industry sugarcane multinational to address various problems the company had caused for the communities in the area and to urge them to take measures to resolve these. The issues had been raised by AA Kenya&#x2019;s partner. The partner had conducted a social audit to assess this and ascertain the direct and indirect impacts of the operations of the multinational. Results showed various rights violations like directing wastewater into the nearby River Kuja, open dumping of waste, damaged roads thus hampering communities to commute, a broken bridge due to the traffic by the heavy sugarcane trucks, non-employment of local young people and in relation to the farmers, there were delays on payment, and delays to collect sugar cane after harvesting. The partner produced a report on the audit and shared it with the company and with government representatives including from the National Environmental Management Authority, Ministries of Agriculture, Youth, Roads and local administration departments, and the company. In response to the report findings and advocacy by AA Kenya&#x2019;s partner, the county government representatives held talks with the company, including on the damage to the bridge, proper waste disposal, and employment of local people. As a result, the company took various measures to address the issues. These are mentioned under outcome E. The measures were all recommendations from the social audit by the partner. The county government also repaired the bridge and this was partly funded by the company as reparation.

Uganda (1)
Result 5D.14

Zimbabwe (7, 3g)
Result 5D.15
(1) Following the Zimbabwe Alternative Mining Indaba (ZAMI) side session engagements on the 6th of October 2021 convened by ZELA and AAZ, policy makers from the Parliament (1) made commitments to push for policy and legal reforms around gemstones in line with the Precious Stones Act. They further linked the two partners with the Zimbabwe Gemstone Miner&#x2019;s Association, an association that was formed to further improvement of the gemstone industry and this made ZELA and AAZ to be the only CSO incorporated in the association. This shows that policy makers appreciate and recognise the work which is important for the project as this will allow ZELA and AAZ to engage with multiple actors in the gemstone sector. 

Result 5D.15
(2) The Parliament of Zimbabwe and Hurungwe Rural District Council committed to putting gemstones and black granite issues raised by ActionAid Zimbabwe and partner ZELA on their agenda in 2021. The Parliamentary Portfolio Committee on Mines and Mining Development (1) committed to conducting an enquiry into the mining, marketing and smuggling of gemstones from Zimbabwe, focusing on the Karoi and Hurungwe districts. The Hurungwe Rural District Council (1, g) committed to offer discounted prices for the registration of women miners in the district to ensure that more miners operate formally for improved transparency and accountability in the mining of the gemstones in the district. Further to that, they committed to set aside land for a gemstones marketing centre in Hurungwe and fight Illicit trade of gemstones which commitments were put on their official website (1g).

Result 5D.16
(2) ActionAid Zimbabwe and partner ZELA were approached by Mutoko Rural District Council (1) and Uzumba Maramba Pfungwe Rural District Council (1), a neighbour local authority who also host some quarrying companies, in September 2021 to assist them in improving their domestic resource mobilization, particularly through taxing and levying of black granite mining companies who are paying close to nothing to the local authorities. AAZ and ZELA organised a two-day engagement meeting to discuss the challenges the local authorities were facing in taxing mining companies and offer technical expertise on the best solutions they can implement. As a result of the meeting and technical support, the Rural District Councils resolved to increase and standardise their tax and levy rates to new tangible and progressive rates that have value so that they can get a fair share from the resource being mined in their area. The new taxes and rates will be reflected in their 2022 annual budget and await confirmation. Mutoko RDC further took the matter to the Minister of Finance who approved the proposals pending certain changes such as the removal of the roads levy.

Result 5D.17
(2) ActionAid Zimbabwe and partner ZELA organised the 2021 Gender and Extractives Symposium, and discussions were continued later in the year during the Zimbabwe Alternative Mining Indaba. During these sessions, they shared recommendations on improving participation of women in the extractives sector. As a result, the government (1) committed to pilot the mining cadastre system recommended by AA and ZELA. The system is set to begin in the first quarter of 2022. The Parliamentary Portfolio Committee on Mines and Mining Development (1) followed the recommendation to conduct field visits to ASM sites to better understand issues related to health and safety, especially for women miners (2g).</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">Kenya (2)
Result 5F.1
(1) The Kenyan Ministry of Agriculture (1) started training and engaging young people from a youth movement to be part of their farm field support team as agricultural extension officers. This happened after AA Kenya&#x2019;s partner had linked the youth to the Ministry for a training on agroecology and climate resilient agriculture practices. The Ministry was so impressed by the young people&#x2019;s efforts that they have now been integrated into the Ministry&#x2019;s farm field support team. This is important because getting more young people involved in promoting and supporting agroecology practices is expected to increase the success of agroecology promotion and its sustainability, e.g. for resilience.

Result 5F.2
(1) In Kitui, the Department of Climate Change of the Kitui County Government (1) accelerated the launch of the Climate Change Fund, that was set up in 2018 to provide small scale funding to climate change adaptation initiatives in the county. They also agreed to decentralize the fund, which is now operational, with pilots with the fund having started in 6 local wards, These were all recommendations from AA Kenya and partners. Moreover, the government also agreed to develop a Climate Change Policy (which they did not have up to that point) and requested AA Kenya&#x2019;s partner and the Kitui CSOs Network to take a lead role in the drafting of a County Climate Change Policy to help them better manage climate justice interventions. These were all recommendations from AA and partners. This happened after the department of climate change held a meeting with the Kitui CSOs Network on their request. It is significant that AA Kenya&#x2019;s partners have now been requested to participate in the development of the County Climate Change Policy, as this will help ensure that climate change adaptation projects integrate the interests and needs of the affected communities on the ground, e.g. in terms of resilient livelihoods. These outcomes are the result of a training that AA Kenya undertook with the Kitui CSOs network on National Adaptation Plans on Climate Change, where one of their action points was to request for the implementation of the fund. Kitui is among the areas in Kenya most heavily affected by climate change impacts and has been dealing with droughts and famine over the past two years, impacting heavily on poor communities/households dependent on livestock raising and subsistence farming.

Zimbabwe (2)
Result 5F.3
(2) The Zimbabwe Miners Federation (ZMF) and the Zimbabwe School of Mines (ZSM) have committed to developing the country&#x2019;s first Gemology and Lapidary course as a result of engagements with ActionAid Zimbabwe and partner ZELA during the Alternative Mining Indaba. This course will allow for studying and improving the gemstones value chain, to make it more sustainable and fairer.</narrative>

Result 6E.1 (practice change)
(1) As a result of the advocacy and the social audit undertaken by AA Kenya&#x2019;s partner in the areas of operations of a company (see under result 5D), the company (1) has started to address the issues raised in the audit report and some of them in a structural manner. In line with the recommendations from the social audit, in 2021, the company installed a system for proper waste disposal instead of open dumping of sugar cane waste as they used to do. They have started to hire locals, thus improving the household income levels in the community. They have also started collecting sugar cane from the farmers timelier after harvesting and paying the farmers in time. 

Result 6E.2 (practice change)
(1) In Taita Taveta, a foreign mining company (1) prospecting for manganese mining has taken measures to address issues raised by the community in the mining area in 2020 (under FGG-II). At that time, AA Kenya&#x2019;s partner had set up a meeting between mining firms, the mining department at the County and CSOs to deliberate on the perennial issues related to the mining company&#x2019;s operations, including regarding environmental violations, land grabs and forced evictions, working conditions and lack of integration of artisanal miners. The company committed to improving on such matters. In 2021, the partner undertook a social audit with the community, to assess progress on the company&#x2019;s commitments. The social audit demonstrated that the mining company has taken steps to address the issues raised and improve their living and working conditions. The mining company has started constructing houses and providing water amongst other things. The company has also agreed on a resettlement package for those to be displaced. In addition, the community is now shareholder in the company through a community owned organization. The mining firm is yet to install dust arresters once operations begin and purchase and ambulance as part of the agreement that they had with the host community. AA Kenya&#x2019;s partner mediated between the company and the community. ActionAid supported the partner with activity funding.</narrative>

(1) As a result of ActionAid Zimbabwe and partner ZELA&#x2019;s trainings and workshops on Business and Human Rights, communities are now knowledgeable and capacitated to demand and assert their rights. The empowered community of Mutoko through environmental monitors and the paralegal stopped a Quarry Mining Company in Mutoko from operating without an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) in March 2021 because it was disrupting people&#x2019;s livelihoods and causing land degradation close to their homes. The Company then complied to the Environmental Management Act and carried out EIA consultations in the community and properly acquired an EIA addressing the communities&#x2019; concerns.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">In the first year of FGG-III, ActionAid continued to structurally integrate learning and knowledge exchange between all partners in the programme. Representatives from ActionAid in AA&#x2019;s five FGG-III focus countries (Bangladesh, Guatemala, Kenya, Uganda and Zimbabwe) as well as in the Netherlands met bimonthly to jointly discuss emerging opportunities and threats from the changing context, programme risks and mitigation strategies, promising new approaches as well as policy priorities. In 2021, at the start of FGG-III, ActionAid together with partners organized a session to reflect on the key successes and lessons from FGG-II, as the FGG-III programme builds on the achievements of the previous programme. We discussed key successes in defending communities&#x2019; and women&#x2019;s land rights and in holding corporates accountable, amongst other things. Throughout the year, we have also mutually shared information and learned jointly e.g., on women&#x2019;s land rights, the links between land rights, land use and climate resilience, on the Energy Charter Treaty and its expansion to the Global South, and on UNBT and national advocacy strategies.</narrative>

These learning sessions (both cross-country and country level) will among other things be focused on Land Rights (with special focus on women&#x2019;s land rights and internationally agreed standards such as the VGGTs and FPIC): the UN Binding Treaty process  the Energy Charter Treaty expansion process and risks for countries associated with accession to the Treaty  the ActionAid international Campaign on Climate and Agriculture  and on Tax Justice. For many of these learning sessions  the purpose includes knowledge exchange for shared learning  adapting our plans and strategies based on our exchanges  but also joint reflection on the programme and how we can strengthen our work based on our joint analysis.</narrative>

In 2021, we updated our gender analysis for our work on social safeguards in corporate investment policies, and on social and environmental impacts of large-scale investments including in agribusiness/plantations, extractives and energy infrastructure projects (such as power plants), amongst other things. Our work promoting social and environmental safeguards of corporate operations and for mandatory human rights due diligence policies and a UN Binding Treaty continued to highlight the importance of using a gender lens in such work.

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">In 2021 (as in earlier years), the FGG programme was primarily built upon the expressed needs of our partner organisations and/or on the challenges and opportunities they have identified. This way of working goes well beyond involving or consulting with local groups. Our approach is rather to facilitate for people affected by social injustice to organize and advocate for their rights, themselves. We work with AA offices in Bangladesh, Guatemala, Kenya, Uganda and Zimbabwe and their partners (CSOs, CBOs and community groups) which are strongly rooted in the communities we support. Therefore, they have a key role in defining the ways in which communities are supported and we ensure not only local ownership but local leadership. ActionAid works bottom up and follows the priorities of these local constituents in the design of local and national level programmes. In 2021, all countries built on the track record from FGG-II, supporting communities affected by large scale investments (in mining, agribusiness, energy projects) to advocate for their rights and for remedy in cases where these rights have been violated. We collaborated with these partners to shed light on local cases in research publications as well as in lobby meetings in which partners participated directly including in international policymaking fora and lobby meetings targeting national or local decision makers.</narrative>

We will continue to mobilize and facilitate the organization of community groups in e.g. in Bangladesh  where the setting up of over 90 Community Land Rights groups in FGG-2 was a highly successful strategy to engage vulnerable communities affected by large scale energy infrastructure projects and support them to take center stage in advocating for their rights. In Kenya and Uganda too  we will continue our work with community and women&#x2019;s groups on land rights and support community- and women-led advocacy for land and other rights. In e.g. Guatemala  some communities will receive additional training for enhanced mobilization and participation e.g. in (inter)national decision-making spaces  and other communities will start being involved in the FGG programme to lobby and advocate for their own rights.</narrative>

Result 3.1
(3) The CTM (a network consisting of women representing 20 communities) (1), Movement of communities in Defence of the Water (1) and CONGCOOP (1) put their strengthened lobby and advocacy capacities into practise by lobbying towards the Ombudsman for Human Rights (specifically, to the Ombudsman for Indigenous Women) and towards the Community Development Council (COCODE / local authority) to raise awareness about the gendered impacts they face as a result of the palm oil plantations in the region, such as contamination of water sources. Their strengthened capacities include the increased knowledge on gendered impacts in the region, how to define and prioritize the problems women face, and how to get in contact with these high level institutions in Guatemala.. The Ombudsman visited the region in April and the Ombudsman&#x2019;s team visited the region three more times. Before CTM became active, the perspectives of women were not taken into account as local authorities are mainly embodied by men. ActionAid Guatemala, through its implementing and strategic partner CONGCOOP, organized trainings for CTM and Movement of communities in Defence of the Water to make women aware of their rights and promoting their participation at all levels of governance.5

(1) Feminists for a Binding Treaty (1) and ActionAid Guatemala lobbied towards the Guatemalan delegation in Geneva and were invited for a meeting after they shared their gendered recommendations to improve the UNBT text and to integrate women&#x2019;s and indigenous rights. Unfortunately, due to a lack of time the meeting was canceled. This advocacy was a result of joint strategizing meetings, also together with other Guatemalan CSOs, which improved their knowledge on the UNBT draft text and how this should be improved. Together they wrote down the gendered recommendations which are used for lobby and advocacy (1g)

Netherlands (2)
Result 3.2
(2) ActionAid South Africa and MACUA/WAMUA used their increased knowledge on gendered impacts in the manganese supply chain and their increased access to relevant stakeholders as a result of the joint research with ActionAid Netherlands and SOMO to engage with local duty bearers and with mining companies on the need for gender-responsive due diligence. In addition, they also used the results of the research to advocate for the need of Free, Prior and Informed Consent within the Minerals and Petroleum Resource Development Act in South Africa.

(1) AA Kenya&#x2019;s partner undertook various actions against an imminent land grab in the area. The organisation wrote to the Ministry of Education to express concerns and request for information about the students at a primary school, which was under threat of demolition as the land it sits on is under threat of grabbing. The ministry responded with a letter providing information on the number of students, the school&#x2019;s performance, and number of deployed government teachers which the partner has been using for further campaigns against the land grab plans. The partner also lobbied the Environment and Land Committee of the Taita Taveta County Assembly and the local minister in charge of land in Taita Taveta County, which led to these actors visiting for a fact-finding mission in the area. ActionAid supported the partner through joint strategizing and networking and with activity funding, amongst other things. 

Result 3.4
(1) AA Kenya&#x2019;s partner, together with an association representing the communities in the area (1), filed a petition in court against salt firms that had caused various types of injustice in their area of operations. When the salt firms organized community meetings to advocate against the court petition filed, the community members whose capacity had been built by AA Kenya&#x2019;s partner were able to articulate the real issues and defend the petition, and the salt firms stopped these community meetings. The litigation process seeks to address a variety of injustices due to the operations of the salt companies over the years, such as land grabs, forced eviction, blocking access to beaches, denying fishermen access to landing sites, and environmental violations including air pollution, pollution of fresh water sources, and destroying natural fish breeding sites. The community is supported in this process by the partner through trainings, joint strategizing, and hands-on advice. The community indicated that it is because of their constant engagement with AA Kenya and the partner that they have the knowledge and capacity to speak out against the injustices caused by the salt firms and to defend their rights. 

Result 3.5
(2) AA&#x2019;s partner (1) supported a CSO network in Kitui (1) to start a conversation with the County Government and requested the implementation of the County Climate Fund, which the County Government accepted to do. See the result description under Outcome Indicator 6F. AA Kenya&#x2019;s support to the partner throughout the year included joint strategizing, knowledge exchange, and activity funding.

Result 3.6
(3) With support from AA Kenya, several local organizations (2) worked with communities in one of the implementing areas (1) to address a threat of a massive land grab through a deal between the county government and a multinational agribusiness company intending to set up a sugarcane plantation in the area. AA Kenya&#x2019;s support included joint strategizing, knowledge exchange, and activity funding. See the description under outcome indicator 5D.

Result 3.7
(4) In Kilifi, after an interactive radio talk shows with a local radio station, AA Kenya&#x2019;s partner have been able to assist four communities who had called during the shows to establish their respective community land management committees (CLMCs) after identifying their lands as community land together with an officer from the lands department of the County Government of Kilifi. The CLMCs are structures that help in the management of community lands on behalf of the wider community. They are selected and or elected by the community as guided in the Community Land Act, 2016. The CLMCs will be instrumental in the registration of these community lands and their subsequent management. Registration of community lands is vital for protecting these &#x2018;commons&#x2019; against land grab. With the Kenyan Community Land Act 2016, registration of community lands is now possible. The challenge, however, is in the implementation of the law as it requires communities to obtain formal recognition of their land as &#x2018;community land&#x2019; in a county register (to be submitted to the Ministry), which the county governments have been slow in preparing. AA Kenya and partners support communities in making use of these legal provisions, that will help safeguard their rights. 

Result 3.8
(2) Two communities (2) that were trained by AA Kenya&#x2019;s partner on their request have formed community land management committees (CLMCs) and have written demand letters to the Ministry of Land and Physical Planning for their lands to be registered as community lands. This happened after AA Kenya&#x2019;s partner and respective communities identified five unrecognised community lands as a follow up to two successful road shows raising awareness on community land and provisions in Kenyan land law to protect such lands. These five unrecognised community lands might have otherwise been left out of the county community land inventory and thus target for land grabs in future. The CLMCs are structures that help in the management of community lands on behalf of the wider community. They are selected and or elected by the community as guided in the Community Land Act, 2016. A government surveyor has already been sent to site for fact finding and establishment of boundaries to aid this process. One of the other committees formed have petitioned the environment and land committee of the Senate for their land to be included into the county register of community land. They are also under threat of land grab and evictions.

Result 3.9
(0) In Kitui, AA Kenya&#x2019;s partner conducted an audit on corporate conduct by the iron mining companies in the area and produced a report that will be used to advocate against human rights violations at the mining sites and for better working conditions and legal and policy compliance in their mining operations. The partner trained 45 people and 15 were selected to conduct the social audit. The report pointed at the lack of compensation for landowners displaced and dispossessed by the mine and not filling holes left after extraction. The report also indicated the need for licensing as well as training and capacity building for artisanal miners, including on mining skills, awareness of relevant legal frameworks and on advocacy skills.

Uganda (10)
Result 3.10
(1) In 2021, human rights defenders and community members from an indigenous community (1) used new approaches in advocating for the rights of indigenous communities including pursuing legal aid to get back their land. In a training by ActionAid&#x2019;s partner, they gained knowledge about protecting the rights of HRDs and land rights of indigenous people. As a result, they were able to participate in barazas (dialogues) with the Local Council Authorities and Uganda Wildlife Authority in pursuit of administrative remedies for the victims of human rights abuses and violations. The community members were violently evicted from their ancestral forest lands on several occasions in the past decades, first by the National Forest Authority and later by the Ugandan Wildlife authority. They are still living in deplorable conditions in ramshackle camps, awaiting justice. ActionAid Uganda brought the HRDs into contact with the partner and provided activity funding to the partner for the training.

Result 3.11
(6) Four communities and two women&#x2019;s groups supported by AA and partners, took various actions to peacefully resist land grab threats and/or to voice their grievances vis &#xE0; vis decision makers and corporates with regards to their land rights. The capacities they strengthened included knowledge on rights, community organizing, peaceful resistance tactics, and capacities to engage in legal and bureaucratic procedures addressing their concerns, amongst other things. This is further described under the outcomes C, D and E.

Zimbabwe (4)
Result 3.12
(1) ActionAid Zimbabwe and partner ZELA organised trainings and workshops on Business and Human Rights for communities in Mutoko and the Mutoko North Development Trust, who increased their knowledge on for example regulations regarding Environmental Impact Assessments. The community monitors confronted a mining company in Mutoko on the fact that the company operated without an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA), which led the company to comply to the Environmental Management Act and conduct a proper EIA.

Result 3.13
(1) ActionAid Zimbabwe and ZELA increased the knowledge and capacity of the Publish What You Pay Coalition by conducting and sharing a research on illicit financial flows in the gemstones sector. As a result, the Coalition used this knowledge to set up a campaign meant to make public and private stakeholders aware of how much potential revenue Zimbabwe is losing through illicit financial flows in this sector.

Result 3.14
(2) ActionAid Zimbabwe and partner ZELA worked together with two groups of women ASM miners to increase their knowledge on the legal requirements for ASM groups to register as trusts. As a result, the two groups used this knowledge to start the registration process, which is a long and extensive process with the government. Formal registration will increase the women&#x2019;s access to for example marketing and value addition services.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">Guatemala (27, 27g)
Result 2.1 
(20) ActionAid Guatemala organized community meetings, in which women from the communities in the Northern Lowlands (Guatemala) shared information on their participation in the community and knowledge about the problems they face due to activities of TNCs in the region. Women from 20 communities participated (Caser&#xED;o Sechaj, Cooperativa Sechaj, Esperancita del Rio, Bel&#xE9;n, Yalmachac, Chajmaic, Volcancito, Carolina, San Sim&#xF3;n, Santo Tom&#xE1;s Calle 3, Chinacolay, Sisbilha, San Francisco Las Mercedes, El Prado, Tezulutl&#xE1;n, Las Mercedes I, Santa Cruz, Santa Elena, El Chorro, las Mu&#xF1;ecas). The meetings also served to broaden the knowledge of women regarding advocacy actions at the local, national and international levels that has been carried out in defense of the rights of indigenous peoples and women. (20g)

Result 2.2
(1) As a result of community meetings, the Territorial Coordinator for Women (CTM) (1) is created. 91 women from 20 communities are elected as representatives in territorial coordination. The communities decided to choose more than two representatives per community to be able to rotate participation in the discussion spaces, so more women get involved in the processes. This is a result of community meetings organized by ActionAid Guatemala, during which the participants were motivated to participate in the elections to become territorial coordinator. (1g)

Result 2.3
(3) Together with the Territorial Coordinator for Women (CTM), the organization Marm&#xE1; Maquin (1), the women of the Committee of Peasant Unity (CUC) (1) and of the Social and Popular Assembly (ASP) (1) strengthened their and exchanged strategies regarding knowledge on participation in community business, women&apos;s rights, organization, advocacy and political participation. This is a result of five workshops and community meetings organized by women of the CTM and AA Guatemala. (3g)

Result 2.4
(3) Together with Feminists for a Binding Treaty (1), Fundaci&#xF3;n Guillermo Toriello (FGT) (1), CONGCOOP (1) and CTM, ActionAid Guatemala organized joint strategizing meetings to mutually increase their capacity for advocating for a Feminist UNBT. They wrote key, gendered, recommendations on how to improve the treaty text considering women&apos;s and indigenous rights. As a result, Feminists for a Binding Treaty (1) and ActionAid Guatemala were invited for a meeting with the Guatemalan delegation in Geneva after they shared their recommendations. Unfortunately, due to a lack of time the meeting was canceled. (3g)

Netherlands (18, 15g)
Result 2.5
(13) In September 2021, ActionAid Netherlands organized a capacity strengthening webinar about the UN Binding Treaty on Business and Human Rights for ActionAid staff and partners. More than 45 persons participated, including representatives from 19 ActionAid offices and CSO partners from Africa, Asia and Latin America (of which we count 13 because of double counting - ActionAid Zambia, ActionAid Zimbabwe, ActionAid Ethiopia, ActionAid Guatemala, ActionAid Ghana, PODER, SISWACHI, OFRANEH, Asociacion de Mujeres Madre Tierra, GAWU, CONDEG, CEHRO, Initiative for Right View). In this meeting, all gained a deeper understanding of a gender-responsive UN Binding Treaty on Business and Human Rights negotiation process, discussed civil society positions on the elaboration of a Binding Treaty and exchanged feminist ways to get engaged in this process at the national, regional and international level (13g).

Result 2.6
(3) In 2021, ActionAid Bangladesh, Uganda, and Kenya improved their understanding of the negative impacts of the Energy Charter Treaty and its potential expansion to the Global South as well as strengthened their constituency/network with CSOs working on this topic. They did this by engaging on a platform on the ECT newly established by AA NL &amp; TNI linking CSOs across the world to facilitate knowledge exchange and joint strategizing on the topic. It was the first time that ActionAid engaged in the topic. Through these initial exchanges, ActionAid in Bangladesh, Kenya, the Netherlands and Uganda are now linked to civil society organisations across the world campaigning on the topic. The current platform includes organisations from inside and outside FGG in Europe, Africa, Asia and Latin America. As a result of knowledge sharing and joint strategizing, organisations in countries including in Bangladesh and Kenya have for the first-time developed action plans to start advocacy work in their countries to generate awareness both with policy makers and in civil society on the risks for their country associated with accession to the Treaty. At the time of writing, research projects as a basis for advocacy and awareness raising work in the first half of 2022 are under way for AA in Bangladesh, Uganda and Kenya (3). This is significant, as so far, the Energy Charter Treaty and its expansion agenda were little known in the countries in the platform. At the same time, the ECT expansion process poses serious risks for candidate countries, including in terms of their ability to address e.g. negative impacts of energy related infrastructure projects or to take climate action in the future. AA&#x2019;s contribution has been to organize workshops, jointly strategize, share information and provide small scale activity funding for ActionAid&#x2019;s partners in Bangladesh, Kenya and Uganda (possible double counting TNI).

Result 2.7
(2) ActionAid South Africa and MACUA/WAMUA strengthened their research capacities and knowledge on the manganese supply chain, as well as their access to relevant stakeholders in the supply chain, as a result of joint research conducted with ActionAid Netherlands and SOMO. Specifically, they learned more about the gendered impacts of manganese mining and the need for gender-responsive due diligence (2g).

Kenya (21, 17g, 8x)
Result 2.8
(21) In 2021, 13 CSOs, 7 communities and 1 CBO including women&#x2019;s groups, spread across five counties, have been able to strengthen their awareness, knowledge and advocacy skills regarding women&#x2019;s land rights through various AAIK activities and activities of partners incl. training and joint planning and strategizing sessions. Some of these groups were reached for the first time with information on women&#x2019;s land rights. As a result, women&#x2019;s and widows&#x2019; organisations created networks to support each other, and to collect data on women&#x2019;s land property rights and customary practices that marginalize them. Organizations benefited also through networking support and linking them to other key organizations and networks in the Kenyan CSOs movement.

Uganda (18, 1g, 15x)
Result 2.9
(1) One community (1) strengthened their access to the legal system while taking further steps in the legal process addressing a massive land grab case from 2001, where the focus is now on completing the legal documents required to finally obtain their financial compensation. The compensation is yet to be obtained from the Government for their land that had been forcefully grabbed by a foreign investor to establish a coffee plantation. The community was supported in the legal process by ActionAid Uganda and a local partner. AAU facilitated for the communities to attend the court sessions and further facilitated the lawyers from the partner organisation to attend the court sessions and represent the community.

Result 2.10 a
(2) One community (1) strengthened their petition writing skills and drafted a petition with key asks from the Government to resolve their sustained problems related to land grab. They were supported by ActionAid and its partner. AAU facilitated the community members to attend the meetings and further got a translator to explain the recommendations from the findings in their own language. In addition, ActionAid supported the partner organisation with activity funding. 

In 2021, ActionAid&#x2019;s partner also trained leaders of a community on non-violent resistance actions as they deal with longstanding land grab issues, both caused historically, as an effect of the Ugandan civil war when they became internally displaced, and more recently, when an investor wrongfully obtained a part of their lands for a hunting reserve. The cultural leaders (1) were also supported to have dialogues between them to address land disputes in relation to this conflict.

Result 2.11
(6x) Three communities, two women&#x2019;s groups and one group of cultural leaders were also directly supported by AAU and its partner in community based awareness raising and training sessions on land rights, international guidelines for land rights such as the Free Prior and Informed Consent criterium, on how to organize, how to peacefully resist land grab threats on collecting evidence and how to advocate for their rights to be respected by the government and corporations.

Result 2.12
(1x) Sugarcane plantation farmers (1x) were supported by ActionAid&apos;s partner through a training on the UN binding treaty on Business and Human rights, in particular the 3 principles of the state duty to protect human rights, corporate responsibility to respect human rights and access remedy for victims of business-related abuses. AA funded the partner to carry out the activity.

Result 2.13
(1x) The Tax Justice Alliance (1x) was supported through activity funding of AA&#x2019;s partner including for a training on various tax laws and policies which equipped with the tax justice alliance members with knowledge to develop new activities related to Domestic Revenue Mobilisation.

Result 2.14
(4x) A civil society group (1x) took part in the Land Awareness Week where they gained knowledge to provide legal aid to communities and groups affected by land rights violations and further carrying out fact finding missions in relation to such land cases. AAU supported three partners as part of the land actors by funding some of their activities attending the conference as well as by joint strategizing and exchanging information.

Result 2.15
(3x) Three partners of ActionAid Uganda (3x) strengthened various advocacy related skills through their participation in FGG in 2021. These included strategic planning and networking. ActionAid Uganda also provided small-scale activity funding throughout the year.

Zimbabwe (5, 3g)
Result 2.16
(1) ActionAid Zimbabwe and partner ZELA organised trainings and workshops on Business and Human Rights for communities in Mutoko and the Mutoko North Development Trust, who increased their knowledge on for example regulations regarding Environmental Impact Assessments.

Result 2.17
(1) ActionAid Zimbabwe and partner ZELA jointly organised a number of meetings and workshops for a wide range of stakeholders from the gemstone and black granite sectors. Through these meetings, ActionAid and ZELA (1) increased their knowledge and capacity on the issues in both sectors and especially the gendered dimensions (1g). 

Result 2.18
(2) ActionAid Zimbabwe and partner ZELA organised meetings and exchanged knowledge with two groups of women ASM miners to increase their knowledge on the benefits and the legal requirements for ASM groups to register as trusts (2g).

Result 2.19
(1) ActionAid Zimbabwe and ZELA increased the knowledge and capacity of the Publish What You Pay Coalition by conducting and sharing a research on illicit financial flows in the gemstones sector.</narrative>
