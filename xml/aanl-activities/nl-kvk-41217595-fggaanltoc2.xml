AA NL did this through co-writing of the food security chapter of Ready for Change report, in which alternative approaches for the Dutch government and EU to support food security and the right to food in the context of SDGs were proposed, based on work of AA in LLMICs on climate resilient sustainable agriculture (1).</narrative>

We promoted this through dissemination of the documentation among Dutch government officials, the general public and in international fora as a key alternative strategy to build resilience (1). With financial support from ActionAid the Netherlands, ActionAid International developed a report on &#x201C;Principles for a Just Transition in Agriculture&#x201D;, outlining how food systems can transition to agricultural methods such as agroecology and less and better meat which reduce GHGs and are more resilient to climate change, in a way that is just and inclusive for workers in the food system, based on evidence from LLMICs. The report draws from the lessons of workers&#x2019; unions in the energy sector, farmers and rural communities in LLMICs and was promoted at COP26 climate negotiations in Madrid in December through advocacy, meetings, side events and media work (1).</narrative>

Women under the banner of Kilimanjaro Initiative will be supported to take stock of progress in realizing the rural women&#x2019;s demands and develop a comprehensive framework for monitoring the implementation of the county and national Women&#x2019;s demands. As a result we anticipate that the women&apos;s inputs will be discussed by governments, media, and/or CSOs. Netherlands (4): - Synthesis of promising alternatives from ActionAid experience and beyond (agroecology, smallholder irrigation, resilience and women-led responses) will be presented in policy development exchange platforms, particularly on food, agriculture, climate and emergencies. - ActionAid will promote the importance of land rights in climate, food and agricultural policies with concrete proposals, such as based on climate-land paper of ActionAid and other CSOs, towards relevant ministries, parliament and media. (From the various proposals we plan to make towards different actors/platforms as part of the activities above, we expect that at least 4 will actually be discussed).</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">Kenya (1): ActionAid Kenya and national level partners collaborated with the Kenyan government to develop the framework for implementation of women&#x2019;s rights to land, as a result of which the government has included questions pertaining to women&#x2019;s rights to land in the 2019-2029 census&#x2019; questionnaire. This will help to fill existing data gaps at the national level in relation to land holding patterns and tenure security (1). Mozambique (2): Together with partners, ActionAid Mozambique organised a conference with the theme of &#x2018;Expanding Voices, Strengthening the Movement of Rural Women for the Defense of the land, Natural Resources and Seeds&#x2019;. More than 100 women from all over Mozambique attended. The Rural Women Charter was finalised at the meeting, and handed over to and discussed by the local government (1). ActionAid Mozambique and its partner developed three policy briefs with proposals for changes in land and investment related laws, such as the inclusion of FPIC principles and the removal of barriers to women&#x2019;s access to land. The policy briefs were put on the agenda of the Parliament (1). NL (9): In the EU, ActionAid Netherlands contributed to the IPES-food process (IPES-food is a think tank headed by Olivier De Schutter) geared at elaborating a scorecard of what needs to be done to transit to a sustainable food and farming system in Europe. As a consequence, the external dimension (impacts on small-scale food producers in developing countries) is reflected in the outcome document. We also played an important role to avoid that the EU trade policy will be seen as a tool to force partner countries to produce food sustainably, and rather put the focus on the need to stop the detrimental impacts of the EU trade policy on the right to food in the Global South (1). In the EU, ActionAid Netherlands had a very significant impact on the draft position of the European Parliament with regards to the aid budget as many of our suggestions for amendments were tabled, with regards to a.o. references to relevant human rights instruments on corporate accountability, stronger reporting and accountability, need for development impact, a focus on local private sector, cooperatives and MSMEs, etc. (1). The Ministry of Foreign Affairs&#x2019; new Aid &amp; Trade policy acknowledges the negative impact of trade agreements and corporate human rights violations on women, thanks to ActionAid Netherlands&#x2019; lobbying efforts together with WO=MEN (1). Jointly with WO=MEN and other FGG members ActionAid Netherlands wrote a letter to minister Kaag about how to better integrate gender into her trade policy. As a response, meetings took place with high level officials to discuss these suggestions. In addition we were invited to give a presentation to ca 25 heads of economic affairs at Dutch embassies on integrating gender in their work (2). ActionAid Netherlands shared proposals with various MPs on the issue of gender and trade. Our input was brought up during a committee meeting on trade facilitation by Groenlinks and PvdA MPs (2). As a result Minister Kaag pledged that gender would be included in the new trade policy, and announced that the Netherlands would be organizing a conference on gender and trade (1). However, the trade policy as well as the conference were disappointing, and the proposed change did not come to fruition. ActionAid Netherlands had meetings with the trade department at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, where we were able to draw attention to our specific gender recommendations. The new trade policy made reference to trade and gender, but we will engage further to make the measures more ambitious (1).</narrative>

As a result ActionAid Kenya anticipates that the Charter of Demands on women&#x2019;s land, property, and natural resources rights will be discussed by county and national governments, media, CSOs (1). Mozambique (2): Two Ministries will place a proposal on their agendas to implement FPIC/VGGT in public and private investment processes, as a result of case studies on human rights violations related to large-scale investments, produced by ActionAid Mozambique (2). Netherlands (9): &#x2022; ActionAid Netherlands will develop two policy briefs with proposals on the nexus between land, right to food/agroecology, climate, resilience and women&#x2019;s rights, building on evidence and experiences of ActionAid and partners in LLMICs. We will share the policy briefs and we expect that they will be discussed by policy makers and social movements/NGOs (4). &#x2022; ActionAid Netherlands will develop policy proposals on gender just and development friendly climate action,working together with AAI and partners in LLMICs. We will share those with the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the new Minister of Climate, Parliament and media. We expect that two of those four actors will actually discuss it (2). &#x2022; The Dutch government will discuss policy proposals on the SDGs, inclusiveness and the policy coherence action plan that ActionAid will develop, partly based on evidence and experiences in LLMICs (1). &#x2022; In the context of Dutch and international policy processes (e.g. WTO, Commission on the Status of Women), the Dutch government will discuss ActionAid&#x2019;s policy proposals for gender just trade and investment policies (1).</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">Kenya (10): ActionAid Kenya discussed the proposals from the charter of demands related to women&#x2019;s land rights with the Ministry of Lands and Physical Planning (1) and the National Land Commission (1) during meetings of the national Multi-Stakeholder platform on women&#x2019;s rights to land. At the county level, with representatives of four different counties (4) they also discussed their proposal to install multi-stakeholder platforms on women&#x2019;s rights to land on the county level (6). ActionAid Kenya participated in a documentation research of violations against HRDs, set up by ActionAid and the University of New York. The documentary that was produced was used during events on Human Rights Day in Taita Taveta. After seeing the documentary, a senior police officer in the County pledged his support for the protection of HRDs and requested a copy of the documentary to share with other police chiefs (1). ActionAid Kenya partnered with BBC London to document women&#x2019;s land rights work. The documentation was aired on BBC&#x2019;s national programme The She Word and formed the basis for discussions in the programme on women&#x2019;s land rights in a number of countries (1). ActionAid Kenya&#x2019;s partners Ujeri Uhumike CBO and Taita Taveta Human Rights Watch organized two forums for a range of stakeholders to influence their support for the implementation of the framework on women&#x2019;s land rights. As a result of discussions during these forums, the Kishushe county mining officer(1) realized the importance of women&#x2019;s land rights and drafted requests for mining licenses for two women mining groups. Also, Alternative Dispute Resettlement Committees committed to exercising more care for women&#x2019;s issues when handling land disputes (2). Mozambique (2): During a workshop organized by ActionAid Mozambique&#x2019;s partner ASCUT, representatives from civil society and agribusiness companies discussed ASCUT&#x2019;s proposals to improve five key policies related to the agricultural sector to make them more beneficial for communities (2). The Netherlands (18): ActionAid Netherlands&#x2019; proposals for a gender-just economic and trade system were put on the agenda of media, after Trouw published an ActionAid Netherlands editorial (1). Euro parliamentarians discussed the proposals of ActionAid Netherlands and ActionAid EU on the inclusion of gender-just mechanisms in trade agreements, including agreements with LLMICs, during bilateral meetings (1). The Dutch Ministries of Foreign Affairs (1) and Agriculture, Nature and Food (1) reduced their resistance to agroecology and accepted to get in a dialogue with CSOs, partly as a result of ActionAid Netherlands&#x2019; lobby on the topic. They expressed to support agroecology as one of the innovative practices that should co-exist with other practices. Based on our lobby with other CSOs they accepted to organize a lunch lecture on agroecology at the Ministry (2). During the Madrid COP25 ActionAid Netherlands&#x2019; proposals for a just transition in agriculture were discussed by influential NGOs and unions at a special meeting hosted by trade unions to share and discuss the report findings (1). Several policymakers at the COP25 negotiations on agriculture alluded to the need for just transition principles to be applied in agriculture sector, and privately thanked ActionAid for the report&#x2019;s contribution to advance thinking in this area (1). The proposals also received media (1) coverage (3). The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Special Report on Land reflected ActionAid&#x2019;s advocacy on policy coherence, climate action to reduce GHGs and strengthen resilience in the agriculture and land sector and the importance of securing women&#x2019;s land rights to strengthen investment in sustainable and resilient land management, as a result of ActionAid Netherlands&#x2019; and partners from LLMICs influencing civil society networks, engaging with scientists, and inputting on IPCC report drafts (1). This resulted in the coverage in several high-profile media (1) (New York Times, Reuters, AFP) of ActionAid&#x2019;s proposals on policy coherence, climate action and women&#x2019;s land rights (2). During the COP25 three government coalitions (Least Developed Countries group, African Group of Negotiators, Alliance of Small Island States) discussed ActionAid&#x2019;s proposals on policy coherence, particularly on loss and damage in LLMICs. One of ActionAid&#x2019;s key demands is that those having caused the climate crisis should pay for (finance) loss and damage in LLMICs (3). ActionAid Netherlands successfully lobbied the UNFCCC secretariat to invite women smallholder farmers to give keynote speeches about their experiences and recommendations at two key workshops on agriculture held at the Bonn Climate Change Conference (SB50) and COP25 under the Koronivia Joint Work on Agriculture (KJWA) negotiations. At the SB50 workshop on soils, and the COP25 workshop on soil nutrients and fertilisers, women farmers from Zambia and Malawi recounted their experience of how chemical fertilisers had weakened soils and water carrying capacity, leaving them with lower yields in times of reduced rainfall, and how composting, agroecology and gender-responsive policies and services can strengthen community resilience (2). ActionAid Netherlands&#x2019; proposal to end subsidies for fertilizers was adopted by the civil society Climate Action Network (1), which then put it on the agenda of governments (1) during the COP26 agriculture negotiations panel discussions (2). ActionAid Netherlands&#x2019; proposal to strengthen policy coherence and support climate-impacted countries with a financing arm to address loss and damage was discussed by governments at the COP25, as a result they set up an Expert Group under the Warsaw International Mechanism (WIM) looking into the financing of loss and damage, in which governments will discuss possible solutions to enable finance for countries affected by climate-induced loss and damage (1). During the COP25 ActionAid Netherlands, other ActionAid offices, including from LLMICs, and other partners advocated for policy coherence by introducing a technical facility for loss and damage, which was then taken up by governments in the key outcomes of the COP (1).</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">Kenya (5): ActionAid&apos;s partner led women to identify gaps and recommendations for improvements in the law (legislation in the land sector including investment policies on land) leading to women&#x2019;s land rights violations. Content of the law, clarity, and roles and mandate of institutions were identified as gaps. These issues were discussed by 3 area Members of County Assembly, area Member of Parliament and 20 community members in a breakfast meeting called by ActionAid&apos;s partner. They further discussed the issues with the National Land Commission in Nairobi as a follow up on a report of review of grants and dispossession of titles done in early 2016 by National Land Commission. Netherlands: (4) Proposals for making climate policies and action gender and human rights proof have been discussed by media and government bodies through an op-ed on Joop, as well as conversations with MinFA and Economic Affairs/ climate department and parliament, where southern colleague presented recommendations on adaptation funding, the centre of excellence, loss and damage and gender. This also contributed to a motion in parliament on pro-poor climate adaptation, something AA also raised in parliamentary inputs for the budget discussions (eg linking SDG1 and leaving no one behind to climate and other policies). (1) AA NL has supported other Dutch CSOs (incl MD) to influence parliamentary debates on biofuels to ensure further outphasing of land-based biofuels that lead to land grabs). Two joint letters were sent resulting in more attention to this issue and the adoption of a motion calling for a cap of 5% and outphasing palm oil and soy . We met with 3 Ministries on biofuels in order to ensure good implementation of ILUC (indirect land use changes) commitments in NL and phasing-out of biofuels from food after 2020 and exchanged emails with MEPs ahead of the EP vote in November. (1) SDGs: adopteer SDG and feedback to SDG monitoring of the Dutch government and input to parliamentary discussion in response to PCD reporting &#x2013; both via Partos and directly - included several proposals how to do this better. A motion to do SDG test was adopted as a result of the partos and Building Change lobby that AA supported. (1). We shared and discussed several proposals on food and agroecology with policy makers, including our critique of Climate Smart Agriculture and reports of ActionAid and others on stronger integration of policies on climate change, land and food. Civil servants have discussed the pro&#x2019;s and cons of different terminology, which could be a result of AA raising this throughout the years (very few others doing this) and parliament (PvdD) motions that AA contributed to. (1) AA proposals on making food security programmes and PPS more inclusive, gender friendly and sustainable, have been discussed by policy makers, media and other key stakeholders during the Aid&amp;Trade debate with ViceVersa that AA co-organised (together with FGG/ Both Ends and others) and where a southern colleague and AA NL colleague presented in two panel sessions on this issue. (1) Mozambique (1): In the context of the process of creation of a new law on Agriculture, Food Security and Nutrition, ActionAid worked with partner organisations to lobby and advocate for improved policies on agricultural investments (including respecting the right to FPIC) and improved community consultation processes. A draft of the law did not adequately reflect or protect the interest of (often poor and disadvantaged) local communities affected by the investments. As a result of the advocacy efforts, the Mozambique government committed to putting in place a new comprehensive consultation process to ensure the informed participation of citizens (including local communities and especially farmers), in revising the law.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">Kenya (6): ActionAid Kenya will train 6 partner organizations to advocate and lobby on risk and security and coach them to establish community-based protection mechanisms. ActionAid Kenya supports dialogue meetings for HRDs and the National Assembly committee on security and human rights to push for the formulation of an HRDs Protection Law. Consequently, the National Assembly committee on security and human rights will develop a Law for the protection of HRDs (6). Mozambique (12): ActionAid Mozambique&#x2019;s partner organisations will train representatives of 12 women&#x2019;s associations on legislation in the area of land. These associations already lobby and advocate for improved policies related to trade and investment, and it is expected that they will use the knowledge gained in the trainings to further improve these activities (12). Netherlands (10): &#x2022; ActionAid Netherlands will support ActionAid country offices in LLMICs in documenting alternatives, such as right to food/agroecology, as well as in the area of trade, investment and gender, which can be used in advocacy activities. We expect 2 ActionAid partners re. food/ agroecology (for example Kenya and Cambodia) and 2 re. trade/investment (for example Nigeria and Bangladesh) to take this up and actually use the documentation in their lobby and advocacy activities (4). &#x2022; ActionAid Netherlands will support the global ActionAid platform and federation work (20 CSOs) on climate justice, as well as share lessons learnt from our work on a just transition, which will enhance knowledge, skills and network for lobby of various ActionAid partners. We expect 4 of these CSOs in LLMICs to use this in advocacy (4). &#x2022; ActionAid will facilitate contacts and access for southern CSOs working on gender and trade via Dutch government (processes) as part of our global campaign on women&#x2019;s rights and participation in international processes (e.g. WTO, CSW), which helps their lobby. The global campaign includes 30 partners, but 2 are expected to benefit and use this (2). &#x2022; Partners in LLMICs will increase the amount and effectiveness of their advocacy and communications work as a result of joint advocacy and communication strategy development with ActionAid Netherlands (no specific target). &#x2022; ActionAid will share developments on SDGs and monitoring mechanisms with partners, which helps their work in using the SDG framework more strategically to lobby for better policies (not sure if used in advocacy yet in 2019; so no target).</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">Kenya (6): ActionAid Kenya trained its 6 partner organisations (Ujeri Uhumike CBO, TTHRW, CHRCE, MRF, IWN, KFA) to advocate and lobby on risk and security and coached them to establish community-based protection mechanisms. As a result, the partner organizations advocated for an HRD Protection Law to be put in place by the National Assembly Committee on Security and Human rights (6). Mozambique (23): ActionAid Mozambique&#x2019;s partners NADEC and CODESA trained representatives of 21 Women&#x2019;s Farmer Associations and representatives of 2 Agrarian Monitoring Committees on legislation around land and investments. As a result of these trainings, the organizations are now advocating with local governments for better implementation of the Land Law, trade and investment policies, for investors accountability and corporate social responsibility within communities. The Monitoring Committees are also actively monitoring agricultural investments in the Mocuba and Manhi&#xE7;a districts (23). The Netherlands (19): 4 CSOs (ActionAid Malawi, Senegal, Nepal, Ghana) undertook meetings with government, response to consultations, capacity building workshops with government, policy briefing documents, and training and joint advocacy with civil society networks, to advocate to their national governments, climate institutions and civil society to strengthen policy coherence and implement their responsibilities under the Paris Agreement as a result of coordination, training workshops, joint strategizing, advice and feedback to strengthen knowledge and capacity on: relevant climate policy processes and opportunities to engage to leverage outcomes that benefit smallholder farmers, communities, adaptation, disaster risk reduction, agroecology, loss and damage and renewable energy, including through Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), National Adaptation Plans (NAPs), Green Climate Fund (GCF) and Africa Climate Week (ACW). The coordination, training and support was financed by ActionAid the Netherlands (4). 17 CSOs (ActionAid Bangladesh, Cambodia, India, Myanmar, Nepal, Thailand, Vanuatu, Vietnam, Burundi, Ghana, Kenya, Malawi, Nigeria, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Uganda, Zimbabwe) undertook advocacy through organizing and joining with youth and farmers&#x2019; movements for the international Climate Strike mobilizations around the UN Climate Summit in New York, as a result of capacity building workshops, advice and support which strengthened their knowledge on these topics financed by ActionAid the Netherlands (13 &#x2013; 4 are already counted in another outcome under this indicator). A Brazilian CSO representative lobbied to the Dutch World Bank Director for better Dutch investment policies that prevent land grabbing, as a result of contacts facilitated by ActionAid Netherlands, with a report on women&#x2019;s land rights defenders and a meeting with policy makers from MoFA in order to strengthen women&#x2019;s land rights, and prevent land grabbing (1). Through a blog produced and facilitated by ActionAid Netherlands, women from several CSOs from the Global South (Kenya and Malawi) lobbied to Dutch policy makers and politicians for better land governance in their respective countries, as the Dutch government is a major trade partner and donor and as such should pay attention to this issue (1).</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">Kenya (6): Through joint strategizing and training, ActionAid Kenya supported 6 partners in their efforts to strengthen the mobilization of project-affected communities and to organize them into &#x2018;collectives of people of interest&#x2019;, which successfully halted large-scale investments in two areas. Furthermore, some 21 county- and community-level forums organised by AAIK and partners raised stakeholders&#x2019; awareness of the provisions of the 2016 Community Land Act and sensitized community members on existing land laws and factors hindering women&#x2019;s rights to land, as a result of which women were included in land adjudication processes and community land management committees, while over 600 men reached directly changed their beliefs, behaviour and attitudes and eventually became champions of women&#x2019;s rights to land (6). Mozambique (41): ActionAid Mozambique and its partners trained 25 women farmer associations in two districts in land and investment related policies. As a result of these trainings, the associations were lobbying and advocating for improved policies that respect their land rights. For example, the farmer associations meet regularly with local investors, local government and CSOs in consultative processes for land acquisition to voice their main concerns regarding the Land Law and related policies (25). ActionAid Mozambique&#x2019;s partner trained 15 Agrarian Monitoring Committees on topics such as land laws, investment policies and anti-corruption policies. As a result of their increased knowledge and skills, the Committees advocated for improved trade and investment policies in their districts. For example, they try to influence the Cash Crops Price Policy to make sure the government sets the prices of crops such as sugar cane, cashew nuts and tobacco at a fair level that takes into account the costs of production (15). ActionAid Mozambique&#x2019;s partner strengthened the capacities of the 19 organizations that are part of a district-level civil society platform by providing training and network support. As a result of this support, the platform improved its lobby and advocacy activities for more inclusion in district and local decision-making processes. For example, the platform is now part of the District Consultative Committee, where they can engage directly with the government on issues such as women rights and food security (1).</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">NL (4): The new trade policy of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs explicitly states that there will be agreements on gender in new EU trade agreements. This was the result of ActionAid Netherlands&#x2019; and WO=MEN&#x2019;s lobbying of Parliament and the Ministry (1). In the new aid and trade policy minister Kaag pledged to make positive steps towards gender mainstreaming, which means gender will be considered in all elements of her policy: trade, corporate accountability, emergencies, food security, climate etc. This was a result of our lobbying efforts together with WO=MEN and Partos (1). ActionAid Netherlands was active as a part of the official Dutch delegation to the CSW62 in feeding into and shaping the CSW62 outcome document which is a tool for governments worldwide to make progress on women&#x2019;s rights. This led to the Dutch government and the EU negotiating block adopting a number of ActionAid recommendations, on land ownership and control, gender responsive public services, unpaid care work and unequal power relations. ActionAid&#x2019;s involvement contributed to a progressive outcome document (policy/declaration) (1). In the EU, with regards to regulating finance, together with other NGOs ActionAid Netherlands played an important role in the drafting of amendments to the EP position that included strong language on human rights due diligence, along with safeguards relating to indigenous communities and food security. As a result the European Parliament draft report on the &#x201C;Taxonomy&#x201D; regulation includes stronger minimum safeguards on human rights, and amendments tabled to the draft report expand on human rights even further and strengthen due diligence requirements (1).</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">Kenya (1): ActionAid will support development of laws and policies on land and extractive sector at the county level through policy analysis. In doing this, partner organisations will be supported to initiate actions that lead to development of a county investment code of conduct and promote its full implementation. We see no guaranteed results in 2018. Further, ActionAid will facilitate relevant stakeholders to generate a more binding framework for implementation of the women land rights charter. We will follow this up with strengthening rural women&#x2019;s capacity to audit/ track implementation of the charter and holding the state agencies to account. As a result we anticipate the state agencies will adopt components of the charter of demands on women&#x2019;s land, property and natural resources rights which will ensure engagement and decision-making power of civil society in future land investments. This is counted as 1. Netherlands (1): ActionAid will contribute to emphasize the importance of the annual monitoring exercise and dialogue of the government with civil society on the SDGs, with specific focus on Policy Coherence for Sustainable Development i.r.t. the right to food for women and men. With new government it is important to ensure this mechanism stays in place and improves where possible. We will therefore include it in our lobby and continue to support the PCSD and SDG efforts of other CSOs such as the Adopt an SDG initiative.</narrative>

Because the NLC was also intensively involved, their thinking was influenced and they entrenched women land rights into the comprehensive program for registration of land titles. Being an advisor to the national government on comprehensive registration of land titles throughout Kenya as per Article 67 (2)(c) of the Constitution of Kenya, the Government is obligated to implement it therewith capturing the interests of women on land (1). NL (0): ActionAid Netherlands, together with Wo=Men, Wide+ and Both ENDS pushed the Dutch government for facilitating civil society participation involvement in the Trade and Gender conference organized by the Netherlands, the WTO and the World Bank- in order to have Southern civil society voices heard and give them access to decision making. Although we were not able to ensure that there was a civil society member (from the Global South) on any of the panel discussions, we did have various interactions with the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs about this issue, and we assisted in organizing diverse civil society presence and a strategy for influencing (0).</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">Kenya (1): In 2019 state agencies will adopt components of the charter of demands on women&#x2019;s land, property and natural resources rights. This charter is a result of ActionAid efforts in facilitating multi-stakeholder processes to generate a more binding framework for the implementation of the women land rights charter and strengthening rural women&#x2019;s capacity to track implementation of the charter. ActionAid will follow this up with strengthening rural women&#x2019;s capacity to audit/ track implementation. This will ensure engagement and decision-making power of civil society in future land investments (1). Netherlands (2): &#x2022; ActionAid Netherlands will contribute to and emphasize the importance of the annual monitoring exercise and dialogue of the Dutch government with civil society (through PARTOS) on the SDGs. ActionAid will put specific focus on the importance of Policy Coherence for Sustainable Development and specific issues such as the right to food for women and men. As a result, we expect that the government will address these issues more prominently in the dialogue (1). We will also monitor and if possible contribute to the new SDG &#x2018;test&#x2019; (but no specific target here). &#x2022; ActionAid Netherlands will lobby the Dutch government to introduce a mechanism for comprehensive gender consultations during trade missions. As a result of this mechanism we foresee that gender experts and a diversity of women from different forms of work (informal, formal, unpaid, paid) and sectors (agriculture, export industry, public services) are consulted to help shape gender-just trade agreements and practice (1). &#x2022; ActionAid will continue to emphasise the importance of access to decision-making around climate, food, trade and investment for civil society and particularly women. We will particularly reach out to Dutch MPs and civil servants of different Ministries and bring in voices from Southern partners directly as well as lobby for their engagement in international fora (e.g. COP/ Climate spaces and CFS). This might not result in particular mechanisms directly (0).</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">Kenya (2): The Ministry of Lands and Physical Planning and the National Land Commission adopted components of the charter of demands on women&#x2019;s rights, property and natural resources rights. They are now leading a process of developing a new gender policy for the land sector and a new training manual on women&#x2019;s rights to land &#x2013; neither existed before. This is being done together with a new taskforce consisting of civil society organizations, including ActionAid Kenya. Through this taskforce, ActionAid Kenya has access to decision-making around women&#x2019;s rights to land (1). ActionAid Kenya developed a guide on how to establish multi-stakeholder platforms on land rights at the county level, anchored under the national Multi-Stakeholder Implementation Framework on Rural Women&#x2019;s Land Rights. They held meetings with four Counties with the aim of convincing them to establish the county-level platforms. As a result, the County of Taita Taveta put in place the platform, to coordinate planning and implementation of actions that fast track the realization of women&#x2019;s rights to land. Civil society has access to this multi-stakeholder platform (1). The Netherlands (1): The Dutch government opened up the women&#x2019;s land rights workstream of the Multi-Stakeholder Dialogue on Land to more NGOs. As a result, these NGOs now have better access to decision-making by the government, for example when it comes to policies regarding trade missions. ActionAid Netherlands lobbied for this improvement, using evidence and cases from LLMICs (1).</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">Kenya (1): ActionAid Kenya and partners will hold lobby meetings with key people and institutions who/that can fast track enactment of investment laws and community land laws and who will foster their implementation. Because of these lobby meetings, government will implement/enforce the community land act 2016 where community land committees shall be established and functional. In the committees CSOs will have slots; they will be able to influence decisions on trade and investment (1). Netherlands (3): ActionAid Netherlands will continue to emphasize the importance of access to decision-making around trade and investment for civil society and particularly women. We will particularly reach out to Dutch MPs and civil servants of different Ministries and bring in voices from Southern partners directly as well as lobby for their engagement in international fora. We expect this will result in an improved or adopted mechanism included within the action plan for Policy Coherence for Development (1). As part of the Agroecology Promotion Coalition, ActionAid Netherlands will lobby the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Agriculture, Nature and Food Quality to put in place a mechanism related to support for agroecology. While the exact format is still unclear, we expect that one of the Ministries will put in place this mechanism, and that CSOs will be able to use it to engage with the government on agroecology promotion (1). As a result of lobby by ActionAid Netherlands, the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs will improve either the Multi-Stakeholder Dialogue on Land or the Land@Scale programme to include more system approaches that link land rights, land use, agroecology and climate change adaptation and mitigation. Both mechanisms provide access for civil society to engagements with the government on issues related to land (1).</narrative>
