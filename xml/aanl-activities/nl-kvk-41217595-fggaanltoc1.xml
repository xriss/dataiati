       <narrative xml:lang="EN">AA NL (3) - The Model Mining Legislation, drafted by a consortium of non governmental and community based organizations has been promoted in meeting with Dutch policymakers as a model of how community rights can be properly reflected into legislation (1) - AA NL developed an alternative approach to current Free, Prior and Informed Consent processes by supporting the development of a FPIC training manual (AA and FAO). This manual provides an alternative approach that improves FPIC processes which enable practitioners to better protect the rights of indigenous people and ensure more inclusive decision-making around investments (1). - Recommendations and ways to jointly monitor VGGT, implement FPIC and the use of participatory action research were co-developed by AA NL and Mozambique and shared in stakeholder meetings in Netherlands and Mozambique. In Mozambique plans were developed between CSOs and government for setting up a national multi-stakeholder land rights committee to supervise and monitor VGGT &amp; FPIC &amp; involuntary resettlement compensation implementation. - 2. AA NL also supported the development of the VGGT Score Card. This is an alternative approach for assessing government land related policies. The scorecard also facilitates community based monitoring of land rights policies (including Norther policies) and can be used by CSOs as a tool for dialogue with governments (1).</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">Zambia (1): ActionAid and the 3 partners have developed guidelines for conducting interface meetings with the 3 mining companies and government to create a platform every six months as part of the social audit process to get feedback from communities. This will lead to increased women and youth participation, enhance transparency and accountability in the manner communities are engaged. This social audit is an alternative to the audits being done by the companies. Zimbabwe (1): The Zimbabwe Alternative Mining Indaba (ZAMI) will be organized by ActionAid&apos;s partner organisation and other civil society organisations. The ZAMI is an alternative platform for increased participation of often excluded but equally important stakeholders in the mining sector such as host communities and policy makers from different government departments regulating the mining sector. The declarations formulated at the ZAMI profiles the key recommendations aimed at transforming the sustainability of the sector which is also tracked and monitored by ActionAid&apos;s partner organisation. Kenya (1): ActionAid together with partner organisations will engage corporates to establish and sustain participatory community dialogue processes to develop Community Development Agreements and Environmental and Social Impact Assessments (ESIAs); and to implement such agreements jointly with County Governments and Communities. Bangladesh (1): ActionAid will support the formation of an Independent People&apos;s Commission to engage key duty bearers and monitor the compensation and rehabilitation process of the communities affected by corporations. The Independent People&#x2019;s Commission is a civil society platform comprised of community leaders, HRDs, CSOs, academics, media personnel (and other representatives of affected communities) and will, amongst other things, develop an Alternative Safeguard Framework for ensuring rights of affected communities and marginalized people are taken into account in the context of land acquisition and investment. Netherlands (1): Building on our previous work around FPIC, we will more actively promote FPIC for all communities as based on ActionAid standards defined in the AA FPIC briefing, that we will also enhance. We will explore cases that have particular strong gender aspects in order to promote gender sensitive application of FPIC in particular.(1)</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">Bangladesh (2): ActionAid Bangladesh and its partners facilitated the setting up of 4 People&#x2019;s Commissions as Platforms for Social and Environmental Safeguard (PSES), 3 at regional level and 1 at national level. All platforms are adapted to the specific circumstances in the different areas. The platforms bring together community people, CSOs, media, HRDs, academia, legal experts and youth, among others. As a participatory initiative, the PSES worked to hold key duty bearers accountable and to develop alternative models related to corporate conduct (1). ActionAid Bangladesh developed a draft People&#x2019;s Safeguard Policy as an alternative policy for ensuring human rights in infrastructural developments. The Policy was developed in a participatory process with CSOs and related stakeholders in several national and local level consultations and meetings and will be put forward to the national government for adoption (1). Kenya (1): To support a re-convergence of women under the banner of the Kilimanjaro Initiative, ActionAid Kenya and partners finalized and launched the framework for implementation of women&#x2019;s rights to land [of which the development was initiated in 2017], whilst also developing tools to track its implementation [currently under review] and popularizing the charter of demands to sustain and foster women&#x2019;s mobilization (through village forums, a radio talk show, and a roadshow). ActionAid Kenya and partners provided guidance in the process, funded and organised workshops to develop the framework, and facilitated participation of women in the process (1). Regarding the set target to engage corporates to establish and sustain participatory community dialogue processes, work was initiated but agreements were not developed and completed. However, committees for the community development agreements are being established in one project area, where already two of our women have been elected as members of the committees. This target will therefore be reported in the 2019 outcomes (0). NL (2): ActionAid Netherlands provided inputs for the ActionAid International agroecology promotion paper that was presented at the FAO agroecology forum in Rome. ActionAid Netherlands also explicitly lobbied for agroecology as an alternative to large-scale agribusinesses at the IOB food security evaluation conference (1). ActionAid Netherlands improved its understanding of integrated land-based climate solutions, including agroecology and community-based forestry through the participation of ActionAid in developing the report &#x2018;Missing Pathways to 1.5 Degrees&#x2019; on alternative ways to reduce carbon emissions. The report and its messages were picked up in various media and raised during the CFS negotiations in Rome (October) and the COP negotiations in Poland (December) (1). ActionAid Netherlands drafted a first discussion paper with ActionAid colleagues about the just energy transition and how this relates to the current mining model. No final paper has been produced yet (0). Zambia (1): As an alternative to audits being done by companies, ActionAid Zambia has capacitated its three partners and the local authorities of three project regions on carrying out social audits instead, performed by communities. As a result, two of the local authorities created a platform for social audits where various stakeholders, both from the supply and the demand side, review the quality of service provision of mining companies to communities. This alternative social audit process has ensured that the rights of mining communities are better protected, as they are engaged in the meetings and both companies and local authorities need to be transparent on service provision (1). Zimbabwe (1): The Zimbabwe Alternative Mining Indaba (ZAMI) organized by partner organisation ZELA and other CSOs is an alternative platform for increased participation of often excluded but equally important stakeholders such as host communities, who can engage during the event with policy makers from different government departments regulating the mining sector. The 2018 ZAMI was attended by more than 10 CSOs and more than 5 Rural District Councils. During the ZAMI the CSOs developed a declaration with key recommendations aimed at transforming the mining sector, including a national plan and campaign to stop violence caused by machete attacks in the ASM sector (1).</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">African Extractives Working Group (3): &#x2022; As an alternative to the Africa Mining Vision, the African Extractives Working Group will develop and promote a bottom-up Feminist Critique of the document. This alternative will be promoted through advocacy and lobby using research papers and reports and during (international) events such as the Alternative Mining Indaba in February 2019 (1). &#x2022; The African Extractives Working Group will work with the different ActionAid country offices to develop a &#x2018;People&#x2019;s Mining Charter&#x2019;, based on the model from South Africa, for the different countries. In this People&#x2019;s Mining Charter, mining-affected communities in the different countries will put forward their aspirations, principles and demands for participation in decision-making processes in the mining sector (1). &#x2022; The African Extractives Working Group will develop a policy paper with inputs into the Binding Treaty on Transnational Corporations and other Business Entities, with a focus on more participation, representation, decision making and remedy for mining affected communities. This alternative approach will be presented to the Department of International Relations and Cooperation of the South African Government (1). Bangladesh (1): In 2019 the People Safeguard (PSG) Policy, a strategic document developed by a consortium of CSOs including ActionAid Bangladesh, affected community members, land and environmental experts, Human Rights Defenders (HRDs) and lawyers, will be published and promoted towards the government for endorsement. Herein the UNGP, FPIC, EIA as part of proper rehabilitation, adequate compensation and resettlement mechanisms related to large-scale investments are introduced to legal bodies. The result will be the discussion of the incorporation of PSG into the national law to protect human and environmental rights (1). Cambodia (1): ActionAid Cambodia will double its investment in its role as facilitator in the Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) Platform in 2019 to introduce the UNGPs and VGGT as part of the CSR platform, as prime strategy to defend human and environmental rights. ActionAid Cambodia will facilitate multiple conferences and exposure visits for corporate sector members to affected communities. Through those exposure visits, ActionAid Cambodia will further promote corporate accountability of major mining and other commercial groups within the CSR group (1). Kenya (1): In action against the polluting and other devastating consequences of the mining company in the area of Kishushe, ActionAid Kenya supports communities in drafting comparative analysis of similar corporate practices and influencing adoptions of best practices by mining companies. As a consequence, the mining company will pledge to adopt dust collectors as a model for reducing pollution in the mining area. Netherlands (3): &#x2022; ActionAid will actively promote FPIC for communities affected by large scale infrastructure projects, as an alternative, inclusive decision making process for policy and investments that supports women&#x2019;s rights (as opposed to current practice where their rights are often ignored). We will explore investment cases that have particularly strong gender aspects in order to promote gender sensitive application of FPIC in particular (1). &#x2022; ActionAid will document and promote alternative and small-scale inclusive business models in agriculture (e.g. respecting agroecological principles and land rights, smallholder irrigation systems and resilient farming systems) based on experiences (best practices) to the Dutch and international public, civil society and policy makers through policy briefings, videos, online media and in meetings. This work includes scoping, thinking and developing alternative initiative/models, including in the areas of Human Rights Due Diligence practices, land and natural resource governance (1). &#x2022; Through feminist participatory action research, ActionAid will develop and document alternative approaches to the current corporate accountability (CSR) policies to the benefit of ensuring women&#x2019;s rights to be respected in the context of labour, decent work and gender responsive public services in the Global South (1). &#x2022; In collaboration with several of the other FGG ActionAid country offices ActionAid will start scoping alternative livelihood models for mining communities to improve the secure access to and control of natural resources for communities and women in particular. This exercise will result in a report on which alternative models can be built in the future (0). Uganda (2): &#x2022; ActionAid Uganda and its partners will work with a community in a region where a large company is seeking to establish a sugar cane plantation, to prevent land grabs and to ensure that the community can claim its rights. They will ensure that the community understands the &#x2018;deed of settlement&#x2019; document developed by the government. As opposed to other cases, ActionAid Uganda and its partners are promoting the participation of the community as a group rather than as separate individuals claiming their land rights (1). &#x2022; ActionAid Uganda and its partners will promote and implement mediation as an alternative to forced evictions. They will facilitate mediation between a government and a company on the one hand and the community on the other (1). Zambia (3): &#x2022; ActionAid Zambia and its partners will lobby for community engagement in the implementation of the Africa Mining Vision, as an alternative to the current top-down implementation process in which communities are not involved. ActionAid Zambia and its partners will draft position/discussion papers and will engage with Parliamentary Committees to promote this participatory model (1). &#x2022; ActionAid Zambia and its partners will push for community participation in Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) planning in three mining communities, contrary to the current CSR planning processes where only the mining companies are involved. ActionAid Zambia will promote this participatory model to mining companies and government bodies at different levels (1). &#x2022; ActionAid Zambia and its partners will conduct research on the effects of mining activities on livelihoods and will come up with sustainable community driven livelihood alternatives. They will promote these alternatives to local, provincial and national government bodies (1). Zimbabwe (1): The Zimbabwe Alternative Mining Indaba (ZAMI) organized by ActionAid&apos;s partner organisation and other civil society organisations is an alternative platform to increase participation of often excluded but equally important stakeholders, such as host communities, with policy makers from different government departments regulating the mining sector. The Declarations formulated at the ZAMI profile the key recommendations aimed at transforming the sustainability of the sector, which is then also tracked and monitored by the partner and other civil society organisations (1).</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">Bangladesh (3): AAB has published a &#x201C;Social and Environmental Safeguard Policy; People&#x2019;s Proposals&#x201D;; these are proposed policy guidelines for ensuring that negative social and environmental impact of government and corporate activities is mitigated. The proposed policy guidelines came out of broad participatory sessions with community groups, HRDs and CSOs, AAB and partners promoting this policy in the community and CSO level through campaign and awareness. Thus they will be lobbying and advocating with the government to adopt this policy (1). Two partners have each developed a framework document on resettlement and livelihood rehabilitation in the context of Bangladesh&#x2019;s megaprojects and related displacement of communities. The frameworks are based on the experiences and developed with the participation of affected communities, HRD and CSOs. This was the result of various consultation workshops and joint investigations Based on this framework partners submitted the memorandum to various actors, including the District commissioner (DC), Upazila (sub-district) Officer (UNO), Department of Environment (DOE) etc. In addition, they presented these documents at press conferences and workshops organized through the people&#x2019;s commissions (2). Cambodia (1): A mediation process was piloted by AAC together with a consultant, aimed at finding a solution to the long-standing conflict between a company and an affected community in Pursat province, which so far could not be resolved through other means. A first meeting to explain the process took place on 31 May 2019. The affected community people decided not to continue with this process; instead, they approached the Supreme Council for Consultation and Recommendations to help them in order to reach a solution. The Netherlands (5): ActionAid Netherlands developed a feminist ten step plan for the binding treaty, as an alternative to current corporate accountability policies which are gender-blind. This alternative was developed using input from the feminists 4 a binding treaty coalition network, which consists of organizations based in LLMICs and MICs, and was promoted under Dutch policymakers and public (1). Based on experiences and methodology development of ActionAid at international level, including from LLMICs, (with contributions by ActionAid Netherlands to the flagship report and through an earlier Agroecology publication) ActionAid Netherlands contributed to agroecology promotion, agroecology &amp; feminism, local food systems and the right to food providing inputs to FAO-CFS, Parliamentary debate (including a formal letter for agroecology promotion to parliamentary commissions), and lobby of Ministries of Agriculture and Foreign Affairs in the Netherlands. Agroecology is an alternative to industrial agriculture, which is based on monocultures with low biodiversity, high use of pesticides and seed patents, for example (1). ActionAid Netherlands promoted the power of feminist participatory action research within the ActionAid flagship trajectory for resilient livelihoods and climate justice and as part of the land@scale trajectory of the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs, partly based on experiences in Mozambique and other LLMICs. The alternative is methodological and aimed at policy change contributing to land governance initiatives based on respectively diagnosis, participation and co-implementation by local communities and women in particular (1). ActionAid Netherlands has developed an integrated approach to address the thematic nexus between gender, women&#x2019;s rights, land rights, sustainable land-use (like agroecology) and climate change adaptation for resilient livelihoods for women and men, based on practices in LLMICs. This approach was promoted during several meetings with the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs, for example in the land@scale trajectory, as an alternative to approaches that look at these issues in a more separated and industrial way (1). ActionAid Netherlands has promoted its joint proposal with ActionAid Kenya for inclusive Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) to the RVO SDG Facility as an alternative to current PPP structures that do not include civil society strongly enough (1). Zambia (2): ActionAid Zambia and its partners supported women from communities affected by mining to formulate a Women&#x2019;s Mining Charter, that puts forward their demands with regards to the domestication of the Africa Mining Vision. So far, the Africa Mining Vision in itself and the domestication process in Zambia have not been gender-inclusive or participatory. The Women&#x2019;s Mining Charter was presented to a number of relevant stakeholders, such as the Ministry of Mines and the Ministry of Gender (1). ActionAid Zambia and its partners have pushed for community participation in Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) planning in the three mining communities where they work. This is an alternative to current CSR planning processes where only mining companies are involved, and that often do not address the real needs of the communities. As a result, the mining companies have started to involve community members, with a focus on women and youth (1). Zimbabwe (1): ActionAid Zimbabwe and partner ZELA contributed to the organization of the Zimbabwe Alternative Mining Indaba (ZAMI). This is an alternative platform to increase participation of often excluded but equally important stakeholders, such as host communities, with policy makers from different government departments regulating the mining sector. At the end of the ZAMI, a declaration was formulated with key recommendations for the sustainability of the sector, such as joining the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative. ZELA and other civil society organisations will monitor the implementation of the recommendations to hold duty bearers accountable (1).</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">Kenya (1): ActionAid supported their partner to go to a mining company that has adopted best practices for a learning visit. From the visit, they learnt that the company has an integrated community development program leading development in the community, an transparent and inclusive selection of Corporate Social Responsibility committee members, and a clear 5 year term. Back home, they advocated towards the CSR committee in the mining area to adopt this CSR model. The CSR committee committed to emulate the practices. As a result 7.8 million dining hall is under construction at a secondary school, a dispensary worth 4 million is also under construction and 13 secondary school students are supported with full scholarship. These projects were identified and selected by the communities. Cambodia (1): ActionAid was one of the organizations to set up a CSR platform to develop an alternative mechanism to improve engagement between public and private sector and civil society (organizations). In 2017 this platform has become most active. It promotes corporate social responsibility, VGGT, UN guidelines, including more sustainable corporate conduct and participation of communities. The CSR Platform encompasses 17 private companies, 3 Chambers of Commerce and 7 CSO members, and has a three pronged strategy such as: capacity building, advocacy and regulatory reform. The Goals of the CSR platform are to mainstream and materialize CSR guidelines, tools and principles in Cambodia, CSOs and government institutions to start adopting and implementing CSR guidelines, tools and principles. Zimbabwe (3): ActionAid and its partner mobilized and trained community monitor groups on how to do environmental impact assessments in mining areas. This as an alternative to the EIA done by the mining companies. One CBO have been accredited by EMA as independent environmental monitors to document and report violations of environmental laws by a mining company in their area. The community monitors produce reports that include community perspective and are used to mirror reports submitted by mining companies. ActionAid and its partner together with another organisation organised the Manicaland Alternative Mining Indaba as a community level alternative initiative to the Mining Indaba. They organised this as a model to ensure citizen participation and stakeholder engagement on good governance in the mining sector. The platform allows mining communities to have face to face discussions with duty bearers and critique government and company policies and practices. ActionAid together with other organisations organized the Zimbabwe Alternative Mining Indaba (ZAMI), as a national level alternative for the Mining Indaba, for communities and CSOs to advocate for responsible corporate conduct in the country&#x2019;s mining sector. A broad range of subject issues were discussed on corporate accountability such as the respect and promotion of community rights. Bangladesh (2): An accessible and easy to understand handbook on &#x201C;Laws and Rules of Land and Water&#x201D; was developed which was published by ActionAid, in order to achieve greater transparency on existing laws, rules and policies around land management, and more participatory decision making and land management practices. An online platform called the Displacement Archive was set up by ActionAid&apos;s partner that brings together information on various &#x2018;development&#x2019;-related cases of land grabs and displacement. The online platform provides tools for communities affected by displacement and land grab to engage in advocacy around their cases and provides CSOs and activists tools for lobby and advocacy Uganda (2) With FGG support, ActionAid&apos;s partner continued to promote their models and strategies for nonviolent grass roots resistance to land grabs in various localities and communities in Uganda. They have organised trainings, including nonviolent resistance trainings and Training of Trainings on this topics, for activist and especially women who are confronted by land grabs. (1) On request of the Commission of Inquiry into Land Grabs, ActionAid and its partner made proposals for the development of Alternative Dispute Resolution where land is customarily held.(1) Netherlands (2): VGGT scorecard based on key principles of equality, gender and participatory land governance was piloted and adjusted as based on learnings from the Netherlands, Australia, Gambia and Senegal and is currently being shared as a tool for others to use as an alternative way of assessing land governance including corporate accountability standards in their countries. Results and tool were shared with Dutch government as well as AU, FAO and other institutions. (1) We have supported the Women&#x2019;s Land Rights in Africa initiative that was funded by the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs (via LandAc) and allowed for AA Kenya to do participatory action research with women in follow-up of women2kilimanjaro. As advisory board member AA NL has ensured that the bottom-up and participatory approach remained on the agenda of the overall programme and provided inputs to AA Kenya to support their work. This is an important alternative to existing research approaches and allows for win-wins with empowerment, lobby and policy objectives. (1)</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">Bangladesh (2): To challenge the exclusion of communities from decision-making by corporates and the government, ActionAid Bangladesh will develop the &#x2018;Power of voices&#x2019; platform to bring together members from the 69 Community Land Rights Groups, members from the People&#x2019;s Commissions and HRDs. Through mass demonstrations at the community level, they will make their voices heard to ensure participation of communities in decision-making processes (1). The Life and Nature Safeguard Platform, set up and supported by ActionAid Bangladesh, will develop an alternative proposal for improving the environmental conservation rules of Bangladesh that takes into account the rights of both communities and the environment, something that is not done in existing policies on this topic. These proposals will be submitted to the Government and discussed in the media. (1). Cambodia (1): ActionAid Cambodia has an active role in the CSR platform in Cambodia. This is a unique platform in Cambodia, where corporates interact directly with government and civil society on Environmental and Social Governance (ESG). ActionAid Cambodia is contributing to the development of the platform, for example by developing specific strategies to mobilize more corporations to be involved, active and responsible (1). Mozambique (1): As an alternative to a company audit, a partner organisation of ActionAid Mozambique will carry out a social audit on the conduct of a sugar cane company in one of the project districts, to assess the implementation of the corporate social responsibility promises of the company to the community, and the change that this has brought to small farmers living around the company premises (1). Netherlands (1): ActionAid Netherlands will develop and document the &#x2018;feminist economy&#x2019; as an alternative to current corporate accountability strategies. This will be piloted and promoted under media and policymakers (1). Zambia (2): ActionAid Zambia and its partners will lobby for community engagement in the review and finalization of the land policy. So far, communities are not actively involved in this process. ActionAid Zambia and its partners will draft position/discussion papers as well as engage with Parliamentary Committees to promote this participatory model (1). ActionAid Zambia and its partners will push for improvement of corporate accountability through participation in the Zambia Alternative Mining Indaba, Provincial Alternative Mining Indaba and District Alternative Mining Indaba for the three mining communities where mining companies attend and participate. ActionAid Zambia will promote this participatory model to mining companies and government bodies at different levels (1). Zimbabwe (1): Partner organisation ZELA, together with other CSOs, will organize the Zimbabwe Alternative Mining Indaba (ZAMI), an alternative platform for increased participation of often excluded but equally important stakeholders in the mining sector, such as host communities and policymakers from some government departments. During the ZAMI, the participants will formulate a Declaration outlining the key recommendations for transforming the sustainability of the mining sector. Also, ZELA and other CSOs will develop the ZAMI Progress Tracker, to follow up on the commitments made during the ZAMI (1).</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">AA NL (1): In the Dutch CSR covenants processes AA NL, together with the MVO platform, has successfully improved 1 government mechanism (covenants), by successfully promoting inclusion of additional civil society representatives and additional funding allocation . E.g. AA NL has been emphasizing the need for including NGOs in the implementation of the coal sector agreement, which has led to a closer coordination between energy companies and NGOs on proposed actions. Zimbabwe (1): ActionAid&apos;s Zimbabwe&apos;s partners provided expert advice to the Parliamentary Portfolio Committee on Mines and Energy on the gazetted Mines and Minerals Amendment Bill. This was to ensure that they could understand effectively the legal provisions in order to effectively carry out their law-making and oversight roles. As required by the Constitution that the public should be provided with scope to influence legal and policy making, the Parliamentary Portfolio Committee on Mines and Energy facilitated public hearings on the Mines Bill on 19th -24th September. As a result of pressure and advice from partner organizations these meetings were also opened up for CSOs to participate in. Zambia (2):1. AA Zambia has influenced the decentralization of government structures so that civil society has more access to government platforms and can better influence government to hold corporations accountable. AA Zambia influenced the District Development Coordinating Committee (DDCC) to acknowledge ActionAid&#x2019;s partners so that they can have a seat at the DDCC. In 2016, all the 3 implementing partners have been attending DDCC meetings in their respective districts. They have used the DDCC as advocacy and lobbying platforms on water pollution, implementation of mitigation plans (after mining phase) etc. 2. Through the engagement with the local government, the Zambia Environmental Management Agency (national and provincial) and the Ministry of Mines, AAZambia reinforced the need for community engagement in decision making. Specifically, ZEMA and the local government have committed to strengthening engagement with local communities and providing for feedback mechanisms on water pollution, resettlement issues. Mozambique (2): 1. AA Mozambique engaged with the Mozambican parliament, CSO partners and the Ministry of Agriculture and Food Security about the LASAN (Law of Agriculture, Food Security and Nutrition). AA Mozambique has put pressure on the ministry of agriculture during the meetings they had with them to provide space for CSOs to give input on the LASAN. This was successful and the ministry of agriculture has provided space for CSOs who gave input on the LASAN. 2. The Local Consultative Councils (CCL) and District Consultative Councils (CCD) platforms were established by government years ago in which communities could discuss (land related) issues and possible solutions with local and district leaders. However, the CCLs and CCDs had been inactive ever since. Because of pressure from AA Mozambique the government has improved the implementation of these councils and started organizing these meetings in 2016. Furthermore, with support from AA Mozambique the participation of women in these platforms has increased with more than 100%. Kenya (1): The police and provincial administration have been influenced by wealthy individuals/ institutions including investors to harass people resisting land grabs. AA Kenya trained police and provincial administration on Chapter IV of CoK (Bill of Rights). AA Kenya has built the knowledge of law enforcers on the Bill of Rights so that they will no longer violate the rights of people resisting land grabs when performing their duties. This opens up the space for people to defend their rights and hold companies and government accountable without being threatened by law enforcers. Thus, the implementation of the mechanism the Chapter IV of CoK (Bill of Rights) is improved with the result that civil society has safer access to influence democratic decision making processes related to corporate conduct.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">Zambia (2): ActionAid will engage with government to include the Zambia Environmental Management Agency (ZEMA) in the platform committee. In these platform committees, local CBO&apos;s and government meet each other and discuss issues related to mining. Their presence in this platform will enable civil society to voice their grievances to the Zambia Environmental Management Agency. The 3 partner organisations and community groups will engage with ministry of lands and traditional leaders to adopt guidelines for land administration that includes that local people need to give consent for resettlement. Zimbabwe (1): ActionAid in collaboration with the Ministry of Women Affairs, Gender and Community Development will organize a gender and extractives symposium convening Civil Society organizations in Zimbabwe, mining companies, Ministry of mines and the Environmental Management Agency to exchange views and engage on integration of international policy frameworks such as the Africa Mining Vision and their benefit for women in and out of the mining sector. This meeting was held last year and will be organized this year again. This is counted this year because now it has become a reoccurring meeting and therefore a mechanisms and not a one-off-meeting. Kenya(2): ActionAid will support the development of county and national policy visions on extractives that include community views and propositions basing on African Mining Vision as the starting point. Kenya is already developing its Kenya Country Mining Vision where ActionAid is an alternate member of the Technical Working Group (multi-stakeholders) that is supporting in development of the Kenya Country Mining Vision. ActionAid together with partner organisations will hold forums for rural women, local communities and County Government on the need and relevance of a localized Mining Vision in the counties. We anticipate that 2 county governments where this project is implemented will put in place policy visions on extractives which provides a framework for key players in the sector to make democratic decisions. As a result, CSOs will gain access to democratic decision making process related to corporate conduct. Uganda (1): It is expected that as a result of ActionAid Uganda&apos;s work with the Ministry of Housing, Lands and Urban Development, this Ministry will structurally start engaging local communities for consultation and dialogue in the event of acquisition of land for infrastructural development. Netherlands (2): ActionAid will continue to actively support, participate in and lobby for continuation and improvement of existing mechanisms under the new Dutch government, such as the multi-stakeholder dialogue on land and the Land Forum (LandAc), the various sector agreement negotiations and dialogue between CSOs (particularly OECD watch) and the National Contact Point. AA also actively supports the continuation and improvement of the Gender Meerpartijen Initiatief of Dutch Parliament that is a space for dialogue between parliamentarians, CSOs and others on gender and women&#x2019;s rights. (1) ActionAid will continue to lobby for an active role of the Dutch government and embassies to ensure improved civil society access to democratic decision-making in partner countries, by emphasizing the need for including and upholding impact assessments that include the voices of civil society and the affected people and consent procedures (including FPIC) in the event of investments, as well as the importance of ensuring women are at the table for important policy and investment dialogues (1). We will also support HRDs and ensure public debate on the importance of political space for CSOs through Dutch/EU embassy engagement in partner countries, as well as events and advocacy in the Netherlands. This might not lead to a direct mechanism but is a crucial long-term engagement to preserve foundation for civic space. [We expect at least 2 of these strategies to result in new mechanisms put in place or &#x2013; more likely &#x2013; existing one to be improved.]</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">Bangladesh (0): The current political context in Bangladesh is not favourable to put in place these types of mechanisms. Despite this, ActionAid Bangladesh organized a lobby meeting with the Law Commission of Bangladesh, land and law experts, CSOs and representatives from affected communities on the improvement of the &#x2018;Acquisition and Requisition of Immovable Property Act 2017&#x2019;, and other laws related to land. Apart from this meeting, ActionAid Bangladesh and partners built the capacity of the People&#x2019;s Commissions, active agencies, citizens, CSOs and HRDs through training and workshops to create public pressure on the issues. We anticipate that these activities could contribute to an improved mechanism by 2020 (0). Cambodia (0): ActionAid Cambodia&#x2019;s partner issued the factsheet &#x201C;Cambodia&#x2019;s Special Economic Zone and Human Rights&#x201D; in October 2018. The publication served as an awareness raising tool, bringing information concerning the obligation of the Royal Government of Cambodia and corporate enterprises in respecting human rights and fundamental freedoms. In reaction to this factsheet, a Cambodian Government&#x2019;s spokesman said that SEZs were created by private companies or joint venture and so were not under the supervision of the government; therefore, such establishment came under the agreement between the local people and companies. The spokesman however added that as a requirement, such companies must conduct impact assessment and report to government before starting operations. He further defended the rights given to workers by the government to discuss conditions with the companies. Although it appears to have fueled some sort of public discussion around the assertion of workers&#x2019; rights and labour conditions, we cannot report this here as an outcome. Kenya (0): Development of policy visions at county and national levels was not completed even though the process was initiated. For that reason, we place the outcome at zero. However, initial steps towards development of the visions have seen CSOs gain access to democratic decision-making processes related to corporate conduct. Example: communities in one project area successfully pushed for a public participation memorandum between the community and a mining company, outlining critical short-term and long-term issues that the company should address e.g. safety of workers, insurance cover for workers, workers to join trade unions, signing of community development agreements, environmental impact assessments (0). NL (1): ActionAid Netherlands, together with other CSOs, has been successful in influencing the contents of the new Land@Scale programme of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for land governance, among others through our VGGT scorecard analysis of the Dutch government and the results from a Dutch funded land rights in Africa programme. As a result, the Land@Scale programme design includes explicit provisions to raise support for community and women&#x2019;s land rights, will be accessible to civil society organisations and is based on VGGT principles, including FPIC. The programme will be launched by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs early 2019 (1). ActionAid Netherlands continued to push for access for civil society in decisionmaking in the Multi-Stakeholder Dialogue on Land, the Land forum and during sector agreement negotiations, hereby calling on the different parties to assure principles around Free, Prior and Informed Consent (FPIC) in their investment/supply chain. This has not yet resulted in improved mechanisms (0). Uganda (1): Over the years, ActionAid Uganda and partners have engaged the Ministry of Lands, Housing &amp; Urban Development in different platforms to conduct consultations with local communities and CSOs on land reforms to ensure that they are pro-poor and facilitate land tenure security. The Land Awareness Weeks in Soroti (February 2018) and Mubende (June 2018) are examples of such platforms. As a result, the Ministry of Lands, Housing &amp; Urban Development has developed a draft Land Acquisition Bill and has put in place a joint consultative meeting with CSOs to ensure voices of local people are heard and taken into account. Although not mandatory, the government has made such meetings part of their wider process, therewith enabling structural CSO participation in the Land Acquisition Bill and the Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation, Resettlement and Relocation Policy (1). Zambia (5): During the Zambia Alternative Mining Indaba, ActionAid Zambia, together with various other stakeholders including civil society organisations, lobbied to the Ministry of Mines, the Ministry of Environment and the Zambia Environmental Management Agency (ZEMA) to include ZEMA in national, provincial and local engagement platforms. As a result, ZEMA is now required to attend these meetings on all levels and give updates on various concerns and activities. This enables civil society to engage with ZEMA directly (1). ActionAid Zambia engaged with local authorities to ensure better access for CSOs to Ward Development Committees and District Development Coordination Committee meetings. At the same time, they strengthened the capacity of 3 local partners on deepening community engagement to enhance advocacy and participation, especially of women, in key decision-making processes. As a result of these actions, local authorities are now actively inviting CSOs to the meetings to create a more enabling environment, and CSOs are better able to meaningfully engage (1). As a result of engagements with CSOs, among which ActionAid Zambia&#x2019;s partner organisations, during Ward and District Development meetings, the Government through the District Commissioner&#x2019;s Office and the local authorities has introduced an open-door policy. This policy means that CSOs and communities can contact local authorities at any time with pressing issues, and do not have to wait anymore until official meetings. This has for example helped one of the partners and the community members to access first-hand information from relevant authorities on issues that are affecting mining communities in one of the project areas (1). ActionAid Zambia&#x2019;s partners engaged with local authorities, traditional leaders and mining companies to give priority to women when resettlement is being implemented. As a result of these engagements, women are now consulted at every level and their committees are invited to attend Land Meetings at the Ward and District level, meaning that their concerns can be taken into consideration there (1). ActionAid Zambia built the capacity of its three partner organisations and the local authorities of the three project areas on all aspects of the social audit process. As a result, two of the local authorities created a platform for social audits and interface meetings where various stakeholders, both from the supply and demand side, come together and review the quality of service provision from companies to the companies. The Ward Development Committees, as an arm of the local authorities, are now engaging the communities periodically in the social audit process and interface meetings (1). Zimbabwe (1): For the second year in a row, ActionAid Zimbabwe in collaboration with the Ministry of Women Affairs, Gender and Community Development organized a Gender Symposium in Mutoko, convening Zimbabwean civil society organisations, mining companies, the Ministry of Mines and the Zimbabwe Environmental Management Agency to exchange views and engage on the inclusion of women in international policy frameworks and decision-making bodies. This Symposium offered civil society groups, among which women from community-based groups, the opportunity to engage with decision-makers and mining companies to advocate for improved corporate conduct. As this Symposium is now an annual event organized by ActionAid and the Ministry of Women Affairs, Gender and Community Development, it offers a structural mechanism that guarantees access to decision-making processes for civil society (1).</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">Kenya (1): CSOs platform to inform Kenya country mining vision. Kenya as a country is currently developing its mining vision and CSOs had been left out. ActionAid and other network members at the national level lobbied for space for CSOs to participate in the discussions around the development of the country mining vision. This was granted and as a result ActionAid is alternate member to the multi-stakeholders Technical Working Group representing views of the CSOs to the group. Zimbabwe (1): ActionAid and its partner organisation supported community groups to write a petition to the Parliamentary Portfolio Committee on Mines and Energy to improve the government&#x2019;s consultation mechanism. The communities requested the government to start organizing the consultations at community level to ensure that communities have access to this process. Resulting from the petition, the consultation mechanism has been improved by the government as the meetings are now held at local level throughout the country instead of organizing them merely in the capital city Harare. This opens up the space for communities to participate in these meetings. Zambia (3): Government has launched the 7th National Development Plan which is a tool that enhances local participation in decision making. This is built up on strengthening devolution of powers by government to allow for local level participation in planning and decision making. ActionAid at national level participated in the review of the 6th NDP and specifically made submission on creating spaces for local level participation. At local level, the 3 CSOs through the District Development Coordinating Committee (DDCC) advocated for an improved document that gives more powers to locals. In addition, the Ward Development Committees (WDCs) in two Districts have been established by government and ActionAid strengthened these structures by building their capacities on understanding human rights as well as holding interface meetings between duty bearers and rights holders. (1) The validation of the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) is another formalized platform which provides for transparency and accountability in the extractives sector. ActionAid and other partners in the extractives sector have been participating in reviewing the EITI reports and providing recommendations for improvement to ensure Zambia is upholding the principles of transparency and accountability in the extractives around resource allocation and responsiveness to local needs as set by global EITI group. Recommendations that were taken up in the EITI system were how to engage women in social and environmental impact assessments, how communities can benefit mining activities, monitoring mechanism to ensure there is transparency in mines reports on their production and profits. The Zambian EITI system was validated in October, 2017 and this means the space is now more strengthened to provide oversight to government in the management of affairs in the extractives.(1) ActionAid trained local people to understand the government decentralization and how they can use these spaces to demand for progressive policies in the extractives sector. ActionAid also engaged with local governments in the mining districts (as part of its decentralization) to facilitate the development of indicators to give space to local people to participate in decision making at local level through Ward Development Committees. This advocacy work was positively responded to by government integrating it in the latest 7th National Development Plan. Local communities developed indicators to keep track of the progress of the decentralization. The local council are now using these indicators to engage communities in the process. (1) Mozambique (1) At district level, ActionAid and local partners revitalized the local and district consultative councils (CCLs and CCDs) in ActionAid&apos;s intervention areas by promoting women&#x2019;s participation in those decision making fora, where all issues related to land grabbing, family law, investment law, including infrastructure, health and education are discussed. More than 30% of the members of the CCDs are women. These results were achieved due to various meetings held to plan the process of revitalization of the CCLs, to present the Strategic Development Plan of the government for the District (2016-2025), to revitalize the CCLs bodies and to review the lists of interest groups.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">Cambodia (3): Multi Stakeholder Committees (MSC) at national, provincial and district level (3) will continue to be improved in terms of enabling CSOs to influence decision-making processes regarding corporate conduct of government and companies that violate land rights (land grabbing, land pollution e.g.) in 2019. The legal government bodies involved are: the Ministry of Land Management, Urban Planning and Construction, the Ministry of Environment, the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, the Ministry of Commerce and the Council for Development of Cambodia (CDC). ActionAid Cambodia and its partner will train and support civil organisations to maximize their decision-making powers in those MSCs (3). Kenya (1): A special Taskforce including CSOs will be implemented by the Government of Kenya in 2019 to formulate a tailor-made Kenya Country Mining Vision (CMV), ensuring measurements for inclusive socio-economic developments in line with operations of the mining industry. ActionAid Kenya will train and support the CSOs to maximize the response to needs of affected communities in the Kenya CMV. This mechanism will guarantee civil society organizations&#x2019; access to democratic decision-making processes regarding the conduct of the mining companies (1). Mozambique (1): ActionAid Mozambique&#x2019;s partner will train members of the Agrarian Investment Monitoring Committee (consisting of government representatives, investors and civil society) in carrying out investment surveys. As a result of this, the Agrarian Investment Monitoring Committee as a mechanism will be able to monitor investments regularly and to advice both investors and small farmers, especially women and youth. The Committee guarantees access for civil society to democratic decision-making processes, as civil society is included as one of the member groups and as such has a say in the decisions and activities of the Committee (1). Netherlands (2): &#x2022; ActionAid will continue to participate in existing mechanisms of the Dutch government and lobby for further improvements and inclusiveness, particularly of the Multistakeholder Dialogue Land Governance and sector CSR covenants (e.g. wind energy sector), and will specifically lobby to ensure that these mechanisms guarantee access for civil society. As a result of these activities, we expect that the Dutch government will improve at least one of these mechanisms in 2019 (1). &#x2022; ActionAid will continue to lobby for an active role of the Dutch government and embassies to ensure improved civil society access to democratic decision-making in LLMICs, by emphasising the need for including and upholding gendered human rights impact assessments that include the voices of civil society and the affected people and consent procedures (incl. FPIC) in the event of trade and investments, as well as the importance of ensuring women are at the table for important policy and investment dialogues. We aim for at least one embassy or entity to create or improve this mechanism (1). &#x2022; ActionAid will support HRDs and ensure public debate on the importance of political space for CSOs through Dutch/EU embassy engagement in partner countries, as well as events and advocacy in the Netherlands. This might not lead to a direct mechanism but is a crucial longterm engagement to preserve foundation for civic space (0). Uganda (0): The operating space for CSOs in Uganda has continued to shrink over the years, and it is expected that this will go on in 2019. ActionAid Uganda and other CSOs will continue their work to increase civic space, but this will probably not lead to concrete mechanisms in 2019 (0). Zambia (2): &#x2022; In 2019, the Zambian government will ensure that Development Committees are put in place in all districts, following its own policy on this, and that communities are included in decision-making processes around corporate conduct. This is partly the result of the engagement of ActionAid and its partners with the government, corporates and other relevant stakeholders through the Alternative Mining Indaba policy dialogues on different levels (1). &#x2022; The Zambian government will ensure the inclusion of community members in decision making platforms, such as Ward Development Committees, District Development Coordination Committees and full council meetings, to guarantee community access to democratic decision making processes as a result of ActionAid and its partners&#x2019; continued lobby on this topic (1).</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">Kenya (1): In Taita Taveta, a county level artisanal miner&#x2019;s association (Dawita Duweta Association of Artisanal Miners) that had been established by a senior officerin the county government without the participation of artisanal miners was disbanded after complaints by the artisanal miners, with financial and strategic support of ActionAid Kenya&#x2019;s partner Taita Taveta Human Rights Watch (TTHRW). It was reconstituted afresh and now has 4 members of mining groups who are members of TTHRW (1). Mozambique (1): ActionAid Mozambique&#x2019;s partners NADEC and CODESA trained members of Agrarian Investment Monitoring Committees (consisting of district government representatives, investors and civil society) in scrutinizing budgets and monitoring the impact of investments on the lives of smallholder farmers. As a result of these trainings, the Committee improved its monitoring and provided quarterly updates on investments. Also, the district government guaranteed the presence of different civil society groups and the minimum percentage of women (30%) in the local decision-making spaces (1). The Netherlands (5): The Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs together with other EU government delegations guaranteed structural access for civil society at the upcoming binding treaty negotiations in 2020 during the 5th session, after ActionAid Netherlands together with other FGG alliance members sent a letter, based on inputs from partners in LLMICs, to the Ministry asking them to protect access (1). The Dutch government (Ministry of Foreign Affairs in collaboration with RVO) set up a consultation trajectory with NGOs (several sessions to date) for land@scale programme document finalization, co-creation for and monitoring of the programme. ActionAid Netherlands, as part of the Multi-Stakeholder Dialogue on Land and in consultation with CSOs in LLMICs (Zimbabwe, Kenya and Bangladesh), frequently engaged with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to advocate for more inclusion of NGOs (1). The Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs provided a structural platform for monitoring and capacity development for women&#x2019;s land rights as part of the Multi-Stakeholder Dialogue on Land, of which ActionAid Netherlands, having consultations with CSOs in LLMICs, is an active member. During several occasions, including the annual meeting, we made recommendations to provide this platform (1). In the Netherlands an Include (NWO, Ministry of Foreign Affairs) trajectory provided structural space for civil society to contribute to advocacy for capacity development of CSOs political roles (lobby &amp; lobby advocacy capacity) with the NWO (dialogue &amp; dissent) assumptions research as core input. ActionAid Netherlands guided and facilitated the research. The series of workshops provided space to draw in on experiences within FGG from partners in LLMICs, like land rights advocacy in Kenya and how it translates into land rights advocacy in the Netherlands too (1). Due to two different reports on respecting human rights in wind turbines supply chains that we published, ActionAid Netherlands, as an expert, is now structurally invited to the talks on the establishment of a wind sector covenant as the only civil society representative, together with government representatives and wind energy companies (1). Zambia (2): At some point, the Government of Zambia had put the formation of Ward Development Committees (WDCs) on hold in order to deal with clarity issues on guidelines and implementation. Whilst the intention behind the suspension was good, stakeholders among them CSOs felt this was a drawback and would delay the progress of shifting power to the people. CSOs including ActionAid Zambia demanded for quick address of the issues so as to lift the suspension. Government was able to lift the suspension afterwards. The WDCs create access for communities to information about developmental programmes, but also spaces for advancing agendas on human rights. The government worked with Local Councils to ensure formation of WDCs is actualized in all districts. The biggest challenges were resources for Local Councils to facilitate this process. AAZ and its partners partnered with the Local Councils to ensure these are functional at ward level so that local people can have spaces for engagement with duty bearers. At least in all the districts where the project is being implemented this was actualized. AAZ supported with training of WDCs where this was a gap. AAZ also mobilised communities and created awareness on how local people can use the WDCS spaces to hold the state accountable and also to demand for enforced regulation of corporate conduct (1). ActionAid Zambia and its partners have engaged with two Local Town Councils to ensure inclusion of communities in local decision-making structures, such as Ward Development Committees and District Development Coordinating Committees. As a result, the Local Councils have allowed women&#x2019;s groups and civil society organisations to participate in the council meetings, so that they have access to decision-making structures (1). Zimbabwe (1): The Government of Zimbabwe, through the Manicaland and Mashonaland East Provincial Administrators Offices, signed an MoU with ActionAid Zimbabwe&#x2019;s partner ZELA to allow them to work in the respective provinces. As a result, ZELA has been able to convene meetings with mining communities and the local authorities, thus promoting and improving democracy and active participation of CSOs and CBOs in decision-making processes that are linked to corporate conduct (1).</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">Cambodia (2): The &#x201C;CSOs and Government Partnership&#x201D; initiative of the Ministry of the Interior provides a forum enabling CSOs to raise their voice. The &#x201C;National Democratic Development Programme&#x201D;, also of the Ministry of the Interior, provides an additional mechanism through which civil society organisations can give their views on development plans at Provincial and lower levels. Because of the advocacy of AAC and its partners with the Ministry of the Interior, these mechanisms (currently of limited use) will be turned into a more meaningful space for dialogue between CSOs and Government on development policies (2). Kenya (1): As a result of lobbying and advocacy work by AAIK and its partners TTHRW, MRF, CHRCE and KFA, the government will implement the mining Act 2016. In particular, it will ensure that functional community development agreements committees (CDAs) are established or revived. In principle, these Committees include slots for CSOs and provide a mechanism for raising issues related to corporate conduct. Mozambique (1): District governments will improve the dialogue mechanism of the Local and District Consultative Councils, where government officials, CSOs and corporations interact on for example agribusiness investments. In 2020, the government will allow more CSO representatives in the meetings, which opens up the space for members of women smallholder farmers&#x2019; associations to participate and lobby for better inclusion of the Free, Prior and Informed Consent (FPIC) principle in all investments. This improvement is the result of active lobby towards national and local government by CSOs, including ActionAid Mozambique (1). Netherlands (2): ActionAid Netherlands will continue to participate in existing mechanisms of the Dutch government and lobby for further improvements and inclusiveness, particularly of the Multi-stakeholder Dialogue Land Governance and sector Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) covenants (e.g. wind energy sector) and its successors, and will specifically lobby to ensure that these mechanisms guarantee efficient and effective access for civil society, including in Bangladesh, Cambodia, Kenya, Mozambique, Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe. As a result of these activities, we expect the Dutch government will improve at least one of these mechanisms in 2020 (1). The Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs will put in place a PMEL framework for the Land@Scale programme that includes attention for the VGGTs, Women&#x2019;s Land Rights and FPIC principles, as a result of lobby efforts of ActionAid Netherlands, amongst others. The PMEL framework will be accessible online for CSOs. A PMEL framework to monitor these principles is a precondition for further action to increase civil society&#x2019;s role in decision making (1). Uganda (0): The operating space for CSOs in Uganda has continued to shrink with the NGO Bureau and the Finance Intelligence Authority targeting NGOs like ActionAid Uganda that work on civic and political rights. The situation is likely to get worse with focus on national elections slated for 2021 as campaigns begin in 2020. Zambia (1): In 2020, the Zambian government will finalize a land policy that ensures participation of women in decision making, following its own draft policy. This will be partly the result of the engagement of ActionAid Zambia and its partners with the provincial administration, corporates and other relevant stakeholders (1). Zimbabwe (1): The government of Zimbabwe will continue to improve the national and provincial dialogue platforms that were jointly created with ActionAid Zimbabwe and partner ZELA to ensure corporate accountability in Manicaland and Mutoko&#x2019;s mining districts. For example, they will ensure better government representation at each platform meeting, so that communities have a chance to speak to the relevant officials about their situation and demands (1).</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">Cambodia (6): ActionAid Cambodia will train and support communities and CSOs to work and negotiate with the government in working groups to claim their land rights via national Land Conflict Solution Mechanisms. By the end of 2019, two major commercial companies (2), the Ministry of Land Management and Urban Planning, the Ministry of Justice, the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries and the Ministry of Environment (4) will have improved their implementation of the existing Leopard Skin Policy, summoning corporate companies to return parts of the land the companies are using to the communities. Through regular CSR working groups including government representatives, affected communities can bring their complaints forward and the government and companies will address land conflicts between them and the affected communities (6). Kenya (1): The National Land Commission is working, together with ActionAid Kenya and other players, to further develop Guidelines on Alternative Dispute Resolution Mechanisms. ActionAid already established and will work further with Alternative Dispute Resolution Committees in the project sites to ensure the inclusion of the voice of the CSOs and communities in and expedite this process. As a result of this, the National Land Commission will adopt a safeguard mechanism that CSOs and communities can use to resolve grievances (1). Netherlands (2): We will work towards improving or adopting grievance mechanisms in the Netherlands and the international arena that allow for communities in LLMICs to gain access to justice or dispute settlement. &#x2022; ActionAid will do this amongst others via the sector agreements negotiations of the Dutch government by participating as a stakeholder or by providing negotiating parties with input. In addition we will participate in issue-focused processes (i.e. multistakeholder dialogue land). In all these processes we will push for strong grievance mechanisms. As a result of our efforts, we expect that in at least one of these processes a grievance mechanism will be adopted by the Dutch government or a corporation (1). &#x2022; The Dutch National Contact Point will improve its focus on key issues such as women&#x2019;s rights and land, as a result of ActionAid&#x2019;s contribution (partly through our OECD Watch membership and partly through direct lobby inputs) to the debate on the role and functioning of the Dutch NCP, as well as the discussions around the Dutch government&#x2019;s duty of care (also in collaboration with MVO platform) (1). &#x2022; ActionAid will advocate for stronger monitoring of VGGT implementation and appropriate grievance mechanisms at international and national level to uphold the Guidelines and seek redress in the case of violations. The VGGT scorecard that we developed and used for Dutch and other country analyses will be used to achieve broader buy-in at the international level (0). Uganda (1): By the end of 2019, the Commission of Inquiry will recommend the reestablishment of land tribunals to handle cases of land grabbing, resulting in CSOs and communities being more able to claim their land rights. This will be the result of ActionAid Uganda and partners&#x2019; advocacy efforts towards the Commission to set up an independent body to hear land grab claims (1). Zambia (2): &#x2022; A corporation involved in a mine in the project area will improve its grievance mechanism for resettled families as a result of ActionAid Zambia and its partner&#x2019;s engagement with the corporation on respecting environmental and human rights (1). &#x2022; The local government and the Ministry of Mines will strengthen their mechanisms to check if companies follow the right resettlement procedures (based on international guidelines such as the UNGP and FPIC) as a result of the engagement of ActionAid Zambia and its partner on issues of pollution and resettlement (1). Zimbabwe (2): ActionAid Zimbabwe&#x2019;s partner will facilitate workshops with local communities, several Rural District Councils and a number of mining companies on the importance of local non-judicial grievance redress mechanisms. As a result of these workshops, it is expected that at least 2 of the Rural District Councils will set up local redress mechanisms in the form of grievance registers in 2019. The grievance registers will be a binding mechanism for the companies to resolve human rights grievances (2).</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">Bangladesh (1): JICA has formed a Grievance Redress committee in a project area where a mega project is being implemented, although it is not yet functioning properly (1). This was due to constant pressure by ActionAid Bangladesh and its capacity to bring together organisations at the local, national and international levels. Cambodia (1): A rubber company has established an external grievance mechanism, but it had not yet been tested. ActionAid Cambodia and its partner CCHR have improved its working by monitoring its progress through meetings with the affected community and informing the company about negative impacts of its work, forcing it to remediate (see also 1.F.b). The Netherlands (1): After two years of ActionAid Netherlands lobby the metal International Responsible Business Conduct sector agreement, which was signed in June 2019, specifically included that companies open up their internal grievance mechanisms to third parties who have complaints or information about alleged violations of the OECD Guidelines and the UNGPs, and that they need to participate in a mediation process recommended by the National Contact Point if a complaint against them is deemed admissible (1). Zambia (3): ActionAid Zambia (AAZ) and its partner organized three meetings with a mining company on environmental management and grievance handling mechanisms. Through the engagement of AAZ and its partners, the mining company has strengthened the mandate of its community advisory committee that handles grievance mechanisms, to ensure that they are regularly engaged. The mining company has also allocated a specific office to deal with complaints and grievances from local communities with a deliberate agenda to ensure AAZ&#x2019;s partner and the women are engaged on a regular basis on matters of human rights and any other issues affecting the local communities (1). ActionAid Zambia and its partner engaged with the Ministry of Mines, the Zambia Environmental Management Authority and the Local Council on the need for strengthened regulation of the conduct by the mining companies with regard to resettlement. As a result of this engagement, the Local Council has improved its grievance mechanisms by including consultations with both the mining company and the community around the resettlement process, to ensure that all parties can share the relevant information (1). ActionAid Zambia and its partner engaged civic leaders and the District Commissioner&#x2019;s office as well as the Ministry of Mines in one of the project regions on the liquidation of a mining company in line with an international case court. Through these engagements, the government put in place a mechanism to include community representatives in the consultations on liabilities of the mining company so that their grievances are not lost in the process (1).</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">Cambodia (1): There will be opportunities for the government to adopt land dispute resolution mechanisms in Cambodia. ActionAid will support this process. Zambia (3): ActionAid Zambia together with partner organisations will engage mining companies to formalize their Community Engagement Committees/platforms that were formed in 2016/2017; with an inclusion of women as part of their company policy and a clear agenda to resolve conflicts and grievances by the community especially those affecting women and youth. ActionAid Zambia working with the Governmental Human Rights Commission and partners organisations will work out guidelines to establish a Human Rights Defender desk to deal with complaints of human rights abuse in the mining communities. ActionAid will support communities affected by mining to make annual submissions to the Parliamentary Committee on Legal Affairs and Human Rights. ActionAid will engage with the Committee to ensure that a structural feedback mechanism is in place so that affected communities have the information needed to resolve their grievances with government and corporations. Zimbabwe (2): ActionAid&apos;s partner organisation will facilitate workshops on the importance of local non-judicial grievance redress mechanisms. The meetings are meant to facilitate the local communities, local government and the mining companies to establish local redress mechanisms which meet quarterly to resolve human rights grievances related to mining operations and to put in place will be grievance registers. Kenya (1): ActionAid desires to expand linkages/ dialogue between investment companies, communities and civil society through different forums that share information on &#x2018;Human Rights Gap&#x2019;, best practices and current developments in the sector so as to inform programming on participation by women, youth and their groups. Therefore, partner organisations will be supported to bring Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) mechanisms to community level to resolve community &#x2013; corporate disputes. Netherlands(1): We will work towards improving or adopting grievance mechanisms in the Netherlands and the international arena that allow Southern communities to gain access to justice or dispute settlement. We will do this mainly via the participation in the sector agreements negotiations by participation as a stakeholder or by providing negotiating parties with input. In addition we will participate in issue-focused processes (ie multistakeholder dialogue land). Participating in these processes will enable us to advocate for strong grievance mechanisms in their agreements. ActionAid will also contribute to the debate on the role and functioning of the Dutch National Contact Point, as well as the discussions around the Dutch government&#x2019;s duty of care. ActionAid will also advocate for stronger monitoring of VGGT implementation and appropriate grievance mechanisms at international and national level to uphold the Guidelines. [we expect that these various strategies will result in at least one grievance mechanism adopted or improved ]</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">Cambodia (0): In late 2018, the EU has warned the government of Cambodia that the EU will withdraw the Everything But Arms (EBA) policy if the government of Cambodia fails to respect human rights, continues to oppress political activist and does not release the deputy president of the opposition party from prison. An EBA investigation will possibly be implemented (https://www.phnompenhpost.com/national/eu-officials-ending-eba-18-month-procedure). Kenya (0): Although Alternative Dispute Resolution committees are in place at the community level, there has not yet been any successful engagement with investors (0). NL (0): As a result of input given by ActionAid Netherlands into sector agreement processes, access to grievance mechanisms in the metal and wind energy sector has been discussed. Both sector agreement processes have not been concluded, it is therefore not yet clear whether grievance mechanisms will be set up or improved within these agreements. In draft texts there are references to the need to improve access to companies&#x2019; grievance mechanisms for victims of corporate abuse (0). ActionAid Netherlands took part in an internet consultation on Invest-NL, providing the Ministry of Economic Affairs &amp; Climate with input on how to make sure this new instrument includes a strong grievance mechanism for local stakeholders. Unfortunately this was not included in the instrument proposal (0). Zambia (2): ActionAid Zambia and its three partner organisations engaged three mining companies on women&#x2019;s economic and social empowerment to formalize engagement of women&#x2019;s movements. This resulted in one of the companies putting in place a mechanism to respond to community concerns, aspirations and values to ensure that basic needs are supported. They also made it a company policy to continuously engage with the community, and share information through the Community Advisory Committee, where women movements representatives are now also included (1). ActionAid Zambia and its partner organisations engaged with the Human Rights Commission and the Social Services Department of the government to establish a Human Rights Defenders Desk. As a result, the Desk was put in place at both the local and the provincial level. Communities can file complaints, and the Human Rights Commission deals with the issues related to human rights abuses. The Desk cannot make legal rulings, but it can advise on litigation, or can propose to engage with the involved stakeholders (1). Zimbabwe (0): Partner organisation ZELA convened a breakfast meeting to establish and strengthen grievance redress mechanisms in Mutoko with different stakeholders, including a foreign mining company whose operations residents have been aggrieved with at many instances. This was the company ZELA was most focused on. After the breakfast meeting on grievance redress mechanisms, it emerged that the company did not have a public relations office. They claimed to have an open-door policy where any grieved party may approach their manager on site, who is a foreign national. The meeting agreed that for language purposes the company should look into having a Public Relations or Liaison Officer who is a local person and they have agreed to resolve it by looking into possibilities of hiring a public relations officer. Further, ZELA will develop a grievance register for the company, that ZELA will be monitoring. This will take place in 2019 (0).</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">Kenya (2): ActionAid Kenya connected their partner to relevant media houses and they used the media to expose human and land rights violation by mining companies. Verifying the content, it was found that the CSR committee that was supposed to act as a bridge between the community and mining companies wasn&apos;t functioning properly. As a result the CSR committee was strengthened (1). ActionAid partner mobilized elders and sensitized them on cultural norms that affect women in the mining areas and the rights violations of female day-labourers taking place by the company staff members in the mines. The elders were then supported to hold a press conference. This was aired/ broadcasted on the TV prime news. As a result, the manager of the mine called a meeting with ActionAid&apos;s partner organisation and asked the organization to hold regular forums with workers of his mining company to discuss and improve labour rights and resolve the rights violations (1). Zimbabwe (2): ActionAid&apos;s partner supported communities to conduct an independent Environmental Impact Assessments (EIA). This was initiated between the Zimbabwe Environmental Management Agency (ZEMA) with the community based groups and is providing effective and efficient mechanisms to address grievances emanating from the operations of the mining companies in their areas which are not in compliance with the EIA report. The EIA of a local CBO, who are supported by ActionAid, are now recognized and adopted by ZEMA as an official EIA and they will be included in the EIA processes. This will enable CBO&#x2019;s to include community level grievances (1). ActionAid through their partner organisation also provided financial support for lawyers on a case they brought to the High Court. The High Court of Zimbabwe&#x2018;s interdict against ZCDC operations for non-compliance with EIA laws showcases the courts as an effective legal platform for CSOs and communities to seek for redress and for resolution of grievances with governments and companies regarding environmental and human rights impacts. This court case is a precedent for future similar court cases and thereby it can be used as a reference in court for other noncompliance of mining companies to EIA laws. This verdict has improved the High Court as a mechanism to resolve community&#x2019;s grievances with mining companies (1). Zambia (2): Established a regular liaison with Parliamentary committee on legal and human rights which will allow the mining communities and ActionAid to report cases of human rights violation to the committee through the Parliamentary Liaison committee. This came about after the submission on how communities are being affected my mining activities to the committee by ActionAid and the community representatives and this was followed up by training of parliamentary committee members by ActionAid on how they can harness their engagement with mining communities. The parliamentary committee visited the mining communities and the general complaint was the lack of grievance mechanism which then the committee offered as an alternative to the laid down procedures. The parliamentary committee has opened up access to the liaison office of the parliamentary committee so that communities can channel their grievances through them. (1) Under the Law Association of Zambia, a project has been established which focuses on providing women legal support to address human rights violations. This is a human right protection mechanism which ActionAid working with the other CSOs have been advocating for to ensure there is a protection mechanism which creates an enabling environment for local people especially women in accessing legal representation when their rights have been violated. The Law Association of Zambia have adopted this mechanism. The FGG has contributed to this development through its advocacy for Human Rights Defenders protection mechanisms. (1). Uganda (1): A Commission of Inquiry into Land Acquisition was established by government to resolve numerous land disputes in the country. ActionAid has interacted with the Commission by linking 2 communities with land disputes to the Commission and making their grievances known (1). Mozambique (3): In Mozambique the local government uses the Community Consultations as a mechanism through which communities can complain in case of violation of the boundaries of their land during the installation of an investment. In these consultations, usually only community leaders participated and the process was not transparent. Leaders used to sign the minutes of the consultations without deep knowledge of the areas to be explored and type of investment, and sometimes the leaders used to be corrupted by investors to release land. But due to the involvement of AAMoz Strategic partner&#x2019;s sensitization on FPIC , government has now adopted to strictly follow the policies. For example: a.) For the installation of a beverage factory, in addition to the community leaders and members of the advisory councils, the Government invited ActionAid&apos;s partner and other CSOs for the process of consultation. b.) In the framework of the implementation of the European Union-funded project, a company has set up a Project Implementation Committee in which ActionAid&apos;s partner, local government officials, company representatives, farmers&apos; representatives and European Union delegates take part. These meetings are monthly and participants use them to place complaints, land disputes, land conflicts cases, challenges in accessing DUAT among other concerns related to the impacts of the company operations. This was also a result of the pressure from AAMoz strategic partners. c.) An Investment Monitoring Committee in the agriculture sector was created in to monitor the investment in the agrarian sector, ensure community participation in the agricultural investment planning process in the district , ensuring compliance with agreements between investors and local communities and disseminate information on local investments.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">Zambia (3): 1. One of the mining companies in the project location has established a Community Liaison office to connect with the local community after several grievance reports were made through one of the AA partner organisations. The Community Liaison Office enforces interface with the local communities and the task force to deal with problems related to impact of mining on the community. A deliberate move has been made to provide for space for women inclusion on the Liaison committee between the community and the mining company. 2. In the 2nd project location the targeted mining company held meetings with AAZ partners to agree on the grievance procedure and feedback mechanism. As a result the Mining Company has provided for a contact person through whom grievances can be channeled and appointments have been made with the mine management to interact with relevant target groups. 3. In the 3rd project location the AA partner has facilitated the establishment of a stakeholders&#x2019; platform involving government departments, the Municipal Council, churches, media, national assembly local office, CSOs and community representatives. The platform was established to resolve communities&#x2019; issues coming from mining activities. The mining companies had refused to attend the platform meetings. As a result of this platform, the municipal council wrote a statement that the mining corporations should be responsive to the demand of communities that they should attend these platform meetings and to the grievances and demands from the communities. Zimbabwe (1): ActionAid&#x2019;s partner is a member of the Environmental Thematic Working group of the Zimbabwe Human Rights Commission. As a result, reports have been shared on the human rights violations in one of the project locations in a bid to strengthen their complaints handling mechanism. The Zimbabwe Humans Rights Commission has committed itself to investigate and take actions on the mining operations that are being done within people&#x2019;s homes and the assaults.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">Cambodia (1): A rubber company will improve the grievance mechanism it has for neighbouring communities to make it easier for them to access it, as a result of advocacy by ActionAid Cambodia and partner CCHR. ActionAid and CCHR will also continue to monitor the commitments of the company to implement policies related to human and worker rights (1). Kenya (3): As a result of lobbying and advocacy work at the county level by ActionAid Kenya and its partners TTHRW, MRF, CHRCE and KFA, trained CSO representatives will be included in the county-level Community Development Agreement committees for 3 mining companies. Through these committees, CSOs will be able to resolve their grievances with government and corporates (3). Netherlands (3): The Dutch National Contact Point (NCP) on OECD Guidelines will improve its focus on key issues such as women&#x2019;s rights and land, both in the way it handles complaints and in its communications, as a result of ActionAid Netherlands&#x2019; contribution (partly through our OECD Watch membership and partly through direct lobby inputs) to the debate on the role and functioning of the Dutch NCP, as well as the discussions around the Dutch government&#x2019;s duty of care (also in collaboration with MVO platform) (1). ActionAid Netherlands together with MVO platform and FGG partners will continue to advocate for the necessity of removing the barriers to justice for communities affected by corporate abuse, specifically within our advocacy focusing on mandatory due diligence legislation. As a result, we expect the Ministry of Foreign Affairs will adopt legislation that includes access to remedy for victims of corporate abuse to further this (1). The voluntary sector agreement on wind energy will include a strong grievance mechanism as a result of input for improved environmental, human and worker rights and involvement of ActionAid Netherlands in the negotiations on the agreement (1). ActionAid Netherlands together with MVO platform and FGG partners will set the agenda of the Ministry of Justice to improve legal mechanisms in order to take away barriers to justice for victims of corporate abuse. We do not expect this to result in a grievance mechanism in 2020 yet (0). Within international fora such as the UN and the OECD conversations will start on updating corporate accountability standards, such as the OECD guidelines and UN Guiding Principles. ActionAid will influence these guidelines, through targeted advocacy together with OECD Watch, MVO platform and FGG partners by taking part in public consultations on these guidelines, to include a strong gender focus and establish effective remedy. However, it will be too early in the process for the new guidelines to be implemented by governments in 2020 already (0). Uganda (1): Because of advocacy and lobbying work undertaken by Action Aid Uganda, its partners and other CSOs, the Ministry of Lands, Housing and Urban Development will introduce an amendment to the Land Acquisition Act. This amendment will establish the Land Acquisition Tribunal, which will handle disputes related to land grabbing and mass dispossession. It will enable litigants to access justice faster than going through the lengthy formal court system. Our target is that this amendment will be adopted in 2020 (1). Zambia (1): At least one mining company in the project regions will improve its grievance mechanism for affected families with damaged houses, making it easier for them to seek compensation. This will be the result of engagement meetings of ActionAid Zambia and partners with the mining companies on relocation of the affected households (1). Zimbabwe (5): In 2020, at least two mining companies will put grievance registers in place and at least two local Councils will improve their grievance registers by adding more companies. Through the grievance registers, communities can register their complaints in a structured way, they can monitor follow-ups and they can use the collected information in their lobby and advocacy for improved policies and practices. This will be the result of workshops facilitated by partner ZELA, where they stress the importance of local non-judicial grievance redress mechanisms at the local level. During these workshops, local communities, CSOs, Rural District Councils and mining companies are present to discuss solutions for human rights grievances (4). The Zimbabwe Human Rights Commission (ZHRC) will improve its complaint handling mechanism system as a result of human rights mobile clinics organized by partner organisation ZELA in the project areas. The ZHRC has limited capacity to access all communities to handle complaints, but the mobile clinics will make visits to the communities easier. This will allow the ZHRC to take up more human rights cases (1).</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">Zambia (6): ActionAid and the 3 local CSOs will engage mining companies to accommodate the social audit process conducted by the communities and are able to accept community reports based on findings form the use of score cards and companies are able to respond ActionAid and the 3 partners will engage mining companies to improve the implementation of their transparency policies and publish reports and present them to communities on the CSR projects undertaken for the development of the local communities. Zimbabwe (2): 1. The grievance redress mechanism platforms and engagement meetings organised by ActionAid&apos;s partner organisation involving the mining companies will emphasize the importance of companies taking concrete steps to prevent and mitigate adverse impacts of mining operations such as monthly monitoring reports. 2. The Independent environmental impact assessment community mechanism improved and introduced to new areas using lessons learnt by the Environmental Management Agency. This enables the communities to have access to the EIA reports and Environmental Management Plan of the Community which enables them to do work on the ground and report to the institution in order to take action on upholding the human rights. As a result it is expected that at least 1 mining company will better adhere to the EIA standards. Uganda (1) ActionAid will support its partner organisations to influence a corporation to improve their occupational hazards policy to minimize risks for employees. Bangladesh (2) We will organize meetings with the local governments and corporations/investors to promote the provision of appropriate livelihood options for those who have lost their livelihood due to the project investments.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">Bangladesh (1): As a result of evidence provided by ActionAid Bangladesh, a large international investor has put in place additional compensation measures and services for local communities that are affected by the operations of a coal-fired power plant in one of the project areas. ActionAid Bangladesh provided evidence on the impacts of the plant on livelihoods, and engaged an international NGO to put pressure on the investor. The investor met with ActionAid Bangladesh and communities in the area, and agreed with many of their demands regarding compensation and rehabilitation (1). Cambodia (0): In July 2018, Cambodia had a national election. Before, during and after the election the tension was very high, hindering project implementation. The opposition party was dissolved in November 2017, there was only one party who allegedly won by a landslide victory and installed a one-party parliament (0). NL (1): In December 2018, ActionAid Haiti and communities of farmers celebrated a major victory after their official complaint with the IADB grievance mechanism led to an agreement between companies and communities on resettlement compensation. ActionAid Netherlands provided support to this case in the form of research, funding, advice and awareness raising (1). ActionAid Netherlands pushed with the energy companies that are part of the sector agreement to improve their due diligence policies and reporting. Due to our push, the covenant parties hired an external party to evaluate the due diligence policies and practices in order for the companies to improve their standards. This however did not yet result into a practice changed in 2018 (0). Uganda (1): A flower farm put in place an occupational hazards policy that focuses on minimizing risks of exposure to chemical burns such as precautions for entering an area, dress code etc. and remedies that can be given to victims in the event of such a hazard happening. This includes immediate first aid, such as victims being taken to the clinic. ActionAid Uganda began engaging with women in the flower farms in 2016 after they were exposed to chemical poisoning in the farm. Since 2016, two capacity development exercises have been held for the union members who work in the flower farm on organizing and advocacy. Their capacity in demanding for a policy was strengthened hence this result (1). Zambia (6): ActionAid Zambia capacitated its three partners on social audits, and the partners engaged three mining companies on these issues, also involving communities by presenting them with the report cards that were generated during the social audit processes. The engagements saw a number of noticeable results: - One mining company responded on the water supply issues raised by communities and set up several meetings with them to solve the issue (1). - The same mining company also took action on the results from the social audit report that showed that women in the mining communities are not economically empowered, by setting up income-generating projects for women related to &#x2018;green charcoal&#x2019;. Another mining company, also pledged to set up projects to mitigate the high unemployment rate, but has not taken concrete steps yet (1). - All three mining companies now set up meetings once every six months to discuss the results from the social audit reports, and how to mitigate identified problems (3). ActionAid Zambia&#x2019;s partners participated in in Provincial Alternative Mining Indabas, supported by ActionAid, where they engaged mining companies, government representatives and CSOs. As a result of these engagements and engagements on the local level, one mining company is now sharing its corporate social responsibility reports as well as social policies, for example related to resettlement, with the partners and the community. Also, the mining company has set up constant engagement mechanisms (1). Zimbabwe (1): Communities in one of the project regions where environmental monitors were trained have been doing independent environmental human rights monitoring in mining areas in 3 wards. Two mining companies have been reportedly working closely with communities and community monitors to ensure less grievances on environmental issues and human rights issues. The monitors have managed to bring the new investors to order through bringing them before the traditional leaders for violations inclusive of cultural rights, land rights and environmental rights (1).</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">Bangladesh (4): In 2019 three corporate companies (1)3) and one investor (3) will (partially) adopt the UNGP on Business and Human Rights and adhere to its guidelines in internal and external management processes. AA Bangladesh will contribute to this by facilitating meetings, fora and media to insist on accountable corporate arrangements. It is anticipated that the amended corporate arrangements will alleviate negative social, gender and environmental impacts on affected communities. Cambodia (1): A major mining and trade company will be sensitized about and internally discuss the negative impact of their operations in the MDS SEZ as a consequence of the follow up discussions with the company, facilitated by ActionAid Cambodia and organisational partners based on their research findings in the area (1). Kenya (1): One company will install dust arresters to prevent and mitigate pollution because of mining activities in the area of Kishushe which are causing health problems to neighboring communities. In this process, ActionAid will continue to facilitate multi-stakeholders discussion to push other mining companies to fix dust arresters until it is done, and thereby combat adverse social, gender and environmental impacts (1). Netherlands (1): &#x2022; At least 1 Dutch company, for example in the wind energy sector, will execute stronger human rights due diligence in its supply chain policies, as a result of ActionAid&#x2019;s engagement with companies in the energy, agriculture, financial and other natural resources related sectors on different standards related to human rights, during for example government-led Multi-Stakeholder Dialogues (1). &#x2022; As part of our broader strategy to improve corporate practices, ActionAid will support our Southern partner organisations as well as communities in claiming their rights around specific cases for which they request our support. No specific target is set here, as this support is not clear yet (0). Uganda (2): &#x2022; As a result of ActionAid Uganda and partners&#x2019; engagement, we expect one company to reduce the employment of underage children in its operations (1). &#x2022; As a result of increased advocacy at the national and international level by ActionAid Uganda and other CSOs, we expect one company to introduce better mechanisms of handling chemicals at its farms as a way of reducing chemical poisoning (1). Zambia (1): At least one mining company will buy silica directly from local women instead of from middlemen. This will contribute to local women getting a fair price for their products. This step is the result of advocacy work of women, supported by ActionAid Zambia and its partners (1). Zimbabwe (2): &#x2022; ActionAid&apos;s partner organisation will facilitate dialogue meetings on sustainable mining and grievance redress mechanisms with mining companies. In these meetings, the partner will emphasize the importance of companies taking concrete steps to prevent and mitigate adverse impacts of mining operations, for example in the form of monthly monitoring reports. As a result of these dialogues, it is expected that at least 1 company will improve its practices to rehabilitate the mining area (1). &#x2022; The independent EIA community mechanism was improved and introduced to new areas using lessons learnt by the Environmental Management Agency (EMA). It will enable community monitors to have access to EIA reports and Environmental Management Plans. This will make it easier for community monitors to work on the ground and report to the EMA on human rights violations. Combined with ActionAid&apos;s partner organisation&#x2019;s trainings, lobby and advocacy, and the won court case in 2017, it is expected that at least 1 mining company will better adhere to the EIA standards and will implement them correctly (1).</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">Bangladesh (10): Matarbari: (i) CPGCBL and JICA have handed over the rehabilitation building project for displaced families. 30 family already shifted to the new houses out of 45 families. CPGCBL also paid each family 3000tk for shifting their belongings, (ii) Provided jobs for 42 displaced family members out of 45, (iii) Matarbari Union Parishad (MUP) has built a water drainage system (second pipeline) through support by CPGCBL, (iv) 620 displaced workers out of 1150 (enlisted) has compensated by CPGCBL each 2,80,000 taka. (v) Around 1200+ local workers employed by construction companies of Matarbari CPP based on recommendation of JICA and CPGCBL, (vi) 400 affected land owner received additional compensation for livelihood each 220000tk from CPGCBL. (vii) Provided one stop service for distribute compensation by CPGCBL through a compensation fair organized by CPGCBL and JICA, (viii) Construction works of alternative road has started for carrying goods of Matarbari CPP by R&amp;H, CPGCBL and JICA, (ix) CPGCBL reviewed land price and given top-up compensation for land which increased 3 times of previous rate. Disbursed top-up 300+ affected land owner out of 800+. (x) SUMITOMO and CPGCBL started dredging Koheliya river, although more needs to be done. All this was achieved in large part by coninuous lobbying and advocacy work by AA Bangladesh and the affected communities supported by AA Bangladesh. Zambia (3): ActionAid Zambia and its partners strengthened the capacity of Human Rights Defenders to enable them to engage with mining companies on violations of human rights. The HRDs then put pressure on a company to safeguard communities&#x2019; rights to water. As a result, the company resumed the water project that they had suspended after accusations from the community that the mine was polluting the water. The water project will ensure that communities have regular access to drinking water (1). One mining company has opened its doors for local women to sell silica directly to the company, which shows a change in behavior. Unfortunately, the local women need mining licenses from the government to sell the commodity, and this process takes a long time. ActionAid Zambia and its partner have lobbied to the company to take this step, and are now helping the women cooperatives to obtain an exploration license, which is the first step towards obtaining the full license (1). ActionAid Zambia and its partner held youth meetings on economic empowerment and entrepreneurship which requires people to be industrious and be self-employed. The partner invited the mining company to be part of the process so that they can support the youth. Through this engagement, the mining company then offered support by organizing a green charcoal production project and trained women and youth on how to venture into this project. Now youth and women are engaging on green charcoal production and earning a livelihood (1).</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">Kenya (1): ActionAid partner mobilized elders and sensitized them on cultural norms that affect women in the mining areas and the rights violations of female day-labourers by the company&#x2019;s staff members. To put this on the agenda of the relevant duty-bearers, the elders were supported by ActionAid&apos;s partner to hold a press conference. This was aired/ broadcasted on the TV prime news (1). As a result, the manager of the mining company (1) called a meeting with ActionAid&apos;s partner and asked the organization to hold forums with workers of his company to discuss labour rights. Zimbabwe (1): The recent EIA public consultation meetings held by a mining company on its proposed diamond exploration activities showcases concrete steps by the state owned enterprise to identify, prevent and mitigate environmental impacts that could potentially emanate from its operations. The consultation meetings were a result of the court case on the company&apos;s Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA). ActionAid&apos;s partner organisation supported a local CBO to file the case and supported their participation in the court case, as well as provided legal aid. This can also be attributed to the case against the company currently before the courts on the failure by the company to conduct the EIA process. Zambia (4): A mining company through the local council commenced the closing and fencing off of the trenches that were left unprotected which had been a threat to small children. ActionAid and its partner organisation have been engaging with the local council and the company. Last year ActionAid and its partner presented a petition to the Minister of Mines and this year the council moved on site to start fencing off and burying the pits left by mining (1) Mining companies have been made to make contribution payments to the Environment Protection Fund on a quarterly basis to the local council. In the past, mining companies were not consistent and sometimes they closed mines after years without addressing the mining physical impact. The local councils in the two mining areas also welcomed demands for setting up of environmental management committees with inclusion of CSOs which is a subcommittee of the District Development Committee to monitor remittance by mining companies but also provide technical guidance to the DDCCC in the best way to use the Environmental Protection Fund. ActionAid&apos;s partners engaged with two mining companies to advocate for the companies to send regular remittances to the Environment Protection Fund while the mine is still in operation. This will ensure that there is funding for rehabilitation of the region after the mining activities have stopped. (2) ActionAid&apos;s partner together with a local university conducted water research and reported violation of human rights. The investigations outcomes indicated that ZEMA was not consistent with providing oversight to mining companies and that mining companies needed to become more transparent in the process of conducting internal water quality assessments. The stakeholders platform of CSOs has since made proposals to ZEMA to provide updates to the community every quarter on the state of water quality. The mining company has accommodated the proposal to periodically engage with local council and the Health department as a way of transparently conducting water tests. ZEMA has also committed to be consistent in conducting spontaneous checks. (1) Uganda (1): Various organisations, including ActionAid, have put pressure on a flower company from 2016 onwards which resulted in the below practice changes in 2017. The flower company from which over 80 women were involved in an accident after a chemical exposure has been able to introduce some policy safeguards to ensure the employees&#x2018; rights are respected and upheld. - The company committed to treat all the women who were exposed to the dangerous chemical in November 2016. - The company appointed a female doctor who will diagnose the women and give an independent report from that which the company has (initially the company had denied that the women were exposed to a dangerous chemical). - The company has begun putting in place safety measures for its employees such as protective gears (1). Mozambique (1): LANDESA is an American organization linked to the Illovo group. Illovo is a wholly owned subsidiary of Associated British Foods and is the largest producer of sugarcane in Africa. The company recently committed to protecting land rights throughout its supply chain with a zero tolerance for land ownership policy. In this context, Illovo has published its own Guidelines on Land and Land Rights (Land Guidelines) and a Road Map, which aims to support Illovo to implement its commitments, create a Land Policy Roundtable Committee, promote transparency and share the lessons learned. After taking these initial steps to improve the protection of land rights in its operations, Illovo now intends to move from commitments to practice, taking the next step to operationalize its commitments. In Mozambique, the Aqueduct of Maragra took another step and selected AAMoz strategic partner to support in this process of transition from commitment to practice. ActionAid partner&apos;s role is to evaluate the direct and indirect impacts of land investments, environmental, social, human rights and gender impacts arising from land investments and propose alternative practical means of action. ActionAid&apos;s partner organisation was invited to become a partner of LANDESA after a meeting that ActionAid&apos;s partner organized to present the research report on the impact of large investments on small producers, in 2017.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">Zambia (1): A partner organisation of ActionAid Zambia put pressure on one of the copper/nickel mining companies to support communities to mitigate their growing food insecurity that was caused by their relocation (which meant smaller plots of land to grow food). Because of the pressure from the partner organisation the mining company now support communities through conservation agriculture (including training and giving out better seeds). This helps people to produce more food on smaller plots of land.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">In one country, ActionAid and partners will influence at least one company in a natural-resource based sector to implement a stronger due diligence policy. As a result of ActionAid and its partners pressure, mining corporations in one country will mitigate adverse social, gender and environmental impacts of their activities as part of their environmental impact assessment. They will also strengthen workplace policies with focus on social and gender issues and their community engagement offices. This will result in at least 2 concrete steps taken by the targeted corporations.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">Cambodia (1): AAC and CCHR will work together to encourage a rubber company to implement and act on its grievance mechanism and sustainability policy. The community people will be consulted in order to assess whether the policy is improved, transparent and accessible or not (1). Kenya (2): ActionAid Kenya and partners MRF and TTHRW will lobby salt companies. As a result, they will open blocked access roads and provide protective gears to workers (1). A mining company will fit dust arresters (1). Netherlands (1): As part of our women&#x2019;s rights campaign, ActionAid Netherlands will engage with business women and corporations on the gendered impacts of their activities. As a result we expect at least one corporation will take concrete steps to identify, prevent and mitigate adverse gender impacts of their activities in their supply chains, such as implementing the OECD guidelines (1). Uganda (2): Because of ActionAid Uganda and partners&#x2019; engagement with a coffee company, we expect it to reduce the employment of underage children in the coffee farms (1). People have been evicted from their land for a coffee plantation without their consent and without proper compensation. The community has waged a long-standing battle against this, including a case that is now in court. ActionAid Uganda its partners have consistently supported the community in their struggle. We expect that the owners of the plantation will now work together with the affected communities in a mediation process in order to find a solution for the evictions (1). Zambia (2): At least one mining company will engage women for the fair access and sustainable utilization of land and natural resources within the women&#x2019;s vicinity and harness women&#x2019;s capacity to protect their rights. This step is the result of advocacy work of women, supported by ActionAid Zambia and its partners (1). One mining company will be transparent on its acid plant business operation and relocation of the affected households, partly as a result of ActionAid Zambia&#x2019;s activities together with the partner on engaging the local government and the mine on issues of pollution (1). Zimbabwe (2): At least one mining company will improve its practices to rehabilitate the mining area as a result of grievance redress mechanism platforms and engagement meetings organized by ActionAid&#x2019;s partner organisation ZELA. ZELA will also continue to monitor other commitments of companies made during these meetings (1). At least one mining company will better adhere to the Environmental Impact Assessment standards and will implement them correctly. This is the result of ZELA&#x2019;s continued work in training community monitors, so that they can track companies&#x2019; performance and report misconduct to the Environmental Management Agency, which adds pressure to the companies to behave correctly (1).</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">AA NL (1): The Tanzanian government has decided to shelve the Bagamoyo investment, which ActionAid criticized in a report and outreach effort in 2015. AA NL contributed to this report and to facilitating dialogue between different parties, including donors and government. The decision by the government means the land of the community will not be taken for this investment, but further protection of their rights is needed. Zambia(1): Through a petition by the community (supported by AA partner) to the Minister of Mines, the Zambian Environmental Management Agency (ZEMA) was instructed to speed up the investigations and provide feedback to the people on the way forward. ZEMA has responded favorably by instituting investigations and has committed itself to making the results on water pollution investigations public before the end of February 2017. Kenya (2): 1. in 2016 one of the mining companies was expanding its operations exposing a nearby school to lots of dust. Parents in the school had to withdraw their children from the school. The community led by a partner organisation developed a petition that was taken to the Director General for National Environmental Management Authority by women. The DG came to the ground and the expansion was stopped. 2. ActionAid supported communities in another project location to develop a Charter of Demands regarding the investments of one of the bigger international agricultural farms. This Charter outlines the negative impact of the investments on the water conditions and communities and proposes steps forward on how to resolve the issues. This proposal was discussed at county and national level by policy makers and resulted in the lease for the Farm not be renewed.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">Zambia (1): ActionAid Zambia and its 3 partner organisations will engage with government to influence enforcement of the Environmental Impact Assessment and rehabilitation plans to minimize the impact of mining on communities. This will also allow for communities voice in determining the conditions to investors. It is expected that the EIA and rehabilitation plans will be enforced by government in 2018. Zimbabwe (4): The policy dialogue platforms organised at the national and local level by ActionAid&apos;s partner organisation will bring together government departments to develop joint quarterly compliance monitoring visits in mining areas aimed at actively identifying, preventing and mitigating adverse impacts of corporation activities. ActionAid&apos;s partner organisation will provide trainings on Environmental Impact Assessments (EIA) for communities and government and will propose to government that they need to ensure that corporations will correctly implement such environmental impact assessments. Kenya (1): ActionAid will promote to County Governments to introduce the exclusive liability principle in investments agreements to hold corporates fully responsible for any pollution or damage arising from their investments/operations. ActionAid and its partner organisations will partner with a research institution to conduct water testing to inform advocacy actions. Further, ActionAid and its partner organisations will engage the environmental tribunal to ensure fully implementation of the Environmental Management and Coordination Act of 1999. Lastly, ActionAid and its partner organisations will seek access to remedy for communities and with women survivors of human-wildlife conflict. We anticipate the government will establish a taskforce to independently look into the violations and prescribe measure by key players to prevent negative impacts of corporate activities. Netherlands (1): ActionAid will continue to lobby for the importance of taking into account human rights (OECD guidelines/ UNGP), land rights (incl VGGT and FPIC) and gender in investments and supply chains, including around trade missions organised by the Dutch government and embassies.

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">Bangladesh (1): ActionAid Bangladesh and local communities engaged with the local government about the problems related to water logging in one of the project areas. As a result of these engagements, the local governments has taken steps to help solve the problems, such as the removal of excess water from certain areas (1). Cambodia (0): In July 2018, Cambodia had a national election. Before, during and after the election the tension was very high, hindering project implementation. The opposition party was dissolved in November 2017, there was only one party who allegedly won by a landslide victory and installed a one-party parliament (0). Kenya (2): As a result of the 2 community declarations on mining presented at the National Mining Baraza, and as a ripple effect of the executive order by the Principal Secretary for Mining (also in response to the declaration) that the Country artisanal miners&#x2019; association be disbanded and reconstituted with 3 artisanal miners as members, the county developed investment guidelines highlighting bare minimums for any mining company that wants to invest in the county. ActionAid Kenya and partners contributed by training communities in their basic understanding of rights, leading discussions centered on the generation and framing of aspirations and consolidating them into declarations, and by negotiating space for communities at the National Baraza to present the declaration (1). ActionAid Kenya&#x2019;s partner arranged a discussion between a delegation of mining-affected communities and the Area Senator, after which the Senator called a public meeting attended by management of the associated mining company, elected leaders, and communities. From the deliberations, a public participation memorandum was agreed and signed between the community and the company, outlining critical short-term and long-term issues that the company should address (1). Zambia (1): ActionAid Zambia and its three partners engaged with ZEMA, the local authorities of two regions and other government departments on the need to enforce Environmental Impact Assessments (EIAs) and rehabilitation plans to minimize the impact of mining on communities. As a result of the engagement, local authorities incorporated EIAs into their strategic plans and in their environmental committee priorities, meaning that EIAs and rehabilitation plans are enforced at the local level (1). Zimbabwe (1): ZELA trained community paralegals and environmental monitors on Environmental Impact Assessments (EIA) and their implementations. Their work managed to unearth and document some of the evils that some of the companies were being involved in. ZELA produced a documentary on these issues that the community monitors had identified and it was entitled &#x201C;Communities rights first: The State of Business and Human rights in mining&#x201D; and can be found at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_cmxlprbX8. The documentary captured the work of community paralegals and environmental monitors and some of the advocacy work and monitoring issues they challenged and managed to record positives out of it. The documentary was played on national television 2 times and it managed to pressure the government to react to the issues raised. In reaction to the documentary, the Ministry of Mines issued an order stopping all mining operations along Zvishavane highway and replaced the lenient regulations with stiffer chrome mining regulations to ensure environmental protection (1).</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">Bangladesh (9): &#x2022; The District Commissioner (DC), the sub-district level water board (UNO), the local water board and the local Department of Environment will identify the impact of their work on communities due to their project implementations. This is a consequence of continuous meetings and pressure from social media deriving from advocacy work of ActionAid Bangladesh, HRDs and other partner NGOs. Concrete steps such as the implementation of compensation for displaced and forced unemployed people, the provision of training for alternative money generating activities and an adequate rehabilitation packages will be delivered by those agencies (4). &#x2022; The Ministry of Land, the Ministry of Industry, the Ministry of Forest and Environment, the power plant company and the Cabinet Division will adopt and implement guidelines on business and human rights regulations pertaining to labour rights, compensation or resettlement arrangements and a rehabilitation mechanism on behalf of the affected community by the power plant in the Matarbari area. This process is supported by ActionAid Bangladesh&#x2019;s lobby activities towards the government and joint identification of mechanisms to address social and environmental impacts on communities of the power plant and other major infrastructural developments (5). Cambodia (1): In 2019, the authorities will organize meetings and public consultations on the possible creation of a National Action Plan (NAP) for the implementation of the UNGPs on business and human rights, to which all relevant stakeholders from the public and private sectors will be able to participate. Particular attention will be given to gender representation and gender equality within the NAP policy, the access of women and minorities&#x2019; to an effective remedy will and to women&#x2019;s participation at early stages of development process of the NAP (1). Kenya (1): ActionAid Kenya will lobby to the National Environmental Management Authority (NEMA) to tighten and strengthen adherence to the Environmental Impact Assessments (EIA) guidelines it its operatons. Currently, EIAs for proposed projects have not been inclusive and participatory. It is foreseen that NEMA will take those concrete steps, which will prevent and mitigate adverse environmental impacts of corporate activities (1). Netherlands (1): ActionAid will continue to lobby for the importance of taking into account human rights (OECD guidelines/UNGP), land rights (incl. VGGT and FPIC) and gender in investments and supply chains, including around trade missions organised by the Dutch government and embassies. We aim to see the Dutch government (especially the Ministry of Foreign Affairs/DGIS, DGBEB, embassies and RVO) actively identifying potential risks, raising awareness (or even building capacities) and promoting solutions and guidelines towards companies and key stakeholders. We expect that as a result at least one of the bodies mentioned will take concrete steps to make trade missions more human and women&#x2019;s rights focused or will introduce new tools to ensure better and gender sensitive due diligence (1). Zambia (1): In 2019, the local government will take steps to better implement existing policies and procedures for ensuring communities&#x2019; rights to education and health in areas affected by mining companies and will put in place policy guidelines on how to implement those. This is partly the result of ActionAid Zambia and its partners&#x2019; continued lobby activities (1).</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">Bangladesh (4): Government bodies have taken concrete steps in Matarbari and Bagerhat. Matarbari: JICA and CPGCBL have begun initiatives to resolve issues raised by the community in the Matarbari area, although they have not yet done enough (1). Bagerhat: (i) REB (Rural Electrification Board) Bangladesh has stopped the transmission line over the Chapatala village in Bagerhat. This high voltage (440kb) line could cause unwanted accidents and be harmful for the community environment, (ii) DC office reviewed and increased land price for Rampal airport, (iii) DC Bagerhat ensured one stop service for affected people of Rampal airport through hearing process (3). AA Bangladesh and the affected communities supported by AA Bangladesh lobbied and advocated for this. The Netherlands (2): The Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs revised the corporate accountability guidelines for Embassies to make sure corporations supported by Embassies actively, identify, prevent and mitigate adverse impacts of their activities. These guidelines are also already implemented. ActionAid Netherlands in collaboration with MVO platform advocated for this (1). The Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs revised its guidelines on trade missions to include attention for (women&#x2019;s) land rights, and already put this in practice during the trade mission to Nigeria. This was the result of a presentation of the Women Land Rights group, which ActionAid Netherlands is part of, at the Ministry to highlight risks of land grabbing and violations of women&#x2019;s rights (1). Uganda (2): ActionAid Uganda and its partners have continued to support the development of lobby and advocacy capacities of the Kaweri people. With these skills, they have managed to successfully speak up and seek justice for their land through different avenues i.e. court, media, advocacy and petitions. As a result on 13 December the Attorney General offered to compensate them fully for their land and properties lost in 2001 during the eviction (1). ActionAid Uganda&#x2019;s continuous engagement with The Ministry of Lands, Housing &amp; Urban Development has led to the withdrawal of the Land Acquisition Bill pending amendments in order to deal with the concerns that AAIU and partners have raised during the year. These concerns were mainly related to the rights of women to land. (1). Zambia (1): ActionAid Zambia and its partner trained paralegal officers on policies and laws related to health and education in communities affected by mining, so that they could then perform social audits on education in their communities. They showed the results during interface meetings with the District Education Board Secretaries. As a result, the government has taken steps to better implement the existing policies and respect the rights of communities affected by mining, for example by recruiting qualified teachers in rural communities and providing learning materials (1). Zimbabwe (2): The Environmental Management Authority (EMA) in Zimbabwe issued an order to a mining company to rehabilitate the environment before decommissioning their operations, in accordance with the Environmental Management Act. This was the result of several complaints by community monitors, trained by ActionAid Zimbabwe&#x2019;s partner ZELA (1). The Zimbabwe Human Rights Commission (ZHRC) has conducted independent investigations after complaints about mining companies were filed by environmental monitors, trained by ActionAid Zimbabwe&#x2019;s partner ZELA. The ZHRC also shared the outcomes of its investigations with the communities, to support them in their efforts for proper redress. Both an investigation and sharing results never happened before (1).</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">Kenya (2): Joint work by ActionAid and Kenya National Commission on Human Rights, the independent advisory body of government on Human Rights, on protection of HRDs brought to the attention of KNCHR the various HR violations in the mining sector. As a result, KNCHR instituted a public enquiry into the HR violations (1). ActionAid led partner organisations and community groups to reflect on the community land law 2016. Using knowledge acquired from this process, one community stopped grabbing of their land by the area Chief who had secretly registered a group ranch and leased the land to a company for grazing. The communities quickly assembled, organized, assembled evidence and reported to the county commissioner (president representative in the county). The county commissioner got the community and the chief together and questioned about his action. The chief is now put to trial and the community land was not leased to the company. This is a result from communities knowing their land rights (1). Zimbabwe (1): A mining company&#x2019;s Environmental Impact Assessment reports were not approved by the Zimbabwe Environmental Management Agency based on that the report did not show evidence of community consultation, participation and consent. Also the EIA report was not clear on relocations and compensation procedures by the company. However, the company proceeded to mine without the legal EIA report and this led ActionAid&apos;s partner CBO, with support of another partner organisation, to take the mining company to court on behalf of the community. The High Court of Zimbabwe interdicted against the mining operations for non-compliance with EIA laws. The Zimbabwe government also took steps to improve the engagement of communities in EAI assessment processes. The Zimbabwe Environmental Management Agency now actively supports and includes community participation in the EIA processes. Also community level EIA are now officially recognized. Zambia (4): Based on the advocacy by ActionAid with its partners, the Zambia Environmental Management Agency (ZEMA) has agreed to be providing updates and engaging with local communities on quarterly basis. This engagement is also aimed at strengthening the participation of local communities in the EIA processes. This enhanced engagement led to ZEMA demanding from the mining companies to start rehabilitation of the mine sites in which they are no longer active. (1) As a result from the advocacy actions of ActionAid and partners in 2016, ZEMA has improved their government practices in 2017. They have improved their transparency of the impact of the mining companies activities on water. ZEMA managed to get back to the community to give feedback as facilitated by ActionAid and its partner and explains on the issues of water testing and now they are sharing the water test results which was not the case before. There is a stakeholder platform which brings together mining companies and local government to hold interface meetings on issues of human rights violations. (1) ActionAid&apos;s partner organisation together with a local university conducted water research and reported violation of human rights. The investigations outcomes indicated that ZEMA was not consistent with providing oversight to mining companies and that mining companies needed to become more transparent in the process of conducting internal water quality assessments. The stakeholders platform of CSOs has since made proposals to ZEMA to provide updates to the community every quarter on the state of water quality. The mining company has accommodated the proposal to periodically engage with local council and the Health department as a way of transparently conducting water tests. These periodic engagement have started in 2017. ZEMA has also committed to be consistent in conducting spontaneous checks. (1) The parliamentary committee, as part of the public hearings for communities affected by mining, established engagement with mining companies to follow up on reports of non-compliance leading to pollution and mistreatment of workers. ActionAid together with three partner organisations made a proposal to the parliamentary committee not to make this engagement with the mining company as a one time off event but that it should be a continuous process. The committee committed itself by opening up access to the liaison office for the parliamentary committee so that communities can channel their grievances. The parliamentary committee collected the grievances about the corporate conduct of the mining companies expressed during the meetings and produced a report and presented it at the national assembly for discussions about the next steps. (1) Uganda (1): ActionAid partnerorganisation conducted trainings on nonviolent activism for community activists. The citizen awareness caused them to rise against a proposed corporate body, company and they resisted forceful land grabbing for sugar cane growing without government or the company following due process. As a result of the training for communities community actions following the trainings, the government has had to change its course of action on the same piece of land while the investor has decided to withdraw and lost interest in the area (1). Netherlands (2) Members of the MFA extractives team started to actively refer to women&#x2019;s rights in mineral supply chains following regular engagement with AANL via the WG; moreover, Dutch MFA successfully pushed for a gender meeting at an OECD minerals forum following these engagements (1). Team members also gave general presentations referring to women&#x2019;s rights in the presence of corporate actors to improve their due diligence on gender issues. The Dutch embassy in Uganda has taken steps to address shrinking space and its impact on an enabling environment for responsible corporate conduct in, including sending a letter to the Ugandan government together with other EU member states, engaging in dialogue and raising this issue in trade missions (1 ).</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">ActionAid will support government to change their practices by actively implementing at least one policy (FPIC, VGGT, or other) that will prevent or mitigate human (and environmental) rights abuses. (1) ActionAid and its partners will actively influence government bodies so that they will enforce mining corporations to undertake comprehensive and consultative Environment Impact Assessment based on the adverse impacts on the communities due to previous mining activities. With this pressure of government the companies will further put in place policies and practices on business and human rights that will benefit communities and the environment. (2) ActionAid and its partners will also pressure government in one country to enforce penalties on violations by mining corporations and to hold consultative meetings with communities. (2) As a result of pressure created by citizens due to AA work, government in one country will also improve the level of transparency in the land administration though implementation of the land policy. ActionAid will also support government to improve the functioning and capacity of the land administration. (2)</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">Bangladesh (1): As a result of lobby activities by a number of NGOs, JICA (a Japanese government agency and investor) will take concrete steps to identify, prevent and mitigate adverse social, gender and environmental impacts in the region. The community has submitted several documents with demands to JICA, and JICA will resolve at least one of the mentioned issues in 2020, for example related to water logging (1). Cambodia (1): The National Authority on Land Depute Resolution is one of the government bodies to implement and resolve land conflicts for affected community people. This national authority has stepped in to try and resolve a the long-standing land dispute in a community supported by ActionAid; the target is that this will be achieved. This would be a result of years of community action and AAC and partners will have contributed to this result through years of advocacy work and support to affected people (1). Kenya (1): ActionAid Kenya and partners TTHRW, MRF, CHRCE, KFA will lobby the National Environment Management Authority to enforce the Environment Management and Coordination Act 1999 requiring environmental impact assessments/audits be conducted to ascertain impacts of projects on the environment. We anticipate the government will enforce the polluter pays principle and the remedy principles (1). Netherlands (2): In 2019 the Ministry of Foreign Affairs changed policies relating to corporate conduct within government support, specifically within trade missions and the financial support framework for corporations: attention to Human Rights Due Diligence is now a standard element in trade missions. ActionAid Netherlands in collaboration with MVO Platform will continue to engage and monitor implementation and as a result, we expect to see the government organize and facilitate meetings in the Netherlands and abroad that include the voices of civil society and other stakeholders concerned by corporate conduct (1). The Ministry of Foreign Affairs will more actively monitor the implementation of the VGGTs, Women&#x2019;s Land Rights and Free, Prior and Informed Consent (FPIC) through for example the Land@Scale programme, trade missions or through the Multi-Stakeholder Dialogue on Land, partly as a result of ActionAid Netherlands&#x2019; lobby (1). Roving Advisor (2): At least two Human Rights Commissions (in Zambia, Zimbabwe and/or Uganda) will extend their mandates to investigate cases of human rights violations from corporate activities, and will provide appropriate steps to ensure perpetrators are accountable. This step will be the result of advocacy by the ActionAid offices in the countries, who will be able to do this based on training and knowledge provided by the Roving Advisor (2). Uganda (1): As a result of media, monitoring and mobilization work of ActionAid Uganda and its partners, the Wildlife Authority will no longer use violent means in order to evict people from their lands in certain areas (1). Zambia (1): In 2020, the local government (Mufulira Municipality, Kalumbila Town Council) will take concrete steps in ensuring communities in areas affected by mining companies have access to education and health services. This is partly the result of ActionAid Zambia and its partners&#x2019; continued lobby activities (1).</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">AA NL (3): - AA NL worked with AA South Africa to facilitate a multi-stakeholder mission with representatives of Dutch ports, energy companies and the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs. During the visit to coal mines and mining communities, through which colleagues from AASA, members from a women&apos;s group on community rights as well as members from the community organization enhanced their insights in how these Dutch representatives are linked to the violations in coal mining in South Africa, and how lobby work targeting these actors can be enhanced (0: AASA not a LLMIC). -AA NL supported ActionAid Uganda in establishing embassy relations, shared information on flower and land sector, and provided input on research plans resulting in increased networks and capacity for research and advocacy on corporate accountability in the flower sector in Uganda (1). -AA NL supported AA Haiti financially, and with research and strategic capacity towards the development of a complaint, strategy and documentation in relation to a land grab case through sending letters to company &amp; developing a complaint to IADB which was submitted in Jan 2017)(1) Cambodia (10): Ten CSOs, including CBOs, from 2 provinces lobbied and advocated their (local)government for responsible corporate conduct, on the basis of knowledge, skills, networks and resources which resulted from: a) 2 ToT-training sessions on advocacy skills, HRD security, the UNGPs, OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises, and the FAO&#x2019;s VGGT, organized by partners , and 2) the provision of a small advocacy grant which was provided by partners to the project community- to advocate for getting their land rights addressed. L&amp;A activities include closed door meetings at local, provincial and ministry level with government representatives and donors like the EU-delegation, and it includes outreach to general public, e.g. through radio talk shows, providing interviews to journalists, and developing 2 documentaries to highlight human rights issue on the ground. Zambia (3): AA Zambia organized training for partners in lobby and advocacy about strategizing to engage around the mining issues with corporations and government. The 3 implementing partners have been participating in District Development Coordinating Committee (DDCC) meetings in their districts. They have used the DDCC as advocacy and lobbying platforms on water pollution, implementation of mitigation plans (after mining phase) etc. Kenya (4): 6 CSOs have been trained by ActionAid Kenya on the Human Rights Based Approach and Organizational Development while linking them with national actors and actions. At the network level, AAK engagement with several CSOs enabled cross-learning from each other. In 2016, 4 CSOs have used their strengthened skills to lobby and advocate for more responsible corporate conduct, such as the implementation of an FPIC, stopping the expansion of the salt mining area, demanding government to conduct an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA), including women in the management of group ranches, advocating for more respect of the rights of communities to determine their development pathway, observe FPIC, and conduct EIA. Zimbabwe (4): During the Manicaland Alternative Mining Indaba and the Zimbabwe Alternative Mining Indaba (ZAMI) there where breakaway sessions organized on business and human rights. During the sessions, as well as at local and national policy engagement platforms AA Zimbabwe together with other CSOs provided training on the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights as a means to ensure responsible corporate conduct especially in host communities. 4 community based groups in 4 FGG mining areas gained knowledge on business and human rights through these sessions. During the ZAMI the CSOs developed a declaration which they have since used for their advocacy activities. They have used this declaration and their enhanced knowledge to influence and assist the Environmental Management Agency in monitoring the Environmental Impact Assessments and reporting violations. One of the CBOs also lobbied the Ministry of Mines on the impact of mining and the forced relocations of communities in the mining areas.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">Cambodia (6): ActionAid&apos;s partner organisation will support local communities, CBOs and CSOs to understand their human rights according to the UNGPs, OECD and VGGT and domestic complaint mechanisms. Zambia (1): ActionAid will support its partner organisation and the community to be compensated for the pollution of a mining company. Zimbabwe (5): ActionAid will organize a campaign and lead a documentation process of corporate conduct in the mining sector which will lead to lobby and advocate for responsible corporate conduct. By doing so, ActionAid will support partner organisations to effectively engage corporates for an amendment of the mines and minerals bill. The participation of these CSOs in national and regional policy platforms will also enrich their lobbying and advocacy work. Kenya (4): ActionAid will support partner organisations and HRDs to develop, maintain, implement risk plans and monitor threats and risks in their work, and create linkages for their protection with national and international institutions. The CSOs will also be supported to undertake periodic community and CSO&#x2013;led Human Rights Audits on the practices of corporates and work with communities to seek justice. Besides, the CSOs will initiate and sustain media connections on topical issues relating corporate conduct, human rights violations, and propose best practices from other areas or countries. Uganda (7): ActionAid will strengthen capacity and provide support to CSOs and community groups to lobby and advocate against acquisition of their land without free, prior and informed consent. ActionAid will do so through trainings, providing material support, awareness raising and community mobilization. Bangladesh (5): ActionAid will work with 3 partner organisations and 2 CSO platforms to support them with training on lobby and advocacy and financial support to lobby and advocate for responsible conduct of key corporates. Mozambique (3) ActionAid will continue to support its key partner organisations and 1 platform to connect communities to investors and local government in relation to disputes around large scale investments ActionAid will provide financial support to these organisations as well as trainings. The organisations will support the communities to seek redress for their grievances, which include land grab and displacement. Netherlands (3) ActionAid Netherlands will work with a number of partner CSOs to mutually strengthen capacities to lobby for responsible corporate conduct: &#x2022; In 2018 ActionAid will finalize a tax and extractives research which will be done with in cooperation with at least one of our Southern partners. As a result of this our partner will have a better insight in the relationship between Dutch policies and tax evasion practises by mining companies operating on their soil. We expect this will result in a better informed lobby on their part. &#x2022; ActionAid Netherlands will continue to work with partners in the international land and natural resources platform, where FPIC is a key learning and advocacy agenda. As a result we expect to contribute to knowledge and strategizing on this for around 10 CSOs in LLMICs, of which a few will probably use this in lobby. (2) &#x2022; We will also share our experiences with the VGGT scorecard and support other countries with this where needed. &#x2022; In addition a joint research will be set- up with one Southern partner that examines risks in the mineral supply in order to improve awareness with policymakers and companies on the need for human rights due diligence in the mineral supply chain. We expect this research to result into improved knowledge about actors in the supply chains, that can be linked to human rights violations in their jurisdiction. This knowledge will feed into their advocacy activities. &#x2022; Participation of ActionAid in the Netherlands in the ActionAid Africa Extractives Working Group will allow for mutual capacity building on trends in the extractives industries, and how different actors from different countries are linked to it. This knowledge will strengthen the advocacy work of the AEWG. &#x2022; We will actively support the follow-up of Women2Kilimanjaro, including access to international fora for the women standing up for their land rights. &#x2022; We will support FGG countries with research where needed, such as corporate cases (e.g. tracking financial/ international linkages) and participatory action research.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">African Extractives Working Group (8): The different ActionAid offices involved in the African Extractives Working Group (AA Zimbabwe, AA Zambia, AA Kenya, AA Malawi, AA Uganda, AA DRC, AA Sierra Leone and AA Liberia) increased their skills, knowledge and networks through joint meetings, writing and presenting of policy papers, and workshops. As a result, they lobbied and advocated for responsible corporate conduct in their respective countries in a more strategic and cohesive way (8). Bangladesh (60): ActionAid Bangladesh worked with 3 partner CSOs (1 in each of the 2 project areas and 1 Dhaka based HRD CSO). As a result of this cooperation, the partner organisations were able to increase their skills, knowledge and networks by attending trainings and workshops, which enabled them to lobby and advocate for responsible corporate conduct on the local level (for example by submitting a memorandum to the District Commissioner for rehabilitation of displaced people), the national level (for instance by participating in a lobby meeting with the Law Commission of Bangladesh) and the international level (for example by submitting a six-point demand document to a high-level team from a foreign investor) (3). ActionAid Bangladesh supported 2 other CSOs that are working on online activism and campaigning (1 in Raishahi and 1 in Noakhili) by providing knowledge, skills development and training for participants from media which enabled them to build the capacity of campaigners. As a result, these 2 CSOs were better able to mobilize people online and to develop effective campaigning strategies (2). ActionAid Bangladesh and its partner organisations formed 46 Community Land Rights Groups (CLRGs). The Groups were trained by the partner organisations in for example relevant laws and advocacy methods. As a result of this, the CLRGs were able to effectively lobby and advocate to local governments for their land rights, their livelihoods and for corporate accountability, which they put in practice in for example lobby meetings with the local government. As a result of lobby and advocacy with local government, 62 CLRG members are now included in a social safety net programme (46). ActionAid Bangladesh and its partners facilitated the setting up of 4 People&#x2019;s Commissions as Platforms for Social and Environmental Safeguard (PSES), 3 at regional level and 1 at national level. One of the partners organized a capacity building training, a visit to one of the affected areas and the writing of a fact finding report. As a result, the PSES were able to lobby and advocate for improved policies and instruments to corporates and government (4). ActionAid Bangladesh supported 5 significant land rights movements by providing training and skills development on for example advocacy. As a result of this support, the land rights movements lobbied and advocated against corporate development intervention and for improved laws and policies (5). Cambodia (7): With technical support from ActionAid Cambodia&#x2019;s partner and financial support from ActionAid Cambodia, the local trainers provided 6 cascade trainings to 6 communities. Through these trainings, communities gain more knowledge regarding their legal rights, which they subsequently use to assert their rights and to mobilize to advocate with authorities (e.g. communities traveled to Phnom Penh to engage the ministries &#x2013; see 1.E.a). And in the radio talk shows, community members are invited to talk about their problems and progress. Which is also a means for advocacy, because it gives them a voice (6). ActionAid Cambodia has provided a Land Law and Advocacy Training to the community representatives from 3 provinces who are subjected to land grabbing in their respective provinces. In the training, the villagers obtained a lot of knowledge in terms of land laws, mediation processes and domestic complaint mechanisms, which they subsequently used for e.g. filing complaints and in their roles as guest speakers on the radio talk show (1). Kenya (6): ActionAid Kenya built lobby and advocacy capacity of 6 partners through mutual capacity building approaches including knowledge development (training), and development/review of localized campaign strategies. These partners have demonstrated increased ability to undertake needs assessments for both their training requirements and their project implementation. The application of risk matrices has resulted &#x2013; for the first time &#x2013; in no reported arrests of HRDs, as they now know when to push and when to retreat, aided by their ability to map out any foreseeable risks, which is a process that facilitates ad-hoc responses to potential threats. In addition, partners have been able to work with communities in developing community aspirations into declarations, which they subsequently take to their leaders, who then initiate discussions with investors in search of a memorandum. This happened in the case of a mining company, that had to halt its operations because of non-compliance with the requirements formulated in the public memorandum (6). Mozambique (4): ActionAid Mozambique supported its key partner organisations at district level and at national level by providing trainings (for example on the Human Rights Based Approach), network contacts and financial support. As a result, the partner organisations were better able to assist communities in their lobby towards investors and local government in relation to disputes around large-scale agribusiness investments (3). ActionAid Mozambique&#x2019;s partner supported the creation of a Civil Society Platform, composed of 30 organisations from the district. The aim of the platform is to promote responsible practices of companies in communities. The partner provided training to the member organisations on monitoring investments in the agricultural sector and on monitoring the Economic and Social Plan (PES) of the districts, enabling the organisations to lobby and advocate for more responsible corporate conduct (1). NL (2): During the ActionAid FGG annual meeting in Entebbe, ActionAid Netherlands provided a workshop on corporate accountability in supply chains. AA Zambia used the knowledge and skills gained in this workshop to look into advocacy options higher up in the corporate structure of the violating mining company and to support an international court case against the company (1). ActionAid Netherlands facilitated lobby visits from Southern colleagues (from ActionAid Kenya and ActionAid International) working on land rights and corporate conduct in order to establish dialogue between them and the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Thorough preparation on key messaging and context, as well as of the dialogue itself contributed to their network, knowledge and skills to advocate for improved policy and continued Dutch support to land governance in Africa (1). Uganda (5): ActionAid Uganda and its partner have supported the community leaders in one of the project areas by mentoring and training in advocacy and nonviolent tactics for resisting land grabs, and have linked them with various embassies, missions, Office of the Speaker of Parliament and the Commission of Inquiry into Land. As a result, community activists in the region were able to advocate for their land rights with the Commission of Inquiry into Land where their case was registered, with the Speaker of Parliament, and they were able to convene meetings with embassies in Kampala (US, Denmark, EU working group on human rights) (1). ActionAid Uganda has provided platforms for a community lobby group to interface with the Office of the Prime Minister (OPM). As a result, the lobby group was able to take their matter to the OPM who designated a focal person from his office to handle the matter of degazetting their land from the park. In addition, the OPM has directed the Ministry of Lands Housing &amp; Urban Development to conclude their findings on the demarcation exercise that was carried out in March 2018 and share the report with the community before the de-gazettement process begins (1). The people in one of the project areas have continued to receive guidance and legal counsel from ActionAid Uganda. As a result, their court case which had taken two years without being heard will be heard on the 19th of March 2019 (1). The Land Awareness Weeks in Mubende and Teso &#x2013; which saw a close collaboration between ActionAid and its partners, and the Ministry of Lands, Housing &amp; Urban Development &#x2013; enabled community members to verify their land titles (including their Communal Land Association certificates) thanks to legal aid services from ActionAid Uganda&#x2019;s partner, while the event also provided a platform for dialogue and widespread community awareness on land governance as well as for vulnerable groups to access guidance and legal counselling on land matters through mobile legal clinics. Grievances regarding titles and registration were handled on spot by the Ministry, and the events reached over 10,000 people through direct community interface and radio talk shows. As a result, land conflicts in two subregions were resolved without recourse to the courts of law, while the expanded knowledge increased communities&#x2019; legal bargaining positions and reduced tensions within communities (1). Eight community groups comprised of women, men and youth in two regions received training by ActionAid Uganda&#x2019;s partner on the approach of nonviolent resistance and are now able to use this approach to protect their land from any form of land injustices such as land grabbing, forceful evictions. As a result, the residents of one community were able to petition the Speaker of Parliament, who then directed the Office of the Prime Minister to halt evictions until the issue of land owners was settled (1). Zambia (1): ActionAid Zambia&#x2019;s partner supported a community with knowledge and network contacts, so that they could revive their pollution case against a mining company in an international court. The community won the case, but the company is reluctant to compensate. ActionAid Zambia further supported the community by engaging pro-bono human rights lawyers, who are continuing the litigation. The community continues to advocate for the mining company to respect their rights, building on the support of ActionAid Zambia and its partners (1). Zimbabwe (4): ActionAid Zimbabwe in collaboration with other stakeholders organized a Gender Symposium in Mutoko, convening Zimbabwean civil society organisations, mining companies, the Ministry of Mines and the Zimbabwe Environmental Management Agency to exchange views and engage on the inclusion of women in international policy frameworks and decision-making bodies. During this Symposium, women from four community-based groups gained knowledge and network contacts by participating in the discussions. Based on their increased knowledge, the women developed action points and a document detailing the way forward, which they have used since then for their advocacy activities (4).</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">African Extractives Working Group (16): &#x2022; The eight ActionAid country offices involved in the African Extractives Working Group (AEWG) will increase their skills, knowledge and networks through joint meetings, writing of policy papers and other activities, enabling them to better lobby and advocate for responsible corporate conduct in their respective countries (8). &#x2022; As a result of the AEWG&#x2019;s support, the ActionAid offices in Uganda, Kenya and Zambia are supporting local partner organisations and local communities through trainings and networking to organize in social movements, following the model in South Africa. At least eight of these partner organisations and social movements will lobby and advocate for responsible corporate conduct and will hold mining companies accountable in their respective countries (8). Bangladesh (52): ActionAid Bangladesh will provide training on advocacy and lobbying regarding land and women&apos;s rights to its partner organizations YPSA and IRV, 48 community based groups and 2 Human Right groups. Consequently, these organizations will negotiate towards local and national governments, corporations and investors to protect their social and environmental rights (52). Cambodia (10): ActionAid Cambodia and its partner organisation will train at least 10 community and Land Rights activist groups which in 2019 will effectively lobby for responsible corporate conducts related to land rights and land acquisition. Through the facilitation of ActionAid Cambodia, its implementing partner and those groups, there will be an increased collaboration between communities versus corporate companies associated with land disputes and affecting human and environmental rights. They will jointly conduct exposure visits to the affected communities which strengthen the cases in grievance mediation work (10). Kenya (6): ActionAid Kenya will provide training and follow-up coaching for 6 partners on responsible corporate conduct, advocacy and lobbying. Through these activities, those partners will advocate, campaign and lobby to raise their voice to corporates affecting their land rights (6). Mozambique (3): In 2019, ActionAid Mozambique will continue to support its key partner organisations through trainings, knowledge exchange and networking to connect communities to investors and local government in relation to disputes around large-scale investments in the project areas. As a result of this support, the partners will assist communities in seeking redress for their grievances (3). Netherlands (12): &#x2022; ActionAid Netherlands will continue its work with Southern partners on risks in mineral supply chains. This work will result in increased capacity on this topic for the Southern partners to lobby and advocate for better due diligence practices and improved corporate conduct in the mining sector. Examples include: o Support ActionAid Zimbabwe in research on foreign ownership information on the companies operating in the Mutoko areas to link their practices with their countries&#x2019; international obligations to enforce and push compliance regarding BHR issues (1). o Collaborate with ActionAid Kenya to scope details of salt mining companies (owners, directors, financiers, buyers, etc.) for advocacy and lobbying work (1). o Joint international advocacy with ActionAid Zambia on Mopani (Mufulira) relocation case (1). &#x2022; ActionAid Netherlands will continue to work with CSOs in the international land and natural resources platform of ActionAid, where the VGGTs and FPIC are key to the learning and advocacy agenda. We will share our experiences with the analysis of land rights through the VGGT scorecard and support CSOs in other countries in using this tool. As a result we expect to contribute to increased knowledge and advocacy skills on VGGTs (and FPIC) in around 10 CSOs in LLMICs, of which at least 3 will actively use this in 2019 (3). &#x2022; ActionAid NL will support ActionAid Cambodia in an international campaign focussing on the financiers of harmful rubber plantations to prevent and mitigate the environmental and social impacts. ActionAid NL will collaborate with ActionAid Cambodia to conduct research on improved investments and supply chain analysis. As a result of increased capacity, ActionAid Cambodia will be better able to lobby and advocate on this topic (1). &#x2022; Through ActionAid Netherlands&#x2019; participation in ActionAid&#x2019;s Global Women&#x2019;s Rights campaign, to which one of our main contributions is to create an understanding of the role of corporate accountability and gendered due diligence in achieving women&#x2019;s economic justice, we will build capacity of partners in countries engaged in this campaign on these topics and lobby for these topics through collaboration on campaign activities in the Netherlands (as through the campaign tour) and through sharing spaces as webinars. As a result, we expect that at least 5 of these partners will advocate at the UN level for a binding treaty and at national level for the support and implementation of the binding treaty (5). Uganda (18): Eighteen CSOs will be better able to advocate for and defend their land rights as a result of ActionAid Uganda and partners&#x2019; capacity building activities, including media trainings and exposure visits. Zambia (4): &#x2022; ActionAid Zambia will strengthen the capacity of its three partner organisations on policy analysis, social accountability training, FPIC, Environmental Impact Assessments, EITI analysis and feminist and empowerment training. As a result, these partners will be better able to lobby and advocate for responsible corporate conduct (3). &#x2022; ActionAid Zambia will go on an exchange visit to another ActionAid office to discuss issues related to displacement and relocation of mining communities, the role of HRDs and litigation. As a result, both ActionAid offices will have increased knowledge and skills on these topics and will use those in their lobby and advocacy activities (1). Zimbabwe (5): Five CSOs will lobby and advocate in 2019 for responsible corporate conduct of mining companies as a result of training and knowledge development activities of ActionAid Zimbabwe and its partner (5).</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">Bangladesh (84): ActionAid Bangladesh supported 3 partner CSOs (1 in each of the 2 project areas and 1 Dhaka based HRD CSO) with trainings and workshops on lobby and advocacy and by facilitating the building of networks. As a result of this cooperation, the partner organisations were able to increase their skills, knowledge and networks and were able to lobby and advocate for responsible corporate conduct on the local level (for example by submitting a memorandum to the District Commissioner for rehabilitation of displaced people), the national level (for instance by participating in a lobby meeting with the Law Commission of Bangladesh) and the international level (for example by submitting a six-points and a 15 points demand document to a high-level team from a foreign investor) (3). ActionAid Bangladesh supported 2 other CSOs that are working on labor rights, environmental safeguarding and business and human rights by providing knowledge, skills development and training for participants from labor, community and media which enabled them to build the capacity of bargaining and campaigners. As a result, these 2 CSOs were better able to mobilize workers on a mega coal power plant project and to develop effective campaigning and awareness strategies (2). ActionAid Bangladesh and its partner organisations facilitated the setting up of 69 Community Land Rights Groups (CLRGs) as part of FGG. 46 were set up in 2017-2018, 23 were set up in 2019. These groups were trained through 2 separate capacity building workshop/training and community level awareness workshop by the partner organisations in for example relevant laws and advocacy methods. As a result of this, the CLRGs were able to effectively lobby and advocate to local governments and administration for their land rights, their livelihoods and for corporate accountability, which they put in practice in for example lobby meetings with the local government and administration. As a result of lobby and advocacy with local government, 34 CLRG members received skill training from Department of Youth Development and 2 members received 2 sewing machine from local government office (69). ActionAid Bangladesh and its partners supported the setting up of 5 People&#x2019;s Commissions including a new one in 2019. One operates at the national level and 4 work at local level. They organized 5 fact finding missions to as many affected areas, they prepared a fact finding report on people and environment, and the people&#x2019;s commissions organized several press conferences at the local and national level, a people&#x2019;s dialogue and public hearing. The People&#x2019;s commissions mobilized other local and national level CSOs and were able to lobby and advocate for improved policies and instruments to corporations and the government (5). ActionAid Bangladesh supported 5 significant land rights movements by providing training and skills development on for example advocacy. As a result of this support, the land rights movements lobbied government and corporates for accountable government and corporations, against harmful corporate development interventions and for improved laws and policies (5). Cambodia (13): In May 2019, ActionAid Cambodia and partners have trained representatives of nine fishery communities on the Importance of Mangrove Forest and the possibilities for influencing corporate and government actors. Instruments for this that were treated in the training included elements of the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGPs), corporate social responsibility (CSR), Land Tenure, Land Dispute Resolution and Access to Remedy. As a result, the participants were able to better lobby and advocate to combat injustices concerning land, corporate abuse and related matters (9). In 2019, AAC&#x2019;s partner, CCHR produced 6 radio talk shows. In these talk shows, four community members were invited to talk about their problems and progress. This is also a means for advocacy, because it gives them a voice (4). Kenya (21): ActionAid Kenya strengthened the capacity of the six implementing partners (Ujeri Uhumike CBO, Iloodokilani Women Network, Kamnarok Famers Association, Centre for Human Rights and Civic Education, Taita Taveta Human Rights Watch, Malindi Rights Forum) through exchange learning to a community that has successfully resisted land grabs. They applied the skills learnt from the exchange visit to rally solidarity behind HRDs who had been arrested (6). ActionAid Kenya built the capacity of 15 members of the coast land non-state actors on lobby and advocacy around policy formulation processes. Together with ActionAid Kenya, they continue mobilizing communities to engage with the process of revising the national land policy of 2009 whose timeframe lapsed in 2019. The purpose of this was to safeguard the gains made over the past period and to work towards easier implementation, taking lessons learnt into account (15). Mozambique (3): ActionAid Mozambique supported its partners NADEC, CODESA and ASCUT through trainings, knowledge exchange and networking. As a result, the partners connected communities to local governments and investors and lobbied for the resolution of land disputes on different levels (3). The Netherlands (6): Human rights defenders from three CSOs from Zambia and Guatemala advocated for responsible corporate conduct with a feminist lens at the binding treaty negotiations in Geneva and in meetings with policymakers in the Netherlands as a result of strategic and network support of ActionAid Netherlands (3). With financial support from ActionAid the Netherlands, representatives of 3 CSOs (ActionAid Bangladesh, ActionAid Zimbabwe and partner organization Zimbabwe Environmental Law Association) participated in a workshop on strategic litigation, organized by FGG in Amsterdam. As a result of this workshop, they are now investigating opportunities for holding companies accountable through climate-related litigation in their respective countries (3). Uganda (9): ActionAid Uganda and its partners have continued to support the development of lobby and advocacy capacities of the Kaweri people with training, advice, media work and funds. With the skills gained through receiving training and advice, they have managed to successfully speak up and seek justice from the Government for their land through different avenues i.e. court, media, advocacy and petitions. As a result on 13 December the Attorney General offered to compensate them fully for their land and properties lost in 2001 during the eviction (1). AAIU has supported the CSO formed by the evicted families of Kaweri by strengthening their capacity to participate in and conduct a court mediation process for the 401 families that were forcibly evicted by the Military (1). AAIU has provided a platform for the voices of the people of Apaa to be heard internationally by linking them to researchers and having their voices documented globally. https://actionaid.org/stories/2019/never-give-struggle-birthright) This international exposure created additional space for them to advocate their cause, also nationally. The Apaa community is involved in a long-standing conflict; they are under constant threat of eviction from their land and houses by violent means, to make way for wildlife parks and (suspected) mineral prospecting (1). ActionAid Uganda and its partners trained the community of Apaa on non-violent resistance to land grabbing. This training provided the community, which had been previously harassed, with much needed skills to claim what is rightfully theirs. As a result, they wrote a petition to the president, resisting eviction from their land without adequate compensation (1). The Land Awareness Weeks in Wakiso was organised in close collaboration between ActionAid Uganda and its partners, and the Ministry of Lands, Housing &amp; Urban Development. It enabled community members to verify their land titles thanks to legal aid services from partner LASPNET, while the event also provided a platform for dialogue and widespread community awareness on land governance as well as for vulnerable groups to access guidance and legal counselling on land matters through mobile legal clinics. Grievances regarding titles and registration were handled on spot by the Ministry, and the events reached over 100,000 people through direct community interface and radio talk shows. As a result, land conflicts in Wakiso, which hosts most of Kampala&#x2019;s workers, were resolved without recourse to the courts of law, while the expanded knowledge increased communities&#x2019; legal bargaining positions and reduced tensions within communities (1). ActionAid Uganda has supported the formation and organisation of 47 women of the National Land Defence League with money, training and advice. They advocate against land grabbing by companies or powerful private individuals. As a result of these training, these women are now equipped with lobby, advocacy and recruiting skills (1). ActionAid Uganda supported three communities (Apaa, Benet and Kijayo) in their knowledge exchange over two meetings regarding land rights defence. As a result, these three communities have learned from each other&#x2019;s experiences and have seen, in turn, their capacities strengthened, which they put to use in their lobbying and advocacy work (3). Zambia (4): ActionAid Zambia strengthened the capacity of its three partner organisations through trainings, workshops and exchange visits. As a result, each of these organisations lobbied for better conduct by mining companies. For example, one partner lobbied to a mining company for better water services for the community. And another partner conducted social audits after a training by ActionAid, and used the results to lobby to the local government for better revenue tracking (3). ActionAid Zambia and its three partners went on an exchange visit to ActionAid Bangladesh and increased their knowledge on displacement and litigation activities. As a result, all organisations now use a number of new strategies in their engagements with other stakeholders, such as local government officials and mining corporations (1; the 3 partners are already counted in previous outcome under this indicator). Zimbabwe (5): ActionAid Zimbabwe&#x2019;s partner ZELA organised a mobile human rights legal aid clinic in Mutoko with the Zimbabwe Human Rights Commission in Mutoko for members of the Mutoko Community Development Trust. The workshop included capacity building on access to remedy and holding duty bearers accountable. As a result of the workshop, the Mutoko North Community Development Trust advocated to their Member of Parliament and the Environmental Management Agency for proper environmental degradation remedy and environmental rights remedy (1). During the Provincial Alternative Mining Indaba in Manicaland, ActionAid Zimbabwe&#x2019;s partner ZELA exchanged information on the status of the Mines and Minerals Amendment Bill with five CSOs (Marange Development Trust, Chiadzwa Community Development Trust, Mutoko Community Development Trust, Arda-Transau Resettlement Development Trust and Save Odzi Community Network Trust). Based on this information, the CSOs developed a declaration that they have since used to lobby to their local governments (4; the Mutoko Community Development Trust is already counted in another outcome under this indicator).</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">Kenya (10): In the previous years, ActionAid held sessions with partners to reflect on their cases and develop localized campaign plans. Last year, feeding to Kilimanjaro Initiative, the partners were further built on how to develop clear demands. Utilizing this knowledge, this year three partners conducted a gender audit of group ranches. They then presented the findings of the audit in a forum calling for group ranches managements, National and County government officials, and selected representatives of the community. From this, the women vowed to storm the next AGM of the group ranches and demand inclusion and if they are not they petition the government to dissolve them. The group ranches resolved to enlist women as their members and support them to occupy leadership positions in the group ranches. (3) ActionAid supported and built the L&amp;A capacity of 3 communities to develop and present memorandums during forums to get views and recommendations from the public called by the task force established by the government to develop regulations to guide renewal and extension of leases where their memorandums were discussed. (3) ActionAid led partner organisations and community groups to reflect on the community land law 2016. Using knowledge acquired from this process, one community stopped grabbing of their land by the area Chief who had secretly registered a group ranch and leased the land to a company for grazing. The communities quickly assembled, organized, assembled evidence and reported to the county commissioner (president representative in the county). The county commissioner got the community and the chief together and questioned about his action. The chief is now put to trial and the community land was not leased to the company. This is a result from communities knowing their land rights. (4) ActionAid strengthened the capacity of their partner to advocate about the human rights violations in the mining area by connecting them to the relevant media networks. Their partner used these media contacts to expose human and land rights violation by the mining companies. Verifying the content it was found that the CSR committee that was supposed to act as a bridge between the community and mining companies was hiding the truth from the companies. As a result the CSR committee was strengthened. Cambodia (5): ActionAid&apos;s partner supported communities (particularly women) to better understand their human rights and available grievance mechanisms to resolve issues. This led to three community advocating for resolving a land conflict, one community advocating towards the general public about the adverse impacts of a company on the local community, and one community advocating toward relevant stakeholders to be included in the process to resolve land related issues. Zimbabwe (3): The members of two Women&#x2019;s Forums, 2 CBOs and male and female community members were trained by ActionAid partner organisation on the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) legal framework and EIA processes to ensure that men and women from the communities can effectively participate in decision making processes governing corporate accountability of mining companies in environmental management. Particular attention was paid to a balanced participation of men and women to ensure equal support and that both perspectives could be taken along in the advocacy activities. Also during the Manicaland Alternative Mining Indaba a specific session was organized by ActionAid and partner organisations to strengthen the knowledge of communities on ensuring corporate accountability through participating in the mining companies EIA processes and the importance of monitoring the mitigation measures outlined in the EIA report and EIA license. This resulted in the following lobby and advocacy activities: A CBO filed a litigation case against a mining company for mining within people&#x2019;s homesteads, thus violating environmental rights of the affected families and the failure to produce an EIA report and license in accordance with the law. The litigation case is evidence of demanding responsible corporate conduct. (1) A CBO provided written submission on the failure by the EIA consultants hired by a mining company to conduct the EIA public consultation process in accordance with the law. (1) ActionAid and its partner supported 2 CBOs to write a petition to the Parliamentary Portfolio Committee on Mines and Energy to improve the consultation mechanism. (1) Zambia (9): ActionAid trained their partner CBO on lobby and advocacy and on how to develop a strategy to resolve the issues of relocation. ActionAid together with the CBO advocated for holding of a mining company accountable in compensating 3000+ households who are scheduled to be relocated. During a meeting with the Resettlement Director, the Director of the department expressed concern about who will compensate the displaced households and this is what necessitated the advocacy and lobbying with local government to compel the mining company to take up the compensation since they are responsible for the pollution. As it stands, the displaced households were given plots (residential) but the challenge is the government is not moving in to service the stands and it is affecting the process because the health is not coming in, education and other service providers are not moving in because the area is not serviced. The CBO went back to the Government and called for an all stakeholders meeting. One of the resolutions agreed was that the government was going to engage the company. Also they had agreed to mobilise resources through contributions and donations as well as make use of the Constituency Development Fund to service the stands. ActionAid together with the partner CBO held an interface meeting with the traditional leaders, local communities and the mining company. The CBO discussed with the company to reconsider their initial promises on resettlement. This has been after realization by the community that the mining company didn&#x2019;t provide adequate information to the local people at the time of effecting relocations. The feeling also was that too much land was given without priority given to local people&#x2019;s livelihood needs. Three mining affected communities were trained by ActionAid to understand the government decentralization process and how they can use these spaces to demand for progressive policies in the extractives sector. All of the communities engaged in lobby and advocacy towards government in planning, resources allocation and transparency and accountability. ActionAid did sensitization workshop of the African Mining Vision in 9 mining affected communities. With the AMV translated to the local language the communities identified the main issue they wanted to raise with their local government and toward the mining companies. Three communities discussed the AMV with local government, ZEMA and the mining companies. ActionAid mobilised 200 women from 10 different districts of Zambia as part of the Women&#x2019;s assembly and a Women&#x2019;s movement was formed with the focus on fighting for Women&#x2019;s rights in mining communities but also to challenge policies around women access to and control over land. ActionAid supported women with mobilisation, linking them to the South African WAMUA for support in building a strong movement. The movement during the assembly launched a campaign on &#x2018;challenging retrogressive policies and practices by government and mining companies in Zambia&#x2019;. Further, during the women&apos;s assembly itself, we created a platform where women participants were able to have interface meetings with Ministry of Mines, ActionAid&apos;s partner CBO including ZEMA to surface the underlying causes of women marginalisation in decision making and challenge government ministries to become responsive. ActionAid also supported an interface meeting between a mining company and the women participants on issues relating to violation of women&#x2019;s rights and the exclusion of women in decision making processes in the mining communities. After the Women&apos;s assembly again we supported them to engage duty bearers in their respective districts. The women were able to challenge the mining company on being insensitive to the needs and lack of responsiveness to their needs due to lack of consultation. The mining company committed itself to follow up with their community engagement units to ensure women participation in those spaces is guaranteed. (1) Bangladesh (31) ActionAid and 3 local FGG partners have strengthened their skills, knowledge and/or network contacts by being part of the FGG programme and have all actively lobbied and advocated for responsible corporate conduct over the year. In addition, AAB organized trainings for human rights defenders (HRDS) and as a result 3 HRD groups have been set up in 2017, including in both project areas. Moreover, in 2017, AAB has facilitated the setting up of 23 community-based people&#x2019;s landrights groups from the communities affected by the projects, whose goal is to advocate with government and corporates to claim their rights, resolve grievances, and change laws and policies around land acquisition and resettlement (23). These community groups have also already started raising their voices in 2017 with governments and investors on landrights. Outside of our project areas AAB supported 2 other CSOs actively advocating on similar issues in the context of large scale investments (2). Uganda (7) AA Uganda&#x2019;s local partner continued to receive support from AA Uganda. Together with these partners, AA has also been able to support community groups in strengthening their capacities to lobby and advocate for social justice. The community of evictees (1) has had their capacities in lobbying and demanding for their rights strengthened. They have been able to stand up and challenge government through the support and linkage with a local activists group) (1). These groups have together taken legal action against two companies that evicted them from their land in August 2016. Another community (1) and a local CBO (1) have been strengthened through regular support to their leaders in advocacy and organizing by ActionAid Uganda (AAU) and local partner. AAU has supported them in advocacy tactics while the local partner has trained them in non violent mechanisms of resisting land grabs. With strengthened capacities the two CBO&#x2019;s have engaged their members of parliament, the district leadership, the local councils, the resident district commissioner, the chief administrative officer, and the district land board. The two CBO&#x2019;s organised a meeting to bring these stakeholders together to discuss the land boundaries. The outcome of the meeting was that the boundary lines of the community were no longer included in the national park. Now they are waiting for the boundaries to be de-gazetted. Mozambique (19): Representatives of 15 women&apos;s associations were trained in Land Law (Law 19/97 of October 1) Investment-related Policies, and the Family Law (Law No. 10/2004 of 25 August) by ActionAid&apos;s partner. Due to this increased skills, the communities are now claiming their rights (15). The Investment Monitoring Committee (1) Members have stepped up their efforts to gather evidence of violations of community rights by investors. As a result of the trainings on Land Laws, Family Law and Investment Policies provided by AAMoz partners, they identified 8 cases of land conflicts and are following up on them by themselves, of which 1 is at the level of the District Administrator and 3 in the court. In addition, AA&#x2019;s implementing partners have strengthened their capacities and carried out lobby and advocacy work as part of the programme (3) Netherlands (4) AA also provided input to ActionAid Uganda&#x2019;s land research that helped them (AA Uganda) sharpen it further and we linked them more strongly to the Dutch embassy, providing information back and forth, when they were facing repression, and contributed to them being able to continue their work on corporate conduct and land (1). Following an international meeting, a joint AASA/AANL visit to project work of AA Bangladesh was organised. Different strategies on how to respect social and environmental norms were exchanged, both with communities and AA Bangladesh staff. We also shared knowledge on business&amp;human rights (standards and instruments) with AA Bangladesh, that they are using in their strategizing and lobby (1). We actively contributed to the VGGT scorecard development and the first pilot, which have helped not only our capacity to analyse land and related policy, understand gaps and how to discuss them most effectively with government in Netherlands but also ActionAid Senegal, ActionAid the Gambia, Australia and the international secretariat based in Kenya &#x2013; which used the final report in engagements at AU level that involved different AA offices and partners. We also presented in Arusha meeting our learnings with all FGG partners. (2)</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">Bangladesh (83): Partner organisations YPSA, IRV and CLEAN will lobby and advocate for improved corporate conduct on the local and the national level as a result of training on lobby and advocacy strategies by ActionAid Bangladesh. For example, YPSA will publish a document on people&#x2019;s struggles and will use this to lobby the responsible corporations (3). Six strategic partner organisations will use their increased knowledge to lobby and advocate for improved corporate conduct on the national and international level as a result of strategic communication and evidence sharing by ActionAid Bangladesh. For example, these organisations will advocate for better implementation of international standards in the project areas by submitting their demands to the government and discussing them with other Civil Society Organisations and in the media(6). ActionAid Bangladesh supports citizen-based organisations set up to hold governments and companies accountable. Five of these will lobby and advocate for responsible corporate conduct at the local and national level, as a result of financial and training support of ActionAid Bangladesh (5). 69 Community Land Rights Groups will lobby and advocate for responsible corporate conduct at the local and national level, as a result of financial and training support of ActionAid Bangladesh. For example, with the research skills and know-how gained in the training by ActionAid Bangladesh the Groups will produce periodic monitoring reports and factfinding reports that they will use in their lobby towards corporates and the government to ensure that the rights of people and the environment are protected. Also, some of the Groups will set up a media campaign (69). Cambodia (4): Two communities will be better able to advocate for responsible conduct of companies in their regions, as a result of the knowledge and skills that they acquired through trainings by ActionAid Cambodia and partner organisation CCHR. Some of the advocacy activities that they are expected to undertake in 2020 will include the submission of a petition, participating in radio talk shows, giving a press conference, file complaints, and organize protests (2). Land rights activists and communities will advocate for responsible corporate conduct and will file complaints through the land dispute resolution mechanisms, as a result of financial support from partner organisation CCHR via the Small Grants Fund and associated legal advice (2). Kenya (4): ActionAid Kenya will hold coaching sessions for TTHRW, MRF, CHRCE, and KFA on relevant skills required to advance their lobby and advocacy work. We anticipate through this coaching TTHRW, MRF, CHRCE, and KFA will increase their skills and knowledge on lobby and advocacy, eventually lobby, and advocate for responsible corporate conduct in their areas. One way they will do this is by human rights audits on corporate practices including a scorecard instrument that will be developed by ActionAid Kenya (4). Mozambique (14): Two partner organisations will train members of twelve smallholder farmers&#x2019; associations in two districts on lobby and advocacy strategies, and on budget tracking. As a result of these trainings, the associations will track local government budgets and will hold the government and local investors to account (12). A partner organisation will provide trainings on land laws and community rights to Monitoring Committees. The Committees will use their increased knowledge on this topics to better track the implementation of mechanisms for land dispute resolution and compliance with community consultation requirements (1). ActionAid Mozambique will strengthen the capacity of members of one of its partner organisations on land conflict mediation approaches through trainings on this topic. As a result, the partner will use these mediation approaches in their lobby and advocacy to the government and to companies to solve conflicts between communities and investors (1). Netherlands (9): Through ActionAid Netherlands&#x2019; participation in ActionAid&#x2019;s Global Women&#x2019;s Rights campaign, to which one of our main contributions is to create an understanding of the role of corporate accountability and gendered due diligence in achieving women&#x2019;s economic justice, we will strengthen the capacity of partners in countries engaged in this campaign on these topics through collaboration on campaign activities in the Netherlands (as through the campaign tour), dissemination of materials and through sharing spaces as webinars. As a result, we expect that at least 5 of these partners will advocate at the UN level for a binding treaty and at national level for the support and implementation of the binding treaty, and for the implementation of the feminist economy as an alternative to current corporate accountability strategies (5). Two CSOs (or coalitions led by ActionAid Brazil and ActionAid Guatemala) in respectively Brazil and Guatemala shall lobby with financial and knowledge support of ActionAid the Netherlands for improved corporate accountability including community and women&#x2019;s land rights and right to food (2). ActionAid Netherlands will continue its work with Southern partners on risks in mineral supply chains. This work will result in increased capacity on this topic for the Southern partners to lobby and advocate for better due diligence practices and improved corporate conduct in the mining sector. For example, ActionAid Netherlands will support AA DRC in in scaling up and strengthening their lobby and advocacy work led by women affected by mining towards government and corporates, by sharing its knowledge on lobby and advocacy strategies and through financial support (1). Due to the results of ActionAid South Africa mapping the human rights abuses linked to manganese mining for batteries (for renewable energy sources) used in the Netherlands amongst other countries, members of the African Extractives Working Group (AEWG) will strengthen their capacity and position on the realization of a &#x2018;just transition&#x2019;. At least one of the eight members of the AEWG is expected to use the results of the research for local lobby and advocacy towards government and companies purposes so that corporate conduct is improved in order to help realize a just transition in their respective countries (1). Roving Advisor (4): The Roving Advisor will train staff of four ActionAid offices (Zambia, Zimbabwe, Mozambique and Uganda) and their local partners on designing effective lobby and advocacy strategies related to corporate conduct. As a result, each of the four countries will set up a multimedia campaign to lobby their national and regional governmental bodies (4). Uganda (10): Twenty CSOs and cultural institutions will be in a better position to advocate for and defend their land rights as a result of AA Uganda and partners&#x2019; capacity building activities, including trainings on different aspects like advocacy, media engagement as well as learning exchanges and exposure visits. We expect that at least half of them will be able to show how they have used this in their L&amp;A work (10). Zambia (4): ActionAid Zambia will strengthen the capacity of its three partner organizations on Free, Prior and Informed Consent, Environmental Impact Assessments, Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative analysis and dissemination, conducting environmental talks, leadership skills and feminist leadership training. As a result, the partners will be able to lobby and advocate for responsible corporate conduct (3). ActionAid Zambia will capacitate partners, media houses and freelance journalists on investigative journalism on mining related issues including human rights violations. As a result, the partners and media houses will be able to monitor operations of the mining companies that have a bearing on the environment and their livelihoods, which they will use in their lobby towards the companies and the government for improved policies on these topics (1). Zimbabwe (3): ActionAid Zimbabwe and partner ZELA will organize a National Conference on Corporate Accountability, focusing on Chinese investments in the extractives sector. During the conference, participants, including CSOs, will exchange information and knowledge on the standards of operation of Chinese mining companies. From the outcomes of the conference a publication will be developed and shared. At least three local CSOs will use their increased knowledge on the topic and the publication to lobby for better conduct of Chinese mining companies in their respective regions (3). Three CSOs will lobby and advocate for improved corporate conduct of mining companies in their regions, based on knowledge that they gained from an analysis shared with them by partner organisation ZELA on the finalized Mines and Minerals Amendment Bill (0).</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">AA NL (8): - AA facilitated 1 multi-stakeholder visit with representatives of Dutch ports, energy companies and the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs to coal mines and mining communities in SA, resulting in improved awareness and understanding on human rights violations and women&apos;s rights violations in the coal supply chain. The energy companies as well as the Dutch companies have now formulated actions on improving the conditions under which coal is mined in South Africa, which will be implemented in 2017 (1). - Regular interactions with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and with companies on the adverse impact of mining minerals on the impacts of mining on women, resulted in improved understanding of gender specific risks in the supply chain and how to address these(1). - Proposals for improving conflict minerals act (see also motion in next section) were discussed by media, parliament and Ministry (1) - AA NL shared knowledge and proposals for a compensation protocol that is being developed as part of the MSD land (1). - AA NL engaged in discussions and shared inputs on the White Paper VGGT, which contains ideas for and has been discussed with banks and other parties to improve land rights due diligence in their investments, as part of MSD land. (1) - AA NL proposed stronger land rights (VGGT and FPIC) protection in Dutch investments (private sector and PPPs) and a zero tolerance to land grab as part of our conversations with parliament and through a paper and a NGO-letter submitted to parliament (1) - AA NL raised awareness and shared proposals on the importance of women&#x2019;s land rights as a key condition to improved corporate conduct to parliament and Ministry, as well as wider public. Proposal made were an opinion article (1) written together with Both Ends that was published in the Volkskrant (VK, ViceVersa) , and proposals made in a presentation and conversation with the Minister during an ActionAid photo exposition on women&apos;s land rights at the ministry. The proposals fed into the high level dialogue on land governance. - As a result of the multi-stakeholder mission on coal to South Africa, the Dutch energy companies have defined action plans specifically addressing human rights violations in the extractives industry in South Africa (1). Cambodia (5): - With support of AACambodia, their partners and CSO networks, 5 policy recommendations were made and 4 communities engaged directly with the government to claim their land back, or seek proper compensation from authorities, and/or to prevent environmental pollution, e.g. by submitting petitions and intervention letters to various Ministry departments &amp; National Assembly, and organizing press conferences, resulting in government issuing (investigative) action by government and targeted companies (5). Zambia (2): - Periodically the mining company takes water tests. They are obliged to share this with the Zambia Environmental Management Agency (ZEMA) and ZEMA should also conduct independent water test. The main issue for communities and CSOs is their transparency because the water test reports are never released. ActionAid Zambia sent a proposal to ZEMA demanding that they should be transparent about the water test and install mechanism for external actors to provide feedback. This proposal was discussed by the district commission. -In one of the project locations, ActionAid&#x2019;s partner together with a local women&#x2019;s group that was affected by one of the Copper/nickel mines proposed for improved conditions for the relocation, compensation (including a specific focus on the need of women). These proposals were discussed by the mining officials and the Chief of the community. Kenya (2): Two proposals were discussed by public sector decision makers: - In a mining area which was expanding its operations exposing a nearby school to lots of dust. Parents in the school had to withdraw their children from the school. The community led by our partner organisation developed a petition that was taken to Director General for National Environmental Management Authority by women where it was discussed. - ActionAid Kenya supported communities in one of the project locations to develop a Charter of Demands regarding investments of one of the bigger international farms in that area. This Charter outlines the negative impact of the investments on water conditions in that area and communities proposed steps forward on how to resolve the issues. This proposal was discussed at county and national level by policy makers. Mozambique (1): AA in partnership with the National Agricultural Development Company and Utrecht University conducted a research on the &#x201C;Impacts of Inclusive Business Models in the sugar industry in Manhi&#xE7;a&#x201D;. This research was discussed in the university of Utrecht during the LANDAC conference.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">Cambodia (2): ActionAid is one of members of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) Platform. The CSR platform consists of 42 companies and NGOs. The platform aims collaboration among Government, Private Sector Companies and Civil Society Organizations to ensure that CSR guidelines, tools, and principles are widely known in Cambodia and have started to be adopted and implemented by companies and enforced by the government in the best interest of communities and environment. ActionAid will use this platform to develop a proposal for improved corporate conduct and engage companies to improve responsibility for their business. The project team will initiate policy dialogue with policy makers and government officials. ActionAid and its partner organisations will develop a proposal on how to implement effectively human rights compliance and social responsibility programs based on the UNGP. This will be discussed in policy dialogues with private sector, relevant ministries, CSOs and CBOs and community people. Zimbabwe (1): ActionAid and its partner organisation will organize the national and local alternative mining indabas where government departments such as the local authorities, ministries of Mines, Rural Development, Environment, the Environmental Management Agency and Parliament will interact and discuss with civil society on corporate conduct in the mining sector. ActionAid and other CSO&#x2019;s will make recommendations to the government and follow up regularly on the key policy actions which the government departments commit themselves at these platforms to track progress. Kenya (2):ActionAid will lobby the Ministry of Mining to introduce communication and sensitization programmes that eradicate cultural norms which inhibit women from actively participating and contributing to the extractive sector, and provide specific provisions on gender equality and equity empowerment in the sector. ActionAid is an alternate member of the Technical Working Group (multi-stakeholders) that is supporting in developing the Kenya Country Mining Vision. CSOs will promote an gap analysis for the extractive sector and particularly on environment and social issues. Two proposals will be presented for discussion and adoption by counties when developing their county mining visions. Uganda (4): a) Proposal for consultation with communities and to provide compensation in cases of land acquisition, prior to occupation of land by corporations. ActionAid and partners will continue to make these proposals to various ministries. b) Proposals on the amendment of Article 26 of the 1995 Constitution will be widely discussed in parliament, cabinet, media, CSO fraternity, academia etc. c) Proposal for Improved working conditions for women in the flower sector especially occupational safety discussed with 4 flower farms. d) Proposal for giving more space to workers in the flower sector to join workers unions without being victimized. Bangladesh (5): ActionAid jointly with CSOs will undertake a review of laws and policies related to land acquisition, compensation and resettlement and prepare a set of policy propositions for improved corporate conduct based on this review. These will be brought forward in dialogue with private and public sector / decision makers and/or in academia, public agenda, media and social movements. Mozambique (1): -based on case studies on human rights violations related to large scale investments, ActionAid will formulate a proposal to implement FPIC/VGGT in investment processes and to ensure that it is put on the agenda within the Ministry of Agriculture, Land and Environment Netherlands (14): ActionAid will pursue activities in order to influence the agenda on private and public level on corporate conduct improvement on at an array of topics. The most important are: 1. ActionAid will conduct various meetings with government officials to ensure attention for policies that foster the need for responsible mineral supply chains in new Aid, Trade, investment and CSR and potentially energy (public procurement) policies (3). 2. We will specifically also raise awareness about the need for addressing risks in the renewable energy supply chains, at the level of the parliamentary committee on energy, Ministry of I&amp;M, Foreign Affairs and Economic Affairs as well as the renewable energy industry. We will mainly do this by disseminating our report and proposals on conflict minerals in wind turbines (published in 2017), as well as media and CSO outreach where possible. (3) 3. We will continue to participate in the government led working group on women &amp; mining, via which we emphasize the need for stronger gender-sensitive policies in the area of development and trade and implementation at NL, EU and international level by speaking at relevant fora and producing and disseminating papers (2) 4. We discuss our proposals on land rights, particularly women&#x2019;s land rights and VGGT implementation with decision-makers, i.e. through the Multistakeholder dialogue on land, the covenants discussions and engagements with the Dutch parliament and government officials.(3) 5. We will put the need for FPIC and community participation in decision making higher on the agenda of decision-makers through our proposals to and participation in the Multistakeholder dialogue on land, the covenants, our interaction with Dutch and European policymakers and members of parliament. This includes showcasing how the current lack of standards and FPIC leads to human rights violations and land grabs.(1) 6. Increased attention of media and awareness with the Dutch public on the relevance of land and food rights in relation to resilience, emergency aid and SDG&#x2019;s.(1) 7. We will try to engage social movements in Netherlands and internationally to ensure stronger cooperation between those working on human and women&#x2019;s rights, development and environment.(1)</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">African Extractives Working Group (1): Following the Policy Conference on the Binding Treaty, a delegation from the African Extractives Working Group participated in the United Nations Human Rights Council negotiations on the Binding Treaty in Geneva and presented for the first time an African civil society perspective into the negotiations during a side event. Together with other civil society organisations, the delegation met with the South African Ambassador, who acknowledged the importance of bringing in the African civil society perspective and confirmed the ongoing commitment to drive the process through the UN system (1). Bangladesh (6): ActionAid Bangladesh organized a lobby meeting with the Law Commission on the review of the &#x2018;Acquisition and Requisition of Immovable Property Act 2017&#x2019;. The Law Commission discussed the review and agreed with many of the recommendations that ActionAid Bangladesh made. As a result, they have agreed to work together to improve land related laws and policies (1). ActionAid Bangladesh and PNGO organized several workshops, social dialogues and lobby meetings to present the People&#x2019;s Safeguard Policy that they developed. This Policy is an alternative proposal to ensure human rights in infrastructural developments. As a result of these meetings, the People&#x2019;s Safeguard Policy was put on the agenda of private companies, policy makers, social movements and CSOs. In addition, several media platforms published articles about the Policy (5). Cambodia (0): In July 2018, Cambodia had a national election. Before, during and after the election the tension was very high. The opposition party was dissolved in November 2017, there was only one party who allegedly won by a landslide victory and installed a one-party parliament. It was very difficult to implement any activities under those circumstances. All the donors appealed the government to restore the democratic process. The EU has launched an EBA withdrawal process (0). Kenya (7): 2 community declarations on mining were presented and discussed during the National Mining Baraza organized by 17 civil society organizations and attended by government departments, mining corporations, researchers and academia, and activists. These declarations resulted from ActionAid Kenya and partners&#x2019; efforts with mining-affected communities to build their initial understanding of rights, to map community issues and aspirations, and to draw roadmaps for engagement with duty bearers. Following another round of 8 forums, the community aspirations were popularized and then developed into community declarations on mining, subsequently adopted at 2 County Mining Barazas, after which selected delegates presented them at the National Mining Baraza (2). 1 petition was developed and submitted by survivors of human-wildlife conflicts &#x2013; which result from land dispossession by group ranches and encroachment into community lands by Kenya Wildlife Services &#x2013; to the Chairperson of the Wildlife Conservation and Compensation Committee, highlighting concerns related to proposed amendments in the Wildlife Conservation and Compensation Act. The petition was discussed in a committee meeting and forwarded to the taskforce that is currently reviewing the amendment act (1). 1 memorandum detailing community grievances submitted and discussed during a meeting called by the UN Rapporteur on Business and HR when he visited Kenya, prior to which he had requested ActionAid Kenya to comprise this memorandum, which ActionAid Kenya did by conducting community forums for input collection (1). Upon request by the area MP, ActionAid Kenya&#x2019;s partner organisation developed and submitted 1 petition to the National Assembly Committee on Land and Natural Resources, detailing on the ground human rights violations in the salt belt in response to a non-factual audit report from the Kenyan Association of Manufacturers/KNCHR (1). ActionAid Kenya&#x2019;s partner shared 1 report on chemical composition of water sources (wells) during a community forum, provoking the communities to prepare and submit a complaint letter to the County Executive Committee Member for Water and Environment in their County. As a result, the issue was put on the agenda of the County Executive Member, who will carry out a fact-finding visit to the region in early 2019 (1). 1 proposal to leave coal in the soil was adopted by the Members of the County Assembly (MCAs) after ActionAid Kenya and its partner took them and mining-affected communities on a toxic exchange learning visit in South Africa. The visit exposed the MCAs to the realities of coal mining, which subsequently bolstered their position against coal mining affirming that they will mobilize their fellows in the assembly to oppose mining of coal in the area until a clear roadmap to deal with environmental and community concerns is in place. The visit has become critical in shaping discussions in the assembly and in the community about the development pathway the county will be taking in the light of coal mining (1). Mozambique (2): The proposal of ActionAid Mozambique to better respect human rights in large investments was distributed through local radio shows in local languages. Topics that were discussed included land laws, human rights with a focus on women rights, displacement and resettlement. As a result of the radio shows, the proposal to improve corporate conduct was put on the public agenda (1). ActionAid Mozambique&#x2019;s partners organized four meetings at local and district levels to bring together communities and decision makers. In these meetings, they discussed proposals to improve corporate conduct, such as the inclusion of FPIC in all agribusiness investments. Other topics that were discussed include the empowerment of women, better inclusion of communities in decision-making processes and improved government accountability. As a result, these proposals were put on the agenda of public decision makers (1). NL (17): At EU level, ActionAid Netherlands together with other NGOs put pressure on EU policy makers to make sure that the EU would engage more constructively in the process towards getting to a UN Binding Treaty on Business and Human Rights. Subsequently, a shift could be witnessed during the last round of the UN Treaty negotiations in Geneva in October, from the EU objecting the process in 2017 to the EU representatives making interventions and being substantially more positive in 2018. The EU is now for the very first time internally discussing the content of what an international instrument could look like. The push for the Treaty also triggered the EU to start to look at how to regulate companies at European level, in order to shape rules before seeing rules imposed from above. Also, the European Commission is working on a study to scope legislative options relating specifically to that (1). ActionAid Netherlands published its report on human rights violations in wind turbine supply chains, including proposals to the Dutch government and to companies on how to identify and address risks. As a result, we are now seen as the leading expert on these issues. The following agendas were successfully set: - After the report was published, ActionAid Netherlands was invited to meet and discuss its proposals with the Trade Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Infrastructure and Water and the renewable energy industry (3). - Two sets of written parliamentary questions were raised to Minister Kaag and Minister Wiebes, and 2 Members of Parliament raised the issue orally. Minister Wiebes mentioned the possibility for including human rights standards in wind energy supply chain legislation (4). - The topic of including human rights standards in wind energy supply chain legislation was raised in a &#x2018;Klimaatakkoord&#x2019; meeting, which was acknowledged publicly by one of the negotiators (1). - Various media channels (NOS, Volkskrant, supply chain magazines) reported about the report. Also, references to the report were made on the official &#x2018;Klimaatakkoord&#x2019; website and on the Triodos page on responsible mineral supply chain. In addition, OneWorld published an article about human rights in green technology quoting ActionAid (1). - Various interactions and meeting with the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Climate and the Ministry of Infrastructure and the Environment took place, which led amongst others to the initiative from EAC to explore how human rights risks can be included into the &#x2018;grondstofferscanner&#x2019; (1). - Due to bilateral meetings, media attention, political attention and speaking at wind industry conferences, we raised awareness about the need for human rights safeguards in mineral supply chains of green technologies, wind turbines in particular. As a consequence, the wind industry sector organisation and different companies in the wind turbine industry convened to discuss due diligence in their supply chains and the possibility of setting up a sector agreement (1). - AANL pushed with the energy companies that are part of the sector agreement process to improve their due diligence policies and reporting. Due to our push, the covenant parties hired an external party to evaluate the due diligence policies and practices in order for the companies to improve their standards (1). A joint letter by ActionAid/SOMO/TNI/IUCN/FIDH/FOE to the parliament was sent to stress the importance of the Dutch government accepting the Binding UN Treaty on Business and Human Rights resulted in the issue being raised by 2 MPs during an Aid &amp; Trade commission meeting. This led to a ministerial letter and a reaffirmation of the Netherlands to keep engaging constructively with the process. A follow up letter was sent on the same issue and as a result Minister Kaag has agreed to share the EU position paper on the binding treaty with parliament (which was not accessible until now) (2). ActionAid Netherlands discussed its proposals on land rights, particularly women&#x2019;s land rights, FPIC and VGGT implementation with decision-makers and parliamentarians on various occasions. As a result, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs decided to anchor women&#x2019;s land rights in its policies through a participatory process that includes ActionAid (1). At the EU level, together with other NGOs ActionAid Netherlands contributed to the shadow EU action plan developed by the European Parliament&#x2019;s working group on Responsible Business by discussing the draft in meetings with MEPs and by sharing inputs. ActionAid&#x2019;s specific inputs into the draft shadow EU action plan mainstreamed gender considerations throughout all actions, calling for gender impact assessments, gender-sensitive due diligence and gender-responsive grievance mechanisms. Thanks to our inputs, the draft also incorporates a strong policy coherence for development narrative, and it makes a link with the increasing use of ODA for private sector without proper corporate accountability mechanism in place (1). Uganda (1): Due to increased pressure and activism by CSOs and local communities, the government withdrew the Constitutional Amendment Bill that sought to amend Article 26 of the Constitution. With ActionAid Uganda&apos;s partners pointing out its negative effects, followed by a widespread discussion of the proposed amendment by CSOs, media, academia and parliamentarians, the amendment was eventually withdrawn from parliament for further scrutiny to ensure the right to land of the citizens is sustained (1). Zambia (7): ActionAid Zambia and its three partner organisations engaged three mining companies on women&#x2019;s economic and social empowerment. As a result, this issue was firmly put on the agenda of the companies, who are now engaging regularly with the communities to discuss issues related to community grievances and corporate social responsibility (3). ActionAid Zambia and its three partner organisations supported communities to put forward their issues related to human rights violations to the Parliamentary Committee on Legal Affairs and Human Rights. Communities raised the issues of water pollution in their area by a mining company, and the case of cracked houses in another area as a result of the operations of the same mining company. These cases were taken to the media, and engagement processes took place at the local and national level. Different CSOs, among which ActionAid Zambia and partners, made submissions to the Parliamentary Committee for remedial action. As a result, the District Administration for the region confirmed receipt of a directive to resolve the water crisis in the community. Also, Members of Parliament and Councilors in the two other project regions have expressed their support to resolve the communities&#x2019; grievances (3). ActionAid Zambia made submissions to the Parliamentary Committee for the ratification of the Statute of the African Minerals Development Centre to provide strategic operational support for the Africa Mining Vision and its Action Plan. This was discussed by the Government, and the statute was ratified in June 2018 (1). Zimbabwe (3): At the local Manicaland Alternative Mining Indaba, a number of CSOs developed a declaration outlining their demands and action points, which they have since then used for their advocacy activities. As a result, the declaration was put on the agenda of a government-owned mining company, as the CSOs presented their declarations during the company&#x2019;s conference (1). A number of CSOs, among which partner organisation ZELA, developed a number of declarations at the Zimbabwe Alternative Mining Indaba, among which the declaration that mining communities, mining producers and relevant stakeholders should attend public consultations on the forthcoming Mines and Minerals Amendment Bill, so that the Law reflects the demands of the communities. The President consequently rejected the signing of the Bill, citing the demands brought up by the group of CSOs as one of the reasons (1). Partner organisation ZELA invited 3 companies to the Grievance Redress Mechanisms (GRM) meeting. One was a foreign-owned company which ZELA deems necessary to engage with after countless human rights violations complaints had been raised against them. Community paralegal and environmental monitors had attempted to engage the company to no avail. The company agreed to engagement with ZELA facilitating and they sent a representative to the GRM meeting. This was a commendable first step by the company to be open to engagement especially considering that no one had managed to approach them with any measure of success. So far, only complaints about violations had been recorded against the company without any response from them (1).</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">African Extractives Working Group (1): &#x2022; The Department of International Relations and Cooperation of the South African Government (who are co-sponsors of the Treaty at the United Nations Human Rights Commission) will bring in the arguments made by the African Extractives Working Group (AEWG) in the negotiations around the United Nations Binding Treaty on Transnational Corporations and Other Business entities with respect to Human Rights. The AEWG will provide these actors with their arguments in the form of a policy document (to be developed in 2019) (1). &#x2022; The African Extractives Working Group will develop a policy document bringing together the discussions and critiques on the Africa Mining Vision, and will lobby towards the African Union to have them put this on their agenda (0). Bangladesh (9): &#x2022; ActionAid Bangladesh will introduce the People Safeguard (PSG) policy proposal for discussion and approval to the Cabinet Division of People&#x2019;s Republic of Bangladesh, Ministry of Land, Ministry of Industry, Ministry of Forest and Environment, one investing and four commercial agencies (8). Discussions will be held within the ministries and at platforms, to strategize actions to protect communities against violations of social and environmental rights due to infrastructure development projects. &#x2022; The Ministry of Land will discuss and consider a land acquisition and compensation policy proposal developed and submitted by AA Bangladesh and partners. This policy would hold government and companies accountable for proper land acquisition and compensation (1). Cambodia (6): &#x2022; ActionAid Cambodia&#x2019;s partner organisation will submit 2 proposals to the Council for the Development of Cambodia (CDC) regarding Due diligence and Effective Remedy. It is expected that this will be endorsed in 2019. &#x2022; Further, two major international commercial companies, the Ministry of Land Management, Urban Planning and Constructions, the Ministry of Environment, the Ministry of Agriculture and the National Assembly will in 2019 consider working in line with the UNGPs, FPIC and VGGT. ActionAid Cambodia has introduced these democratic tools to the CSR platform of which those actors are part of (4). Kenya (2): &#x2022; In 2019 the African Extractives Working Group (AEWG) seeks to influence the African Union (AU) to amend sections of the African Mining Vision (AMV) towards a people centered mining vision. ActionAid Kenya will play a pivotal role in collecting and analyzing regional consultations with affected communities. It is anticipated that the AU will consider those analyses to amend the AMV. &#x2022; ActionAid Kenya supports dialogue meetings for HRDs and the National Assembly committee on security and human rights to push for the formulation of an HRDs Protection Law. Consequently, the National Assembly committee on security and human rights will develop a Law for the protection of HRDs. Netherlands (11): In 2019 we will follow-up on the new policy frameworks of the Dutch government and international institutions with specific proposals on: &#x2022; The Dutch government and members of Parliament will increasingly pay attention to the need for responsible mineral supply chains as a result of ActionAid&#x2019;s continued lobby on this topic, using our research on the role of the Netherlands in the international mineral market (1). &#x2022; As a result of the dissemination of ActionAid&#x2019;s report from 2018 on the inclusion of human rights safeguards in the mineral supply chains of wind turbines and the follow up research that will be done in 2019, among the Parliamentary Committee on Climate and Energy, the Ministry of the Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Economic Affairs and the industry association of the renewable energy sector, it is expected that at least one of these actors will increasingly pay attention to the risks in renewable energy supply chains. The report is based on cases in various LLMICs, among which Zambia (1). &#x2022; Corporates involved in mineral supply chains and governments will emphasize the need for stronger gender-sensitive policies in the area of development and trade, and implementation of these policies at NL, EU and international level. This is a result of the continued participation of AA in the Dutch government-led working group on women and mining, of the dissemination of papers and of presentations at international fora (2). &#x2022; ActionAid will discuss its proposals on land rights, particularly women&#x2019;s land rights, VGGT and FPIC implementation, with different actors. They will engage with decision-makers in the Multi-Stakeholder Dialogue on Land, and they will propose written questions and motions where relevant to the Dutch Parliament and government officials. As a result, landrights are put on the agendas of the Dutch Parliament, Dutch government officials, and CSOs WO=MEN and MVO Platform (4). &#x2022; ActionAid will highlight the gendered impacts of investments and will share policy proposals on gender, corporate accountability and economic diplomacy (including gendered due diligence, the need for a feminist UN treaty, broader approach to decent work and more attention to unpaid carework). As a result, it is expected that this topic is put on the agendas of members of Parliament, the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs and social movements in the Netherlands that work on women&#x2019;s rights (3). Uganda (5): &#x2022; ActionAid Uganda, its partners and other CSOs will develop proposals for negotiation and mediation in a case where communities lost their land to land grabbing. These proposals will be discussed by the government, the company and evictees (1). &#x2022; Communities in one of the project areas, facilitated by ActionAid Uganda and partners, will develop a proposal for improvements of the situation in their area regarding land rights. This proposal will be discussed with the Office of the Prime Minister and Parliament (1). &#x2022; The community in one of the project areas will develop a proposal on land rights on the Deed of Settlement, facilitated by ActionAid Uganda and its partners. This proposal will be discussed by the involved company and the Government (2). &#x2022; By the end of 2019, the Ministry of Finance, Planning and Development will pay increasing attention to the need to renegotiate tax treaties as a result of proposals for alternative revenue mobilization developed by ActionAid Uganda&#x2019;s partner (1). Zambia (4): &#x2022; ActionAid Zambia and its partners will conduct a research on the effects of mining activities on livelihoods (especially housing) of the local communities with specific reference to the resettlement policy. The recommendations from the research will form the basis for advocacy to the local, provincial and national governments. As a result, at least one government body will discuss this further (1). &#x2022; Following an exchange visit to another ActionAid office, ActionAid Zambia will develop proposals for improvements on displacements and relocation of mining communities, on the role of HRDs and on litigation. These proposals will be presented to decision-makers and social movements in meetings, and as a result at least two government bodies/organisations will discuss these further (2). &#x2022; ActionAid Zambia and partners will continue to set the agenda of the local, provincial and national government on community priorities and community demands on improved corporate conduct. As a result of their lobby activities, including advocacy papers and engagement in commemorating international days, at least one government body will discuss this further (1). Zimbabwe (1): ActionAid&apos;s partner organisation will organize the national and local Alternative Mining Indabas where government officials will engage with civil society on corporate conduct in the mining sector. ActionAid Zimbabwe, its partner and other CSOs will propose a revision of the Mines and Minerals Amendment Bill based on the needs of local communities, including topics such as artisanal mining, FPIC and the role of women in the sector. Several government agencies will be present at the AMIs, including local authorities, the Ministries of Mines, Rural Development and Environment, the Environmental Management Agency and members of Parliament. It is expected that at least one of these agencies, most probably the Ministry of Mines, will further discuss the proposal (1).</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">Bangladesh (9): The Social and Environmental Safeguard Policy proposal that AA Bangladesh developed and published this year (see indicator 1C) was discussed in a dialogue session as part of an international conference on Prospects and Challenges of Sustainable Development in Developing Countries organized by Rajshahi University, Bangladesh. A Professor from Chittagong University, Bangladesh, supported by AA Bangladesh, did a presentation on &#x201C;Development Perspective Towards Community and Corporates: A Trend of Ignoring Indigenous Knowledge&#x201D; which focused on human displacement and ecological damage caused by infrastructure development projects. The LNSP shared the recent experiences with the impact of the Mega infrastructure projects like coal power plants, ports and Hi-tech parks. Referring to these experiences and both national and UN legal instruments it was proposed to adopt ActionAid&#x2019;s Social and Environmental Safeguard Policy proposal, that was outlined during the session. Actionaid Bangladesh highlighted key Social and Environmental Safeguard issues in Bangladesh and how these are linked to the Sustainable Development Goals. This meeting managed to put this proposal on the agenda of academics (1), high government officials and related experts (1), international and national-level activists (2). In total around 100 people attended the session, approximately half of which were academics, CSO leaders, and activists, while the rest were mainly affected community leaders (4). The proposal for a Land acquisition and compensation framework that AAB and partners developed in 2019 was discussed in a lobby meeting with the Law Commission. The Bangladesh Law Commission is an independent body set up through the law commission act 1996, that carries out research for enacting new laws or for reforming laws and that makes recommendations to the related ministries and departments or the parliament. In this meeting, that was organized by ActionAid Bangladesh with the participation of affected communities and CSOs, AA proposed to reform existing land laws and develop a comprehensive new land law. The Law Commission responded positively to the proposal. [last update: in February 2020, the Law Commission did develop a comprehensive land law including compensation guidelines, in line with the recommendations from ActionAid Bangladesh. This will be reported in the FGG 2020 reports] (1). The People&#x2019;s Safeguard Committee- Cox&#x2019;s bazar has organized a seminar on social and environmental safeguards which put the issues raised on the agendas of district, town council and non-government stakeholders (3 government department -DC, DoE and Police), representatives, 1 Local Government representative (Cox&#x2019;s Bazar pouroshava &#x2013; town council) and many non-government actors were present in the seminar (2). LNSP conducted biological surveys in the Moheshkhali and Kalapara areas. These reports are used by the LNSP to advocate for changes to the mega-projects being planned and constructed in these areas &#x2013; these are now on the agendas of the District Commission (DC), Department of Environment (DoE) and other related government department (2). Cambodia (6): There is a mechanism in place already which is led by the Ministry of Interior. It is called &#x201C;CSOs and Government Partnership&#x201D;. National NGOs, including AA Cambodia, participate in this forum to review progress in partnership with the government. In 2019, they used this platform to put forward NGO demands on a reform of the restrictive Law on Associations and Non-governmental Organization, which the Ministry agreed to discuss (1). Government officials (Fishery Administrative Offices and Commune Councils, Department of Tourism, and Department of Environment) participated in the training given in May 2019 by ActionAid Cambodia and partners to representatives of nine fishery communities on the Importance of Mangrove Forest and the possibilities for influencing corporate and government actors. Instruments for this that were treated in the training included elements of the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGPs), corporate social responsibility (CSR), Land Tenure, Land Dispute Resolution and Access to Remedy. As a result of this, these government officials in the provinces of Kep and Kampot have put these concerns on their agendas. AAC will do follow-up work with them and with the local communities concerned in 2020 (2). AAC, the NGO Forum on Cambodia, UNHCHR and Oxfam together conducted a multi-stakeholder dialogue on &#x201C;Responsible Foreign Direct Investment in Agriculture in Cambodia&#x201D;. The participants from NGOs and a representative of Vietnam Embassy discussed on the FDI, ELC steps, conflict solution and way forwards. Thus, this was put on the agenda of the Vietnamese Embassy and of the other stakeholders present in the meeting (1). On 24-25 October 2019, a National Advocacy Conference on Land and Natural Resources Governance was conducted by a group of NGOs. The community participation came from nineteen provinces including Pursat, Oddar Meanchey and Mondulkiri. In addition, representatives from the Ministry of Land Management, Ministry of Environment, Ministry of Agriculture participated in the conference. The statement of the conference which stated the key demands and concerns of community were handed to a representative of Ministry of Interior. AAC plans to do follow-up work on this statement in 2020 (1). The CSR Platform of Cambodia of which ActionAid Cambodia is an active member, has lobbied the Council for Development of Cambodia to force companies to take into account CSR principles. As a result, the Council is now drafting a new Investment Law (1). Kenya (13): The National Assembly Committee on Security and Human Rights agreed to develop an HRD Protection Law, as a result of pressure from the CSOs, including ActionAid Kenya. ActionAid Kenya has been involved in developing a draft law with other national CSOs led by the Kenya National Commission on Human Rights (1). Partly as a result of pressure from civil society, including ActionAid Kenya&#x2019;s partner Taita Taveta Human Rights Watch (TTHRW) with financial and strategic support of ActionAid Kenya, the county government of Taita Taveta agreed to develop a Gender Mainstreaming policy in the mining sector, for mining regulation (local equity participation). ActionAid Kenya&#x2019;s partner TTHRW is a member of the taskforce developing the Gender Mainstreaming policy (1). In Elangata Wuas, ActionAid Kenya collaborated with the Bertha Connect Foundation to hold a Forum that brought together national and international media to document on the plight of 42 households that have been dispossessed from their lands. The violations were reported in both national and international media, prompting the Governor of Kajiado County to task the County Land Board to fast track the cases and address it (1). ActionAid Kenya and partner Centre for Human Rights and Civic Education disseminated findings from a GIS mapping exercise earlier carried out on coal mining and its implications. This put the issue of coal mining on the agenda of the County Assembly of Kitui and it enhanced the County Assembly members&#x2019; insights and real situation on the mining and its effects to the environment (1). With financial support from ActionAid Kenya, its partner Malindi Rights Forum and communities identified land utilization as a core priority during community prioritization forums. This was later put on the agenda of the County staff during the budget public participation forums for incorporation into the new County Annual Development Plans. The community called for holistic physical planning to be carried out in specific villages (1). The Kilifi County Assembly has pledged to draft a Land and Environment Policy and will involve ActionAid Kenya&#x2019;s partner Malindi Rights Forum in the process. This came out after a two-day meeting between ActionAid Kenya, Malindi Rights Forum and the Land Committee of the Kilifi County Assembly on violations by the corporates in the county, especially salt mining companies (1). A petition on land injustices by wealthy and politically connected persons drafted by ActionAid Kenya&#x2019;s partner Taita Taveta Human Rights Watch (financially supported by AAK) was submitted to the Senate Committee on Land and Environment. This prompted the Senate Committee to visit Taita Taveta on a fact-finding mission and hold five sittings with the communities. The official report is yet to be released by the committee (1). The National Land Commission (NLC) findings on historical land injustices were disseminated in Marereni and Baringo by ActionAid Kenya&#x2019;s partners Malindi Rights Forum and Kamnarok Farmers Association respectively. It is still astonishing that recommendations by the NLC are yet to be implemented, especially around the expansion of the salt mining belt. This matter was brought to the attention of the Member of Parliament for Marereni; it became part of his agenda and he pledged to the communities to follow up on the matter (1). ActionAid Kenya, together with several other Kenyan NGOs, organized a national conference around the Community Land Act. During this conference, they discussed their proposals regarding the safeguarding of tenure and citizen&#x2019;s rights with the National Land Commission and the Ministry of Lands and Physical Planning; it is now on their agenda and they will have to take these proposals into consideration (2). A press release issued by ActionAid Kenya&#x2019;s partner Taita Taveta Human Rights Watch on Kishushe people&#x2019;s aspirations and grievances was taken up by the press. It generated considerable public interest and debate and made them a matter of public opinion and debate. This was on the effects of mining on local communities (1). ActionAid Kenya partner Malindi Rights Forum took up the issue of sexual harassment at a salt mining company in Kilifi County. This led to media attention and forced the company to develop an employee handbook, which will contain sanctions against sexual harassment at the work place (1). During the National Conference on Mining, Oil and Gas, ActionAid Kenya supported 8 women and 4 men from affected communities to attend and participate. They were able to share their situational analysis and recommendations towards improvement with other actors, including duty bearers, thus placing it on the agenda of government officials in relevant ministries (1). Mozambique (4): In his inauguration speech, the President of Mozambique announced that during his term, the budget for the agrarian sector will be 10% of the total budget (at the moment it is around 4%), in line with the Malabo/Maputo declaration. ActionAid Mozambique&#x2019;s partner ASCUT advocated for this for years (1). After training by ActionAid Mozambique&#x2019;s partner NADEC, women smallholder farmers advocated during Local Consultative Committee meetings for an increase of the number of agriculture extension workers to deliver technical support for smallholder farmers associations. As a result, the local government committed to allocate two more extension workers to the region (1). After training by ActionAid Mozambique&#x2019;s partner CODESA, farmers associations, community leaders and youth organizations advocated for improved corporate conduct regarding the Land Consultation process and for better corporate social responsibility of investors during District Consultative Committee meetings, where private sector actors were also present. As a result, the private sector committed to improving their social responsibility to provide basic services to the community. For example, one sugarcane company agreed to build a delivery house (1). ActionAid Mozambique&#x2019;s partner ASCUT participated in the joint validation of the biennial report of the Malabo Declaration, where they advocated for improvement of the quality of technical assistance to smallholder farmers and to provide local quality seeds to improve the yield. Their proposals were included in the final report that was then presented by the Head of State and discussed at the annual session of the African Union (1). Netherlands (103): Binding Treaty (21): The Ministry of Foreign Affairs discussed their engagement with the binding treaty process at the EU-level after parliamentary questions were submitted by a Member of Parliament (SP). ActionAid Netherlands together with FGG partners Milieudefensie and SOMO released a press release calling on minister Kaag to support the treaty in Brussels, the parliamentary questions were based on the press release (1). Three Members of Parliament (Groenlinks, SP, PvdA) indicated to &#x2018;fight&#x2019; for the binding treaty during the political event ActionAid Netherlands organized with FGG partners on the 4th of June. During this event ActionAid Netherlands&#x2019; proposals for the binding treaty were also put on the agenda of the public sector decision makers present (3). As a result, one Member of Parliament (GroenLinks) (1) spoke out in favor of the binding treaty during the AO IMVO on the 20th of June, resulting in minister Kaag (1) giving more information about her efforts in Brussels. This MP pledged her support during an event ActionAid Netherlands organized with FGG partners, which was followed up in a meeting before the debate (5). The general public discussed ActionAid Netherlands&#x2019; proposal on the feminist demands for the binding treaty during an event we organized at Pakhuis de Zwijger in June together with FGG partners. The public took part in an interactive game where they had to reflect on various human rights violations and different identities, based on experiences from LLMICs (1). Four Members of the European Parliament (PvdD, Groenlinks, PvdA, D66) spoke out in favor of ActionAid the Netherlands&#x2019; proposal to adopt the binding treaty during an FGG European public election debate. During this meeting the proposal was also put on the agenda of the general public (5). GroenLinks policy officers discussed ActionAid Netherlands&#x2019; and partners&#x2019; proposal to adopt the binding treaty, after human rights defenders from Mozambique and the Philippines presented their demands, during a lobby meeting with FGG member organisations at the parliament organized by ActionAid (1). During the binding treaty negotiations in Geneva ActionAid Netherlands and partners from Zambia and Guatemala discussed proposals for the treaty text with 6 different government delegations (EU, Netherlands, France, Spain, Finland and Switzerland) in bilateral meetings (6). Media (RTV Noord and Dagblad van het Noorden) picked up ActionAid Netherlands&#x2019; and partners&#x2019; proposal to adopt the binding treaty, for example through an interview with ActionAid partners from Zambia and Guatemala during the Feminists Unite speakertour and through a joint press release of ActionAid and other FGG partners (1). The Ministry of Foreign Affairs introduced their appreciation of the Binding Treaty in a letter to Parliament, thanks to a request by a SP Member of Parliament for which ActionAid Netherlands and FGG partners advocated (1). Feminist Binding Treaty (14): High-level officials at the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs discussed ActionAid Netherlands&#x2019; feminist proposals to the binding treaty, as a result of letters sent to Minister Kaag by ActionAid in collaboration with FGG partners and with MamaCash and WO=MEN (1). The feminist binding treaty and gender due diligence was put on the agenda of the media after an opinion editorial written by ActionAid Netherlands, WO=MEN and Hivos was published on online media platform Joop! (1). ActionAid Netherlands feminist proposals for the binding treaty &#x2018;were discussed by CSOs and social movements during two side-events ActionAid organized with the feminist4bindingtreaty coalition at the negotiations (1). During a parliamentary roundtable where ActionAid Netherlands was invited to speak as an expert the feminist binding treaty demands were put on the agenda of 6 different Members of Parliament (PvdD, Groenlinks, PvdA, SP, D66, VVD) and 2 corporations (Tony Chocolonely and VNO NCW). This was the first time the 6 MPs heard the feminist demands and the first time the D66 and VVD MPs engaged with the binding treaty. As a result 3 MPs (Groenlinks, SP, PvdA) called attention to the treaty during the annual budget debate (8). During an event at the Asser Institute where ActionAid Netherlands was invited to speak as an expert, academics (Asser Institute, Wageningen University, Essex University, OECD Watch) discussed our demands for a feminist binding treaty (1). During the Feminists Unite tour organized by ActionAid Netherlands and partners from Zambia and Guatemala, feminist demands for the binding treaty were put on the agenda of social movements (Groningen Bodem Beweging, Women&#x2019;s March Groningen, FNV, student association) in the Netherlands for the first time. These movements and ActionAid&#x2019;s partners discussed their experiences together and exchanged strategies (1). During the Night of the UN organized by the Nationale Jeugdraad (NJR), ActionAid Netherlands organized a feminist leadership workshop for the general public, where we discussed the feminist demands for the binding treaty and got people to sign our petition calling on the Dutch government to ambitiously engage with the feminist binding treaty (1). Mandatory (gendered) due diligence (33): During the political event ActionAid organized at Nieuwspoort with FGG members (SOMO and Milieudefensie) and IUCN NL in June, 3 MPs (Groenlinks, SP, PvdA) spoke out in favor of mandatory human rights due diligence (3). Mandatory human rights due diligence legislation was put on the agenda of the media after ActionAid Netherlands published an opinion editorial on Joop! (1). During a meeting ActionAid organized in collaboration with MVO platform, 2 anonymous corporations spoke out in favor of mandatory human rights due diligence legislation. ActionAid has proposed mandatory due diligence legislation for several years (2). ActionAid Netherlands&#x2019; proposal for gender due diligence was put on the agenda of the media after ActionAid published a blog on gender due diligence on specialized media platform Business and Human Rights resource centre (1). The Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs discussed ActionAid Netherlands&#x2019; proposal for mandatory human rights due diligence during several meetings with ActionAid and partners, and after various parliamentary questions and input by different members of parliament that ActionAid lobbied (1). The Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs discussed ActionAid&#x2019;s proposals for a gender lens to due diligence during a lunch meeting we organized with Green &amp; Justice, ActionAid Zambia and Guatemala. During the same meeting the proposals were set on the agenda of RVO, an important feat as they are the main government agency involved with the conduct of Dutch companies abroad (2). 8 Dutch Ministries (Foreign Affairs, Economic Affairs, Social Affairs, Finance, Infrastructure, Agriculture, Justice, Internal Affairs) and the Social Economic Council discussed ActionAid&#x2019;s proposals for mandatory human rights due diligence during a high-level meeting ActionAid participated in (8 &#x2013; MFA already counted in previous outcome). 11 corporations and trade associations (in the banking, dredging and marine, bioconservation, retail, metal and food industry sectors) discussed ActionAid&#x2019;s proposals for mandatory human rights due diligence during a high-level meeting at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs ActionAid participated in (10 &#x2013; one already counted in previous outcome). 4 Members of Parliament (SP, Groenlinks, PvdA, CU) spoke out in favour of ActionAid&#x2019;s proposals for binding measures during the &#x2018;Algemeen Overleg IMVO&#x2019; on the 20th of June. As a result, Minister Kaag pledged to research the possibility of speeding up the covenants evaluation. ActionAid Netherlands in collaboration with MVO platform sent input on binding measures to parliamentarians in the run up to the debate (5). Other (35): The Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs published a policy letter admonishing the oil &amp; gas sector for their lack of implementation of the OECD guidelines and specifically their lack of grievance mechanisms and urging them to create an action plan for the implementation of the guidelines and the establishment of proper grievance mechanisms. This was the result of the National Contact Point report on the sector which was finally published after ActionAid Netherlands, together with MVO platform, advocated for this (1). The Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs embarked on an ambitious multi-stakeholder process to introduce additional corporate accountability regulations, of which gender is a central element. This was initiated after years of extensive lobbying by ActionAid Netherlands and partners, such as MVO Platform and SOMO (1). The Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs pledged to strife for revision of the OECD Guidelines to be improved to include land rights and gender in response to parliamentary questions by Members of Parliament. ActionAid Netherlands together with other organizations, such as MVO platform and SOMO, lobbied for this (1).

ActionAid Netherlands contributed to setting the agenda of the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs and RVO on the inclusion of VGGT and FPIC principles and women&#x2019;s land rights in the land@scale programme during a number of meetings and consultation processes with stakeholders, including CSOs. As a result, the VGGTs and women&#x2019;s land rights are emphasized in the programme (1). ActionAid Netherlands, together with ActionAid Brussels and ActionAid International, provided inputs for and feedback on a consultancy paper aimed at improving the European Investment Bank&#x2019;s (EIB) social and environmental standards from a land and gender perspective. Our advice was taken on board in the final recommendations to the EIB (1). The Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs and RVO discussed ActionAid Netherlands&#x2019; report on &#x2018;Advancing Equitable Land Governance; Key Lessons for Programme Design and Implementation&#x2019;, for example during lobby meetings and in the process for the Multi-Stakeholder Dialogue on Land (2). As a result of discussions and lobby meetings of ActionAid Netherlands and ActionAid EU with European parliamentarians on mandatory human rights due diligence, various European parliamentary committees (Human Rights, Trade and Justice) are officially requesting to write their own reports on this topic (3). ActionAid Netherlands&#x2019; proposals for mandatory human rights due diligence were discussed by government delegations and corporations during the Finnish presidency conference in Brussels, after ActionAid EU together with civil society organizations advocated for this (2). During the negotiations for the CSR agreement on wind energy, where ActionAid Netherlands was the only NGO at the table, the government discussed ActionAid&#x2019;s proposals on how to ensure more flexible and more effective/impactful ways in which NGOs can contribute to the sector agreements. As a result, the government organized a wider meeting with a large number of NGOs and CSOs to discuss this further (1). During an event at Pakhuis de Zwijger (Grondstoffenparadox), Stedin and Alliander spoke out about the need for mandatory due diligence laws after discussions with ActionAid Netherlands about the human rights abuses that are linked to the many minerals that are needed and used for the development of renewable energy sources (2). The Bank fur Kirche expressed that investors and NGOs should work together in getting the companies to do their due diligence as a result of ActionAid Netherlands contributing to a round table talk at the European Responsible Investment Network about how to get companies to do their due diligence in the energy transition (1). The International Labour Organization and IMPACT expressed their interest in working with the Women and Mining Working Group, that ActionAid Netherlands is a core member of, after we facilitated and contributed to an interactive session on gendered human rights abuses in the mining sector at the OECD Forum in Paris on responsible mineral supply chains (2). The Copper Alliance discussed how to include all mining affected communities and not just indigenous people as initially stated in the responsible copper scheme that they are developing. ActionAid Netherlands addressed this point at a round table event initiated by the Copper Alliance (1). Government officials from several resource-rich countries discussed ActionAid Netherlands&#x2019; proposal on mitigating the adverse impacts of mining on women in a session on gender co-organized by ActionAid during the Intergovernmental Forum on Minerals and Metals in Geneva (1). ActionAid Netherlands published the &#x2018;Human Rights in Wind Turbine Supply Chains&#x2019; report, which concluded that wind turbine manufacturers are still lagging behind when it comes to doing their human rights due diligence. The Dutch mainstream newspapers like Trouw, Volkskrant and Telegraaf wrote about the report. We also had coverage in specialist media and on OneWorld (1). As part of an open consultation of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the, then recently published, Dutch Implementation Law of the EU conflict mineral Regulation, ActionAid Netherlands set the agenda of the Dutch Ministry, stressing the importance of including rules on transparency in the due diligence process of the companies and the inclusion of CSOs and experts to monitor the implementation of the EU regulation (1). Academics (researchers and Master students from Wageningen University) and civil society discussed ActionAid Netherlands&#x2019; proposals for the realization of a just food transition during an event at the Wageningen University that ActionAid co-organized (2). The Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs discussed the proposal from the Women Land Rights group, of which ActionAid Netherlands is part, to pay more attention to women&#x2019;s land rights and local women&#x2019;s voices during trade missions. As a result, the Ministry paid attention to these topics in a trade mission to Nigeria (1). In response to parliamentary questions, the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs has pledged to advocate for the revision of the OECD Guidelines at the OECD, aimed at improvement of land rights and gender safeguards within the guidelines, after ActionAid and OECD Watch advocated for this with parliamentarians (1). In conversations with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, ActionAid Netherlands put the importance of respecting FPIC principles and gendered due diligence on the agenda of Dutch policymakers (MoFA, Director of the World Bank and APG) as a result of its research on investments in Brazil that have links with Dutch investment and supply chains, and where environmental and human rights violations have been identified (1). The Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs is implementing the revision of the National Action Plan on Business &amp; Human Rights due to an adopted motion by Groenlinks, for which ActionAid Netherlands advocated. The existing National Action Plan does not comply with the standards of the UNGPs and is gender-blind, the revision offers an opportunity to change this (1). Uganda (2): ActionAid Uganda&#x2019;s contribution as a witness before the Commission of Inquiry into Effectiveness of Land Administration and Governance has led to two recommendations by the Commission. First, the re-establishment of District Land Tribunals, chaired by a grade one magistrate, as full time dispute resolution mechanisms with an expanded membership (1). Second, the restructuring of the Land Act to include the option for disputing parties to both appoint an additional mediator (2). Zambia (7): ActionAid Zambia&#x2019;s partner and the Local Council undertook an audit to establish the extent of damage of housing units and how other livelihood activities have been affected by the operations of mining companies. The report was presented before and discussed by the District Development Coordinating Committee and the Resettlement Provincial Office on the Copperbelt (1). ActionAid Zambia (AAZ) supported its partner financially and with advice to hold the first ever District Alternative Mining Indaba which attracted various government departments. In the same way, they also supported the holding of two Provincial Alternative Mining Indabas and the national Zambia Alternative Mining Indaba. AAZ and its partners were pushing for the adoption of the Women&#x2019;s Mining Charter by the government. During these engagements, AAZ and its partners organized side events where the research findings on the status of women in mining communities was shared. This led to the evidence-based advocacy for adopting the women&#x2019;s mining charter. Now the Ministry of Gender is on the forefront to engage other stakeholders to adopt this charter as it promotes the interests of women in the mining communities (1). ActionAid Zambia&#x2019;s partner conducted a research on the effects of mining activities on livelihoods for especially women. The key finding was that agriculture is affected by mining, and women have to move long distances to fetch firewood and other forest products. Access and control over land remains a challenge, especially for women. ActionAid Zambia and the community used the outcomes on access to land to inform the ongoing Land Policy formulation of the government, by discussing it with them in bilateral meetings (1). ActionAid Zambia prepared a position paper on the effects of mining on women, based on the Women&#x2019;s Mining Charter that was developed by the local women themselves with financial support and advice of ActionAid and partners. This paper was submitted to and discussed with the Ministry of Mines, to influence the revision of the 2013 Mineral Resources Development Policy (1). ActionAid Zambia attended the international Alternative Mining Indaba in South Africa, and participated in the march of civil society to ask for an invitation to the regular Mining Indaba as well for them and for communities affected by mining. Now, the regular Mining Indaba is mostly a mining company and government affair. As a result of the march, the organizers of the regular Mining Indaba agreed to invite CSOs and communities next year and to provide dedicated timeslots for them (1). ActionAid Zambia and its partner set up a meeting between a mining company and the community, where they put forward the importance of solid resettlement policies. As a result, the company committed to engage resettled families more and to find ways to solve challenged faces by communities as a result of resettlement (1). ActionAid Zambia and its partner set up a meeting with a mining company and the community and put forward their proposals for improved water provision and the prevention of water pollution. The company committed to sink ten deeper boreholes, and to provide water filters and water pipes to the affected communities (1). Zimbabwe (7): As a result of lobby activities by five CSOs trained by ActionAid Zimbabwe&#x2019;s partner ZELA, the Zimbabwe Environmental Management Agency has pledged to better monitor mining companies&#x2019; Environmental Impact Assessments and to report environmental violations (1). The Zimbabwe Consolidated Diamond Company invited five CBOs to an All Stakeholders Diamond Security Conference in Mutare to discuss the declaration that the CBOs developed with support from ActionAid Zimbabwe&#x2019;s partner ZELA. Points on the agenda were corporate accountability, continued violations of human rights and a lack of support for local communities (1). The Parliament of Zimbabwe invited ActionAid Zimbabwe&#x2019;s partner ZELA to discuss its proposed amendments and contributions to the Mines and Minerals Amendment Bill. These proposed changes are focused on ensuring that the Bill includes mechanisms to ensure that communities benefit from mining activities in their areas (1). In Zimbabwe, civil society actors and social movements from two communities discussed and gave their inputs on the proposals of ActionAid Zimbabwe&#x2019;s partner ZELA to develop an ideal Operational Grievance Redress Mechanism for the Zimbabwe Consolidated Diamond Company during a meeting organized by ZELA (1). Together with the Zimbabwe Diamonds Allied Workers, ActionAid Zimbabwe organized the Manicaland Women&#x2019;s Symposium on Extractives. During the Symposium, government representatives and policymakers together with other participants discussed ActionAid&#x2019;s proposals to fight abuse and inequality in the mining sector. These proposals were also picked up by national and local media (2). During a training that ActionAid Zimbabwe&#x2019;s partner ZELA gave to staff members of the Zimbabwe Consolidated Diamond Company (ZCDC) on Business and Human Rights, the company admitted that their current grievance mechanism is not sufficient. ZCDC requested ZELA to develop an Operational Grievance Redress Mechanism. ZELA has thus far developed the Grievance Redress Mechanism, which is yet to be adopted by the company (1).</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">Zambia (5): ActionAid has been supporting Human Rights Defenders in setting up a platform for HRD protection. This initiative started at local level and was strengthened when a team of FGG partners from Zambia visited their FGG partners in Kenya. From the Kenya experience, it was encouraging to the Zambian partners how HRDs were mobilised and linked to national and international protection mechanism. This was an agenda for Zambia partners and they immediately drafted a proposal supported by ActionAid to design a protection mechanism for HRDs especially women. This was discussed at the three CSOs platforms in the mining communities and ActionAid took it up and linked up with other organisations at national level where as a network of CSOs the issue was presented to the ministry of Justice and discussed with the government&#x2019;s legal aid department to see how an enabling environment can be created for HRDs by putting in place legal protection mechanisms. Currently, ActionAid together with the other organisations have been working towards establishing a national HRDs platform and exploring opportunities for linkages with the international mechanisms. (1) Four networks of women living in mining communities in four districts have been established through the Women&#x2019;s assembly that gave birth to the formation of the Women Affected by Mining Movement in Zambia. ActionAid supported with mobilisation of district networks which are acting as HRDs protection mechanisms linked to the legal aid, Law Association of Zambia and the national network for HRDS. The four district networks for women also engaged with duty bearers and mining companies on issues of human rights affecting women and proposals for improvement. (4) Kenya (7): ActionAid supported 3 communities to develop memorandums that included the views and recommendations from the public. They present these memorandums during a meeting with the governmental task force which was established by the government to develop regulations to guide renewal and extension of leases where their memorandums were discussed. ActionAid working with CSOs working group on community land developed a comprehensive gap analysis and recommendations for improvement of the regulations to operationalize community land law and shared with the Government Task Force spearheading the development of these regulations. The proposals were discussed by the taskforce and a number of recommendations have been incorporated in the draft final guidelines. ActionAid together with other CSOs submitted to the Technical working group developing a gap analysis for the extractive sector and particularly on environment and social issues as part of the comprehensive envisioning of the change desired. ActionAid partner mobilized elders and sensitized them on cultural norms that affect women in the mining areas and the rights violations of female day-labourers by the company&#x2019;s staff members. To put this on the agenda of the relevant duty-bearers, the elders were supported by ActionAid&apos;s partner to hold a press conference. This was aired/ broadcasted on the TV prime news (1). As a result, the manager of the mining company (1) called a meeting with ActionAid&apos;s partner and asked the organization to hold forums with workers of his company to discuss labour rights. Cambodia (7): ActionAid&apos;s partner supported a community to send proposals for improved participation in governmental process toward relevant ministries. These proposals were discussed by the relevant ministries.(1) ActionAid&apos;s partner together with other NGOs submitted a proposal to improve the negotiations with the local communities around relocations. This was discussed and acted upon by the Municipality of Phnom Penh. (1) ActionAid worked together with other NGOs to engage with a company to discuss their corporate conduct. From dialogue with ActionAid the company agreed to participate in the CSR platform. At this platform, the CSOs and the company discussed various guidelines for corporate conduct (1). ActionAid&apos;s partner&apos;s proposals to resolve a community conflict was discussed by four influential stakeholders (4). Zimbabwe (1): As a result of the court decision interdicting a mining company from carrying out its mining operations until an EIA was in place, the company approached ActionAid&apos;s partner organisations calling for a meeting to understand concerns which the community had over its operations. During the meeting, ActionAid partners encouraged the mining company to establish a grievance redress platform to address some of the human rights problems that could emanate from its work. The mining company agreed to work on establishing the operational grievance redress mechanism as a means to build community-company relations. Bangladesh (7) 1. AAB submitted a policy recommendation for the land acquisition act and the agricultural land protection act around ensuring safeguards for people and environment to the Land Reform Board (LRB) in a lobby meeting between LRB and affected communities. The proposal was discussed by LRB (Government), CSOs, and affected community experts. 2. AAB organized a policy caf&#xE9; on land acquisition, displacement and people&#x2019;s safeguards with 30 experts, lawyers, academics, environmentalists and HRDs to formulate policy recommendations for improved laws and policies related to land acquisition, environment, infrastructure development and people&#x2019;s safeguard. 3. AAB supported local CSO to organize a workshop with 35 CSOs, academics, youth and HRDs to develop people&#x2019;s safeguards around investment projects. They demand the authorities to implement the high court notice about improve policies and safeguards for affected people included. 4. AAB and local CSOs organized a workshop with local CSOs, journalists, people representatives and lawyers on landlessness and ensuring people&#x2019;s safeguards in land acquisition processes. Through the workshop they demanded the government to allocate land (government owned fallow land) to landless people, stop corruption related to land acquisition and compensation for those affected. 5. With support of AAB, HRDs organized a seminar on industrialization and communities&apos; livelihoods. As a result it was discussed by private and public sector decision makers. 6. With AAB support, a partner CSO organized a dialogue on displacement with academia, environmentalists, lawyers, youth and HRDs. Topics discussed included pro-people development instead of the present development processes, raising the question whether one can speak of development when people are displaced from their land and lose their livelihoods, environment is damaged and culture lost without any adequate resettlement and safeguards 7. Community groups asked the government and the project implementation authority to ensure adequate resettlement and hassle free adequate compensation by organizing a press conference and a &#x2018;human chain&#x2019; procession. Uganda (2) The Commission of Inquiry into Land Grabs requested ActionAid and its partner to make proposals for the development of Alternative Dispute Resolution where land is customarily held. The delegation led by AAU appeared before the Commission on the 23rd of May 2017. The Commission was interested in sharing experiences and examples where ADR has been successful to inform their recommendations for improvement of grievance handling mechanisms where land is held under customary tenure (1) The AAU supported community consultations held in August with Members of Parliament, community leaders, opinion leaders, religious leaders, youth leaders to discuss the proposed amendment of article 26 of the Constitution set the agenda for debate on (opposing) the amendment in Parliament, media, academia, religious leaders, traditional leaders and youth institutions. There was such an impact to the extent that Members of Parliament from the ruling party had to be called to reconsider their opinion on the proposed amendment.(1) Netherlands (19) During our coal cruise awareness with green organizations was brought about on the need to also address the social aspect of energy transition in their work . AA proposals on human rights in coal supply chains and the need for a socially just energy transition were discussed on tv (NOS news), radio, various newspapers (Parool, Trouw), other print (ViceVersa magazine) and online media (ViceVersa various articles and specialized energy media). (1) Through AANL dialogues with the wind energy industry organization and the Ministry of Economic Affairs on human rights risks in mineral supply chains for wind turbines (and other green technologies) were put on the agenda. The interaction with the industry association gave impetus to internal sector discussions and the willingness to start discussions to get to a sector agreement. The email correspondence led to internal discussions at the Ministry of Economic Affairs on the matter (1). Jointly with the other members of the women&amp;mining - MFA led- WG, two papers were produced that call on governments and companies to respect women&#x2019;s rights and adopt stronger gender-sensitive policies in mineral supply chains. (2) AANL individually and together with WO=MEN called for improved attention for women&#x2019;s rights in mineral supply chains in the metal and natural stones sector agreement discussions, which includes private and public sector decision makers (1). Written inputs on land and women&#x2019;s rights were shared with natural stone sector (1). In parallel, efforts by the MFA led women and mining WG- in which AANL is an active member- led to include women&#x2019;s rights as a theme at the MFA/EA raw materials conference as well as the OECD minerals conference. Dutch parliamentarians discussed several of our proposals on the importance of protecting and supporting women&#x2019;s land rights and human rights defenders + the importance of investing in small-scale farmers. In response to an ActionAid pitch on a stronger women&#x2019;s land rights and farmer focus for Dutch aid and investment policies, 3 MPs asked questions and in the debate around the national annual development budget (BuHa-OS policy) 4 MPs discussed our proposals: 1 MP (Greens) asked the Minister to protect land rights defenders better, 1 asked for more focus on local food markets (CDA) and 2 MPs asked for adopting more gender-sensitive trade and investment policies (PvdA and CDA; including a motion from CDA), which was the recommendation we shared with them both directly and via wo=men. (4) The Ministry and RVO have discussed the relevance of applying VGGT and FPIC in their policies as a result of our ongoing lobby together with Both Ends, Oxfam and others, as well as our VGGT scorecard specifically which helped put it on the agenda of different departments after being launched at the AU. (1) As a result of the work of ActionAid, both individually and with other CSOs (FGG and Partos Civic Space group), embassies, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and institutions such FMO have discussed the issue of shrinking space for specific countries (e.g. in response to Uganda raid), as well as proposals to address this issue and ensure an enabling environment for civil society as a precondition to responsible corporate conduct as well. We further supported the SPEAK initiative on addressing shrinking space, which was published in the media advertisement and an op-ed on Joop (1). ActionAid send and supported various letters to the new Minister, including one with indigenous people&#x2019;s on the need to ensure their rights (incl to land) as part of Dutch and Trade policies, to which the Minister responded that NL will continue to support this issue.(1) AA has provided input for sector studies on the importance of land rights for international responsible business conduct. AA proposals on how land rights should feature in the covenants have been discussed with policy makers and academia, during a workshop by KIT in August, as well as during the covenant multi-stakeholder dialogue (1). ViceVersa published interview with AA staff including proposals on how to ensure corporate conduct and coherent aid&amp;trade policies, including addressing imbalance of power in the value chain and ensuring attention to human rights and land rights at all times. (1) LandAc and Women Land Rights in Africa programme team discussed AA NL and AAIK/ AAI recommendations on supporting women&#x2019;s land rights and the Women2Kilimanjaro movement within this programme and in development and research policies more generally, including a grassroots action research approach led by women themselves. This was also discussed at the LandAc conference by a wide range of stakeholders based on AA presentations (1). AA proposals for improving covenants as well as going beyond by installing binding regulation on companies were discussed in articles on ViceVersa (referring back to AA own article) and in inputs from MVO platform to parliament (1). AA proposals on conflict mineral law implementation in the Netherlands was discussed in op-ed in Trouw (feb 2017) (1) ActionAid finalized and presented its VGGT scorecard at the CFS in October 2017, as well as provided direct input to the monitoring exercise of all governments at the CFS. This contributed to a clear and noticeable progression in international discussions on monitoring and implementation of the VGGT worldwide and the commitment to continue bi-annual monitoring reporting by governments at the CFS (1).</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">Bangladesh (10): Policy makers will discuss ActionAid Bangladesh&#x2019;s policy brief on the binding instrument on Transnational Corporations and human rights during a consultation workshop with HRDs and CSOs, organized by ActionAid Bangladesh (1). Partner organization YPSA and a people&#x2019;s commission will publish extensive documentation on people&#x2019;s struggles related to a coal-fired power plant project, and they will propose alternatives for people&#x2019;s livelihoods. They will use this proposal in order to hopefully meet community demands for mitigating the adverse effects of the project and for compensation (7). Partner organizations YPSA and IRV will conduct two social audits to measure, understand and report on the adverse impacts that corporate interventions have on women living in the communities. These social audits will be shared with and discussed by the media and civil society (2). Cambodia (6): In meetings of the Cambodian CSR platform, corporates will discuss proposals put forward by ActionAid Cambodia, CCHR and other NGOs on improving companies&#x2019; policies related to social, environmental and human rights issues (1). Corporates and policymakers will discuss partner organisation CCHR&#x2019;s factsheets on what business can do to respect human rights and on the freedom of association and land conflicts during policy dialogue meetings. In the factsheet, CCHR puts forward proposals on the improvement of laws and policies related to business and human rights in the land sector (2). Government officials, corporations and civil society will discuss CCHR&#x2019;s research report on corporate misconduct during events and engagement meetings. The report describes specific cases related to land, and gives lessons learned and recommendations for policy improvements (3). Attempts will be made to engage a Chinese developer into a dialogue that would lead to them identifying adverse impacts of their activities. So far, the company has refused such a dialogue, so we do not expect a real outcome in 2020 yet (0). Kenya (6): ActionAid supported communities to develop visions for a sustainable future of mining affected communities. These visions will be presented for discussion by corporates and government during sessions towards domesticating the African Mining Vision. (1) ActionAid Kenya and its partners supported women to develop charter of demands on the National Land Policy and its implementation framework. The government is implementing these by developing a training manual on women&#x2019;s land rights and land sector gender policy. Women will be supported to contribute to these processes using the charter and implementation framework as reference. This will cause the Government Task Force, the Ministry of Land and Physical Planning, the National Land Commission, the Parliamentary Committee and the full Parliament to discuss the proposals by women. (5) Mozambique (7): The Parliament will discuss a partner organisation&#x2019;s position papers in the process of revising the legal framework around land. The position papers advocate for more attention for women&#x2019;s rights in the new land policy, as well as for gender-responsive public service provision in the area of land law (1). In the process of the revision of the Mozambican Land Law, the Parliament, the Ministry of Agriculture and the Ministry of Land and Environment will discuss ActionAid Mozambique&#x2019;s proposals for separating the Agriculture Law from the Food and Nutrition Law, and their proposals regarding the inclusion of rights of women and communities in the new policy framework (3). The government, civil society and investors will discuss ActionAid Mozambique&#x2019;s proposals on the revision of the legal land policy framework, such as better inclusion of the rights of women and the Free, Prior and Informed Consent (FPIC) principles, during media debates organized by ActionAid Mozambique (3). Netherlands (19): ActionAid Netherlands will continue to highlight the gendered impacts of corporate abuse and put forward the feminist perspective to the binding treaty on Business and Human Rights as a solution. This will be set on the agenda of the Dutch public (1) and media (1) through our campaign activities and stunts and published blogs and opinion editorials. We will set the agenda of the departments DDE, IMH and GTF within the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (3) by providing written lobby inputs and by having structural and ad hoc advocacy meetings. MPs (1) of SP, PvdA, Groenlinks and D66 will discuss this during AOs or by submitting parliamentary questions and we will set their agenda by providing written and oral lobby inputs. It will be put on the agenda of academics (1) and social movements (1) by organizing meetings and by publishing articles and position papers on specialized media platforms (8). ActionAid Netherlands will continue to advocate for the necessity of binding legislation to improve corporate conduct in collaboration with MVO platform. This will be set on the agenda of the Dutch media (1) through our campaign activities and stunts and by publishing blogs and opinion editorials. The agenda of the MPs (1) of ChristenUnie, 50+, D66 and CDA will be set through targeted lobby efforts and they will discuss it during AOs, specifically surrounding the evaluation of the voluntary sector agreements and the implementation of the child labor due diligence legislation. We will put it on the agenda of departments DDE and IMH within the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (2) during a structural dialogue in corporate accountability (4). As a result of the dissemination of ActionAid Netherlands&#x2019; report from 2018 on the inclusion of human rights safeguards in the mineral supply chains of wind turbines and the follow up research done in 2019, the Parliamentary Committee on Climate and Energy will increasingly pay attention to the risks in renewable energy supply chains during meetings and debates on renewable energy, climate action and just transition (1). Due to ActionAid Netherlands&#x2019; lobby around the effectiveness of the voluntary sector agreements, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs will initiate multi stakeholder talks including civil society, knowledge institutions and companies on mandatory human rights due diligence measures for the metal and mineral sector (1). The industry associations of the renewable energy sector will increasingly put the need for responsible mineral supply chains on the companies&#x2019; agenda by organizing meetings on how they can best address human rights risks in supply chains. This will be a result of ActionAid Netherlands&#x2019; continued lobby on this topic, using our research on the role of the Netherlands in the international mineral market (1). Corporates involved in mineral supply chains and governments will emphasize the need for stronger gender-sensitive policies in the area of development and trade, and implementation of these policies at national, European and international level. This is a result of continued participation of ActionAid Netherlands in the Dutch government-led working group on women and mining, of the dissemination of papers and of presentations at international fora (see the &#x201C;Stakeholder Statement on Implementing Gender-Responsive Due Diligence and ensuring the human rights of women in Mineral Supply Chains&#x201D; on www.womenandmining.org) (2). Due to the results of the research on manganese realized under the African Extractives Working Group (of which ActionAid Netherlands is a member) and the results of the Monitor Brede Welvaart (2018, 2019) emphasizing the Dutch mineral footprint, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs will initiate and engage in conversations with companies and civil society on the realization of a just and fair transition (1). The Ministry of Foreign Affairs will discuss ActionAid&#x2019;s proposals for mandatory due diligence, put forward in its publication on corporate accountability cases and strategies, in the run up to the evaluation process of the voluntary sector agreements. This publication will be co-created by ActionAid Netherlands and the other FGG ActionAid countries (1). Roving Advisor (1): During a multi-stakeholder dialogue meeting, organized by the Roving Advisor, actors from governments, corporates and CSOs will come together to discuss cases of corporate misconduct. The recommendations coming from this meeting will be used by ActionAid to lobby to regional bodies such as Southern African Development Community, Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa, African Union and the United Nations. It is expected that at least one of these bodies will discuss the proposal (1). Uganda (4): Affected communities will continue to develop proposals for staying on their land without being arbitrarily chased from it. The proposals will be discussed by the paramount chief, the Office of the Prime minister and Parliament (3). ActionAid Uganda will ask attention for the importance of safeguarding basic human rights and freedoms in Uganda, which will be discussed by the media. This will lead to an increased media mobilization on human rights violations against HRDs and land rights holders (1). This will be possible through facilitating media to document human rights issues, issuing press releases, radio and TV talk shows as well as regular meetings with duty bearers. Zambia (1): ActionAid Zambia and partners will continue to set the agenda of the local, provincial and national government on community priorities and community demands on improved corporate conduct. As a result of their lobby activities, including advocacy papers and engagement in commemorating international days, at least one government body will discuss this further (1). Zimbabwe (8): During local and national Alternative Mining Indabas, organized by partner organisation ZELA and other CSOs, several government departments will discuss the recommendations proposed by ActionAid Zimbabwe, ZELA and other CSOs on improving policies related to corporate conduct in the mining sector. These departments will at least include the Ministry of Mines, the Ministry of Rural Development, the Ministry of Environment, the Environmental Management Agency and the Parliament (5). During a stakeholders&#x2019; engagement meeting, organized by ActionAid Zimbabwe and partner ZELA, several representatives of the government will discuss the progress on adoption of the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) in Zimbabwe. ActionAid Zimbabwe will advocate for swift adoption of the EITI to ensure transparency and accountability in the mining sector, and this will be discussed with members of Parliament, local authorities and the Ministry of Mines (3).</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">AA NL (2): - AA NL has made recommendations towards Dutch government and OECD (eg through OECD watch) in the past years, that contributed to the development and launch (March) of an OECD-FAO guidance note for agricultural supply chains that includes VGGT and land rights and Dutch government promotion of FPIC (not included in the end) in that process. (AAInternational also towards FAO) (1). - An AA NL proposal, in cooperation with Both Ends, for ensuring sufficient support to land rights and particularly to grassroots women&#x2019;s land rights defenders resulted in the Dutch government allocating extra budget (500000 euros) for 2017 to address this cause. (1) - An EU law on conflict minerals was adopted with inputs from ActionAid and other NGOs, yet the result was less than hoped for. AA&apos;s engagement with the Dutch Parliament has led to the adoption of a motion that calls on the government to incentivize companies not only to look at tin, tungsten, tantalum and gold in their due diligence (for which there is a legal obligation) but also look at other potential &#x201D;conflict minerals&#x201D;. This is yet to be turned into policy. (0). Kenya (1): The community land law passed in August 2016 now includes an important recommendation from CSOs and communities that corporates can in the future only invest in land with the consent from communities. In the Community Land Law, that was gazetted in August 2015, many of the inputs resulting from community consultations had been removed. In response to this, ActionAid Kenya collaborated with the National Land Commission to bring together sixty community members to deliberate on the new Bill. ActionAid Kenya ensured that consultations took place with communities and CSOs; that communities presented memorandums and defended the gains that had been recognized by the draft law. When the Community Land Law passed in 2016, it provided a framework for management of community land. It now includes an important recommendation from CSOs and communities that corporates can in the future only invest in land with the consent from communities.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">Kenya (1) Currently, Kenya is developing a mining vision at national level. From our work with counties to put in place mining visions, and from our anticipation that 2 counties will put in place mining visions, this will introduce a policy/ regulations for holding companies accountable for respecting human rights. Uganda (1) ActionAid participates in drafting the amendment of the LAA 1969 and we expect it to be discussed and passed into law by Parliament. The amendment caters for cardinal human rights principles such as FPIC. Bangladesh (1) Based on our planned law and policy review findings, ActionAid will organize a dialogue with the government. One key recommendation would be to have compensation for landless people included in policy amendments and we aim for this to happen in 2018. Uganda (1) Currently, an Agriculture, Food Security and Nutrition law is being developed by the parliament. CSOs including AAM have already started revising the draft proposal of law to ensure that the communities&#x2019; rights and interests are taken into account. Key recommendations focus on 1) inclusion of Conservation Agriculture, 2) more focus on smallholders with limited options to invest in &#x2018;modern&#x2019; tools and technology instead of only on more industrialized forms of agriculture, and 3) to make use of a database developed by AA and partner organisations on land occupation and other land related issues in order to have a realistic basis on which to design the new law. AA Mozambique and other CSOs will lobby for the parliament to incorporate the proposed changes as formulated by civil society into the new law. We expect that this will happen in 2018. Netherlands (3) - ActionAid will lobby for including (women&#x2019;s) land rights in the new Aid&amp;Trade policy, as well as other key policies being developed by the government. Where possible ActionAid takes further steps to support VGGT implementation in line with our recommendations VGGT scorecard published in 2017. (1) - ActionAid will lobby for FPIC directly as well as support the joint work of CSOs on FPIC, such as the organisation of workshops to build the capacity of government officials on integrating FPIC in policy legislation on land matters and land-related investments (eg extractives and agriculture) (1) - By participating in and providing input into various sector agreement negotiations and ongoing lobby towards Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Parliament, we will promote ambitious policies of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to address risks in mineral supply chains that affect communities.

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">Bangladesh (1): Early 2018, ActionAid Bangladesh supported and contributed to the organization of a dialogue meeting with a large international bank and national and international CSOs about the bank&#x2019;s draft Project Affected People&#x2019;s Mechanism (PPM) and Policy on Public Information (PPI). These drafts were based on the People&#x2019;s Safeguard Mechanism that was introduced by ActionAid Bangladesh. Following this meeting, the bank finalized its policies taking into account several recommendations of the CSOs present at the meeting (1). Cambodia (3): Social Land Concessions (SLCs) comprise one of the resolution schemes of the Royal Government of Cambodia (RGC) to redistribute land to landless and land-poor farmers. However, the RGC has not applied this scheme consistently, causing project-affected communities to mobilize and demand its implementation. In one of the project regions, after a decade of advocating to get their lands back, 329 affected families finally obtained SLCs and there are 383 affected families submitting their requesting letter and other documents to the provincial governor for SLCs. ActionAid Cambodia and its partner are members of the Sugar Justice Network, a CSO collective that has been advocating for a solution to the &#x2018;blood sugar&#x2019; land disputes. To this end, they have had many meetings with various Ministries to push for the implementation of the SLC scheme for these 712 families (1). One of ActionAid Cambodia partner&#x2019;s mandates is to provide legal advice to all affected communities across the Kingdom. In relation to one case, the partner has helped 175 communities and another 200 communities (in two instances) with L&amp;A efforts towards compensation packages [remedy], which were eventually adopted by the Ministry and the associated company. Specifically: &#x2022; Following a peaceful march on Phnom Penh by 175 families involved in a long running conflict with a sugar company, the government officially announced to solve their cases along with another 200 affected families from the same province, by compromising with the owner of the company to resolve the conflict by offering compensation packages of $2,500 with 3 hectares of cultivated land for each of the 175 families, and 1.5 hectare of land for each of the 200 families (without cash compensation). Those families received the package of compensation on the same day at the Ministry and the land will be managed to grant to them later (1). &#x2022; On 30 June 2018, the provincial authorities offered a compensation package of $3,000 and 2 hectares of land per family to another 317 affected families in one of the project regions. All the affected families accepted (1). Kenya (0): Although the process of developing county mining visions and a national mining vision was initiated, it was not completed during this reporting period. We hope to be able to report this for 2019 (0). Mozambique (0): ActionAid Mozambique planned to influence the development of the Agriculture, Food Security and Nutrition Law. However, the Parliament did not schedule the discussion of the Law this year, so this target is included in the 2019 plans instead (0). NL (10): ActionAid Netherlands regularly carried out policy advocacy with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, parliamentarians and through the media. One major achievement is that the VGGT, FPIC and women&#x2019;s land rights are now central to the programme document of Land@Scale, a new Dutch land governance support programme that will be launched on March 5, 2019 (1). A second achievement is that the Dutch government has put its commitment to develop new cross-departmental policy to strengthen women&#x2019;s land rights based on the VGGT in the programme document as well (1). After extensive lobbying by ActionAid Netherlands in previous years the Ministry of Foreign Affairs pledged in the new Aid &amp; Trade policy note to constructively engage with the UN Binding Treaty on Business and Human Rights (1). After extensive lobbying by ActionAid Netherlands in previous years the Ministry of Foreign Affairs pledged in the new Aid &amp; Trade policy note to consider binding regulations for corporates after the voluntary sector agreement evaluation in 2019 (1). ActionAid Netherlands used the &#x2018;Monitor Brede Welvaart&#x2019; publication to influence the Parliament on sustainable production and consumption in the extractives value chain. A PvdD MP submitted a motion to mainstream this publication in all Ministry of Foreign Affairs&#x2019; policies. The motion was adopted (1). Following ActionAid Netherlands&#x2019; lobby towards the Parliament on the need for human rights safeguards in wind turbine supply chains, two motions were adopted calling for 1) more transparency in these mineral supply chains and 2) the government to investigate how the UNGPs can be included in tenders of wind turbines and solar parks (2). ActionAid Netherlands provided MPs with written input on corporate accountability in relation to women&apos;s rights in the run up to the debates on the annual aid &amp; trade budgets. As a result, corporate accountability was a strong focus of the debate, with SP, Groenlinks and PvdA MPs pushing for pledges from minister Kaag. 3 motions were passed on corporate accountability, 1 leading to a stricter supervision on standards for corporations by embassies, and 2 leading to a more thorough evaluation of the voluntary sector agreements (3). Zambia (1): ActionAid Zambia and its partner organisations engaged with the Human Rights Commission and the Social Services Department of the government to establish a Human Rights Defenders Desk. As a result, the Desk was put in place at both the local and the provincial level. Communities can file complaints, and the Human Rights Commission deals with the issues related to human rights abuses. As a result of the Desk, it is easier for communities to hold companies accountable for respecting human rights and the environment on the local level (1).</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">Bangladesh (1): In 2019 the Land Reform Board will improve the existing Acquisition and Requisition of Immovable Property Act 2017 by incorporating (parts of the) Land Acquisition and Compensation policy developed by ActionAid Bangladesh and partners. This policy includes basic principles such as the treaty on Business and Human Rights, FPIC and the independent-third party Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA). The law amendment will therefore result in the improvement of the national law on land acquisition for commercial purpose and hence protect vulnerable communities from land grabbing and forced displacement (1). Cambodia (4): ActionAid Cambodia and its partner organisation anticipate that, through their lobby and influencing work towards the Ministry of Land Management, Urban Planning and Constructions, the Ministry of Environment, the Ministry of Agriculture and the National Assembly, those major corporate agencies will have incorporated (elements of) UNGP, FPIC and VGGT for improved accountability within their corporate policies. In 2019 the Law on Access to Information will be endorsed and enacted, as a result of lobby and advocacy work. The enhanced accountability will promote transparency in upcoming decision-making, and will also encourage other CSOs to use the upcoming law as an advocacy tool (3). Kenya (3): &#x2022; The government body the Kenya Wildlife Services, Sanctuaries National Assembly is set to review its Wildlife Conservation and Compensation Act of 2013 and ActionAid will support communities in project sites to develop and submit memorandums to parliament for adoption. As a result of this, Kenya Wild Services, sanctuaries and conservancies will hold themselves accountable by acting according to a mechanism of accountability for respecting human rights and the environment and providing adequate remedy to victims of adverse impacts (1). &#x2022; The Community Land Act 2016 was formulated and endorsed in 2016 and guidelines to operationalize the act will, through the support of ActionAid Kenya, make the implementation possible. ActionAid will facilitate communities to petition the National Assembly to fast track the process. Through this, the National Assembly will pass those guidelines (1). &#x2022; ActionAid Kenya is working to develop and implement, jointly with the government and especially the county governments of Kitui and Taita Taveta, a mining vision in place tailored to the Kenyan context, that is currently absent. This will evolve in a policy/regulation for holding companies accountable for respecting human rights (1). Mozambique (2): &#x2022; CSOs in Mozambique, including ActionAid Mozambique&#x2019;s partner, are discussing possible revisions to the Land Law to ensure that it takes into account the rights of small farmers and communities and does not just focus on the advantages for the private sector. As a result of the partner&apos;s and other CSOs&apos; lobby activities, it is expected that the Parliament will incorporate the proposed changes in the revised Land Law (1). &#x2022; ActionAid Mozambique will continue to support and monitor the design of the Agriculture Law. They will advocate to separate the Agriculture law from the Food and Nutrition Law, to ensure that it reflects the needs of local communities and small farmers, especially women. Also, they will lobby for FPIC to be included. As a result of these lobby activities, it is expected that the Government will include at least one of these elements in the actual Law (1). Netherlands (4): &#x2022; ActionAid will lobby for a stronger focus on women&#x2019;s land rights and implementation of the VGGT in Dutch Aid and Trade policies, particularly policies about private sector development, CSR and food security. As a result of this, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs will mention in at least one policy letter that they aim to strengthen support for women smallholders and land rights/land governance. Where possible, AA takes further steps to support VGGT implementation in line with our recommendations from the VGGT scorecard published in 2017 (1). &#x2022; The Dutch government will improve at least 1 policy related to stronger protection of women&#x2019;s rights and gendered due diligence in CSR, trade and investment policies as a result of ActionAid&#x2019;s lobby activities in 2019 (1). &#x2022; By participating in and providing input into various sector agreement negotiations and through ongoing lobby towards the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, ActionAid will push for strong safeguards on human rights, in particular gender and land rights. As a result, we expect that in at least one of the sector agreements these strong safeguards will be included (1). &#x2022; The Ministry of Economic Affairs and Climate will include human rights references in relation to mineral supply chains in their policies related to wind energy, as a result of ActionAid&#x2019;s awareness raising on the need for addressing risks in renewable energy supply chains in government policies through bilateral meetings, media outreach and public speaking (1). &#x2022; ActionAid will lobby for FPIC directly as well as support the joint work of CSOs on land-related legislation and investments. As a result, we aim for Dutch government departments and Parliament to adopt components of FPIC into key land-related policies (on CSR and agriculture, for example), which will ensure involvement and decision-making power of communities in future land investments. No specific targets are set here for 2019 yet (0). Zambia (1): Partly as a result of ActionAid Zambia and partners&#x2019; policy dialogues and advocacy meetings, the Ministry of Mines will revise the 2013 Mineral Resources Development Policy in 2019. This Policy will consider recent developments in the mining sector in Zambia and the need to domesticate the Africa Mining Vision, and will contribute to more sustainable practices of mining companies (1).</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">Kenya (2): The Wildlife Conservation and Compensation Act of 2013 was reviewed. ActionAid Kenya supported communities to engage with the process. As a result, a proposed amendment to place the Grievance and Compensation Committee at provincial level was successfully challenged by communities and is now placed at county level. Communities argue is it is easier to access compensation at county than provincial level (1). The County Assembly of Kitui discussed the report of the exchange learning visit to South Africa that ActionAid Kenya and its partner Centre for Human Rights and Civic Education undertook in 2018, including their recommendations against coal mining. As a result, the County Assembly adopted a position opposing coal mining in the area of Kitui (1). Mozambique (1): As part of the Agricultural Sector Coordination Committee (CCSA), the Ministry of Agriculture and Food Security adopted the new Agrarian Sector National Investment Plan, with measures to ensure that communities better benefit from agrarian policies (2019-2023). ActionAid Mozambique&#x2019;s partner ASCUT, who is also an active member of the CCSA, lobbied for this adoption (1). The Netherlands (8): The Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs strengthened review procedures for corporations&#x2019; adherence to human rights standards implemented by private sector instrument implementer (RVO). ActionAid Netherlands in collaboration with MVO Platform advocated for this in the run up to parliamentary debates on trade &amp; trade facilitation (1). The Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs strengthened review procedures for corporations&#x2019; adherence to human rights standards for corporations taking part in Dutch trade missions. ActionAid Netherlands together with MVO platform advocated for this in the run up to parliamentary debates, this resulted in a motion by PvdA and SP which was adopted and then implemented (1). The Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs improved its strategy to reach the &#x2018;90% of large Dutch corporations adhere to OECD guidelines by 2023&#x2019; indicator. The Ministry decided to review its strategy after Members of Parliament brought the issue up in Parliament, as a result of lobby by ActionAid Netherlands and MVO platform (1). Human rights due diligence legislation was adopted by the Dutch senate in order to actively identify, prevent and mitigate the issue of child labor. ActionAid Netherlands together with MVO platform advocated for the passing of this law in the senate (1). One motion to instrumentalize diplomacy to further the binding treaty was (almost unanimously) adopted in Dutch Parliament, after ActionAid Netherlands advocated for this during a parliamentary roundtable. This motion means the Netherlands will have to take an active role in getting other Global North countries to the negotiation table, which will be instrumental in creating broader support for the treaty and will bring us closer to the end result of a UN binding treaty that will prevent human rights abuses and improve access to justice worldwide (1). The land@scale land governance programme document (a policy document directing and fine-tuning policy requirements in practice) uses the VGGTs as overarching framework for good land governance and highlights the relevance of women&#x2019;s land rights, which was based on lobby by ActionAid Netherlands and allies such as Both ENDS and Oxfam Novib (1). After many years of ActionAid Netherlands lobby the Ministry of Foreign Affairs included sanctions for companies that fail to respect the EU conflict mineral regulation and thus do not do their human rights due diligence in the Dutch implementation law of the EU conflict mineral regulation (1). The EU has included safeguards in the new framework to facilitate sustainable development (taxonomy) to request investors to abide by the UNGP&#x2019;s and OECD Guidelines, after ActionAid Netherlands together with Global Witness launched a paper and published an op-ed advocating for this (1). Three Members of Parliament put forward motions and amendments to guarantee Invest-NL investments adhere to OECD guidelines, unfortunately none of them are adopted. ActionAid Netherlands advocated for this in the internet consultation on Invest-NL we took part in and by sharing this with MPs (0).</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">Zimbabwe (1): ActionAid through its partner organisation provided financial support for lawyers on a case they brought to the High Court. The High Court of Zimbabwe&#x2018;s interdict against a mining company&apos;s operations for non-compliance with EIA laws showcases the courts as an effective legal platform for CSOs and communities to seek for redress and for resolution of grievances with governments and companies regarding environmental and human rights impacts. This court case outcome can be used as a precedence in court for other noncompliance of mining companies to EIA laws. Also the regulations of ZEMA (Zimbabwe Environmental Management Agency) have changed as a results of the court case. ZEMA now has to consider the community EIA&#x2019;s reports as part of the EIA process to approve mining companies plans before the can operate. Zambia (1): Government through the District Councils (DC) have adopted the proposal by CSOs, including ActionAid, to strengthen the role of District Environmental Committees by including CSOs and focusing more on supporting ZEMA (Zambia Environmental Management Agency) in enforcement of environmental regulations. The DCs will also act as a bridge between the committee and ZEMA. In their strengthened role the DCs are better placed to hold mining companies to account as they operate more locally and can identify adverse impact of mining activities more quickly. Bangladesh (2) The Government amended the &#x2018;Acquisition and Requisition of Immovable Property Act 2017&#x2019; in September 2017 and the amended law includes improvements with regards to the level of compensation for loss of land (from 150% to 200% in case of public investments and to 300% for private investments); it also broadens the categories of people entitled to compensation and rehabilitation. FGG contributed to the improvement of this law by supporting CSOs and affected communities to raise their voices. AAB supported CSOs that advocated for the law to change and organized training workshops with communities to advocate for changes in laws and policies regarding land rights (1). The high court of Bangladesh passed an order to direct the government not to approve any factory within 10 km of the Sundarbans mangrove area based on a petition by Save the Sundarbans Foundation. In the process preceding this ruling and as part of a wider civil society movement and campaign, various local CSOs addressed the issues around the Sundarbans and advocate for the protection of the area (1). Uganda (1) The continued advocacy and resistance from communities that ActionAid and its partner organisatin deals with has made the government rethink its proposal towards amendment of Article 26 of the Constitution. The amendment has been taken back to Ministry of Lands Housing and Urban Development for redrafting to remove clauses (1). Netherlands (2) The new government framework committed to put forward more binding rules for responsible Business conduct in supply chains if after evaluation it turns out that the current voluntary policies did not bring about the desired result. AANL individually and as a member of MVO platform continued to push for binding regulation within the sphere of corporate accountability. This is likely to have contributed to the government&#x2019;s commitment to consider further measures. (1) The government action plan on responsible coal sourcing include specific actions to address risk in the coal supply chain when sourcing from South Africa, which was not the case for the 2016 plans. The inclusion of SA in the 2017 plans ( BOTH GOV AND UTILITIES) was a result of the continued awareness raising of AA on the human rights violations in South African coal mines as of 2014 by publishing a report in 2014, regular meetings with GOV and utilities. The multistakeholdermission to SA, that was organised by ActionAid, the utilities and the Dutch government, in 2016 was key &#x2013; and led to a understanding of the sector agreement parties to specifically address SA in its action plans.

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">Bangladesh (1): The government will improve the schedule-1 classification (classification of industrial units or projects based on its location and impact on environment) in the Environmental Conservation Rules of Bangladesh to prevent negative environmental and human rights impacts of for example energy projects (which are classified as &#x2018;green&#x2019; in the old classification). This improvement will be the result of ActionAid Bangladesh&#x2019;s lobby with the government on this topic (1). Cambodia (1): The Council for Development of Cambodia will adopt a new investment law that will encourage investors to act responsibly. The law will require corporates not to be only profit-minded, but also to behave responsibly towards society and environment. The adoption of the law will be the result of lobby by ActionAid Cambodia, partner CCHR and other NGOs (1). Kenya (1): The government has embarked on revising the national land policy 2009 after its 10 years&#x2019; timeframe elapsed. ActionAid Kenya will mobilize women, communities and CSOs to engage with this process. We expect that in 2020 a revised national land policy will be adopted. The target is that as a result of our work, this policy will have strong safeguards including components of Free, Prior and Informed Consent (FPIC). As a result of the feminist action report that will be generated by ActionAid Kenya and partners, the number of women in leadership positions in the land sector will increase (1). Netherlands (4): ActionAid Netherlands will continue to lobby the government and highlight the gendered impacts of corporate abuse and put forward mandatory gender due diligence as a solution. As a result, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs will improve at least one corporate accountability policy to address these gendered impacts (1). ActionAid Netherlands will continue to engage in dialogue with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to include the need to adhere to the OECD guidelines within all forms of government support. As a result, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs will improve at least one policy to make this happen (1). ActionAid Netherlands together with MVO platform and partners will continue to advocate for the necessity of binding legislation to identify, prevent and mitigate adverse human rights impacts of corporate activities in supply chains. As a result, we expect the Ministry of Foreign Affairs will introduce a policy letter expanding on the concrete steps towards mandatory human rights legislation (1). The Ministry of Economic Affairs and Climate will include human rights references in relation to mineral supply chains in their policies related to wind energy, as a result of ActionAid Netherlands&#x2019; awareness raising through bilateral meetings, media outreach and public speaking on the need to address risks in renewable energy supply chains in government policies (1). Uganda (1): By 2020, the Ministry of Lands Housing and Urban Development will have passed the Land Acquisition Rehabilitation and Resettlement Policy that is comprehensive and addresses key issues in the land acquisition process such as compensation to Project Affected Persons as well as rehabilitation and resettlement for those who are not able to acquire land elsewhere. This will be the contribution of ActionAid Uganda and its partners through analysis of the draft policy and presentation of policy proposals to the ministry and one on one physical meetings with the drafters of the policy (1). Zambia (2): Partly as a result of ActionAid Zambia and partners&#x2019; policy dialogues and advocacy meetings, the Ministry of Lands will review and finalise the draft land policy. This Policy will consider women&#x2019;s movements on advocacy, access to and control of resources and human rights, and will contribute to more sustainable practices of mining companies (1). The Zambian government will ensure that policies (Environmental Management Policy, Mines and Minerals Development Policy, Resettlement Policy) and laws that address the current challenges facing the communities such as pollution, damaged houses and compensation are harmonized. This will be a result of policy dialogue by ActionAid Zambia and its partners through meetings and submission of position papers (1). Zimbabwe (1): The Zimbabwe Human Rights Commission (ZHRC) will adopt the National Business and Human Rights Action Plan and will use it in their constitutional duties to ensure that mining companies promote more sustainable practices and are held accountable for respecting human rights and the environment, including the provision of remedy to victims of adverse impacts. This will be the result of engagement meetings between the ZHRC, ActionAid Zimbabwe and partner ZELA (1).</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">Cambodia (0): When ActionAid Cambodia&#x2019;s partner published a briefing note, they received a reaction from the rubber company involved, criticizing their lack of detailed information about the case. The fruitful result was: &#x2022; The rubber company and ActionAid Cambodia&#x2019;s partner agreed to create one channel for further communicate in the future. &#x2022; The partner is engaging the company by collecting information from them for the next factsheet development. It is positive progress that we can engage with the company, to increase engagement and cooperation. It is a good start that might lead to a future agreement with the company, so hopefully we will see some outcomes in 2019. NL (0): Due to bilateral meetings, media attention, political attention and speaking at wind industry conferences, ActionAid Netherlands raised awareness about the need for human rights safeguards in mineral supply chains of green technologies, wind turbines in particular. As a consequence, the wind industry organisation and different companies in the wind turbine industry convened to discuss due diligence in their supply chains and the possibility of setting up a sector agreement. However, it is not yet clear whether companies have already improved their policies (0). As a result of input given by ActionAid Netherlands into various sector agreement processes, among other topics women&#x2019;s rights and land rights were discussed during the negotiations. These sector agreement processed have not been concluded, it is therefore not yet clear whether these theme will feature in the final agreement (0). Zimbabwe (0): Due to the low implementation during the election period from around May up to September, the Grievance Redress Mechanism (GRM) meeting failed to take place at its scheduled time. However, the meeting finally took place with a number of stakeholder, including a foreign-owned mining company whose operations residents have been aggrieved with at many instances. As the meeting happened in December 2018, it managed to bring the company to agree 1. Establishing a grievance register and to 2. Appoint a public relations officer to assist in addressing grievances. These will be followed up in 2019 (0).</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">Bangladesh (1): ActionAid Bangladesh and partners, in collaboration with a Japanese NGO, will work with the investor of a power plant in the area of Matarbari on the improvement of the protection policy and its implementation to safeguard the communities affected by the power plant. This policy is inspired by the existing safeguarding policy of the investor. The investor has the authority to enforce the implementation onto the power plant, especially in the Matarbari project sites where ActionAid Bangladesh is working. Cambodia (2): In 2019, one international and one national corporate companies will (partly) integrate FPIC and UNGP principles into their leading policies and display them through their own actions, promoting transparency, social justice and safeguards. ActionAid Cambodia and its partner organisation will guide this development by facilitating meetings between corporates and affected communities, provide information on CSR and human rights policies, and review with corporate agencies relevant documents in relation to land acquisition. The policies will improve the transparency of those companies and their adherence to safeguards, plus by being an examples to others, creating a sectorial warning to other corporate agencies to avoid the risk of violating social and environmental rights (2). Kenya (1): A Sexual harassment policy will be developed by company with the support of ActionAid Kenya, as women casual workers accuse the company employees for asking for sex in exchange for day work. This will result in that the company will put in place a policy to protect women in the mining sector (1). Netherlands (1): &#x2022; By participating in and providing input in various sector agreement negotiations (most importantly the wind energy covenant) and via bilateral meetings, media attention and public speaking, ActionAid will raise awareness on the need to address (gendered) human rights risks in renewable energy supply chains. We will push for ambitious policies to address these risks. As a result, we expect that at least one company in the wind energy sector will improve its human rights due diligence policies in 2019 (1). &#x2022; By participating in the Multi-Stakeholder Dialogue on Land (if continued) ActionAid will continue to influence companies&#x2019; policies regarding land rights, but no specific outcomes are expected in 2019 yet. &#x2022; As part of our women&#x2019;s rights campaign, ActionAid will scope for relevant companies and existing company policies on gender and women&#x2019;s rights. No specific changes are expected in 2019 yet. Zambia (2): &#x2022; Two mining companies will improve their Relocation Policy, partly as a result of ActionAid Zambia&#x2019;s engagement with partners and HRDs in 3 mining communities. As a result of this engagement, HRDs will put pressure on the companies to respect safeguards and promote conflict resolution. This will lead to the changes in policies (1). &#x2022; One mine will improve its compensation policy, partly as a result of ActionAid Zambia&#x2019;s activities together with the Human Rights Commission to provide HRDs with legal support services. The services will foster conflict resolution mechanisms and sustainability, and will put pressure on the mine to change its policy (1). Zimbabwe (2): ActionAid&apos;s partner organisation will facilitate dialogue meetings on sustainable mining and grievance redress mechanisms with mining companies with the aim to have these companies improve their operational policies to incorporate the values of the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. The partner will assist the companies in the development of community-centered policies that promote social justice, conflict resolution and sustainable corporate social investment. As a result, it is expected that at least 2 companies will change their policies in 2019 (2).</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">Cambodia (1): As a result of pressure from CCHR and AA Cambodia, a rubber company started to be more transparent and give more information to local communities about how it chooses to implement its CSR policies. This will allow the community to monitor the rubber company&apos;s work, with ongoing support from CCHR and AA Cambodia. Zambia (1): As a result of lobby by ActionAid Zambia&#x2019;s partner, a mining company has changed its policy on community inclusion. Now, the mine organizes regular engagement meetings to share information and discuss issues with community members (1).</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">Zambia (2): As a result of advocacy work of ActionAid and its partner organisation, corporate social responsibility mechanisms for managing their relations with the communities were put in place by 2 mining companies. They are now engaging the community through consultative meetings. A committee was set between the mining companies and the community to address some of the concerns. One of the positives in terms of corporate responsibility is that the committee had agreed to respond to the needs of the community. The community can now voice concerns and needs, especially women. Uganda (1) In March 2017, a flower company improved its policy on safety and security for its employees following numerous advocacy efforts by partners such as AAU and partner organisations. Netherlands (1) Dutch utilities in their joint action plans (sector agreement which includes commitments per company) showed increased attention for risks in the supply chain when sourcing from SA and includes objectives on more sustainable sourcing from south Africa. They also refer back to this in their policies. The inclusion of SA in the 2017 plans ( BOTH GOV AND UTILITIES) was a result of the continued awareness raising of AA on the human rights violations in South African coal mines as of 2014 by publishing a report in 2014, regular meetings with GOV and utilities. The multistakeholdermission to SA, that was organised by ActionAid, the utilities and the Dutch government, in 2016 was key &#x2013; and led to a understanding of the sector agreement parties to specifically address SA in its action plans.

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">ActionAid and its partners will influence mining corporations in 1 country to adopt communication and sensitization programmes that eradicate cultural norms which inhibit women from actively participating and contributing to the extractive sector, and provide specific provisions on gender equality and equity empowerment in the sector. In 2 instances ActionAid and its partners will influence corporations, most likely in the coal/energy utilities sector and land-based sector, to adopt Due Diligence policies. We will do this by presenting case studies, influencing them in dialogues and other activities.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">Bangladesh (1): JICA (a Japanese investor) will improve its Environmental and Social Safeguard policy as a result of lobby activities by ActionAid Bangladesh and other NGOs (1). Kenya (2): ActionAid Kenya and partner MRF are lobbying a company to put in place an anti-sexual harassment policy. We anticipate this will be put in place (1). ActionAid Kenya and partners MRF, TTHRW, KFA, CHRCE, Ujeri CBO, and IWN will undertake actions (including exchange learning visits) towards expanding linkages and dialogue between corporates, CSOs, and communities. We anticipate through this, companies will adopt good practices learnt from elsewhere, such as community liaison committees and/or corporate social responsibility committees etc. (1). Netherlands (3): As a result of ActionAid Netherlands&#x2019; research (2019) on the implementation of the OECD guidelines and the UNGPs by wind turbine manufacturers, at least 3 out of the 7 companies researched will improve their policies with regards to human rights due diligence to make them in line with the UNGPs and the OECD guidelines (3). ActionAid Netherlands will continue its advocacy in order to change ABP&#x2019;s investment policies, but we expect this will not yet lead to a real policy change in 2020 (0). ActionAid Netherlands will continue its advocacy in order to have Dutch palm oil supply chain policies changed, but we expect this will not yet lead to a real policy change in 2020 (0). Zimbabwe (2): As a result of dialogue meetings on sustainable mining, organized by partner organisation ZELA, with a number of mining companies, at least two of these companies will improve their policies to make them more in line with the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights and to make them more community-centered (2).</narrative>
