       <narrative xml:lang="EN">AA NL (2): - AA NL launched the &#x2018;Mistreated Report&#x2019; in February 2016. The report provides and promotes an alternative process for tax treaty (re)negotiations to make them more fair for developing countries, including the minimum standards tax treaties should comply with. The alternative approach includes: all governments should subject treaty negotiation, ratification and impact assessments to greater public scrutiny; All governments should consider the development implications of their tax treaties; A pro-development approach to the negotiation of tax treaties would treat suggested rates and provisions in the UN model as minimum standards, not upper limits; and multinationals should be transparent about their interactions with developing country lawmakers and officials regarding treaty terms (1).- Together with other members of the Tax Justice Network AA NL developed a detailed vision paper on the status quo regarding tax policy and how it should change. The paper is broad in subjects ranging from tax transparency, tax competition all the way to ending the Dutch status of tax haven.(1) Uganda (1): Due to the capacity building sessions organized by AAU and its partners for members of the Tax Justice Alliance, members were able to analyze the Uganda-Netherlands treaty and provide recommendations to a number of clauses that were thought of as not fair. The ministry has accepted two of the recommendations to inform their own policy analysis. Zambia (1): At the Zambia Alternative Mining Indaba (ZAMI), ActionAid Zambia together with partners, have developed a proposal for an alternative use of mineral revenues. With this proposal they have been advocating for the development of a mineral revenue sharing mechanism that increases the investments of mineral revenue at community level. As a result the Ministry of Mines has requested CSO&#x2019;s to input into the development of a mineral revenue sharing policy.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">NL (2): ActionAid Netherlands developed a 2-pager on gender &amp; tax putting forward an alternative vision for a gender-sensitive tax policy, including mechanisms to do gender analysis ahead of signing tax treaties, adopting the UN treaty model with a gender frame and providing technical tax assistance to women. This was presented during the Building Change conference on SDGs where recommendations were formulated for MPs with an &#x2018;adoption&#x2019; role for the SDGs (1). ActionAid Netherlands put forward a proposal for the installation of a UN Global Tax Body as an alternative for current national tax legislation and bilateral tax treaties. Recommendations have been shared with MPs ahead of relevant parliamentary debates (1). Uganda (2): Two proposals for progressive taxation that were part of the CSO position on tax revenue measures for FY 2018/19 were taken on by the government and adopted into the tax laws. These include: -Value Added Tax (Amendment) Bill 2018: The Insertion of Section 76(3) to allow the cabinet to ratify and the parliament to approve any tax reliefs that are given to a foreign government or international organisation as a result of an international agreement entered with the Government of Uganda. This proposed amendment seeks to empower parliament to approve tax reliefs given by government through International agreements by giving parliament an oversight role from the beginning, i.e. when tax reliefs are first being negotiated. Previously, parliament could only exercise oversight after money had been spent by an entity by reviewing reports of the Auditor General (1). -Insertion of Section 14B to impose an Environmental Levy on imported motorized vehicles five years or older from manufacturing date, ranging from 20% of the CIF value for vehicles principally designed to carry goods to 35% of the CIF value for motorized vehicles between 5 and 8 years old, and 50% for those over 8 years old (1).</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">Netherlands (1): ActionAid Netherlands will launch a company case report that highlights the tax avoidance of a well-known multinational in developing countries via a mailbox company in the Netherlands. The report will also provide recommendations for alternatives to the current tax model that are more beneficial for developing countries. The alternatives focus on fairer Dutch international fiscal policies in particular their tax treaty policies and their policies on source taxation. This alternative will be promoted among CSOs and policymakers (1). ActionAid Netherlands will develop a feminist tax model as part of creating an alternative to the current economy (no count, already included under ToC 1). Uganda (2): The ministry of Finance Planning and Economic Development will receive and incorporate proposals from ActionAid Uganda and other CSOs on the Multilateral instrument (the Multilateral Convention to Implement Tax Treaty Related Measures to Prevent Base Erosion and Profit Shifting) and the analysis of the Uganda Mauritius Treaty study that was conducted by AAIU and its partners. As a result of this, Uganda will bargain with its international trading partners leading to a better deal that will boost its revenue generation. Uganda has begun renegotiation with Netherlands and Mauritius (1). ActionAid Uganda and the Tax Justice Alliance will develop alternative policy proposals to the Tax Bills of 2020/2021, which will come out in March 2020, to make them more progressive and fair to citizens. They will promote these proposals to Ministry of Finance and the Parliament in bilateral meetings (1).</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">Netherlands (4)
(1) ActionAid federation Launched the &#x2018;Who cares for the Future Report&#x2019; throughout the world countries with AA presence, which clearly describes the links between taxation and women&#x2019;s rights including clear alternative policy recommendations and how taxes can be transformed for women. We raised political and media attention on the basis of this and linked it to the underfunded state of healthcare in the global South to combat the Covid-19 crisis.

(1) Together with AA Senegal, AA India, AA South Africa, AA Brazil, AA Jordan and AA Guatemala and several feminist networks, ActionAid Netherlands has written reports about feminist economic alternatives which also contain fair taxes and gender responsive public services as a integral part of achieving a feminist economy based on wellbeing and care.

(1) ActionAid Netherlands, based on experiences with multiple southern ActionAid offices and with input from ActionAid Global Secretariat, launched the &#x2018;Tax in Times of Corona&#x2019; report that details the growing impact of the Netherlands on the global South, how that negatively influences countries&#x2019; ability to combat Covid-19 in the global South, and above all we provided clear recommendations on how alternative extra measures could contribute to a fair a more equal world.

(1) Based on input from southern partners, ActionAid promoted an alternative for tax capacity development activities for governments and CSOs in the global South, at the EU and the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Finance. This alternative is an improvement of the current methods in terms of inclusion, including women and civil society participation, and democracy in these initiatives.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">Uganda (1): Due to continued engagement and making policy proposals to parliament and to the Ministry of finance by AAIU and partners; the Income Tax Amendment for FY 2019/20 provided for a definition of Beneficial ownership. This should limit tax avoidance/ evasion which arises when a 3rd of all parties benefit from Uganda&#x2019;s tax treaties with other countries. Zambia (2): ActionAid Zambia has been part of the CSO alliance that lobbied the Zambian government to quicken the establishment of an inclusive Mining Industry Reform Tax Team. The team will be unique in its kind and will offer alternative, independent advisory services to the government on financial and tax spending. So far, the government is in the process of finalizing the composition of the team (1). ActionAid Zambia and its partner demonstrated to the a local Council how revenue is lost through leakages in the tax system. They also proposed alternatives for revenue collection and spending options to strengthen local resource mobilization for gender-responsive public services. Based on these alternatives, the Council did a mapping and sensitization exercise together with the Zambia Revenue Authority on established mechanisms of taxation and alternative ways of remitting, which is going to significantly increase income and subsequently public service delivery (1).</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">Zambia (2): ActionAid&apos;s partner has developed tools for conducting social auditing to monitor tax and spending policies and practices to be able to hold a mining company and the local council accountable. The tools have been developed with support from ActionAid. The local government showed their support for the social auditing by organising periodic interface meetings in which actionaid&apos;s partner presents their findings. The Zambian Tax Platform of CSOs, facilitated by ActionAid and its partner organisation, has agreed with the district administration to have representation of the local people in the board for approving projects to be funded. The board is also a platform that allows for monitoring of revenue collection and allocation from government and the mining companies including levies from the public. At National level, the Zambian Tax Platform has become an alternative platform for monitoring government policies on taxation. This is a platform of CSOs including Think Tanks from the research institutions. Uganda (2): An analysis of the DTAs that Uganda has signed with different countries titled &#x201C;Analysis of Uganda&#x2019;s Double Taxation Treaties&#x201D; was completed, including recommendations for alternative policies. It went through a peer review on the 24th August 2017 where members of the Tax Justice Alliance made input into the study objectives and reviewed the inception report. A CSO critique of the DTA Framework that was developed by government was also developed for purposes of advocacy in improving the guiding framework for negotiating/renegotiating DTAs (1). ActionAids partner and other CSOs under the Tax Justice Alliance (with support from FGG) developed alternative revenue proposals for FY 2017/18. A paper highlighting alternative revenue measures was developed. The proposals were aimed at contributing to increase and equitable domestic revenue mobilisation.(1) Netherlands (1): ActionAid produced a detailed policy brief that advised members of parliament to vote against the ratification of the tax treaty with Zambia. The policy brief clearly described an alternative approach to tax treaties and what elements are needed to ensure fair redistribution of taxation rights (1)</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">Zambia (1): ActionAid and its partner organisation had been advocating for the establishment of a platform where the local government, the mining company and ActionAid&apos;s partner could be holding interface meetings to discuss and share information on tax. As a result the mining company have set up this platform in 2017 in which information on tax and CSR is being shared and discussed. * Explanation of targets not met: the under-achievement was recorded on this outcome because whilst ActionAid together with the implementing partners did some work around facilitating and advocating for effective legal and other grievance mechanisms, there was a lot of resistance by the mining companies to formalise mechanisms. A number of feedback meetings were initiated with mining companies but these could not be reported as legal mechanisms. On CSR, currently this is not obliged by law and so mining companies still hold on to exclusive power to implement CSR practices. We have started with ZEMA as the key link in this area. So far we have managed to hold meetings with ZEMA, the communities and mining companies and the tripartite approach seems to be working well in terms of strengthening grievance mechanisms. Zimbabwe: * Explanation of targets not met: Zimbabwe Ministry of Mines and the Zimbabwe Revenue Authority are not willing at this moment to adopt provisions of the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative. ActionAid will advocate for use of Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative guiding standards through the auditor general&#x2019;s office. Shadow reports such as the PWYP report will be used to promote accountability and pressure for action to be taken. Currently the auditor general report is only read to parliament and the government is not obligated to take action.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">Netherlands (0): ActionAid Netherlands will call on FMO and potentially other IFIs to protect communities from being worse off after investments, including after the financier pulls out (disengages), and to ensure grievance mechanisms are accessible for a longer period of time. We will also lobby the Dutch government for upholding this in any (semi-)public financing, partly based on the experience of the case of Addax in Sierra Leone. We do not expect results yet in 2019. Zambia (1): Three mining companies will establish grievance handling structures through the engagements of ActionAid Zambia and its partners. ActionAid Zambia and partners will hold dialogue engagements at national and local level for disclosure to the public of all Development Agreements (DAs), emphasize any clauses of the DAs that are still applicable (working with government and mining companies) and lobby for review of clauses that are no longer applicable to the current development context. This will iron out grievance issues pertaining to mistrust and transparency and will lead to communities claiming their environmental and human rights through the established structures (1).</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">Uganda (1)
(1) On 20th February 2020, the Ministry of Finance, Planning and Economic Development (MoFPED) officially launched the Domestic Revenue Mobilisation Strategy FY 2019/20-2023/24. This happened after sustained advocacy and lobby efforts to raise key tax justice related issues by the Tax Justice Alliance Uganda (TJAU) of which AAU is an active member. Part of this new strategy is that it gives a platform to the TJA to develop and present tax proposals to the ministry henceforth. TJAU is now also officially recognized by MoFPED (as an advisory platform). To illustrate this changed reality: In November 2020  the Ministry of Finance, Planning and Economic Development summoned the Tax Justice Alliance Uganda steering committee where ActionAid is part of to present their tax justice proposal FY2020/2021 that had several recommendations to amend laws to make taxation fairer and more progressive, and to support the collection of revenue. These included the Income Tax Amendment Bill 2020/2021, the Value Added Act (Amendment Bill) 2020/2021, and the Tobacco Control Act (Amendment Bill) 2020/21.

Zimbabwe (1)
(1) The Rural District Councils of Mutoko and Mutare, together with partner ZELA (with financial and strategic support from ActionAid Zimbabwe), scaled up the Community Forums on Tax Justice and Delivery that were set up in 2018. Capacity strengthening workshops were organized with the Forums to strengthen their knowledge and skills on revenue mobilization and budget tracking. As a result of their knowledge and advocacy efforts, government councils initiated a structural civil society consultation which provides communities and community groups with access to decision-making and budget consultations.</narrative>

Zambia (2): &#x2022; ActionAid Zambia and its partners will lobby to be included in decision making regarding the use of a large IFI fund for community-development. As a result, an inclusive decision mechanism will be put in place (1). &#x2022; ActionAid Zambia and its partners will lobby to be included in discussions on the introduction and implementation of a revenue sharing mechanism in the mining sector that allocates 10% of taxes paid by mining firms directly to mining host communities. It is expected that the government will put this mechanism in place and will include affected communities in decision making structures in 2019, partly as the result of ActionAid Zambia&#x2019;s lobby activities (1). Zimbabwe (4): ActionAid&apos;s partner organisation and several Rural District Councils will continue working with and strengthening the Community Forums on Tax Justice and Service Delivery that were set up in 2018. These Forums will continue to guarantee access for communities and community groups to participate in decision-making processes related to tax collection and management in the areas of improved service delivery.

ActionAid Uganda and its partner SEATINI have been invited to participate in the work of this committee, representing the Tax Justice Alliance (1). The Tax Justice Alliance has received a new invitation from the Ministry of Finance Planning &amp; Economic Development to provide research and documentation on topical issues to inform the Ministry&#x2019;s intervention in areas such as the impact of Double Taxation avoidance Treaties on our domestic revenue generation and the implication of signing the Multi-Lateral Instruments (1). Zambia (3): ActionAid Zambia and its partner engaged the local government to ensure that communities are involved in the decision-making around the use of the 13 million USD World Bank fund meant to improve basic services for the Mufulira community. As a result, the local government has made information about this project available to the communities, and they are involved in decision-making around income-generating projects that are being set up in the area (1). Partly as the result of ActionAid Zambia&#x2019;s lobby activities, two local Councils have set up committees consisting of CSOs, community members affected by mining, representatives of the local Council and the Zambia Environmental Management Agency to act as an oversight body in the use of the Environmental Rehabilitation Fund, which mines contribute to (1). In one of the project regions, ActionAid Zambia and its partner engaged the local Council to develop mechanisms for publishing what the mine pays to the Council and to enable the community to participate in tracking the utilization of these funds and in the planning for expenditures from these funds. As a result, the local Council now uses these mechanisms for publishing the information, which enables communities to be involved in decision-making around the utilization (1).</narrative>

After successfully training the CBOs, their representatives attended the Rural District Councils budget meetings and meaningfully participated after being capacitated by ZELA. This engagement was possible because the government in a welcome move opened up the budget consultations in the respective provinces before the budgetary statements.

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">Zimbabwe (5): ActionAid&apos;s partner conducted a prep schools for CBOs and communities in four Rural Districts to ensure that they could effectively participate and contribute to the platforms introduced by government Rural District Councils. The CBOs as a result advocated towards the councils to organise budget consultation meetings. This resulted in four Rural District Councils carrying out local budget consultations in 2017 for the 2018 budget. These consultation meetings will now be held annually. The women and men in all 4 regions had an opportunity to input into decision-making on the utilisation of public funds for improved service delivery. ActionAid&apos;s partner initiated a quarterly community interface meeting between communities, the Rural District Council (RDC) and Business actors such as mining companies. This was adopted by the Rural District Council. During the interface meetings the RDC presented the 2017 Budget Expenditures. This enabled communities to identify and communicate in these meetings which mining companies had outstanding mining tax payments to the RDC, such as the granite mining companies. This resulted in the granite mining companies entered into payment plans with the local authority which saw most of them paying up their debts to the Council. As a result, the local authority was able to improve social service delivery in the District for its residents.(1) Zambia (3): As a result of advocacy of ActionAid and its partner, the local council in one of the mining areas has established a committee, including the partner organisation and the church to develop mechanisms that will enhance public monitoring of the council revenue to ensure it is utilised to address the local needs. ActionAid&apos;s partner has been accommodated as one of the key players in providing information on progressive taxation. ActionAid lobbied for an improvement at government level for engagement between CSOs and government on tax. As a result the Zambia Tax Platform (of which ActionAid is a member) became a member of the advisory body to the Ministry of Finance on issues of taxation. The platform is an initiative claimed by the CSOs to provide oversight to the revenue collection process and ensure progressive allocation. ActionAid is a member of the CSO Zambia Tax Platform which engages with IMF and the World Bank to make consolations on development priority areas for investment in Zambia. The platform for CSOs has also been engaging IMF in the process of designing a support package for Zambia amidst a heavy debt situation. Previously IMF and the World Bank organised consultation meetings for both the Zambian government and CSO&#x2019;s in the same meetings. After worries shared by the CSO&#x2019;s that these joint meetings did not provide space for CSOs to talk freely with the presence of the government, IMF and the World Bank started organising the consultation meetings separately. Uganda (1): Following numerous lobby engagements between AAU and partners and the Ugandan Ministry of Finance, Planning &amp; Development, the Ministry has developed a framework for negotiation and renegotiation of Double Taxation Agreements (DTAs), for which AAU along with other CSOs had provided recommendations and discussions regarding actual renegotiation of treaties are underway. The analysis of the DTAs is complete and engagements with the Netherlands embassy were made in December as a way of influencing positive discussions regarding the Uganda-Netherlands treaty. Netherlands (1): FMO has included FPIC as a requirement for clients as part of their land governance position paper and emphasis community consultation. Whilst this was already part of the IFC PS they use, it is still an important signal to investors and communities on the importance of the right to say no. This is partly a result of long term inputs from ActionAid and other FGG members such as Both Ends and Somo.(1)</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">AA NL (8): - AA NL proposed improvements to FMO&#x2019;s sustainability policy (particularly on land, gender and HRDs) through live and online consultation, that were discussed. (1) - AA NL provided policy recommendations (in earlier years and recent Partos Ready for Change report and parliamentary input) for strengthening land criteria in RVO investments (private sector instruments), which were discussed in different meetings and resulted in a commitment from government to safeguard policy coherence with the development goals and SDGs (1). - AA NL discussed public country by country (P-CBCR) regulations (focused on public fiscal transparency) with civil servants of the ministry of finance and foreign affairs (1). - AA NL engaged with FMO and the Ministry of FA on the importance of ensuring also communities affected by investments that they pulled out of have access to justice and liabilities are improved, as this is not covered by the current grievance mechanism of FMO and other development banks. It is not yet sure whether and how they will improve their mechanism (1) - AA NL influenced the tax treaty policy recommendation process between the Netherlands, Malawi, Kenya and Zambia. AA NL had meetings on this with the Greens and the Socialist on tax treaties, including southern partner visits. In addition AA NL worked with the Greens to raise parliamentary questions to the State Secretary of Finance and the Minister of International Trade and Development Cooperation. The questions focussed on the problems related to the impact of developing countries. (1) - Together with Southern partners AA NL discussed the Mistreated report and related policy recommendations on redistribution of Taxation rights with the ministries of Finance and foreign Affairs.(1) -AA NL worked with the socialist party in raising questions on AA&apos;s report on the tax incentive that 3 oil companies have enjoyed in Nigeria including questions on possible involvement of the Dutch government. This builds on the findings and the policy recommendations of the report.(1) - Together with other Tax Justice members, AA NL made policy recommendations to promote a progressive position of the Dutch government for the EU Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive negotiations positions that were discussed with 2 ministries and several political parties (1). Zambia (2): Background info: ActionAid Zambia engaged 10 politicians who were advisors from three (3) major political parties participating in 2016 general elections and did an orientation on taxation and mining. The purpose of the meeting was to orient the political parties on issues of mining and taxation in order for them to consider adopting progressive tax policies in the mining sector once they form government after the General elections. The political parties committed to adopt progressive tax policies in the mining sector once they form government. 1. Furthermore, ActionAid Zambia developed the Elections Asks Brochure which highlighted how political parties can raise sufficient tax revenue by adopting progressive tax policies in the mining sector. This brochure was launched and during the launch, 28 reporters and news editors were present. The brochure was circulated to all the major media houses in order to enhance tax discussions during the election campaigns in the media. The Election Asks Brochure received a lot of media coverage. In addition, ActionAid working together with other organizations jointly hosted the Presidential Debate dubbed &#x201D;Zambia Decides&#x201D;. This debate was attended by six (6) aspiring presidential candidates. 2. Communique that was drafted during the Zambia Alternative Mining Indaba that influenced the enactment of legislation that requires companies to report country by country and disclose ownership information and tax information. Government used this communique in their monitoring project.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">Kenya (1): ActionAid Kenya is a member of the ActionAid Tax Justice Working Group. In this forum, it will promote the concept of Gender Responsive Public Services, which will be discussed by its participants (1). Netherlands (9): The Dutch government (Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Finance, political parties) will discuss ActionAid Netherlands&#x2019; proposals on closing tax loopholes and stopping tax avoidance issues in the mining sector in parliamentary meetings and events, based on ActionAid&#x2019;s Mining Tax Gaps report (3). ActionAid Netherlands will set the agenda of Dutch policymakers on the need for feminist alternatives to tax rules through a report which outlines the role tax rules play in a feminist economy. These alternatives will be discussed by Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Finance and political parties during parliamentary meetings and public events co-organised by ActionAid Netherlands and the Ministry. It is expected that at least three policy makers will discuss ActionAid&#x2019;s proposals for feminist alternatives to tax rules (3). European policymakers will discuss ActionAid Netherlands&#x2019; proposals for more ambitious European environmental taxes in meetings and events. It is expected that at least one policy maker will discuss the proposals (1). European policymakers will discuss ActionAid proposals for more equity, transparency, fairness and efficiency in the EU Direct Resource Mobilisation Programme in meetings and events as a result of research and lobby activities of ActionAid It is expected that at least one policy maker will bring in or discuss the proposals (1). Through the Building Change CSO group, ActionAid Netherlands will continue to set the agenda of policymakers on issues related to tax. Specifically, ActionAid Netherlands will put forward proposals to decrease tax avoidance through the Netherlands, based on its company case report that will be published in 2020 (1). Roving Advisor (1): During a side event of the multi-stakeholder dialogue meeting on corporate investments and tax in Zambia, Zimbabwe and Uganda, organized by the Roving Advisor, actors from governments, corporates and CSOs will come together to discuss improvements of current tax systems for the benefit of local people. The recommendations coming from this meeting will be used by ActionAid to lobby to regional bodies such as Southern African Development Community, Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa, African Union and the United Nations. It is expected that at least one of these bodies will discuss the proposal (1). Uganda (5): In 2016 , the Ministry of Finance Planning and Economic Development drafted a policy on renegotiation of Double Taxation Agreements. This was a big push from ActionAid Uganda and its partners. Although it was vetted and approved by cabinet, it has not yet been shared with CSOs. However CSOs continue to have a transparent and good working relationship with the Ministry, especially the department of trade and investments (0). ActionAid Uganda and its partners will study the tax system and the state finances and will reach out to the media on these issues. It is expected that the topic will be discussed in at least one medium/media channel. Because of this, it will be possible to engage the Ministry of Finance through lobby and advocacy work. This will lead to a better exchange of information with the Ministry and to an engagement in decision-making processes (1). The Tax Justice Alliance, of which AA Uganda is a member, will develop alternative policy proposals to the Tax Bills of 2020/2021, which will come out in March 2020, to make them more progressive and fair to citizens. This proposal will be discussed by the Ministry of Finance, members of Parliament, media and academia (4). Zambia (2): ActionAid Zambia and its partners will conduct public expenditure tracking to advocate for gender responsive public service provision to mining companies in the project areas. As a result of this advocacy, at least one mining company will discuss this issue further (1). ActionAid Zambia and its partners will set the agenda of the government and mining companies on the importance of reviewing existing tax laws, policies and exemptions reductions. For example, ActionAid Zambia will put forward proposals on revising the Double Taxation Agreement with the Netherlands, which will be discussed by the government (1). Zimbabwe (8): During the National Tax Justice Forum, organized by ActionAid Zimbabwe and partner ZELA, mining companies and policymakers from the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Rural Development and the Ministry of Mines will discuss ZELA&#x2019;s recommendations for progressive tax realization and management in the mining sector (4). The government will discuss partner organisation ZELA&#x2019;s arguments on adhering to the recommendations made by the Auditor General, and their proposals on more effective, transparent and accountable use of the resources coming from the mining sector (1). ActionAid Zimbabwe and partner organisation ZELA will facilitate a National Tax Justice Campaign, focusing on the extractives sector. The campaign will target policymakers to improve the collection of tax from mining companies and improve the spending policies for better service delivery. The Parliament of Zimbabwe, the Parliamentary Portfolio Committee on Public Finance and the Parliamentary Portfolio Committee on Mines will discuss the proposals put forward in the campaign (3).</narrative>

(1) During a television show in Malawi, youth groups that were financially and strategically supported by ActionAid Malawi engaged with government officials on the negative effects of Double Taxation Agreements (DTAs) and their proposals for transparency. As a result, the government officials were open about the number of DTAs that are up for negotiation and the status, which is already a great step forward in terms in transparency.

(2) ActionAid Malawi discussed its tax policy analysis and recommendations for progressive taxation with the Ministry of Finance and the Parliamentary Committee on Budget and Finance during several engagement meetings. As a result, the Ministry of Finance, through Parliament, provided an update on measures it is undertaking to transform tax revenue generation. 

Netherlands (9)
(1) The &#x2018;Tax in times of Corona&#x2019; report, which outlines the negative impact of the Netherlands&#x2019; tax behavior and policy on Southern countries,  which was produced by ActionAid Netherlands, (based on experiences with multiple southern ActionAid offices and with input from ActionAid Global Secretariat) was discussed with several political parties (GroenLinks (1), Socialistische Partij, Partij voor de Dieren) and resulted in questions raised by GroenLinks in Dutch Parliament.

(4) ActionAid Netherlands based on experience working with Southern partners contributed to the &#x2018;Tax justice Position paper&#x2019; which dealt with issues such as: Tax treaties, and measures against tax havens, ActionAid Netherlands organized a meeting and discussed this paper one-on-one with the SP(1), D66(1), GL(1),  PVdD(1). They all indicated to discuss this further in a General Meeting (Algemeen Overleg (AO)).

(2) The report on the improving Dutch capacity development initiatives on tax issues, produced by ActionAid Brussels, ActionAid Denmark and ActionAid Netherlands, was discussed in a meeting with the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs (1) and several EU policymakers and the European Commission (1) and ActionAid Netherlands. This report recommends several alternative methods to improve the current methods in terms of inclusion, including women and civil society participation, and democracy in these initiatives.

(1) The European Commission INTPA(1) is supportive of ActionAid EU&#x2019;s views and used their input, based on experiences from our Southern partners, into the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM), which sought to integrate the needs and perspectives of the communities in the global south into the CBAM (as impacts on global south countries were lacking in the EU analysis). This input also resulted in the invitation to a round table meeting with the commissioner in 2021 to discuss the further development of the CBAM.

(1) ActionAid Netherlands provided the Who Cares for the Future report to several policymakers and Ministries and discussed it during a meeting at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (1). The report provides a strong analysis of the weak state of care in Southern Countries and how tax avoidance is part of the underlying problems of the inadequate gender responsive public service provision and dept. We also sent a letter to the Minister of Finance on the need for dept payment pauses and dept cancellation for countries in the global south.

(1) In November 2020  the Tax Justice Alliance Uganda steering committee that ActionAid is part of, presented a tax justice proposal FY2020/2021 to the Ministry of Finance, Planning and Economic Development (1). The proposal had several recommendations pertaining to specific laws that should be amended to help collect revenue. For 2020, the Bills for amendment were;
&#x2022; Income Tax Amendment Bill 2020/21
&#x2022; Excise Duty (Amendment Bill) 2020/21
&#x2022; The Value-Added Act (Amendment Bill) 2020/21
&#x2022; The Tobacco Control (Amendment Bill) 2020/21 

(2) The TJA (including AA) held a press conference calling upon the government ) that had delayed responding to the tax bill proposals tabled by the TJAU to allow the tax justice alliance to defend the tax proposals as laid out in a position paper, to make them more progressive and fair to citizens.  The issues raised by the CSOs  were subsequently discussed in the media  (TV, radio Twitter and Facebook) (1). Subsequently, the Ministry of Finance (1) called a few CSOs from the tax justice alliance to make a presentation of the proposals for the FY2021/2022. The TJA shall follow in 2021 on the agreed actions.

(1) The Tax Justice Alliance published a paper about the negative impact of the Covid 19 pandemic on businesses and especially on Small &amp; Medium Enterprises and on the economy in general  The paper specifically advocated for  rethinking domestic revenue mobilization during the pandemic with a view to providing incentives to SMEs. The president subsequently held a speech in line with the recommendations on SMEs from the TJA (1) and the Uganda Development Bank is currently working with SMEs to provide incentives for them to restart as well as revamp the economy. 

Zambia (7)
(1) ActionAid Zambia conducted trainings on public expenditure tracking for women from mining communities, who then took part in budget planning meetings with local government officials of Mufulira to discuss the importance of transparency in public budgets. This has resulted into the local government of Mufulira to start announcing the allocation given by government under the Constituency development fund, including information on the projects that will be implemented in each ward. 

(5) During a series of radio and television programmes that they organized, ActionAid Zambia together with mining communities discussed their proposals to improve the current tax regime with the Ministry of Mines, the Chamber of Mines, the Zambia Revenue Authority, the Ministry of Finance and the Secretariat of the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative. The impact of the Covid-19 pandemic was an important topic, with all participants agreeing that the mining sector has an important role to play in revenue raising in times of crisis.

(1) During a multi-stakeholder meeting, ActionAid Zambia discussed its recommendations for strengthening compliance of the awarding of mining rights and monitoring mechanisms with the Parliamentary Committee on Mines. The representatives of the Committee were well prepared and had a number of questions for ActionAid that showed they had done their research on the topic. 

Zimbabwe (5)
(1) During Community Tax Justice Forums, the Rural District Council of Mutoko engaged with communities trained by partner ZELA (with financial and strategic support from ActionAid Zimbabwe) on challenges that they face in terms of domestic resource mobilisations. They also discussed the proposals of youths involved in the Forums on the use of public funds. After the meeting with the youths, the Rural District Council approached ZELA to say that it agrees to share its budget performances for annual analysis, and that this will be shared using a public online platform created by ZELA. 

(1) Two youth groups discussed their proposals for fair and adequate taxes for black granite mining companies with their local authorities during several meetings that the youth groups organized. ActionAid Zimbabwe and partner ZELA had strengthened the knowledge and skills of the youth groups on the topic of tax justice. The local authorities were interested in the proposals of the youth and agreed to meet them again to discuss this matter further.

(1) Four Community Forums on Tax Justice discussed their proposals for improved public finance management, improved tax collection policies and improved spending to achieve better and gender-sensitive service delivery with their Rural District Councils during budget consultations. ActionAid Zimbabwe and partner ZELA had strengthened the capacities of the Forums in workshops. The representatives of the Councils agreed on the importance of gender-responsive public services, and committed to keep the Community Forums informed on budget developments. 

(1) Women from two wards in Mutoko discussed their proposals for gender-responsive budgeting with their local authorities during budget consultation meetings. ActionAid Zimbabwe&#x2019;s partner ZELA had strengthened the capacities of the women during workshops on tax justice. During the meeting, the local authorities agreed to keep the women informed on budget developments, so that they can continue to hold the authorities accountable. 

(1) With the leadership of the Mutoko North Development Committee together with paralegals, the Mutoko community discussed its proposal for community-owned black granite mining claims with the Mutoko Rural District Council. The Council approved their proposal and the community applied for the claim. They are now waiting for the decision. The community claim will be used to ensure benefits from the black granite mining are fed back into the community. ActionAid Zimbabwe&#x2019;s partner ZELA strengthened the capacity of the Mutoko North Development Committee on lobby and advocacy, and on tax justice.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">NL (16): As a result of ActionAid Netherlands&#x2019; new report on tax treaties, 1 MP submitted parliamentary questions to the Secretary of State of Finance (1). ActionAid Netherlands engaged with various MPs to discuss the shortcomings and potential fixes of the current tax system that still allows for tax avoidance practices. As a result, 4 MPs (4) posed critical questions to the Secretary of State (1) and our criticism was a huge focus of the debate (5). On two occasions ActionAid Netherlands was able to raise questions via one MP on tax treaties: once regarding Malawi, once regarding Mongolia. The questions were directed to both the Minister of Foreign Affairs and the State Secretary of Finance confronting them with the need for additional actions to improve treaties with developing countries (4; 2 separate questions put on the agenda of 2 Ministers). Thanks to input of ActionAid Netherlands, one MP posed written questions to the State Secretary of Finance on the impact of the Multilateral Instrument on developing countries (2). Partly as a result of continued lobby of ActionAid Netherlands over the years, the Dutch Ministry of Finance as well as Foreign Affairs are becoming more progressive towards tax treaties and developing countries since they consider adoption of progressive UN Model (global tax body) tax treaty clauses and they launched a consultation (1) to get expert opinions. At EU level, ActionAid Netherlands participated in the annual interaction of the EIB with civil society in Luxembourg. AA, Oxfam and ActAlliance EU coordinated a follow-up meeting between the Bank and NGOs active on land rights (June) to go into more depth in our demands. As a result, the EIB commissioned a consultancy firm to map existing standards and best practices on inclusion of land tenure rights in Development Finance Institutions (DFIs) work. The outcome of the work will be to recommend amendments in the EIB Standards. This will be done with a gender lens, as per the EIB new Gender Strategy (1). At EU level, ActionAid Netherlands held a public hearing in the European Parliament in late September, which influenced the draft report of the special committee on financial crimes, tax avoidance and tax evasion and includes references to ActionAid research on the imbalance of taxing rights between developing countries and EU countries in double taxation treaties. Our advocacy with MEPs around the draft report also saw various amendments tabled by the Socialists and the Greens expanding on the development dimension of the report and the role that the EU should play in this, including by calling for the EU and Member States to conduct spillover analyses of their tax policies, and to support progressive taxation in developing countries. We put progressive taxation (with a focus on development) on the agenda of the EU Platform for Tax Good Governance, which is the advisory body to the European Commission in relation to tax, as well as on the agenda of our European allies in Tax Justice Europe (1). ActionAid provided input to MPs on policy coherence and tax. 1 MP put the issue on the agenda during the debate on the annual international trade &amp; development budget. As a result, minister Kaag (ministry of international trade &amp; development) pledged to research how revenues developing countries lose due to tax avoidance facilitated by the Netherlands weigh up against aid they receive (1). Uganda (1): Following their Double Taxation Agreements (DTA) analysis in 2017, SEATINI and ActionAid Uganda were able to share a matrix of issues on the Uganda-Netherlands Double Taxation Treaty with Members of Parliament under the committee on Finance, Planning and Economic Development, Officials from the Tax Policy Department at Ministry of Finance, Planning and Economic Development and Uganda Revenue Authority. Out of the 10 issues pointed out in the matrix, 4 were accepted to be included in the government proposals [Ministry of Finance] for the renegotiation of the Uganda-Netherlands DTA (1). Zambia (4): ActionAid Zambia, together with other stakeholders, engaged with the Ministry of Finance in various platforms, resulting in the enactment of the Planning and Budgeting Bill. If this Bill becomes Law, it will increase transparency and accountability in public finance, and will give mandate to the government to consult communities in budget processes and engage CSOs on quarterly basis for feedback on budget performance. ActionAid Zambia also presented the budget expenditure tracking report for the first quarter budget performance of 2018 to the Parliamentary Budget Committee. As a result of these engagements, the government has assured the CSOs that it is committed to introduce the Planning and Budgeting Bill in Parliament for implementation in 2019 (1). ActionAid Zambia and its partners participated in Alternative Mining Indabas at the national and provincial level, together with the Zambia Revenue Authority, the Ministry of Finance, media and several CSOs. The Alternative Mining Indabas created spaces for alternative proposal engagement with the government. ActionAid Zambia and other CSOs put forward proposals for more transparent, effective and progressive taxation in Zambia, for example to mobilise resources to realise development aspirations and tackle poverty and inequality in the mining communities, and for the government to promote strategies that ensure the interests of the citizens are not compromised. Proposals also emphasized that the government must continue to review tax incentives and treaties. As a result of these engagements, the government discussed several of the proposals, and one proposal to increase the Mineral Royalty Tax was even accepted (1). ActionAid Zambia engaged with the government during the budget consultative meetings and presented a proposal to the Parliamentary Budget Committee to ensure that the government allocates 10 percent of its budget towards agriculture, in line with the Maputo and Malabo Declarations. Quarterly engagements with the Minister of Mines and the Alternative Mining Indabas provided spaces for advocacy around Mineral Revenue Sharing Mechanisms. ActionAid Zambia and other CSOs implored the government to enforce the Mineral Value Chain Monitoring Project of the Zambia Revenue Authority, to ensure that by-products are well accounted for. Also, there should be disclosures of mining contracts by government to the communities where mines are located, and communities should be included in budget tracking of local authorities. As a result of these engagements, the Government agreed to consider Mineral Revenue Sharing to be a law. Also, the Ministry of Mines agreed to consider making it mandatory to disclose all mining contracts between government and mining companies (2). Zimbabwe (6): Partner organisation ZELA held a National Caucus Meeting with the 1. Zimbabwe Miners Federation (ZMF), 2. A publicly owned printing and refining company, and 3. National Indigenisation, Economic and Empowerment Board (NIEEB). After the meeting, the ZMF together with ZELA decided to upscale their push for regularisation of Artisanal and Small-scale Mining (ASM), after realising that ASM was making more returns than the big corporates especially in the gold sector. Further, the company was tasked with pushing for policies that ensure proper gold taxes were in place as they had a cordial working relationship with the Minerals Marketing Corporation of Zimbabwe (3). Partner organisation ZELA representative, as the chair of the CSOs coalition, in his opening speech advocated that the Kimberly process (a multilateral trade regime established in 2003 with the goal of preventing the flow of conflict diamonds) should not be a secretive process but rather an open and transparent one. Adding on to that ZELA suggested that the Zimbabwean government should join the Extractives Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) to advance transparency in the overall mineral resources sector. In his budgetary statement, the Minister of Finance suggested and quoted ZELA&#x2019;s recommendation of joining the EITI so as to attract investments in the extractives sector and to adopt international best practices (1). Partner organisation ZELA challenged the office of the Auditor General (AG) on their report on a government-owned mining company, stating that the report lacked in transparency as it did not include proper financial audits and no ethical audits on the sourcing of the diamonds. As a result, the office of the AG invited ZELA to further discuss these recommendations (1). Following ZELA&#x2019;s meeting with the Parliament and the Finance Ministry on the recommendations of the Auditor General, a government-owned mining company agreed to come to the negotiating table on how they could improve on transparency (1).</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">Netherlands (8): &#x2022; Representatives of the Ministries of Finance and Foreign Affairs as well as politicians will discuss options for fairer tax treaties with at least three African countries as a result of ActionAid Netherlands&apos; engagement with them (3). &#x2022; Following discussions of ActionAid Netherlands with politicians and the Ministries of Finance and Foreign Affairs, at least one of these actors will further discuss the creation of a Global Tax Body (1). &#x2022; Dutch Ministries and politicians will increasingly pay attention to the disproportionate impact of tax avoidance on women&#x2019;s rights as a result of ActionAid&#x2019;s awareness raising activities. At least one of these actors will discuss the topic further (1). &#x2022; ActionAid Netherlands will co-develop and share suggestions on land rights, gender and human rights due diligence, as well as on access to justice/grievance mechanisms, for IFIs. For land we will build on the ActionAid FPIC briefing and VGGT scorecard work and where possible we will work with other CSOs (especially FGG members) to share proposals with Dutch parliament, government and agencies and institutions. As a result, we expect that at least one of these proposals will be discussed by at least one of the actors mentioned above (1). &#x2022; ActionAid Netherlands will share 2 proposals on financial and economic policies and their gender and women&#x2019;s rights impacts in the context of labour, decent work and public services (including unpaid carework) with the Dutch government and international financial institutions, as well as media and other movements. We expect that both proposals will be discussed by at least one of the actors mentioned above (2). Uganda (3): ActionAid Uganda, together with several other CSOs, will put forward proposals for alternative tax policies. These proposals will be discussed by at least two government bodies and academia (3). Zambia (3): &#x2022; The Zambian government will pay increasing attention to the improvement of financial, tax and spending policies, as a result of the lobby and advocacy activities of ActionAid Zambia and partners, together with other CSOs and relevant stakeholders (1). &#x2022; ActionAid Zambia and its partners will conduct public expenditure tracking to advocate for gender-responsive public service provision to mining companies in the project areas. As a result of this advocacy, at least one mining company will discuss this issue further (1). &#x2022; The Zambian government will increasingly pay attention to fair and gender-just public expenditure as a result of the lobby and advocacy activities of ActionAid Zambia, its partners and several other organisations (1). Zimbabwe (3): &#x2022; In 2019, ActionAid&apos;s partner organisation will organise the national Tax Justice Forum with the theme of progressive tax realisation and management in the mining sector. The partner will develop a concept note with their recommendations on this topic, which will be discussed during the Forum. Participants to the Forum will include state-owned mining enterprises and policy-makers from the Ministries of Rural Development, Finance and Mines. It is expected that at least the Ministries of Finance and Mines will further discuss the proposal (2). &#x2022; The Government will discuss ActionAid&apos;s partner organisation&apos;s proposal for more effective use of the resources coming from the mining sector (1).</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Netherlands (41): During a roundtable, representatives of the Dutch Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs discussed ActionAid Netherlands&#x2019; (commissioned by Southern offices) report on the impact of tax treaties on developing countries, and recommendations focused on establishing a better distribution of taxation rights with developing countries (2). Two Members of Parliament (Green party and Socialist party) discussed ActionAid Netherlands&#x2019; proposals for mitigating the impact of tax treaties (focused on equitable taxation rights to developing countries and measures to limit the untaxed onflow of momey via the Netherlands) during a workshop at the Africa Day, organized by ActionAid (2). Three Members of Parliament (Green Party, Socialist Party and Labour party) discussed the proposals (to make the conditional withholding tax for financial transactions to tax havens stricter by imposing stricter criteria to determine which countries are a tax haven) of the Tax Justice Network, which ActionAid Netherlands is part of, to influence the 2020 fiscal plan as a result of lobby engagements (3). Newspaper Trouw published the opinion article of Building Change to influence the withholding tax for financial transactions with tax havens. The article pointed at the weak criteria for the determination of a tax haven. ActionAid Netherlands has contributed to the article by providing specific recommendations (1). The Dutch Labour Party put forward a motion initiated by ActionAid Netherlands in Parliament on the need to monitor the effectiveness of anti-abuse clauses in tax treaties. The introduction of such measures has been one of the most important steps of the Dutch government to make treaties with developing countries fairer. But the effectiveness which is strongly dependent on capacity dedicated to its implementation is highly uncertain. Unfortunately the motion was not adopted, but it gained support from three parties (3). The media (online opinion platform Joop!) published ActionAid Netherlands&#x2019; opinion article on the shortcomings of the government&#x2019;s new measures to end tax avoidance. The measures will only affect a part of tax avoidance via the Netherlands. Many companies as a result will still be able to avoid tax in developing countries via the Netherlands (1). The Reformed party used the Building Change Alliance tax input which was written by ActionAid Netherlands for the International Trade and Development Commission annual budget discussion. The input focused on promoting measures that can improve the fiscal policy coherence with development (1). During a bilateral meeting, representatives from the Danish Permanent Representation to the EU discussed ActionAid NL and EU&#x2019;s proposals for country-by-country reporting. Such transparency which is discussed in the EU can, if adopted, improve tax collection in developing countries tremendously (1). European commission reviewed ActionAid NL and EU&#x2019;s written submission to the European Commission&#x2019;s consultation to the evaluation of the EU Directive on Administrative Cooperation on tax (1). European Commission members actively acknowledged the message from ActionAid NL and EU&#x2019;s press release calling for the need for Public Country by country reporting rather than the focus on tax transparency solely between governments as was included in the European Parliament&#x2019;s report on Tax Evasion and Tax Avoidance (1). At the EU Platform for Tax Good Governance of the European Taxus Commission, ActionAid NL and EU&#x2019;s proposals for the EU (about for example improvements in mandatory fiscal transparency and measures to avoid the ongoing tax competition between countries) were actively discussed by representatives of the EU member states (1). Members of the European Parliament discussed and supported ActionAid Brussels&#x2019; (financially supported by ActionAid Netherlands) amendments on tax and developing countries in their parliamentary report (1). The European Commission (DEVCO and TAXUD) discussed findings from the ActionAid recommendations on spillover analysis in a meeting with ActionAid (2). The Tax Justice pledge for candidates to the European Parliament on tax justice and transparency, coordinated by Tax Justice Europe and supported by ActionAid, was signed by a large number of candidates (1). During a high-level meeting on the future of EU tax policy, DG TAXUD discussed ActionAid&#x2019;s proposals for improved tax policies (1). ActionAid&#x2019;s position on tax transparency was highlighted by the media, in an interview on the Accountancy Europe website (1). ActionAid co-organized a debate at the European Development Days with a representative from ActionAid Bangladesh as a speaker. During the event, they discussed their proposals for progressive taxation with the EU Commission members (2). During bilateral meetings with new European Members of Parliament, ActionAid discussed the Tax Justice pledge (which ActionAid contributed to) and its proposals for tax justice and tax transparency (5). Members of the permanent representations of Finland, Denmark, Poland, Sweden, Croatia, Lithuania, Portugal and Germany discussed their country positions regarding Tax Transparency (Public Country by Country Reporting) and ActionAid&#x2019;s proposals for increased transparency during bilateral meetings (8). Participants of the Addis Tax Initiative &#x2013; Tax and Development Conference discussed ActionAid&#x2019;s &#x2018;EU support for Domestic Resource Mobilization&#x2019; briefing document (1). The United Nations viewed ActionAid&#x2019;s joint written NGO submission on the UN Working Group on Business &amp; Human Rights&#x2019; consultation as input for a report to the UN General Assembly on policy coherence (1). Experts discussed ActionAid&#x2019;s position on progressive taxation as presented by ActionAid at the expert workshop on tax and development that was hosted by academic project Global Tax Governance (1). Uganda (5): Through the analysis of the Multilateral Instrument, ActionAid Uganda and partners set the agenda for discussion of the renegotiation between Uganda &amp; Netherlands as the Uganda government commended the work of CSOs and committed through a meeting with the Tax Justice Alliance not to sign onto the MLI (1). Members of the Tax Justice Alliance, among others AAIU, spearheaded the development of a policy dialogue concerning the Uganda-Netherlands DTA and presented them to the Netherlands negotiating team as well as to the Ministry of Finance Planning and Economic Development (2). The Ugandan Parliamentary Standing Committee on Trade &amp; Investment has discussed the annual inputs received from the Tax Justice Alliance (which the project helped to form and facilitate) to the Financial Tax proposals. AAIU is a member of the alliance (1). ActionAid Uganda and partners, after finding harmful clauses in their policy analyses, have pushed their national government to renegotiate the Double Taxation Agreement between Uganda and the Mauritius (1). Zambia (10): The Government of Zambia and the Parliamentary Committee on Planning and Budgeting are engaging stakeholders to come up with recommendations for optimal tax rates as proposed by CSOs, including ActionAid Zambia, through the Zambia Tax Platform. This process started after the CSOs had shown that the government loses huge sums through tax because of failing to optimize the tax rates (1). As a result of training by ActionAid Zambia in budget tracking and social audits, three communities have undertaken budget tracking in health, education, water and sanitation to evaluate the extent to which the local government is prudently utilizing public finances. Based on the tracking exercises, the communities developed community reports with concrete recommendations for improvements in these areas, that they discussed with local government representatives during interface meetings (1). ActionAid Zambia and its partner demonstrated to a local Council how revenue is lost through leakages in the tax system, and put forward proposed alternatives for revenue collection and spending options to strengthen local resource mobilization for gender-responsive public services. As a result, the Council did a mapping and sensitization exercise together with the Zambia Revenue Authority on established mechanisms of taxation and alternative ways of remitting, which is going to significantly increase income and public service delivery (1). During the three Zambia Alternative Mining Indaba meetings in Lusaka and the Copperbelt and North Western provinces, ActionAid Zambia discussed its proposals for reviewing the Mineral Royalty Tax and for a more transparent, effective and progressive taxation system with government representatives (1). During quarterly engagement meetings, ActionAid Zambia discussed its proposal to reinstate the Mineral Revenue Sharing Mechanism Clause, which was part of the previous Mines and Minerals Act of 2008, with the Minister of Mines. The mechanism is a means to ensure that local communities that host mining companies benefit from the mining activities (1). During quarterly engagement meetings and during the Zambia Alternative Mining Indaba, ActionAid Zambia and other civil society actors discussed their proposal to adopt the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative as a law and to identify weaknesses in current legislation, with the Ministry of Mines. Through these measures, the government would be forced to improve the natural resource governance in the country (1). During quarterly engagement meetings and during the Zambia Alternative Mining Indaba, ActionAid Zambia and other civil society actors discussed their proposal to enforce the Mineral Value Chain Monitoring Project of the Zambia Revenue Authority, with the Ministry of Mines. Through this project, it will be possible to monitor the mining and mineral value chain from extraction to exportation, and to have a complete overview of revenues (1). During quarterly engagement meetings and during the Zambia Alternative Mining Indaba, ActionAid Zambia and other civil society actors discussed their proposal for disclosure of mining contracts by government to the communities in which extraction activities are taking place, with the Ministry of Mines (1). ActionAid Zambia has submitted proposals on taxation and Double Taxation Agreements (DTAs) to the Parliamentary Committee, to advocate for strengthened DTAs to prevent leakages in taxes. The Parliamentary Committee has taken these proposals along in their current consideration for reviewing some of the DTAs, including the one with the Netherlands (1). During quarterly engagement meetings and during the Zambia Alternative Mining Indaba, ActionAid Zambia and its three partner organisations discussed their proposal on the need for disclosure of beneficial ownership, with the Ministry of Mines. Not disclosing beneficial ownership can facilitate illicit financial flows (1). Zimbabwe (6): ActionAid Zimbabwe, together with two partners, organized a Youth-Led Tax Justice Symposium in Mutoko. During the symposium, ActionAid and its partners discussed their proposals for better capacity strengthening for youth on tax justice issues with local government representatives (1). The media picked up ActionAid Zimbabwe and partners&#x2019; proposals on better inclusion of youth in tax justice issues, after a national radio station broadcasted discussions from the Youth-Led Tax Justice Campaign, that was organized by ActionAid (1). During a high-level breakfast meeting that they organized, ActionAid Zimbabwe&#x2019;s partner ZELA discussed its proposals for fairer taxation in the mining sector with officials from the Ministry of Mines and Mining Development, Parliament, civil society and media (4).</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">Zimbabwe (6): The report by the Office of the Auditor General on State owned enterprises highlights adverse reports of a mining company based on failure on providing timely reports, failure to provide share certificates of the diamond mining joint ventures and general poor governance of revenues collected by government institutions. ActionAid&apos;s partner developed its own report on the gaps of the Auditor General&#x2019;s report to provide recommendations to ensure that the revenues realised in these entities are used for sustainable development. These reports were discussed at a meeting held at the Office of the Auditor General on State which was attended by ActionAid&apos;s partner and other CSO&#x2019;s. (1) ActionAid&apos;s research on budget tracking, looking at local and central budgets, identified gaps in the 2018 Budget for the ASM sector and proposed to the Ministry on Land and Mministry of Mines and Minerals Development to revisit the following areas: unclear legislative support for Artisanal Small-Scale Mining (ASM), recessive incentives for larg-escale mining (LSM), review of Indigenisation quota and Minerals revenue transparency. The report was discussed by Publish What You Pay members and presented to two government institutions. (3) ActionAid&apos;s partner&apos;s research publication on public financing within the mining sector was disseminated to Parliament and government. In the publication the organisation recommended direct funding of the community share ownership trust from mining levies to ensure communities affected by mining directly benefit from the mining companies working in their areas. This recommendation was made to and discussed by the ministry of finance and ministry of mines and mining development. The recommendations will be measured or assessed against the 2017 National Budget Statement by the Ministry of Finance. (2) Zambia (3): ActionAid participated in the advocacy for sound mechanisms to ensure effective transfers of mining royalty payments to local governments. A proposal was made to government to consider coming up with a formal distribution of revenues to local governments such as the Environmental Protection Fund. This was presented at the Parliamentary Committee who wrote a report to the Ministry of Mines based on the proposal. ActionAid is also part of the movement led by another CSO. This is a National Social Movement which has created a platform for engagement with duty bearers. This movement developed proposals to improve transparency and accountability in government procurements and prioritization of investments. The proposals have been discussed in a public debate by government. ActionAid&apos;s proposals for improved Tax policies was discussed by the Parliamentary Committee. ActionAid was requested by the Parliamentary Committee on Legal Affairs, Governance, Human Rights, Gender Matters and Child Affairs to train Parliamentarians on the Implications of Double Taxation Agreements (DTA&#x2019;s) or Tax Treaties on the progressive realization of Human rights. This training was held on 3rd and 4th May 2017. The training focused on highlighting the weaknesses in some of Zambia&#x2019;s tax treaties such as the lower withholding taxes on dividends and interest payments and how this leads to loss of tax revenue that could fund public services such as education, water and health. Further, specific example was given pertaining to revenue loss as a result of the old tax treaty between Zambia and Ireland. Uganda (2) ActionAid&apos;s partner and other CSOs under the Tax Justice Alliance developed alternative revenue proposals for FY 2017/18. A paper highlighting alternative revenue measures was developed. The proposals were aimed at contributing to increase and equitable domestic revenue mobilisation. One proposal was adopted by Parliament in the tax bills for 2017/18 (1) CSOs including AA developed CSO recommendations for the DTA framework, which were subsequently discussed at various levels including by public policy makers (including the ministry of Finance, Planning and economic development, Uganda revenue authority, members of parliament) and in the media (newspapers and radio); part of the recommendations were incorporated in a revised framework by the government (1). Netherlands (5): FMO has discussed the AA (and other CSO) recommendations on integrating land rights, VGGT, FPIC, gender and human rights more strongly into their policies and practice in meetings and in written feedback. They also discussed the request of AA to be careful on shrinking space and scrutinize the context ahead of making and disclosing new investments, including in the Uganda case (1). FMO has discussed the proposals of ActionAid, its partner organisation and others on addressing the concerns of communities in Sierra Leone around the (former) addax investment, as well as the fact that formally a grievance is difficult due to time limits. Th feedback so far is limited, but the issue of responsible exit is on the agenda and FMO has asked ActionAid&apos;s partner to provide further proposals on actions for them to support.

(1) - AA NL worked with AA Malawi and AA Zambia and AAI in challenging the ratification through meetings, a policy brief, and parliamentarian questions) of unfair tax treaties between the Netherlands Malawi, Zambia and Kenya. Through knowledge exchange and simultaneous lobby in north and south AA NL has improved capacity to work on this.(0 because not a LLMIC) - AA NL developed the Mistreated report, an analysis of 500 international tax treaties of low and lower-middle income countries signed from 1970 until 2014. It analyses the negative impacts of tax treaties and presented clear guidance on how to improve them to make them more fair for developing countries. This information on tax treaty impacts, treaty trends, and recommendations for improvements has been instrumental in raising the capacity of developing countries work to lobby and advocate on the technical topic of tax treaties. The report is used by many AA offices, including AA NL (1). - AA NL supported AA Haiti in formulating strategies and linking up to InterAmerican Development Bank regarding alleged land rights issues of the development of an industrial park, resulting in enhanced capacity of AA Haiti and its partner organization to access grievance mechanisms of the IADB.

With the technical, financial and logistical support of the project, the members of the Tax Justice Alliance have conducted a series of joint activities including developing and presenting the CSO position on the tax bills for FY2019/20 to parliament, and widespread media engagement (16). Zambia (4): ActionAid Zambia strengthened the knowledge and lobby skills of three partners in gender-response public services and how it relates to progressive taxation through several trainings. As a result, the partners have been undertaking processes such as public expenditure tracking and the results are used for engagement with duty bearers through interface meetings (3). ActionAid Zambia and its three partners trained communities in mineral revenue tracking, with a focus on women and youth. As a result, the communities conducted a practical mineral revenue tracking on the local government budget. They found out that the money from the mining companies is going directly to the central government at the expense of local authorities where the communities affected by mining live. The communities developed resolutions and lobbied to the local government to fix this (1). Zimbabwe (3): As a result of guidance, technical and financial support of ActionAid Zimbabwe, the Mutoko Youth Initiatives for Community Development and the Mutoko North Development Trust engaged their local authorities on the unfair practices happening in the black granite mining sector, and advocated for fair and adequate taxes for mining companies to contribute to community development (2). Women from the Mutoko community have advocated for participation of women in the local council budget consultations.

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">Zimbabwe (6): ActionAid brought together the Publish What You Pay Zimbabwe Chapter members and six local CBOs. The capacity of the CBOs were strengthened by the PWYP network on how to do research on financial tax and spending policies. The CBOs and the PWYP network jointly conducted organisation led research on the &#x2019;Zimbabwe 2018 National Budget and its implication on mining&#x2019;. This increased the research skills of the CBOs and increased the capacity of the PWYP members as the research results improve their capacity to lobby and advocate with result-based evidence. This resulted in four CBOs advocating for localized company taxation policies that will increases the local councils budget to improve service delivery as well as advocating for publication of revenue collected from mining companies. (4) ActionAid and its partner organisation organized trainings for the Women Forums in three districts on tax justice and gender sensitive service delivery. The training was aimed at promoting education on women&#x2019;s participation and demanding government&#x2019;s accountability in the management of public funds for improved provision of gender sensitive service delivery as well as establishing grassroots tax justice campaigns. One young woman from the forum was supported to participate at the SADC People&#x2019;s Summit where she shared about the advocacy work of their women&#x2019;s forums anchored at data extraction on mining revenues by the diamond mining companies (1). Further, members of the Women&#x2019;s Forums attended the national budget consultation meeting. The women seized the opportunity to influence decision-making of public funds towards improved service delivery. A key recommendation made by the women was the need to ensure equitable distribution of revenue between the national government and local government. (1) Zambia (6): ActionAid facilitated a training of 20 HRDs in three communities on Business and Human Rights, Paralegal training, protection mechanisms for HRDs. This resulted in the HRDs to engage the Ministry of mines and the local government on the Revenue Sharing Mechanism where a proposal has been pushed to allow for retention of 15% by the local community to be used for local development projects as part of progressive utilisation of resources. This is also in line with our approach to promote the Gender Responsive Public Services and this is what we are promoting in the utilisation of revenue. ActionAid organised trainings for three partner organisations on investment policies and the government budget. This resulted in ActionAid together with its partners engaging with the Parliamentary Expanded Committee on Estimates. At this platform ActionAid has been advocating for revised incentives for MNCs which were retrogressive and not giving maximum benefits to the government and local people. Proposals were made and policy papers developed to advocate for revised incentives. In the 2018 budget, the Minister of Finance in his Budget speech echoed the same sentiments and responded positively by reviewing some investment policies to ensure maximization of tax collection especially from mining companies. Uganda (2): In the effort to enhance citizen and stakeholder&#x2019;s capacity to demand for fair and inclusive fiscal policies and laws and practices through media engagement, ActionAid and its partner in collaboration with African Centre for Media Excellence (ACME) organized a three day training workshop for journalists from various media houses titled &#x201C;Strengthening Media Oversight and Reporting on tax Policies and practices&#x201D; from 3rd to 5th October 2017. As a result of the training, there is more interest among journalists in reporting and investigating on issues of trade and taxation. This is seen through the expression of interest and information requests that they file to ActionAid&apos;s partner organisations (1). The Tax Justice Alliance meets regularly to discuss emerging taxation issues in the country including Bills that affect revenue collection. The network is also in the process of developing its own governance documents to enable it become institutionally strong as it continues to conduct its advocacy work (1). Netherlands (3) - ActionAid Netherlands has continued to support partners working on Addax case in Sierra Leone by facilitating dialogue and network, as well as share knowledge and suggestions for strategies on resolving the case and opportunities for grievance. This has allowed for the CSOs to engage directly and strengthen their advocacy efforts on the ground and internationally. (1) - ActionAid Netherlands and ActionAid Uganda started to work on the to be renegotiated tax treaty, Uganda has produced a detailed policy brief building our knowledge in the NL to engage on the topic (1). -AA coorganised and cofinanced an international meeting of Eurodad with other Dutch Eurodad Members ( Both End, SOMO and Oxfam) and Eurodad that has helped to build the knowledge of many NGO&#x2019;s on a wide range of development orient financial issues among which on Tax Justice. Government representatives also attended this meeting which made it possible for the CSO&apos;s to advocate towards them about the above issues (1)</narrative>

However, the ministry is willing to include the Tax Justice Alliance on the Domestic Revenue Mobilisation committee. This is expected to improve the transparency of tax policy processes (0). Zambia (1): ActionAid Zambia&#x2019;s partners engaged with the local authorities of the project areas to make the resources that are collected from mining companies and the expenditures public. The partners argued that policies at local level must be reviewed to increase transparency, by compelling mining companies to publish what they are paying to the national government and what they are paying to local authorities. As a result of the engagement, local authorities are sharing their plans, budgets, revenue generated and all the expenses during District Development Coordination Committee meetings with the partners, who are also present there (1). Zimbabwe (1): After the meeting convened by partner organisation ZELA on the analysis of the Auditor General report, the Parliamentary Portfolio Committee (PPC) on Mines and the PPC on Finance requested a further meeting for capacitation on tracking public finance, especially funds being produced by state owned enterprises. ZELA convened another meeting, and as a result the 2 PPCs agreed to structurally monitor and track public finance from their respective portfolios, starting from that point (1).</narrative>

Via face to face meetings and policy inputs in cooperation in the Tax Justice Network Netherlands, AA NL promoted measures that are effective for developing countries. The directive entails some improvements for tackling tax avoidance. However promising improvements for developing countries such as strong Controlled Foreign Companies rules (aimed against parking profits in tax havens) were not adopted(1). - AA NL has contributed to the Dutch parliament adopting a motion on the &quot;most fair law&quot; (eerlijkste wet), that encourages the government to policy coherence for Development framework (1). Zambia (2): In cooperation with other CSOs, AAZambia (AAZ) held a series of meetings with the ministry. AAZ made multiple proposals for progressive tax measures that government could adopt for the 2017 budget and the economic recovery Programme. -The first proposal was to enhance compliance in the administration of the Value Added Tax (VAT) by monitoring business transactions of VAT registered suppliers. As a result, government has made it mandatory for all VAT registered suppliers to use Electronic Fiscal Devices which will enable real time monitoring of business transactions. This will enhance transparency (1). -To address tax dodging AAZ made a second proposal to build linkages between taxation and banking. This would ease enforcement and compliance for both the revenue authority and taxpayers. As a result, the government has made it mandatory that all financial institutions require bank account holders to obtain a Taxpayer Identification Number and make revenue collection processes automated (1).</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">NL (2): Partly as a result of lobby of ActionAid Netherlands and other NGOs, the government cancelled the abolishment of the dividend tax (1). After years of lobbying and campaigning, the Ministry of Finance&#x2019;s new policy framework finally contained various proposals against tax avoidance (for instance with regards to taxes on profits), aimed to limit profit shifting via the Netherlands (1). Uganda (1): Coordinated by SEATINI and facilitated by ActionAid Uganda through advocacy and campaigns support, members of the Tax Justice Alliance held a campaign against the newly introduced 1% taxes on Mobile Money and Over the Top services, whereby a series of media engagements and meetings with policy makers were held. These were backed by the public outcry against the two taxes. As a result, the government took a step to adjust the taxes on mobile money to 0.5% and impose it only on withdrawals (1). Zambia (2): ActionAid Zambia is part of the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) multi-sectoral group, which consists of 6 government representatives, 6 company representatives and 6 CSO representatives. As part of the multi-sectoral group, ActionAid Zambia reviewed the EITI report and made recommendations. One of the recommendations that the CSOs were pushing for was to turn Mineral Beneficiation Ownership into a law. As a result of the recommendations made by the CSOs, the government made the Mineral Beneficiation Ownership into a law (1). ActionAid Zambia and its partners participated in budget consultative meetings and attended the quarterly meetings with the Ministry of Mines, where they proposed the Mineral Royalty Tax to increase to 10 percent. This proposal was also put forward during the Zambia Alternative Mining Indaba, where ActionAid Zambia also emphasized that the government needs to ensure that the collected Mineral Royalty tax benefits the local communities. As a result of the engagements, the Government decided to increase the Mineral Royalty Tax rate with 1.5 percentage points at all levels, and introduced 10 percent Mineral Royalty tax when copper prices are above US$ 7,500 per metric tonne, starting from 1 January 2019 (1).</narrative>

(1) The Dutch government has adopted a new Tax Treaty policy (Notitie Fiscaal Verdragsbeleid 2020) that contains UN model treaty clauses which are improvements for countries in the global South, a process ActionAid has influenced (based on experience with southern ActionAid offices on joint tax treaty analysis) and the government has also presented extra guidance to questions in Parliament that ActionAid helped initiating.

(1) The new conditional withholding tax to deter profit shifting from and via the Netherlands to tax havens is now in effect, deterring profit shifting to a number or preselected tax havens. This is a result of various lobby efforts done by ActionAid Netherlands, based on input from our Southern partners.

Zambia (1)
(1) The Government of Zambia decided to relook at its tax treaty with Mauritius, the latest African nation to cancel an agreement with one of the world&#x2019;s leading offshore havens. President Edgar Chagwa Lungu&#x2019;s cabinet in May terminated the 2012 treaty and will soon start to negotiate a new deal. The cabinet highlighted the southern African country&#x2019;s inability under the current treaty to tax payments from certain operations that happen in Zambia but that are paid to companies in Mauritius. This followed engagement by ActionAid Zambia and other CSOs on the need for government to revisit tax treaties to ensure they are mutually beneficial and are adapted to the changing context.</narrative>

One proposal was adopted by Parliament in the tax bills for 2017/18 namely: To impose excise duty on imported furniture other than local furniture and specialized hospital furniture was taken on and included in the Tax Bills for FY 2017/18. Due to advocacy and numerous engagements with the Ministry of Finance, Planning and Economic Development, a framework for renegotiation and negotiation of old and new treaties was developed and adopted by cabinet.
