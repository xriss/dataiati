   </name>
   <description>
    <narrative xml:lang="EN">The official name of Macedonia was changed to North Macedonia in February 2019. A decade ago, North Macedonia was on a steady path toward North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and European Union membership, as its democratic institutions developed and its economy improved. North Macedonia was seen as the next Balkan success story. However, North Macedonia&apos;s progress toward Euro-Atlantic integration has stagnated in recent years as the ruling political party has increasingly used its governing position to consolidate its hold on political and economic power. In 2015, North Macedonia became embroiled in a political scandal that resulted from the public release of recorded phone conversations involving government officials, including the Prime Minister, allegedly engaged in corrupt activities, raising serious concerns about the current government&apos;s commitment to democratic ideals. Combined with fragile ethnic relations and a migration crisis that it is ill-equipped to handle, North Macedonia faces significant challenges in the coming years. The situation is further complicated by growing influence from Russia, which has attempted to undermine North Macedonia&apos;s ties with the West. U.S.-assistance will remain focused on democracy and governance, particularly on supporting political processes, reforming the justice sector, encouraging growth of civil society, improving ethnic relations, and strengthening independent media. U.S.-assistance will also aim to improve North Macedonia&apos;s law enforcement and military forces. In addition to the bilateral funding requested in this section, North Macedonia will also benefit from resources requested for the Europe and Eurasia Regional operating unit, including programs to improve the conditions needed for broad-based and sustainable economic growth throughout the region. U.S. assistance will build resilience and reduce vulnerability to Russian aggression, increase European integration, and provide continued support for enduring programs.</narrative>
