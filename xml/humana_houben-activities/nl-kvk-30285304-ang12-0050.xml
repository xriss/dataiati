   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Goal Overview: Primary school children taught by the graduated TTC teachers have a broad understanding of how to change their nutritional status by changes in the daily diet. Through practicing setting up and maintaining a (door-size) home garden, the pupils are able to apply this at home and spread the knowledge and skills to their peers and parents.</narrative>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Project Plan: The teacher training course at the ADPP Teacher Training Colleges has a duration of 2,5 years. The trainee teachers carry out two periods of teaching practice. In the fourth period, they have half day practice in nearby schools. In the seventh period, they do a full year of teaching practice at rural schools throughout the province.</narrative>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Summary: The proposed project aims to implement a Nutrition education and School Garden course at the ADPP Teacher Training College (TTC) in Caxito. The student teachers will learn how to develop nutrition education lessons for every grade and they will create practice school gardens at TTC Caxito, and at the primary schools where they teach during their teaching practice. The fruits and vegetables grown in the school garden will benefit the children, but the primary aim is that they gain improved knowledge and skills about what a healthy daily diet is, as well as about growing and eating healthy produce which they can introduce at home.</narrative>
