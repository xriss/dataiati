   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Goal Overview: Primary school children taught by the graduated TTC teachers have a broad understanding of developing and maintaining a (door-size) home garden and they are able to apply this at home and spread the knowledge and skills to peers and their parents. The project will secure a widespread appreciation of the use of local vegetables and fruits, use of organic and human manure as well as of use of conservation gardening methods.</narrative>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Project Plan: The project will be implemented in Teaching practice schools of DAPP Chilangoma Teachers Training Colleges in South West Education Division in Blantyre District.

Innovative ideas were brought to the college and the schools &#x2013; the growing of local vegetables and fruits, involvement of even young children in the garden as well as the construction of latrines and use of human manure. The project has also gained valuable experience in cooperation with other stakeholders with in School Health and Nutrition in Malawi &#x2013; both within the Ministry of Education Structures and in other NGOs. By extending the project for a few more years a bigger impact can be reached. The proposed extension of the project will be relying on the already implemented curriculum development and the experiences gained in teaching practice schools.
