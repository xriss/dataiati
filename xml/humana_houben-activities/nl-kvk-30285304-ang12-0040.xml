   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Background: Most families live from subsistence agriculture and food insecurity is an issue at certain times of year. Few The farmers received no training and there is little evidence of any kind of organization or cooperative farming, both of which could lead to improved circumstances. Traditionally women in Angola carry out much of the family-level subsistence agricultural production, which also is the situation in Bengo province. However the women are not normally involved in determining the 
planning of what and how much to grow, much less in how to use the surplus production. Nambuangongo is one of the areas in Bengo province with a relatively high population density, making it possible to organize the farmers.</narrative>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Goal:to enable the farmers to become food secure and produce a surplus to market during the three project years. After this period, the farmers are equipped with the skills, knowledge, experience and income generating capacity to continue expanding their production.</narrative>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Project Plan: The 750 farmers will be organized in 15 clubs of 50 members. The Club project leaders will be trained in all aspects of project implementation. Women will be encouraged to become members and participate in the project activities on an equal footing with men. As soon the members have joined the club, Farmers&#x2019; Club Committees are elected and start their training. The Farmers Club project aims at improving the general standard of living for the farmer and his or her family through increased knowledge and skills in taking care of the health, education and wellbeing of the whole family. By creating viable structures for the farmers in the project area they become organised and productive. Access to markets will be facilitated and/or strengthened. During the programme</narrative>
