  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Goal Overview: the goal is to reduce youth employment by creating self-reliance of 60 adolecents (age 18 to 24) by educating them in carpentry and life skills according to modern standards at Mikolongwe Vocational school within 3 years.</narrative>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Project Plan: This action will benefit 30 young men and 30 young women at the school to acquire modern skills and knowledge in Carpentry techniques. The students will be equipped with skills to establish and run a successful carpentry and joinery workshop. They can also get employed in the construction industry.  There is a great impact of poverty in the country.  Some of the students will be enrolled due to their vulnerability as per government standards.  Mostly the students would come from poor backgrounds. DAPP Management will organize for professional upgrading of its staff for this course</narrative>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Summary: The DAPP Vocational School project resonates well with government&#x2018;s youth development programme to promote business development amongst the youths in order to contribute towards the eradication of poverty, unemployment, prostitution, alcohol and drug abuse among youths. The school seeks to offer quality training in livelihoods skills to the enrolled students with a core component of general education. This Carpentry course will target the youth and in service carpenters that would want to upgrade their career or skills by using new methodologies and technologies in a more conducive environment.</narrative>

Poor in the sense that they can not raise the full amount of school fees for their education and struggle to raise funds for basic needs.</narrative>
