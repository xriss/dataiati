   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The South Asian countries have been experiencing natural gas supply shortages due to growing demand and reduction in domestic gas supply.  Massive blackouts in India have hampered its growth, which is at a decade-low.  From a national security point of view, India plants to double the proportion of gas in its energy mix by 2020 from the current 10% share (coal accounts for 56% of India&apos;&apos;s primary energy need and oil 26%), but in the context of declining gas production from domestic fields, meeting this target will prove challenging.  Hoping to boost its natural gas supply and help fix the country&apos;&apos;s chronic power shortages, India recently doubled the gas prices from April 2014 onward to around $8.40/mmbtu.  In Bangladesh, gas shortage stands around 500-600 mmcfpd, which results in 600 - 1200 MW of load-shedding, a situation which deteriorates during irrigation seasons, when the demand-supply gap reaches up to 1500 MW. In addition, with 6% of the entire population having access to natural gas and 49% connected to the power grid, most Bangladeshi households in rural areas (99%) as well as urban areas (66%) use biomass for cooking, and the inefficient and poorly ventilated clay stoves have caused 46,000 women and children die each year as a direct result of exposure to indoor air pollution, while many more suffer from respiratory diseases.   The proposed investment will support an important junior E&amp;P player in the region in their effort to develop and produce natural gas to meet the growing demand in the region.    The successful implementation of the plan will have a positive and lasting impact on the Company&apos;&apos;s culture and way of doing business.   The project is expected to (i) support the development of natural gas resources in South Asia as a cleaner primary source of fuel to replace coal, oil and biomass, (ii) support the restructuring of one of the few junior E&amp;P companies with a focus on South and Southeast Asia and improve performance in E&amp;S and operations, (iii) help promote and integrate cleaner and more sustainable environmental practices in the region, and, (iv) contribute to increased fiscal revenues for the host governments.</narrative>
