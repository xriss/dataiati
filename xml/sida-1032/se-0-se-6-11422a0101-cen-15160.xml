   <narrative xml:lang="SV">Projektf&#xF6;rslaget l&#xE4;mnades in av Fonden f&#xF6;r globala m&#xE4;nskliga r&#xE4;ttigheter och syftar till att st&#xE4;rka respekten f&#xF6;r och skyddet av m&#xE4;nniskor&#xE4;ttsf&#xF6;rsvarare genom att uppr&#xE4;tth&#xE5;lla och st&#xE4;rka kapaciteten hos lokala m&#xE4;nniskor&#xE4;ttsorganisationer i El Salvador och Honduras.

Fonden f&#xF6;r globala m&#xE4;nskliga r&#xE4;ttigheter &#xE4;r en ideell organisation som skapades 2002 och &#xE4;r baserad i Washington DC. Fonden har ett latinamerikanskt regionalt program som tillhandah&#xE5;ller vidaref&#xF6;rmedling av finansiella medel och teknisk assistans till 56 frontlinjeorganisationer i Mexiko, Guatemala och Honduras. Detta projekt har utformats i n&#xE4;ra samr&#xE5;d med lokala intressenter i El Salvador och Honduras.

Fonden kommer att utveckla strategiska portf&#xF6;ljer av partnerorganisationer i varje land (5 partners i El Salvador och 8 partners i Honduras). Varje organisation kommer att f&#xE5; ett &#xE5;rs operativt st&#xF6;dbidrag, i belopp som str&#xE4;cker sig fr&#xE5;n $ 10.000 till $ 35.000.

I El Salvador kommer projektet att st&#xF6;dja organisationer som arbetar med kvinnors r&#xE4;ttigheter, med fokus p&#xE5; sexuell och reproduktiv h&#xE4;lsa. I Honduras kommer projektet att st&#xF6;dja organisationer som arbetar med mark- och naturresursr&#xE4;ttigheter.

Ambassaden bed&#xF6;mer att det finns ett merv&#xE4;rde att st&#xF6;dja fonden, eftersom den redan arbetar med ett brett utbud av Honduranska organisationer, ist&#xE4;llet f&#xF6;r att st&#xF6;dja enskilt var och en av dem. Fonden identifierade m&#xF6;jliga partners i El Salvador i ett bes&#xF6;k som genomf&#xF6;rdes i juni 2017.

The proposal was submitted by the Fund for Global Human Rights and it is aimed to strengthen respect for and protection for Human Rights defenders by sustaining and strengthening the capacity of local human rights organisations in El Salvador and Honduras. 

The Fund for Global Human Rights is a non-profit organisation based on Washington DC, created in 2002. The Fund has a Latinamerican regional programme which it is providing grant-making and technical assistance to 56 frontline organisations in Mexico, Guatemala, and Honduras. This project has been conceived of in close consultation with local stakeholders in El Salvador and Honduras.  
The Fund will develop strategic portfolios of grantees in each country (5 grantees in El Salvador and 8 grantees in Honduras). Each organisation will receive one-year operational support grants, in amounts ranging from $10,000 to $35,000.

In El Salvador the Project will support organisations working on women&#x2019;s rights, with a focus on sexual and reproductive health rights. In Honduras, the Project will support organisations working on land and natural resources rights.

The Embassy assess that there is an added value in supporting the Fund as this organisation it is already working with a broad range of Honduran organisations, instead of supporting individually each one of them. In El Salvador, the Fund already identified possible partners in El Salvador in a visit conducted in June 2017.</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">This Conclusion on Performance covers the period January - December 2020 and was elaborated based on and the annual reports submitted by the partner, and the monitoring made during the same period by the program officer. Because of the travel restrictions imposed by the Covid 19 Pandemic, field visits weren&#x2019;t implemented during 2020. Also, virtual meetings with all the partners &#x2013; one for each country- were held on last November 2020. Originally the program was designed to be implemented from November 2017 to December 2019. However, the delegation of Funds from Sida to the Embassy of Sweden in Guatemala was extended for an additional year. The Embassy assessed the support to FGHR as relevant and effective, and the validity period of the contribution was extended in time and funds, until July 2021. The Fund for Global Human Rights proved as a relevant partner, highly adaptive especially on the context of the Covid 19 Pandemic. The partner was able to monitor and support the progress of the national organizations in Honduras and El Salvador. Also, the partner was able to include new organizations and topics such as in the case of the media outlet El Faro based in El Salvador. The Swedish support was crucial for the partner to maintain the strategic portfolio of grantees in each country (eight grantees addressing land and resource rights in Honduras and five grantees addressing sexual and reproductive health rights in El Salvador). Each of these organizations have received one-year operational support grants. 3,800,000 SEK were disbursed during 2020, for a total amount of 11,800,000 SEK since the signature of the agreement in November 2017. However, the major impact of the Pandemic was reflected in the ability of the Partner to comply with the reporting requirements of the Agreement. Narrative, financial and Audit Report were submitted with substantial delays. The delays have several causes, for instance, Audit firms unable to implement the exam of transactions due to mobility restrictions, or staff shortness due to the contagious of Covid 19. This situation was subject of a permanent dialogue and monitoring with the partner. Honduras The grantees&#xA0; in Honduras are the following: Asociaci&#xF3;n de Jueces por la Democracia (Association of Judges for Democracy - AJD), The Consejo C&#xED;vico de Organizaciones Populares e Ind&#xED;genas de Honduras (Civic Council of Popular and Indigenous Organizations of Honduras &#x2013; COPINH), Fundaci&#xF3;n Equipo de Reflexi&#xF3;n, Investigaci&#xF3;n y Comunicaci&#xF3;n (Team for Research, Investigation, and Communication Foundation &#x2013; ERIC), Foro de Mujeres por la Vida (Forum on Women for Life &#x2013; Foro de Mujeres), Movimiento Amplio por la Dignidad y la Justicia (Broad Movement for Dignity and Justice &#x2013; MADJ), Organizaci&#xF3;n Fraternal Negra Hondure&#xF1;a (Honduran Black Fraternal Organization &#x2013; OFRANEH), Movimiento Ambientalista del Sur por La Vida (Southern Environmental Movement for Life - MASSVIDA), and Red Nacional de Defensoras de Derechos Humanos en Honduras (National Network of Women Human Rights Defenders in Honduras &#x2013; Red de Defensoras). In Honduras, the framework of the restrictions of the Pandemic, security forces committed abuses while imposing the lockdown restrictions. Activists, including Fund grantees, were disproportionately affected. In July, Marvin Dami&#xE1;n Castro Molina, a member of project grantee MASSVIDA, was abducted and later found dead. In the same month, five indigenous Garifuna men, members of project grantee OFRANEH, were abducted by armed men. Their whereabouts remain unknown until today. In both cases, the men had dedicated themselves to defending their land and countering harmful development projects. The partners in Honduras were able to maintain the litigation at the national courts, for several cases. &#xA0;Grantees AJD and MASSVIDA worked in partnership on two collective cases &#x2013; Caso Colectivo Zacata Grande and Caso Colectivo Prados - addressing the persecution and criminalization of land and resource rights defenders. Grantees ERIC and Foro de Mujeres advanced a case addressing the land rights of the residents of Colonia Alemania, who have been consistently denied these rights and threatened with displacement. Separately, grantee ERIC continued to provide representation to the seven arbitrarily detained defenders in a case known as Guapinol. El Salvador In the case of El Salvador, the partner organizations are: La Agrupaci&#xF3;n Ciudadana por la Despenalizaci&#xF3;n del Aborto (The Citizen&#x2019;s Association for the Decriminalization of Abortion &#x2013; La Agrupaci&#xF3;n), Fundaci&#xF3;n de Estudios para la Aplicaci&#xF3;n del Derecho (Foundation for Research and Application of Rule of Law -FESPAD), El Movimiento de Mujeres &#x201C;M&#xE9;lida Anaya Montes&#x201D; (The Women&#x2019;s Movement &#x201C;Melida Anaya Montes&#x201D; &#x2013; Las M&#xE9;lidas), Organizaci&#xF3;n de Mujeres Salvadore&#xF1;as por la Paz (Organization of Salvadoran Women for Peace &#x2013; ORMUSA), and Red Feminista (Women&#x2019;s Defenders Network), and the media outlet El Faro. During 2020, the Salvadoran context was most strongly characterized by a democratic backsliding. The year began with the president Nayib Bukele storming himself the Salvadorean Legislative Assembly with armed soldiers in an apparent effort to intimidate legislators into approving a loan for security forces. With the Pandemic, the Executive branch decreed a strict, nationwide lockdown, ordering security forces to detain violators and contributing to the increased militarization of public security. More than 16,000 people were sent to containment centers, some held for more than a month in unsanitary and inhumane conditions. Bukele not only authorized, but encouraged excessive use of force, leading to thousands of complaints of human rights violations. Moreover, he publicly defied three Supreme Court orders prohibiting arrests for lockdown-related offenses. Another matter of concern is the situation of the independent media, in particular El Faro, Revista Factum, and Gato Encerrado. President Bukele has thrown bureaucratic threats and attacks at outlets in the form of mandatory audits by the Finance Ministry. Within this bleak context, there have been some positive outcomes for the human rights landscape. In July, three police officers were found guilty and sentenced to 20 years of prison for their connection with the death of a transgender woman deported from the US. As the first conviction of this type in El Salvador, it sets an important precedent for the country. In relation to women&#x2019;s rights, specifically sexual and reproductive health and rights, the obstacles unfortunately have only grown, but there are still some positive outcomes, such as in the case in the case of Cindy Erazo, a victory that received much international attention. In 2011, Cindy experienced a miscarriage in a shopping mall bathroom near San Salvador. She was taken to the hospital, where she was accused of attempting to end the pregnancy and charged with aggravated homicide. Following her conviction, Cindy was sentenced to 30 years in prison, although this sentence was later reduced to 10. In August 2020, having served more than half of her 10-year sentence, Cindy was granted conditional release. Since 2011, grantees Agrupaci&#xF3;n and FESPAD have argued that there was never any evidence to support that Cindy had tried to abort her pregnancy or harm the fetus in any way. They have accompanied her and her family every step of the way, first achieving a reduced sentence, and now her release from prison.</narrative>
