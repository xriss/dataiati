  <description akvo:type="6" type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Fragility, conflict and violence are the most significant obstacles to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Just 20% of fragile and conflict-affected states are on track to achieve SDG targets by 2030, when 85% of the world&#x2019;s poorest people will be concentrated in those states; millions of people living in fragile contexts are at risk of being left behind. As it addresses fragility directly, SDG16 on peaceful, just, and inclusive societies is a vital accelerator of Agenda 2030. 
In the most fragile and conflict-affected contexts, insecurity and injustice is chronic and widespread due to weak, unresponsive institutions that do not meet the needs and claims of security and justice seekers, with adverse impact on the dignity, prosperity, and survival of all in society. The prevalence of insecurity and injustice also undermines people&#x2019;s perception of the efficacy and legitimacy of the state, inducing the weak social contract at the heart of fragility. Concurrently, closed and repressive governance systems underpinned by patriarchal and gerontocratic norms and practices exclude the majority of people, mainly women and youth, from political decision-making arrangements at local and national governance and formal and informal peace processes. These exclusionary arrangements further erode the willingness of people to trust and cooperate with the state, with 
detrimental effects on security and justice&#x2014;and the social contract itself. These dynamics contribute to entrenched poverty, gross inequality (including gendered and generational inequalities), and persistent conflict and instability, including regional spillover, as well as cycles of violent conflict and mass migration. In 6 countries&#x2014;Afghanistan, Burundi, Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Mali, Niger and South Sudan&#x2014;fragility also manifests as lack of freedom and space for independent civic action. All 6 countries are amongst the world&#x2019;s least free and most closed, due to repressive legislation and regulation by states, conservative or patriarchal social norms and informal institutions that restrict space for women and youth, the actions of violent non-state actors, or a combination thereof. In the cases of Afghanistan, Mali, and South Sudan, deficient processes of peacemaking or peace implementation are also present; 5 countries (all but Burundi) host large international peace and security assistance missions. 
Civil society organizations (CSOs), community-based organizations (CBOs), social movements, and informal activist groups in all 6 countries are working to improve security and justice and make political decision-making and peace processes more inclusive. CSOs, CBOs, social movements, and informal activist groups can aggregate and articulate the needs and demands of the most excluded constituencies, and engage on their behalf with duty-bearers and power-holders. But the relative weakness, fragmentation, and contested legitimacy of civil society in a context of shrinking civic space undermines the capacity of these actors to advocate for effective institutions or negotiate and collaborate with the state. Consequently, the demands and expectations of the most excluded are seldom reflected in the policy and practices of security, justice, governance and peace actors at the sub-national and national levels. The dominance of donors and Northern CSOs in many fragile and conflict-affected countries has led to donor dependence and reduction of autonomy for local actors, who are seldom included in the global policy where agendas are set and resources allocated. 
It is in response to these complex challenges that the Just Future Alliance (JFA) came together to support civil society actors in fragile contexts through a global strategic partnership. The Alliance co-created the Just Future programme to achieve the following 
long-term impact: 
Improved accessibility, responsiveness and accountability of security and justice institutions, and inclusive political decision-making and peace processes, achieved by mobilizing civil society for collective action and advocacy that contributes to acceleration and localization of SDG16+ in 6 fragile countries. 
This impact will be delivered through achievement of 3 programme outcomes (POs), specifically: 
1. Security providers are more responsive, accountable and people-centred, and take action enabling the most excluded constituencies to enjoy safety, protection and enforcement of the law; 
2. Justice providers are more accessible, responsive and accountable, and take action enabling the most excluded constituencies, to defend and enforce their rights, redress grievances and resolve disputes through diverse pathways to justice; 
3. Political decision-making, especially in regards to peace processes, is more inclusive of and accountable to the most excluded constituencies, which are able to influence and negotiate collectively with duty-bearers and power-holders in a context of adequate civic space and respect for human rights 
Achievement of long-term outcomes will depend on progress toward 3 intermediate 
outcomes, specifically: 
a) CSOs, CBOs, social movements, and informal activist groups are strengthened in their capacity, cooperation and action on behalf of the most excluded constituencies, and effectively advocate for those constituencies to enjoy safety, protection and enforcement of the law; 
b) CSOs, CBOs, social movements, and informal activist groups are strengthened in their capacity, cooperation and action on behalf of the most excluded constituencies, and effectively advocate for those constituencies to defend and enforce their rights, redress grievances and resolve disputes through diverse pathways to justice; 
c) CSOs, CBOs, social movements, and informal activist groups are strengthened in their capacity, cooperation and action on behalf of the most excluded constituencies, and effectively advocate for those constituencies to influence and negotiate collectively with duty-bearers and power-holders around political decision-making and peace processes 
These outcomes will be realized through a vibrant, inclusive and adaptive social change 
partnership with CSOs, CBOs, social movements, and informal activist groups in fragile 
contexts (the programme&#x2019;s &#x201C;primary stakeholders&#x201D;), using two main intervention strategies: 
&#xF0DE; Capacity strengthening that boosts the capabilities of CSOs, CBOs, social movements, 
and informal activist groups on the basis of capacity assessments and in line with a 
shared mutual learning agenda linking all partners in the programme, enhancing the 
capabilities, cooperation and action of these actors to conduct research, dialogue with 
and lobby security and justice institutions and other duty-bearers and power-holders, 
and work directly with security and justice providers to improve responsiveness and 
accountability to the most excluded constituencies. 
Advocacy and influencing organized around strategies in each country and at each level, based on sound data collection, research and evidence-building; operationalizing the countervailing power and brokering role of primary stakeholders, as well as their ability to foster inclusive dialogue and collaboration; seeking to safeguard, expand and reclaim civic space; and influencing state duty-bearers and power-holders through technical advice and support to internal champions.</narrative>
