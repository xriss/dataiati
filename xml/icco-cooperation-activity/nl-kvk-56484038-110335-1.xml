   <narrative xml:lang="EN">With funding from Argidius Foundation, ICCO Cooperation supports 1,000 youth (18-35 years) with an agribusiness in Nebbi district or Lango sub region in Northern Uganda. We provide different services to them, including trainings, coaching, mentoring and access to finance support.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">With the average rate for waged employment at only 3.2%, a growing youth population, and extremely high rates of youth in the informal sector (90.9%), entrepreneurship/self-employment is an attractive option for Ugandan youth. Uganda has a mixed picture of entrepreneurship, with the country regularly ranked among the top three most enterprising nations in the world. This ranking is based on the enterprise start-up rate and needs to be considered with the contrasting picture of enterprise failure rate. 
The Small Enterprise Performance Report (2015) indicates a failure rate of 50% within the first three years across economic sectors. This is due to multiple factors, including: inadequate financial management, poor records and the failure to collect overdue debtors, poor staff management, limited access to lucrative markets and a lack of access to finance to grow the business and improve technologies.

&#xF0D8; There are increasing number of programmes to support start-ups in East Africa, but the businesses created are often
unsustainable and do not create a significant number of incremental jobs;
&#xF0D8; There are fewer initiatives targeted at high-growth potential businesses;
&#xF0D8; More than 12 million opportunity-driven early stage entrepreneurs in East Africa are capital hungry and less than 20% are able to access equity or debt capital;
&#xF0D8; Mentoring support is regarded as one of the most valuable services for young entrepreneurs, but less than 10% of
entrepreneurs have easy access to business mentoring in East Africa;
&#xF0D8; Demand for services significantly outstrips supply - on average, business plan competitions and pre-incubation service providers in East Africa are only able to accept 15% - 20% of the applications they receive.

For all these reasons, ICCO will support the young entrepreneurs with an existing agri-business with a comprehensive package of Business Development Services, including training, coaching, long-term mentorship and financial linkage support.

ICCO is a member of Youth Business International, and implements the programme in cooperation with them. Youth Business International&#x2019;s mission is to support under-served young entrepreneurs to start their own sustainable businesses, to promote sustainable economic development, including job creation. YBI (est. 2000) is a global network of accredited organisations dedicated to helping young people start and grow their own business and create employment.

Nebbi district and Lango sub region have a  high rate of youth unemployment and rural-urban migration. We aim to encourage young people from these areas to start an agribusiness and create more jobs for fellow youth from their communities.</narrative>
