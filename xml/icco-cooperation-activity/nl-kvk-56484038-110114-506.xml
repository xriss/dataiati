   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The ACT Global Rapid Response Fund (GRRF) 2019 appeal enables local ACT Alliance members to quickly respond to disasters in their local and national context. It is a crucial element of ACT Alliance Humanitarian mechanism that saves lives and alleviates human suffering during the first phase after a disaster. 
ACT Alliance is a coalition of over 150 churches and church-related organisations working together in over 125 countries on humanitarian aid, development, and advocacy.</narrative>

  <description akvo:type="6" type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Rapid Response Fund (RRF) is a global fund of the ACT Alliance administered by the ACT secretariat. Funds for the RRF are provided by ACT Alliance members and non-members on the basis of an annual appeal, and is intended to be accessed exclusively by ACT national members in pursuit of the localization agenda and in recognition of their distinct advantage of being at the forefront of emergency response in their own localities.
In certain cases the RRF can also be requested by national members, through the Forum, as an advance on a forthcoming appeal for immediate life-saving or humanitarian needs assessment activities. This would act as an immediate &#x201C;start-up&#x201D; fund, allowing for a maximum of 150,000 USD to be used in the first 6-8 weeks of a large-scale/global emergency. This amount will be reimbursed in the appeal.

In line with ACT Alliance messaging towards the World Humanitarian Summit, the RRF is a unique tool for empowering national members and local partners as frontline and first responders at the onset of an emergency. Over the past several years since the RRF mechanism was introduced, the ACT Alliance through its national members has been able to ensure that it is able to respond to emergencies that may not always attract the attention of the media and donors. In such contexts, the impact of impact of emergencies at community level is not much different than in large-scale mega emergencies, and it is in these cases where the relevance of local and national actors and faith-based organizations, as well as ACT Alliance&#x2019;s reach in far-flung communities, is clearly demonstrated.

This year, in light of the priorities set by the new ACT Global Strategy 2019-2026, including inter alia the continuing strengthening of the ACT Humanitarian Mechanism, the full rollout of the digitalized Emergency Preparedness and Response Planning (EPRP) process, and improving adherence to the Core Humanitarian Standard (CHS) and Sphere, the request for funding is for $3,240,000.
The GRRF19 Appeal is issued with recognition of the planned review of the ACT humanitarian model led by the Secretariat and the HPPG, where it is initially envisioned that ACT Appeals will have a stronger focus on large-scale and mega emergencies, complemented by a stronger and better-funded RRF mechanism for small to medium-scale emergencies. As such, this Appeal is issued with a particular intention of encouraging other modes of fundraising with members (including a projectized approach to access possible back donor funding).
Further, while the core of the RRF will remain to be life-saving work, holistic approaches to emergency programming that fall within the priorities of the ACT Global Strategy will be given consideration within the context of a humanitarian crisis, e.g. emergency preparedness, survivor and community-led approaches, gender justice, addressing climate and conflict drivers, and investments in local humanitarian capacity. This operational flexibility is expected to result in new learning to inform the Alliance of ways to further improve its humanitarian work within the RRF framework.

Details on the extra elements funded from 7,5% are presented below. As KiA we do support these directions and proposals &gt; hence from our contribution also 7,5% to those initiatives:
In addition to funding RRF projects of national members, the Secretariat proposes to utilize 7.5% of RRF funds resource parallel mechanisms that will strengthen the humanitarian mechanism and primarily benefit the RRF. As in the 2018 GRRF, the Alliance continues to recognize the challenges that remain so that we are able to deliver high-calibre and accountable humanitarian response, and there remains a strong need to address issues around quality, capacity and preparedness especially in the work of national members. In 2018, the GRRF was able to support the development of the digital EPRP mechanism, the work of the EPRP Working Group, and some monitoring visits done by humanitarian staff of the Secretariat. For 2019, this approach will be continued as we further invest in specific areas of capacity development that are expected to benefit national members and our humanitarian mechanism in the long term.
The following critical support areas are being lined up to be supported under the RRF mechanism:
i. Strengthening of the Secretariat&#x2019;s monitoring and evaluation (M&amp;E) and coordination support to RRFs, including quality and efficiency improvements to the RRF proposal and reporting system
ii. EPRP Working Group and Secretariat technical support to ACT national forums in country-level rollout of the revised EPRP mechanism
iii. Capacity building for forums and national members on the Core Humanitarian Standard (CHS) and Sphere Standards</narrative>
