   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Cooperativa de Arte CEIBO R.L. (CEIBO) was founded in 1999 as a Multidisciplinary Art Company, devoted to artistic expression. In 2003, it began to carry out activities focused on education and socio-cultural development of children and adolescents at risk. In 2010, the Company was constituted as CEIBO Art Cooperative R.L., a non-profit, non-partisan and secular organization.

CEIBO has been an ICCO&#x2019;s partner since 2014 implementing a project to prevent violence with 200 youth in the Center for Youth Training and Development in Managua, using cultural and artistic expressions and introducing art in the processes of human development to promote human rights and access to culture, especially for children, adolescents and women.  Their current approved project is being implemented with success.

Prinzapolka is a municipality characterized by jungle and coastal environment.  The community was created based on human displacement caused by ethnic conflicts between Prinsus and Miskitos and the presence of foreign companies that extract gold, latex and wood, and banana production. It&#x2019;s a stigmatized municipality as an isolated territory: first because they have a fragile infrastructure and second because of the lack of presence of public institutions.  Public services are limited or non-existent, which aggravates the conditions of impoverishment.  This situation and the lack of communication within the community may have as an effect the increase of domestic and community violence.  Their dispersion (2 people per km2) facilitates ancestral traditions; nevertheless some of them are harmful, such traditions include tala mana (that naturalizes sexual abuse)  Also, other behaviours have become legitimate within the community, for example, men&#x2019;s violence towards women; which affects directly on children and adolescents as their education is affected by a culture of violence.</narrative>
