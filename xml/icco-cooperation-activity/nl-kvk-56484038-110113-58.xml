   <narrative xml:lang="EN">More than half-a-million (521,000)   Rohingyas have fled to Bangladesh since August 25, escaping violent attacks carried out by Myanmar troops and Buddhist vigilantes. It is estimated that 80 per cent of the refugees are children and women including newborn babies and pregnant women. 

There is very high fluidity and internal mobility, the majority of arrivals are still on the move, with more than 15,000 people coming in every day. The existing makeshift settlements and refugee camps are expanding significantly, meanwhile at least four new spontaneous settlements (as of reporting date) are forming and expanding quickly, with significant numbers of people are inflowing and being absorbed host communities as well. People are making huts wherever they found some space but they are running out of space in the existing settlements. Majority people are staying in open air, suffering from trauma, exhaustion, sickness and hunger.  People continue to come in through different crossing points, including by marine routes in coastal areas on the Bay of Bengal, over the Naf River in Teknaf and via land crossing points in Ukhiya and Bandarban District. Many people are arriving hungry, exhausted and with no food or water. Most of them walked 50/60 kilometers for up to six days and are in dire need of food, water, shelter and protection. According to ISCG situation report on 8 September, 88 dead bodies has been found in the last 10 days. 

The demand for food, shelter, water and basic hygiene support is not being met due to the sheer number of people in need. If families can&apos;t meet their basic needs, the suffering will get even worse and lives could be lost. More than 36,000 children (aged one or less) are the most vulnerable. They are living in conditions that are prime for the spread of diseases.

As of now, the primary emerging needs are food, WASH kits, and temporary shelter materials which will be of immense help for the Rohingyas.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">More than half-a-million (521,000) Rohingyas have fled to Bangladesh since August 25, escaping violent attacks carried in Myanmar. Across all sites in Bangladesh, even in makeshift settlements with services provision on site, the majority of new arrivals have little knowledge of how to access services or are not aware of services available/provided on site.  ICCO/KiA will provide immediate food and WASH assistance in makeshift settlements and spontaneous sites.</narrative>
