  <description akvo:type="6" type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">ACT Alliance has the privileged position of being a network of local, national and international actors
committed to partnerships amongst each other. This commitment enables international and global members
of ACT to enhance the capacity of local and national actors, through resources, training and/or other support,
allowing for first response in the beginning of a crisis or disaster to come directly from the community itself.
ACT Alliance prioritizes approaches that attempt to ensure a commitment of responsibility towards
communities in emergency response. Dignity, community empowerment and capacity-building are
cornerstones of our local and national responses. Our members at the local and national levels are embedded
within communities, familiar with the needs of communities and able to respond before any other actor in
times of crisis. It is the role of the ACT Alliance, in the context of its emergency response mechanism, to
ensure that the tools and resources available lend towards reinforcing this ambition.
The Rapid Response Fund (RRF) is a global fund of the ACT Alliance administered by the ACT secretariat.
Funds for the RRF are provided by ACT Alliance members and non-members on the basis of an annual appeal.
In exceptional cases the RRF can also be requested by implementing members, through the Forum, as an
advance on a forthcoming appeal for immediate life-saving or humanitarian needs assessment activities. This
would act as an immediate start-up fund, allowing for a maximum of 150,000 USD to be used in the first 6-
8 weeks of a large-scale/global emergency. This amount will be reimbursed in the appeal. This is being
introduced in 2017 for the first time, based on the recommendations from the Emergency Response Review
and the Humanitarian Policy (2015).
As of 30 November 2016, 9 RRF projects were approved in 2016, ranging from immediate response to
populations affected by conflict (Armenia), as well as natural disasters (Uruguay, Liberia, India, Bangladesh,
Tanzania, Dominican Republic, Egypt and Costa Rica). In total, more than 575,000USD was disbursed within
24 hours of the request for funding, providing life-saving assistance by ACT members to thousands of people
around the world, within 72 hours of the onset of the emergency.
As per previous years, the RRF appeal continued to enjoy a good level of funding in 2016. In line with ACT
Alliance messaging towards the World Humanitarian Summit, as well as in keeping with the overall ambitions
of the ACT Alliance, the RRF is a unique tool for empowering local and national members as frontline and first
responders in the first moments of an emergency. This is particularly relevant for emergencies that take place outside the view of the media emergencies that affect the lives of populations but are not large enough to
draw the attention or resources of global humanitarian actors.
This year, in keeping with the launch of the revised Humanitarian Response Mechanism for ACT Alliance, the
request for funding has remained at 3 million USD. Feedback from members around the world indicates that
the RRF is one of the most valuable tools for immediate, life-saving response to communities. As such, the
revision to the mechanism will allow the RRF to play a more central role in emergency response activities for
ACT members. In addition, the revision to the Humanitarian Response Mechanism prioritizes the Emergency
Preparedness and Response Plans (EPRP) as the cornerstone of ACT community-based emergency response,
rewarding forums with EPRPs to have access to both increased funding and longer response timeframes. As
you are aware, the revision of the mechanism has also eliminated the ACT Secretariat-managed RST; instead,
ACT members in forums are encouraged to support each other in rapid deployment for assessment and
response.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">PURPOSE The purpose of the RRF is to provide one-time financial resources to members of the ACT Alliance, in the first days following a local or national emergency, and where local or national members have the capacity to respond. The aim is to enable first responders to conduct immediate emergency response programming focused on saving lives, over a three to six month timeframe. The response must adhere to humanitarian principles, the ACT Alliance Code of Conduct, and the Core Humanitarian Stan</narrative>
