   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Building latrines at schools in Central African Republic</narrative>
  </title>
  <description akvo:type="6" type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">After two consecutive Joint Response interventions in the Central African Republic in which ACT partners LWF and FCA together presented relief projects, the two organisations now for the first time will be implementing a joint program complementing each other&#x2019;s activities in the same ten communities. The joint program is the result of a baseline study realised in December of last year, together with ACT member DCA. The choice was made for 18 villages in the zones of Birvan-Bol&#xE9;, Dan-Ghabrir and Binon, all around Bozoum in the prefecture of Ouham Pend&#xE9;, an area identified in the United Nations&apos; Humanitarian Response Plan as extremely vulnerable and lacking of basic needs. The baseline study identified needs in the areas of Food Security, WASH and Protection. 

FOOD SECURITY interventions are threefold:
Fighting malnutrition by providing food supplements to schools through the initiation of durable school canteens for which Associations for Mothers of Students (AMEs) will be formed who will be in charge. This will be complemented by the creation of community fields and vegetable gardens in schools, by distribution of certified seeds, and training of trainers on seeds multiplication and use of compost to keep and grow crops and vegetables in support of the school canteens. As proven in CARJR1&amp;2 the community gardens continue to be the primary vehicle to fight malnutrition, whilst at the same time being an activity that unites the community to live together. 
To further strengthen community resilience on the long-run 100 members of Parent Teacher Associations (PTAs, 40% being women) will be trained in income-generating activities and receive a start-up kit to launch the selected income-generating activity to sustain the food security of the students in their schools. This will make children return to schools, prevent drop-outs, and fight malnutrition.

WASH interventions complement the food security interventions:
Access to clean water is provided through the development/rehabilitation of 15 water sources. Furthermore access to sanitation is provided through the construction of 18 latrine blocks (36 cabins separated for boys and girls), including hand washing equipment. Water management committees and maintenance mechanisms will be established and supported, including providing them with repair kits. 
In collaboration with these structures and PTAs, hygiene awareness raising campaigns will be organised in the 3 zones. These wash interventions will reduce the likelihood of diarrhea and water-borne diseases that otherwise hamper food security.

PROTECTION interventions are mainstreamed in the project to strengthen community resilience and social cohesion through capacity building of and awareness-raising through 20 community leaders, 30 AME-members, 30 PTA-members and 20 members of water management committees. 
Furthermore a Training of Trainers for youth will result in 20 peace ambassadors who will foster social cohesion and reduce Gender Based Violence (GBV) by establishing platforms for community dialogues and by holding focus group discussions. These activities will support the establishment of a community support mechanism on GBV. To ensure schools are zones of social cohesion a total of 10 teachers, 30 parent teachers and 10 mothers of AMEs will be trained on the new peace education curriculum developed by ACT/FCA, CAR Ministry of Education and Unicef. Teaching on peace education will be piloted in the selected 10 schools. These bottom-up approaches will be complemented by 20 radio shows on protection, social cohesion, GBV, and promotion of peace and reconciliation. In addition 20 awareness-raising campaigns, linked to cultural events, on the same topics will be held in the 10 villages.    

Implementing organisations
The Lutheran World Federation (LWF), Finn Church Aid (FCA), and Danish Church Aid (DCA) are the active members of the ACT Alliance in CAR. They implement a variety of humanitarian programs with funding from amongst others UNHCR, CHF, Finnish and German Ministries. As ACT we work closely together with the humanitarian branch of the Lutheran Church of CAR (OSEEL-RCA). Linkages of this project with other longer-term ACT programs will contribute to sustainability of results.  
Due to their proven impact the present project is similar to the ICCO Cooperation/ACT CAR JR 1&amp;2 projects but targets other communities in Ouham-Pend&#xE9;.
LWF/ACT and FCA/ACT have a Head Office in Bangui, as well as field Offices in Bozoum/Ouham Pende, Bouar/Nana Nambere, Sangha Bahere/Mamb&#xE9;r&#xE9; Kadei, Berberati and Nola. This project will be implemented by the regional operational base in Bouar and the sub-base in Bozoum. Field staff and supervisors will be encouraged to be largely stationed in the communities and operate from key locations or the sub-base in Bozoum. Both organizations have regional and international staff to provide further technical advice.

Expected outcome FCA intervention:
Protection: Reinforced protection mechanisms at community level as well as improved access to basic services.
&#x2022;	Peace education curriculum introduced in the targeted schools.
WASH: access to sustainable WASH services has increased and the resilience of the most vulnerable IDPs, their host communities, returnees and repatriated has been strengthened.
&#x2022;	1271 students (847 boys and 424 girls) have access to latrines at schools.
&#x2022;	10.000 community members are more aware of health and hygiene issues because of radio shows and community awareness raising campaigns and events.
Food security &amp; livelihood: lives have been saved and the economic situation of the population has improved.  
&#x2022;	100 PTA members (50 women and 50 men) have reinforced their livelihood capacities through selected income generating activities.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Central African Republic (CAR) is going through a deep and complex crisis with considerable humanitarian consequences. A joint baseline study implemented by FCA and LWF identified the needs for increased protection, food security and water points/latrines at schools around Bozoum. Together both partners will assist the schools and communities, each focusing on their specific expertise. FCA will be constructing latrines and will train parents and teachers on hygiene issues.</narrative>
