   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Church of Bangladesh Social Development Programme (CBSDP) is the social development wing of the Church of Bangladesh which has been operating as a non-governmental organisation (NGO) and working with the poor to enable them overcome poverty since March 1984 in the country having registration with the Department of Social Services, Government of Bangladesh and subsequently with the NGO Affairs Bureau under the Prime Minister&#x2019;s Secretariat. During the first phase of its organisational development (OD) process undertaken by CBSDP with supports from Bread for the World (BfdW), Germany and other donors from January 2012 to March 2013, the proposal of CBSDP for shifting from project approach to programme approach to their development activities was discussed in its partners&#x2019; consultation meeting held on 2 November 2012 in Savar, Dhaka and the donors&#x2019; representatives present in the meeting very kindly appreciated and accepted the proposal. In line with that decision and in order to operationalise its strategic plan which was presented in the said consultation meeting the CBSDP has developed this proposal on its planned comprehensive development programme (CDP) for 6 years to be implemented during the period from July 2014 to June 2020. 

Issues to work on: The programme proposal (PP) covers all the six issues of the life of the poor target people that were mentioned in the strategic plan (SP) of the organisation. These are (a) Food and Livelihood Security, (b) Community Health and Hygiene, (c) Rights and Social Security, (d) Gender Equity Development, (e) Ethnic Community Development, (f) Climate Change and Disaster Risks Management. In addition, it will cover the Target People&#x2019;s Organisations (TPOs) Development and Strengthening issue also. This new issue has been included in consideration of a number of related needs and purposes including socio-political empowerment of target people, adding sustenance to effects and impact of the programme activities, arousing interest and capacity of the target people to take responsibility and care of their own interest and requirements, carrying out advocacy and lobbying by them with relevant authorities and agencies, and mobilisation of supports and services by them from relevant sources even after expiry of the programme period. These issues have been selected in consideration of, among others, the suggestions of the poor, community leaders, religious leaders, government officials of the programme&#x2019;s planned operational areas whom the CBSDP study teams met and discussed with during fieldworks in connection with development of this programme proposal during September and October 2013, and also for the purpose of preparation of SP of the organisation in 2012. 

PP development process followed: This programme proposal is the output of the joint efforts of all concerned staffs of CBSDP of central and field offices. The organisational development (OD) consultant assisted them in development of the PP as a part of performance of one of the three tasks he was assigned in the second phase of the organisation&#x2019;s OD process. Necessary formats/ checklists/ guidelines for collection of necessary data and information for analysis of existing situation of the poor people, collection and presentation of relevant data and information, etc were prepared. These were explained to senior and middle level staffs of CBSDP central and field offices and they were briefed on their respective share of the total tasks in the process in meetings with them in Dhaka and in field offices. 

A team of senior officers of the organisation comprising Coordinator: Planning, Monitoring and Evaluation (PME) (David Sanjib Sarker), Coordinator: Health (John Torun Mondal), and Programme Officer (Ruth Rita Moni Talukder Madhu) worked all through the process. They, accompanied by the OD consultant, made fieldworks, met and discussed with the poor people, community and religious leaders, and key informants of the planned operational areas of the programme. The field office staffs contributed their knowledge and experience to development of this document and their intensive and extensive involvement in the process will be helpful for them in its implementation phase. 

During fieldworks the senior officers of central office and staffs of field offices worked in several teams in September and October 2013. The CBSDP study teams conducted 36 FGDs (focus group discussions) with 529 poor people, met and discussed with 74 community and religious leaders and key informants in 36 locations. The team had in depth and extensive discussion with 51 CBSDP field office staffs of 15 current project locations on all relevant issues for development of the programme proposal.  

Senior officers of the central office including Coordinator: Programmes (John Provanjan Biswas), Coordinator: HRMA (Ruhul Quudus Tito), and Coordinator: PID (Prodip Chand Mondol) also have contributed to development of this document. The CBSDP staffs have selected the operational areas and issues to work on in each area/ location, have decided about the target groups and size of direct target beneficiaries in each group, activities to be carried out in achieving the programme objectives mentioned in the logframes, have estimated the entire programme costs and have carried out other related activities.

Very close involvement and active participation of CBSDP staffs (from the chief executive officer of the organisation to field staffs of middle level) in the entire process of development of this programme proposal has resulted in development of their knowledge about development issues, terms and concepts used in development field, more particularly about their respective jobs and responsibilities in contributing to achievement of set programme objectives and how they can perform their jobs. 

This proposal has been arranged and presented in three sections; Section- A is with consolidated position of the programme as a whole, Section- B with Issue-wise information, and Section- C with concluding words. 

In Section- A, the items, in addition to background, discussed are (a) Socio-economic situation analyses, (b) Country situation: an overview and situational information, and Situation in respect of selected issues in planned operational areas, (c) Overall rationale of the programme, (d) Consolidated size of target people, (e) 	Goal/ Overall Objective and Outcomes/ Programme Objectives, (f) Major strategies to be followed in achieving objectives, (g) 	Overall programme management systems to be followed: 	Staff strength and major responsibilities of key officers, Important support services from CBSDP central office, and Reporting system, (h) Overall sustainability of effects and impacts of the programme, and (i) Total estimated cost budget of the entire programme. 

The items discussed in Section- B which is with issue-wise information are (a) Selected information about the planned operational areas, (b) Issue-wise size of target people, (c) Issue-wise objectives to be achieved, (d) Major strategies to be followed in achieving objectives, (e) 	Issue-wise major activities/ group of activities to be carried out, (f) 	Working methods, (g) Issue-wise expected sustainability of effects and impacts, and (h) Issue-wise estimated cost budget.</narrative>
