  <description akvo:type="6" type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Latin America is the region most violent, The region&#x2019;s rate of 23 homicides per 100,000 citizens is more than twice the world average. As a result of these startling trends, violent crime has emerged as one of the most serious obstacles to development in Latin America, undermining democratic consolidation and eroding vital social capital. In Colombia, the internal armed conflict has generated sequels in social, economic and cultural development of the population. Ten percent of the population is in a situation of displacement, despite positive macroeconomic indicators, the social gap has increased, further complicating the conflict and violence generating patterns.In order to contribute to human security and stability and to reduce the interconnected threats of violence, organized crimes, gender inequality and social insecurity, ICCO - in partnership with local organizations and based on lessons learned in the region - designed the programmatic intervention `Building Protection by empowering people in Latin America&#xB4;. ICCO opts for a dual focus on protection and empowerment. Protection implies a top-down approach: measures taken in order to protect affected communities. It asks for strategies that enhance the capacities of the institutional / governance structures, thus contributing to the capacity of (local) governments to carry out their most essential tasks. . It is complemented by a bottom-up approach of empowerment of vulnerable groups that includes strategies to develop their capacities and strengthen economic opportunities. The target groups of this proposal are 1,500 young men and women and displaced families located in five countries of the region: Nicaragua, Salvador, Honduras, Guatemala and Colombia.The proposal aims to improve the target groups&#x2019; access to the labor market and increase and improve their entrepreneurial initiatives and benefit from the establishment of strategic alliances with public and private actors that strengthen their social and economic integration in society. On the other hand, the proposed program and activities are very much in line with the overall objective of promoting human security.</narrative>
