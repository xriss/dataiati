   <narrative xml:lang="EN">With the rise of water level of Brahmaputra and Teesta, the chars and the river basin areas including mainland of 32 unions of Sundarganj, Sadar Fulchhari and Saghata upazila went underwater. The water level of Brahmaputra rose by 19 cm during the period and it is flowing 128 cm above its danger level at the Fulchharighat point of the district. The Ghagot which is overflowing at different points of the district inundating fresh areas and the river is flowing 87 cm over its danger mark at New Bridge Road point.

In Kurigram, the situation is continuing to deteriorate due to heavy incessant rainfall and continuous swelling of all the rivers, including Dharla, Dudhkumar and Brahmaputra. A total of 390 villages of 55 unions of the district are inundated, while at least 350,000 people are under the open sky, suffering inhumane living conditions, 384 educational institutions are closed. Water levels of the Brahmaputra, Dharla, and Dudhkumar rivers in Kurigram are rising while the Teesta river is going down. Over 300 000 people of 72,480 families in nine upazilas have been marooned in floodwaters, while the  homes of 1,031 families have been damaged in the floods. Four children have also died in as many days after falling into the floodwater in two upazilas.
Over 500 educational institution of Gaibandha and Kurigram districts have been closed as those have been either flooded or flood hit people have taken shelter there.  Around 2.870 000 families have taken shelter on highland, embankment, schools and different safe places. The facilities in most of the flood shelter are not good and there is not enough latrines. As a result, women are suffering and also feeling insecure. Thousands of flood victims in the submerged areas have been passing unhappy life with inadequate relief. Shortages of pure drinking water and food intensified the sufferings of the marooned people. Water Borne diseases are spreading fast in the flood-hit areas while no medical support reached the victims yet.  Some of the displaced people have passing their days under the open sky as their dwellings were washed away by floodwaters. The flood affected people are seeking assistance from the government and other development organizations.
As many as 20,724 flood affected people of the upazilas took shelter at 114 flood shelter centres with their assets. Due to flood, over 4500 hectares of land of standing crops particularly T-Aus paddy, Aman seed bed, jute and summer vegetables went under flood water. Some 500 metric tons of various varieties of fish worth of TK 6.85 crore and fingerlings of TK 20 lakh from 1955 ponds have been washed away due to monsoon flood this year.</narrative>
