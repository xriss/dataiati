   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Women Empowerment for Participation and Improved Livelihood aims at providing alternative means of livelihood for single mothers and youth through vocational skills in Tailoring, Advanced Tailoring, Tie and Dye, Liquid Soap making, Screen Printing, and Driving while engaging them on training and awareness on peacebuilding and reconciliation to promote peaceful co-existence.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">While doing this, the women will gain skills in saw-machine maintenance, cloth making, produce cotton and paper grocery, bed sheets, and shopping bags as alternative to the paper bags, These bags will then be supplied to the supermarkets and other traders. They will also make liquid soap and sell to community members and hotels. While the youth will be trained in various livelihood skills like Screen printing, Driving, and liquid soap making. This will create employment or self-employment to the youth who may use their savings to return back to school and further their education.There is very big improvement in the livelihood of the 48 beneficiaries from our previous projects. Each of these women and youth are now self-supported using their skills to support their families. Women headed households are very poor and as they are poor, they depend on other adults for food and welfare as a result, there are misunderstandings and tensions within the families and eventually hatred and permanent conflicts which can spread to the whole tribe and communities. So this project wants to reunite the single headed households with their relatives and families due to improvement of their income levels and reducing their dependency. These women are also isolated and ignored as irresponsible women, lose and poor by the communities because they have either lost their families/husbands to the war, diseases or broken due to domestic violence as a result, these women get more stigma and discrimination than learned and married women. In the end they suffer more due to psychological torture of isolation harming their effective participation in the community activities, decision making processes. The youth are the most used in conflicts. They also engage in drug abuse if they have nothing to live for. This leads to the spread of HIV/AIDS and other STDs/STIs, criminality etc.

This project therefore intends to build the bond and torn relationships between women headed household and the communities in the following ways.
&#x2022; Community education of the roles of women and youth in the development processes of the community. This process will create awareness in the community about the roles women and youth play in peacebuilding and peaceful co-existence.
&#x2022; Capacity building of women headed households to restore hope and confidence for their effective contribution to the development of their local communities.
&#x2022; Provision of alternative source of income by giving skills and start-up capital other than brewing alcohol which at the end backfires at them through domestic violence. These women and youth cannot access Bank loans like their male counterparts so they are unable start their own business initiatives. So this project will help them start their business by imparting into them the skills that they can use to better their lives and the one of their children.  
&#x2022;  Mitigate potential inter-family, tribe and community conflicts as a result of the increasing number of women headed households.  Women are peace lovers in most cases. They are the more affected during conflicts or war. They have a big influence also on men in terms of peace building. By empowering these women and youth, we will be able to promote peace and stable families and communities.</narrative>
