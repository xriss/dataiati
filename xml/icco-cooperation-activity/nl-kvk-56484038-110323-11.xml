Whereas fishermen&apos;s assets are lost, heavily damaged or lightly, namely 292 boats, 210 spinning machines, 113 generator sets, 206 trawls and 8 sets of strings, 8 anchor rope bales, 326 fishing sets, 375 electric lights, one oxygen tube, 18 FADs, 28 batteries and 8 charts. 

Damage to fishing facilities causes a loss of income of IDR 5 million per month per fisherman.

Another function is a coastal abrasion restraint. Therefore according to the direction, based on the results of studies conducted by BNPB, and starting to become the priority of the medium-term work of BPBD and the local government. However, until now there has not been enough support for vegetation recovery activities from donors, NGOs and other parties. The results of the BPBD Palu study showed that the best mangrove planting area was carried out along the coast of sub-district of North Palu and Tawaeli.

This project aims to improve communities&#x2019; resilience through livelihood recovery and market-integrated emergency Preparedness interventions;
