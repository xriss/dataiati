   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In the countries that are targeted by &apos;We are Able!&apos; (DR Congo, Burundi, Ethiopia, South Sudan, Sudan and Uganda) food security is low. People with disabilities (PWDs) are even more likely to live in food insecure households. We are able! wants to see PWDs improving their right to food and food security by creating an enabling environment for right-to-food action at grassroots level. While PWDs are the core target group of the We are able! program, we create benefits for other excluded groups like vulnerable women, youth in general, marginalised ethnic groups and internally displaced persons (IDPs), as applicable per context.</narrative>

  <description akvo:type="3" type="3">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The We are able! program targets people (including women, men, and youth) with a disability, while, as spin-off, the program will also create opportunities for other excluded groups,3 such as vulnerable women, persons affected by leprosy, youth in general, excluded ethnic groups, internally displaced persons (IDPs) and refugees, as much as possible or necessary in the specific context. Intersectional traits often make people particularly vulnerable. Refugees with disabilities or disabled women and men of particular ethnic backgrounds often face the most severe forms of food insecurity. We are able! identifies and targets groups and individuals with particular vulnerabilities while creating synergies that allow others to benefit as well.</narrative>

The scores will be determined by the involved Public Authorities (PAs) themselves, through **focus group discussions (FGDs)** including technical experts (civil servants of the public authority) and political office holders (mayors, councillors, political appointees in central government etc.). Each LIA-step methodology is a translation of one of the 11 LIA-steps in the Dutch Local Inclusion Agenda.</narrative>
