   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Provision of Shelter Assistance to IDP&apos;s and Returnees in Ngala LGA</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project will target IDPs in Ngala LGA with the provision of shelter repair kit to 500 HHs who found their shelters partially and / or completely destroyed. In 2017 UNHCR continued to effectively respond to shelter needs of IDP&#x2019;s and returnees in three affected states, Yobe, Adamawa and Borno. A total of 13,477 households of 67,385 individuals was reached with shelter assistance in formal and informal camps, host communities and newly accessible areas. This figure included 1,000 households of 5,000 IDPs provided with emergency shelters in Arabic camp in Gamboru Ngala local government area. As part of the NHF 1st Reserve Allocation 2018, UNHCR is currently providing 500 NFI and Emergency shelters in Tungushe and providing 620 shelter repair kits to returnees in Pulka. As the number of returns and displacement increases due to military operations in Ngala, there&#x2019;s need to provide 500 shelter repair kits to Ngala in their plots and as well as for host families whose resources have been overstretched. Subsequently acknowledging that the humanitarian situation is likely to further deteriorate UNHCR will also enhance contingency planning through prepositioning of 500 NFI and emergency shelters support to effectively and rapidly respond to emergency new displacements in Arabic camp, Ngala LGA due to military operations. 

Despite the achievements in the past, the transitional needs of returnees, though shaped by very different dynamics, revealed that quite a significant majority of them are still living in inadequate shelters. As a result, some returnees in host communities are preferring to settle in camps where the humanitarian community is providing emergency shelters for IDP&#x2019;s in camps. The lack thereof not providing an alternative shelter support for returnees in host community is likely to scale up the number of IDP&#x2019;s hosted within camps, consequently reducing the number of emergency shelters available to cover both the needs of new arrivals and the returnees. Due to massive returns to Ngala since 2017 from the neighboring countries and within Nigeria, majority of returnees are living in poor conditions and are in need of shelter repair kit to assist them re-build their houses which had been destroyed by the Boko Haram insurgency. It is also noted that a lack of capital to purchase building materials undermines opportunities for stimulating early recovery in areas of return. 

UNHCR shall build upon progress made in 2017 and proposes to provide:
1. 500 shelter repair kit for Returnees in Ngala
2. Preposition 500 emergency shelters and NFI to response to new arrivals in camps in Gamboru, Ngala.
The UNHCR shelter repair kit aims to complement the returnee&#x2019;s efforts in reconstruction and repair of their shelters. It provides sufficient materials for a substantial beginning, which can be built upon, including also a conditional cash grant to allow some flexibility for IDPs, returnees to supplement according to their specific needs. The UNHCR shelter kit targets beneficiaries who find their houses partially damaged and / or fully damaged and for host families requiring support. The material components were selected based on the need to ensure that the choice of construction method and materials utilized are cost effective, allows for maintenance and are readily available and practical. The kit also provides for a conditional CASH component of NGN 30,000 Naira adequate to cover for the cost of labour and molding of mud bricks or other unforeseen needs. The shelter kit solution is centered on the need to assist identified families and communities to rebuild homes that are safe and meet established technical requirements, in an integrated approach centered on the affected families as informed decision-makers. The selection of beneficiaries will be based on a damage assessment undertaken at household level to define various level of damage. Identification and verification of beneficiaries are guided by UNHCR Protection princ</narrative>
