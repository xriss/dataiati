   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Supporting Safe Access to Fuel and Energy for IDPs (New Arrivals and Households in Congested Camps) of Bama LGA of Borno State.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The long and protracted violence conflict in the northeast region of Nigeria has left many untold hardship arising from loss of shelter, lives and livelihood among the affected population in the region. With the increase activities of security forces and liberation of some of the Boko Haram captured territories, there is an increase in the influx of new arrivals in about 11 LGAs of Borno state, similarly because of the new arrivals, most of the camps are already experiencing congestion and Bama is one of them.
These new arrivals and households in congested camps lack access to safe fuel and energy, thus the reason for their prioritization by the NHF SA1, 2018.
In this proposed project GREENCODE, will undertake community mobilization, collaborate with IOM and other INGOs in Bama LGA to identify new arrivals as well as NEMA/SEMA for households in congested camps.
The project is planned for 6 months and GREENCODE plans to adopt 4 approach to improving SAFE access this will include
Firstly, community and target group mobilization, train enumerators, conduct baseline survey to understand and validate early secondary data on SAFE in Bama LGA. Additional element to the GREENCODE baseline will be choice of stoves and challenges of already distributed stoves and lighting kits.
Secondly, GREENCODE will identify, select and train 200 in the LGA) target group on construction of fuel wood efficient cook stoves (the stove is designed to use either firewood or charcoal and uses Rocket design technology from Ghana).
Also, purchase from ROSAN limited and distribute  2,200  efficient cook stove to 2,200 households (1 stove per household.) in Bama LGA.  
The stoves will be of two types (firewood and charcoal ) based on the choice of each beneficiary.
Thirdly, 750 already assembled solar lighting kits (lamp and mini panels
Also, conscious effort will be taken to mainstream gender and protection activities into the project, some of the gender/protection activities already planned include mass awareness on GBV (sexual abuse/exploitation), Mine education and early warning signs/response mechanism. 
The project is estimated to reach 2,200 households (13,200 persons as direct beneficiaries without double counting) and over 28,000 indirect beneficiaries with all the project activities.
Currently, the beneficiaries mainly women and children are going out of the camp into far way bush to collect both dead and fresh woods for cooking, while some trade off their in-kind food or cash for food from humanitarian agencies to buy charcoal/firewood from traders. 
Gender and protection activates will be mainstreamed in all the project activities (see list of activities/budget) and the Protection budget will be over 10% of the total grant budget.
Similarly, in these locations target beneficairies lack access to safe and sustainable source of energy for lighting. Some households are forced to sleep in the dark as they don&#x2019;t have lamps or afford fuel to power the local lantern
The risk some of them faces in search of energy for cooking ranging from adoption from the bush by Boko Haram insurgency, while some are killed, upper respiratory health effect arising from inhaling of carbons/fumes from the open firing method of domestic cooking with 3 stones, poverty and some gender based violence from men who owns and trade on fuel (wood and charcoals), 
The rationale for this project is to reduce by 40% the amount and volume of wood /charcoals used for cooking,improve health condition through improved cooking method, reduce the high risk of sexual exploitation faced by women and girls for procuring and distributing solar lamps that will be sustainable and less cost effective in its maintenance
GREENCODE in the implementation of this project will be working closing with following organisations -NEMA/SEMA, IOM, local communities, ROSHAN Global Company (Happy Stove), UNOCHA and Global Alliance for Clean Cook Stove- Nigeria chapter and SAFE TWG amp WFP</narrative>
