   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Provision of Shelter and NFIs Assistance to IDPs in response to New Arrivals and Decongestion of Camps in Bama, Ngala and Gwoza Local Government Areas.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project will target IDPs in response to new arrivals and decongestion of existing camps with preposition of 1000 emergency shelters/ Non-food Items (NFIs) in Ngala Local Government Areas (LGAs) and preposition 1000 NFIs in Gwoza and its surrounding villages. As a major partner in Ngala LGA, UNHCR will therefore construct 500 emergency shelters of the 1000 prepositioned shelters. 
In 2018 UNHCR continued to effectively respond to shelter needs of IDPs in three affected states, Borno, Yobe, and Adamawa. A total of 4,041 households of 20,205 individuals have been reached with shelter assistance in formal and informal camps, host communities and newly accessible areas. This figure also includes assistance to new arrivals as follows 250 households of 1,250 IDPs provided with emergency shelters in GSS IDP Camp, Bama and 701 households of 3,505 IDPs in Gamboru Ngala local government area (LGA). As part of the NHF 1st Reserve Allocation 2018, UNHCR recently completed provision of 500 NFI and emergency shelters to 500 households in Tungushe, Konduga LGA while 620 households were provided with shelter repair kits/cash in Pulka, Gwoza LGA. UNHCR also received funding under NHF&#x2019;s 4th Reserve Allocation, and implementation is ongoing where 500 households in Arabic Camp, Ngala will benefit from emergency shelter and NFIs, while shelter repair kits including a cash component will be provided to 500 household returnees in Ngala host community. 

As the number of new arrivals and congestions in camps increases due to military operations in Bama, Ngala and Gwoza LGAs, there is need to provide emergency shelters and NFIs for life-saving emergency assistance. Subsequently acknowledging that the humanitarian situation is likely to further deteriorate UNHCR will also enhance contingency planning through prepositioning of NFI and emergency shelters support to promote the protection, safety and dignity of affected Persons of Concern (PoCs). 

Despite the achievements in the past, the continuous needs of IDPs, though shaped by very different dynamics, revealed that quite a significant majority of people are living in congested camps. The inadequate support to IDPs and lack of adequate land is likely to scale up the number of IDP&#x2019;s hosted within the existing camps, consequently reducing the number of emergency shelters available to cover both the needs of new arrivals and to decongest the camps. 

UNHCR shall build upon progress being made in 2018 and proposes to-

1. Preposition 1000 emergency shelters and NFIs to (1000 households) new arrivals and reduce over-congestion in the camp in Ngala.
2. Provision of 500 emergency shelters out of the 1000 prepositioned to new arrivals and reduce over-congestion in the camp in Ngala.
3. Preposition 1000 NFIs kits to (1000 households) new arrivals in Gwoza and its surrounding villages as a protection response to support basic needs. 

The selection of beneficiaries will be based on needs assessment and vulnerability screening in the locations at the time of implementation. Identification and verification of beneficiaries are guided by UNHCR&#x2019;s Protection principles.</narrative>
