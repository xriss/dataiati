   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Providing first line gender-based violence response and prevention services to new arrivals and other vulnerable populations in Konduga LGA of Borno State</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Jireh Doo Foundation (JDF) operating as a single entity is through this project aiming to provide a survivor centered first line response GBV and protection services to new arrivals in Gomari, Tungushe A and B communities of Konduga Local Government Area. The project will seek to ensure that new arrivals are promptly provided with the needed protection services on arrivals to include psychosocial support services, referral, case management and the provision of critical dignity/NFI kits to women and girls. Two mobile teams made up of nurses and case workers, in addition to providing services to new arrivals in the communities, the mobile teams will also help bridge the gaps in services in surrounding areas where new arrivals or other vulnerable women and girl&#x2019;s population have difficulty accessing the women and girls&#x2019; safe spaces. A significant number of new arrivals arrive communities without the knowledge of existing services or how to access these services. The mobile teams will also be trained to be able to conduct gender-sensitive hygiene promotion targeting women and girls. Tungshe have had recent cholera outbreaks.

Services provided on the project will be geared towards reducing the severe distress, hardship occasioned by the displacement of vulnerable persons. JDF will pay particular attention to new arrivals as they arrive the communities and will seek ways of working with security forces in the screening and processing of new arrivals into the communities at the point of arrival to ensure that protection concerns are quickly identified and addressed. 

The selected LGA, Konduga stands as a priority LGA under this location and JDF already has presence in implementing GBV and other protection activities in the communities and has very good pre-existing relationships with stakeholders that facilitate work in the communities. JDF will continue to nurture with zeal and dedication these relationships for the success of this project

A key component of the project will be the establishment of two women and girls&#x2019; safe spaces (WGSS) in Tungushe and Gomari communities of Konduga LGA which will further expand current community services. Through these safe spaces, women and girls will be provided with life-saving services such as psychosocial support, group therapy, group and individual counseling, psychological first aid and case management services to new arrivals. 

A small livelihoods component of the project will identify 60 women and older adolescent girls to provide specialized training and grants and monitoring by case managers. 200 women and girls will be also trained and formed into groups for Village Savings and Loans as a livelihood and resilience building interventions

Additionally, the project will include a community engagement and awareness-raising component, targeting a total of 600 men, women, boys, and girls in the communities of interest. This approach aims to remove negative attitudes and practices that lead to stigmatization of GBV survivors, which serves to remove barriers to reintegration of survivors over time. This component of the project will also enable community-based referral pathways for individuals who experience violence.

Jireh Doo Foundation is keen on the principle of leaving no one behind and ensuring that unreached populations are reached. JDF will pay particular attention to ensure that project activities, infrastructures to be constructed such as women and girls&#x2019; safe spaces take into cognizance the needs of people with disabilities.  JDF will work with all actors present in the location to ensure that timely and appropriate response to the needs of new arrivals with a focus on women, girls and adolescents that have been exposed to or are vulnerable to abuse are prioritized. 

In total, the project will reach 3620 beneficiaries, split equally between host and IDP communities</narrative>
