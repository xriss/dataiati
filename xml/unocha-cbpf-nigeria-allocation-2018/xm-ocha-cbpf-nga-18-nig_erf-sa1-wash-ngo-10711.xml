   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Now in its tenth year, the crisis in north-east Nigeria remains one of the most severe in the world. Since the start of the conflict in 2009, more than 27,000 people have been killed in the BAY states, thousands of women and girls abducted and children used as so-called &#x201C;suicide&#x201D; bombers. In 2017, 146 children (mainly girls) were used as human bombs. In 2018, 43 children were used in attacks in the first six months.
Today 1.8 million people are internally displaced in the Borno, Adamawa and Yobe states. Thousands of new arrivals have been recorded in recent months, largely coming from hard-to-reach areas for reasons related to insecurity and military operations. From November 2017 to mid-August 2018, Borno and Adamawa states have seen the movement of nearly 190,000 individuals (153,000 IDP new arrivals and 36,000 returnees). This exacerbates a situation where vulnerabilities are already on the rise as a result of the rainy season from June to September and resources are already overstretched.
June to September and resources are already overstretched.
The humanitarian access situation remains challenging in the north-east. Ongoing hostilities in the northern part of Borno State led to an initial, short term downsizing of humanitarian operations in several locations. Humanitarian partners are still assessing the operational environment but have started upscaling again. One of the most affected areas is Kalabalge LGA with Rann as HQ

The vast majority of people currently in Rann, are from Kala, Jilbe, Jarawa and Daima Abori Wards of Kala/Balge LGA. Influx of new IDP arrivals was reported from Bama LGA area (500 since the beginning of January). Women and children are believed to have been worst affected by the conflict. Main communities in Rann are: Ajari, Bulamari, Kelagouru, General hospital and boarding primary school. IDP population are more in number than the host populations (the estimation is given as 80% IDPs, 20% host population), with main host communities been Ajari and Bulamari, while the highest concentration of IDPs are within camps in Kelagouru IDP camp, Boarding primary school camp and General hospital camp. Returnees were population that were displaced in Cameroun, Maiduguri and Ngala, and have returned back to Rann. http://www.wfp.org/content/nigeria-rannkala-balge-rapid-assessment-december-2017 
The following are key situation in Rann.
&#xF0FC;	January there are reported cases of outbreak of AWD in Rann
&#xF0FC;	The location became in accessible by road in August at the peak of the raining season.
&#xF0FC;	In July 2018 the IDPs are evicted form the Boarding and General Hospital camp by the State Government while renovation commence on the locations. 
&#xF0FC;	IOM constructed shelters on stretch of land around the boarding school and the General Hospital.

Key components of the interventions include:
 Provide O amp M to sustain existing water supply facilities to function throughout the year at optimal capacity by conducting routine maintenance and responding promptly to breakdowns, reducing downtime of operations of the facility
 Ensure improved access to safe water supply by daily chlorination and monitoring of free residual chlorine levels at water points.
 Ensure safe water supply from sources to consumption by promoting community level water safety plan.
 Sensitization to mitigate on open defecation practices in the camps/community through participatory approach of latrine maintenance acceptable to the community members.
 Hygiene promotion to promote good hygiene practice, while promoting gender equality, using a participatory approach.
