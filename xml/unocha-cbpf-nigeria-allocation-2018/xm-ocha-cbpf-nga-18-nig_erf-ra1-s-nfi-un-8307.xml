   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Provision of Shelter Assistance to IDP&apos;s and Returnees in Pulka - Gwoza LGA</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In 2017 UNHCR continued to effectively respond to shelter needs of IDP&#x2019;s and returnees in three affected states, Yobe, Adamawa and Borno. A total of 13,477 households of 67,385 individuals was reached with shelter assistance in formal and informal camps, host communities and newly accessible areas. This figure included 290 households of 1,450 returnees provided with shelter repair kits in Pulka in Gwoza local government area. As the number of returns and displacement increases due to military operations in Pulka, there&#x2019;s need to provide shelter related assistance for returnees who are residing in their plots and as well as for host families whose resources have been overstretched., Subsequently acknowledging that the humanitarian situation is likely to further deteriorate UNHCR will also enhance contingency planning through prepositioning of 500 NFI and emergency shelter support to effectively and rapidly respond to emergencies, new displacement as well as complement existing unmet shelter needs.. Despite the achievements in 2017, the transitional needs of returnees, though shaped by very different dynamics, revealed that quite a significant majority of them were living in inadequate shelters. As a result, some returnees in host communities are preferring to settle in camps where the humanitarian community is providing emergency shelters for IDP&#x2019;s in camps. The lack thereof not providing an alternative shelter support for returnees in host community is likely to scale up the number of IDP&#x2019;s hosted within camps, consequently reducing the number of emergency shelters available to cover both the needs of new arrivals and the returnees. Protection assessments conducted in Pulka, revealed that an estimated 3000HH are residing in host communities. Majority of returnees are living in poor conditions and in need of shelter repair kit to assist them re-build their houses which had been destroyed by the Boko Haram insurgency. It also noted that a lack of capital to purchase building materials undermines opportunities for stimulating early recovery in areas of return. 
UNHCR shall build upon progress made in 2017 and proposes to provide:
1.	620 shelter repair kit for IDP&#x2019;s and returnees in Pulka
2.	Preposition 500 emergency shelters and NFI to response to sudden displacement along Maiduguri - Monguno axis.
The UNHCR shelter repair kit aims to complement the returnee&#x2019;s efforts in reconstruction and repair of their shelters. It provides sufficient materials for a substantial beginning, which can be built upon, including also a conditional cash grant to allow some flexibility for IDPs, returnees to supplement according to their specific needs. The UNHCR shelter kit targets beneficiaries who find their houses partially damaged and / or fully damaged and for host families requiring support. The material components were selected based on the need to ensure that the choice of construction method and materials utilized are cost effective, allows for maintenance and are readily available and practical. The kit also provides for a conditional CASH component of NGN 30,000 Naira adequate to cover for the cost labour and molding of mud bricks among other unforeseen needs. The shelter kit solution is centered on the need to assist identified families and communities to rebuild homes that are safe and meet established technical requirements, in an integrated approach centered on the affected families as informed decision-makers. The selection of beneficiaries will be based on a damage assessment undertaken at household level to define various level of damage. Identification and verification of beneficiaries are guided by UNHCR Protection principles and endorsed by community leaders, SEMA officials at LGA areas.</narrative>
