   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Intensified fighting by the military against non-state armed groups (NSAG) continues to force displacements to more secure areas, further eroding IDPs&apos; resilience and efficacy of the WASH response. Per IOM DTM/ETT, Gwoza LGA has received nearly 10,000 new arrivals within a short period of time the &#x2018;Wege Arrival Centre&#x2019; in Pulka town has some 5,500 people who are in urgent need of humanitarian services and assistance. Per  ETT (Report No. 54) covering 13-20 Feb), the transit Camp in Pulka received 506 arrivals, confirming fresh displacements/returns, who joined 2,074 households newly recorded in 3 camps (Damara Arrival Centre, Wege Arrival Centre and Wege Extension).  The total number of new arrival households in Pulka will have reached approximately 2,200 in the next few weeks.  The 2,976 IDP households currently in Pulka (DTM Round XXI) is expected to increase to 3,202 during the project period.  At present, it is estimate that there are 15,777 people in need of NFIs as initial response and/or replenishments in Pulka.  In addition, OXFAM estimate that 1200 IDP households arrived in the Monguno axis including Gajiram in Nganzai LGA are in need of WASH NFIs.

The objective of the project is to facilitate practice of personal hygiene, safe water storage including water treatment at home, and maintain the dignity of women in menstrual hygiene for the 3,400 newly arrived households in Pulka and Gajiram including sustaining safe hygiene practices for 1,002 previously arrived IDPs households in Pulka. Other WASH services are on-going, including support to the management of operation and maintenance of water facilities and environmental cleaning implemented in collaboration with the Government Agency Borno State Rural Water and Sanitation Agency (RUWASA) and OXFAM. OXFAM will provide additional water and sanitation facilities to reduce unmet needs for WASH facilities. UNICEF provided 6,450 WASH kits (1,000 in Pulka through OXFAM 5,000 in Gajigana in Magumeri LGA through IOM and 300 households in Guaram and 150 households in Tungushe through RUWASA.  The project will address unmet needs of newly displaced people who have arrived in Pulka, specifically addressing the critical needs for supplies and commodities for enabling and sustaining personal hygiene. The envisaged outcome is prevention of disease outbreaks such as cholera, diarrhoea and hepatitis, while at the same time maintaining people&#x2019;s dignity. UNICEF will procure and distribute hygiene and dignity kits (1 per household) and provide social mobilization for hygiene promotion in collaboration with other humanitarian actors working on the ground (such as OXFAM and IOM.  The target beneficiaries are:  
a) the current 2,074 HHs plus HH for 506 people who arrived in the past 7 days (total beneficiaries 9,491 people) in 3 camps (2 Arrival Centres: Wege and Damara and Wege Extension camp) plus more yet to arrive: for immediate response in Pulka Town. 
b) up to 1,002 HH of previously arrived IDPs in Wege Camp 2 and Umbazah Rock Side Camp (6,286 beneficiaries) for top ups
c) 1200 new arrivals in Monguno axis, incl. Gajiram.

Each hygiene kit (one for a household) comprises Multipurpose Soaps 125g Laundry detergent/washing powder, 1.5kg Nail Clipper, metal, medium size Torch, handheld, self- powered Clothes line, 10m, with 12 pins Safety pins for clothes, pack of 12 Towel, bath, cotton, 75x130 cm Reusable Menstrual 6-pads women underwear panties 3 (1-large and 2-medium size) plastic kettle 1.5 litres child potty cup, plastic, 500ml Jerry can, w lid, 25 ltr Jerry Can w. Cap,10 ltr Bucket. 20 litres with lid. With the continuing conflict, more arrivals are envisaged, such that UNICEF will rely on other sources to supplement the supplies that will be procured with the NHF Grant.  To close the gap, 3,202 hygiene and dignity kits are required for immediate response for 2,200 newly arrived/arriving households and replenishment for 1,002 previously arrived households</narrative>
