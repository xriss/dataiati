   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Providing protective, inclusive and quality education for conflict affected children in Dikwa LGA of Borno State</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The goal of ROHI&#x2019;s NHF-funded project is to increase access of 5,000 children in Dikwa LGA to protective, inclusive, safe and quality education by 31 October, 2019. The project will particularly target 2,700 female and 2,300 male children in selected communities of Dikwa ward in Dikwa LGA. 
To this end, ROHI has planned to: 

	Rehabilitate 10 temporary learning space (TLS) in camps found in 2 particularly disadvantaged communities in Dikwa, namely Masarmari, and Stadium camp. This will provide classrooms to children formerly congested in few available classrooms and the new arrivals who have arrived Dikwa within the past few months. 
	Construct WASH facilities in schools that will be constructed: the lack of latrines and WASH facilities has been identified as one of the major hindrances to quality and access to education as well as a significant challenge for the protection of girls in schools as detailed above. ROHI will therefore construct 5 gender-segregated toilets alongside hand washing kits and conduct hygiene promotion campaigns in Dikwa. 
	Provide in-service mentorship training to teachers in the targeted schools: the quality of education is extremely poor in the targeted areas in Dikwa. To strengthen the capacity of teachers to provide quality, learner-centred education, positive discipline, protection and psychosocial support to the traumatized children that come to their school, ROHI will facilitate in-service mentorship training for 50 teachers (30male and 20 females due to shortage of female teachers in the area) in the targeted schools. Furthermore, ROHI will work with teachers and SBMC to organise recreational activities that will lead to tournaments in each of the schools that will be supported by this project, to facilitate psycho social activities and to enhance the voice of students in the teaching and learning process.  
	 Conduct back-to-school campaigns through community forums: in addition to improving facilities and the quality of education through the activities detailed above, ROHI will conduct back to school campaigns to increase school enrolment in the LGA, particularly of girls. A significant number of children are still out of school due to insecurity, poverty and lack of community awareness and prioritisation of education and this project will improve access to education for children by targeting out of school children and encouraging them to come back to school. 
	Provide furniture to the temporal learning classrooms as well as the  Shehu Sanda Junior Secondary School at Dikwa. 
	In addition to the above activities, ROHI will distribute teaching and learning materials to the children and teachers and provide incentives to volunteer teachers. ROHI will also conduct an exclusive sensitization session using the female teachers to 200 adolescent girls, to provide guidance on menstrual cycle and personal hygiene. All of these measures will improve the access of 5,000 children in Dikwa to protective, inclusive, safe and quality education. This project will be implemented from 01 December 2018 to 31 October 2019.

This NHF-funded project was designed and will be implemented, monitored and evaluated in close collaboration with targeted children, their teachers and community (particularly School Based Management Committee members) and key stakeholders within existing education management structures. ROHI will work closely with the State Ministry of Education including its subsidiary body (State Universal Basic Education Board) and partners within the Education in Emergencies Cluster to ensure the success and sustainability of this project.</narrative>
