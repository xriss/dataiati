   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Project has an
Anticipated Impact Measurement and Monitoring (AIMM) rating of&#xA0; Satisfactory .    

  &#xA0;    

   Project Outcomes:   &#xA0;Increased access to quality broadband Internet for
individuals and businesses. Based on the standalone capex plan to upgrade
mobile and fixed network, a preliminary assessment suggests &quot; Strong &quot;
Project Outcomes, with a risk of a&#xA0; Moderate &#xA0;rating if savings
are not reinvested or if there is no addition with respect to the current capex
plan. The gap in access to quality broadband Internet in Armenia is expected to
be Medium as, compared to other emerging markets, penetration and download
speed of fixed or mobile broadband is on par with regional or income-group
averages. Without the refinancing component, the Company may not be able to
expand beyond its historical investment trend. The refinancing is expected to
generate savings that, if reinvested, can support network expansion and upgrade
as well as expand international connectivity. The magnitude of these outcomes
will be explored in appraisal and depends on: the degree of commitment to
reinvest the savings, and how these will be invested; and the incremental
nature of this investment compared to the existing capex plan.    

  &#xA0;    

   Market Creation   &#xA0;- Subject to evidence about the expected increase
in high-speed broadband coverage beyond the Company, a preliminary assessment
suggests &quot; Moderate &quot; Contribution to Market Creation. Increased
integration by strengthening international connectivity linkages or enabling
digital platforms may be considered post appraisal. Increased competitiveness
of the market for broadband Internet access by preserving trends in network
upgrade via innovation and competition channels. The market for broadband
Internet access in Armenia is fairly developed with a number of large fixed and
mobile broadband operators providing affordable service within an effective
regulatory framework. However, technological innovation remains limited beyond
the market leader as other operators mainly rely on legacy technologies (3G and
ADSL). By supporting an expansion of 4G and fiber-optic network by the Company,
this investment has the potential to maintain competitive pressure on other
market players to continue upgrading their networks, thereby preserving the
trends in broadband quality improvement in the Armenian broadband sector.</narrative>
