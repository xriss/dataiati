   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Supporting drought affected IDPs to meet their emergency needs through Provision of Emergency Shelter and cash for winterization in Karukh district- Herat Province.</narrative>

  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In accordance to the 2018 AHF 2nd Allocation, rapid displacement caused by drought in western region and contributing to HRP 2018 Strategic Objective 1 (SO1): Save lives in the areas of highest need, Cluster objective 1 and 2, CoAR through implementation of the proposed project intended to support 4,491 families (1742 under emergency shelter and 2749 under winterization component) drought affected IDP families- in Herat province (Karukh district- Shahrak Sabz settlement) to save their lives through meeting their emergency shelter (tents) and winterization (cash 100 $ per family in one installments) needs. It is also considered that some of the beneficiaries might receive both tents and cash for winterization, thus actual number of beneficiaries will be calculated based on the reports, assessments and distribution lists. All proposed activities and locations were coordinated through relevant fora including cluster focal points and AHF partners in the targeted areas (Sharak sabz- Karukh district Herat province) to avoid duplication of services. 
CoAR will ensure that the most vulnerable people in need among drought affected population group prioritized for the emergency shelter and winterization interventions and use the seven specific vulnerability criteria for identifying the extremely vulnerable among the affected population that include female-headed household child-headed household disabled headed household elderly headed household very large family (8 members or more) very poor families families with chronically-ill members or having other pressing vulnerability. 
These seven criteria are adopted by the ES/NFI cluster and to a large extent are in line with vulnerabilities endorsed by other clusters in Afghanistan. CoAR coordinated with other implementing partners about the number of emergency shelters and winterization and that could be released in case of an emergency following procurement and warehouse procedures.
CoAR will hire a team of local expertise who are well trained in CoAR previous programs in the same location. In order to synergize the projects at regional level, CoAR will utilize the existing resources and staff as well, which will help us to effectively manage the project. A total of 1742 emergency shelters are planned to be received from UNHCR and distributed and installed properly by CoAR in Shahrak-Sabz settlement Karukh district, after transparent selection of the right beneficiaries, the most vulnerable families will receive a quality tent and cash for winterization100$ per family in one installment. CoAR will properly coordinate the implementation process with all actors in the area specially with the settlement lead agency (DRC is lead for Shahrak Sabz settlement management) as it was coordinated in the planning stage.
A post distribution monitoring survey will be conducted with a sample of beneficiary households (monitoring will be conducted by male and female monitor who will work as pair). This strategy permits CoAR to ensure collection of dis-aggregated data, reaches out to women., CoAR will ensure that any negative impact that the project could have on women and children will be timely identified and addressed by CoAR project team. The post distribution monitoring survey will be started one month after distribution of cash and tents).</narrative>
