  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Health and Nutrition project for drought affected people in Uruzgan Province is aimed to improve the wellbeing of the general population affected by drought through improved access to basic health and nutrition services targeting IDPs, returnees, and vulnerable host communities in the districts of Uruzgan Province during coming 6 months.

The project will contribute to the SO-1 (Save lives in areas of highest need) that include health cluster and nutrition cluster.

The planned services are:
1.	Winterization support for existing 23 BPHS in 4 priority district that are overloaded with increased number of cases by provision of extra medicines and medical material supplies: Tarinkot, Chorah, Gizab and Khas Uruzgan.
2.	Establishment of 8 Sub Health Center (SHC) in 3 priority districts that provide health and nutrition services: Tarinkot, Chorah and Khas Urozgan.
3.	Establishment of 4 mobile nutrition teams to support existing 14 BPHS health facilities in the districts, which do not have nutrition services: Tarinkot, Dehrawud, Chorah, Gizab and Khas Uruzgan.

The main activities will be:
1.Improve essential live-saving trauma care activities in health facilities including through the provision of rehabilitative care and psychosocial support in emergencies.
2. Provide PHC services in underserved &#x2018;white areas&#x2019; to address the needs of drought affected communities with high concentrations of IDPs due to recent fighting.
3. Provide Integrated Management of Acute Malnutrition (IMAM) for children 6-59 months, pregnant and lactating women.
4. Provide preventative services (Infant and Young Child Feeding promotion and counselling and micronutrient supplementation) for children 6-59 months, pregnant and lactating women.
5. Protection services to women, men, girls and boys referrals and psychosocial support to conflict affected people.

During the needs assessment, AHDS had consultations with the stakeholders the communities, local authorities, NGOs and UN agencies. The numbers, types and location of health facilities were chosen and updated in coordination with the stakeholders. Further inputs and advices of the stakeholders are welcome they will be used for further improvement of the project.

Estimated direct beneficiary is 287,655 people and in the target communities and 54 staff. 

The sub health center (SHC) and mobile nutrition teams (MNT) will have properly trained staff, required equipment, supplies and transportation. 

Community Shuras will be established/used to support the SHCs and MHTs members will be oriented about project objectives and activities, services available, early reporting mechanisms, timely transfer of the victims/survivors, and follow up.

MOU will be signed with the BPHS project for referrals, winterization support and reporting.

AHDS staff will participate in all meetings and other events initiated by Health, Nutrition and Protection clusters in Uruzgan, Kabul and Kandahar as required. 

The project is designed to contribute significantly to gender equality. Data and information will be segregated gender and age wise to ensure a good analysis of outputs and outcomes based on gender aspects.

MoPH national waste management and infection prevention policies ensure minimizing environmental hazard. The services and staff will be managed in a very user friendly manner to avoid any direct or indirect harm. 

The total staff will be 54 including project manager, nutrition supervisor, admin and finance officer, logistic officer and support staff in the office as well as 48 staff in the 8 SHCs and MNTs. Each SHC is planned to have midwife, nurse, vaccinator, nutrition counsellor and guard/cleaner. The MNTs will have female nutrition counsellor with her Mahram. 

The total required budget is USD 376,000 including 260,000 for health (69%) and 116,000 (31%) for nutrition services.

Exit: AHDS will advocate for continuation of the services by BPHS.</narrative>
