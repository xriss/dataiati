   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Timely life-saving ES  NFI assistance to people newly displaced and affected by conflict in Uruzgan</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In accordance with the CHF 1st Standard Allocation Strategy of 2018, and HRP 2018-2021 Strategic Objective 1 (save lives in the areas of highest need) and ESampNFI Outcome 1.5 (IDP, returnee, refugee and non-displaced conflict-affected women, men and children of all ages are protected from the elements and exposure through safe emergency shelter which reduces the likelihood of disease and death), Cordaid proposes to assist 8,400 direct beneficiaries with double counting and 7,000 without double counting in hard to reach Tarinkot district in Uruzgan, providing cash for rent to 1,400 people, cash for shelter repair/ upgrades to 2,100 people and cash for Non Food Items (NFIs) to 4,900 people.
Uruzgan is one of the least developed provinces of Afghanistan. Because of its geographic strategic importance to both the Government of Afghanistan (GoA) and Opposition Forces (OF), fighting has been on-going since 2016, causing (multiple) displacements in the province. Because of its relative safety, Tarinkot has attracted the majority of the displaced. Based upon Department of Refugees and Repatriation (DoRR) Uruzgan&#x2019;s information approximately 30,000 &#x2013; 40,000 IDPs are living in Tarinkot District.
The proposed intervention has been designed based on gaps and needs identified through Cordaid&#x2019;s recent gender sensitive multi-sectoral rapid needs assessment conducted in the district in December 2017, using households (HH) survey, (HEAT), Focus Groups Discussions (FDGs) and Key Informant Interviews (KIIs) and observations by the assessment team. Market assessments carried out by Cordaid in December 2017 showed that markets are functional and shelters can be rented as well. Therefore the proposed modality of the intervention is cash, which is in line with the HRP. In summary respondents prioritized NFIs (kitchen equipment, fuel, warm clothes and blankets) and shelter support as rent increased by 70 - 90% and many houses have been badly damaged (in some areas up to 90% of the houses) and people lack the resources to carry out the repairs. Respondents also mentioned the need for food (situation was stressed or worse and the lack of food stocks was also high with 59% mentioning that they don&#x2019;t have food stocks) and WASH (open defecation is widely practiced). However, WASH will be covered by another organization with OFDA funding and Food will be included in Cordaid ECHO HIP 2018 Multi-Purpose Cash (MPC) assistance application.
In response to the immediate Shelter and NFIs needs of newly and prolonged IDPs and people affected by conflict in Tarinkot district, Cordaid together with its local implementing partner Rural Rehabilitation Association Afghanistan (RRAA) will distribute cash for rent, cash for repair and cash for NFIs, endorsed by the cluster. Cash will be distributed to beneficiaries through mobile Hawala. For the distribution of the cash, the ESampNFI cluster and the CampVWG standards will be strictly followed. Cordaid will use &#x2018;mobile&#x2019; cash. Selected beneficiaries will receive rent assistance of AFN 5,000 per HH per month, for a period of 3 months and shelter repair/upgrade beneficiaries will receive AFN 20,500 per HH in 2 installments, they will also receive the technical assistance and training from a Cordaid and RRAA engineer. Selected beneficiaries for NFI assistance will receive a one off amount of AFN 6,000 per HH. Every cash distribution will be followed by a PDM and a complaint and feedback mechanism will be established, in accordance with Cordaid&#x2019;s guidelines. For beneficiary selection a beneficiaries selection committee will be formed and household will be assessed in accordance with set criteria through HEAT. 
Cordaid will coordinate with APA  (Afgan Planning Agency) a local NGO, who is proposing similar activities in Tarinkot  district to avoid duplication by forming joint beneficiaries selection committees or work in different areas. In high needs areas, Cordaid and APA will complement each other&#x2019;s work</narrative>
