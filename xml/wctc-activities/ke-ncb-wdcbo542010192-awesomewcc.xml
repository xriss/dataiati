      <narrative xml:lang="EN">Limited capacity on disability issue in regards to WwDs among media personnel. Most media present WwDs as objects of pity, are rarely seen, and rarely portrayed as persons with opinions on news beyond disability topics. The journalists treat gender and disability stories as hard to sell. Yet the industry could play a central role in attitude and policy change.</narrative>

      <narrative xml:lang="EN">Our baseline recorded the need for Awareness Raising and Civic Education training for WwDs. WwDs identified barriers of knowledge of all of their rights, confidence, and ability to organize for a campaign or advocacy.

 
In addition, WwDs are not able to make a distinction between their rights as persons with disabilities and their rights as women.

 

The WwDs will be mobilized around their disability rights, electoral rights, general knowledge of their rights as citizens of Kenya, rights in terms getting justice in case of violence. Civic education focuses mainly on role of WwDs participation in decision making processes e.g budgetary processes;civic education also touches on governance,participation in political leadership e.t.c.

 

The targeted Women with Disabilities are existing members and new ones who are not necessarily WCC members; they are leaders of Persons with Disability Organizations, they are friends of WCC who have helped in implementation of other projects; they are also WwDs organizations or individuals we have been referred to by partners.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">755 women + 250 men. 755 WWDs in total:  750 WwDs from civic education and awareness raising meetings; plus 5 WwDs from multi-sectoral training. 

Note: Not included in this number are 102 WWDs from legal clinics and 40 WwD paralegals, because we cannot be sure of double-counting with other activities; and 40 Resource Persons are already included within the 750 WwD number).

Participants&apos; knowledge of their rights was made, their role in decision making processes, the importance for them engaging meaningfully in women movements. We measured the level of increase in knowledge by finding out expectations before training and evaluation at the end of training. We also measured this by asking questions in regard to training content and having one-on-one conversations with participants during breaks.

We wanted to ensure we have representation of men in our meetings so that we are not talking to ourselves. We will reduce the number of men in the coming year to ensure we meet the target of WwDs.

We are targeting 800 Wwds, the remaining will be 100 men with/without disabilities and 100 women without disabilities.

We will continue with the target of 1000 people overall.</narrative>
