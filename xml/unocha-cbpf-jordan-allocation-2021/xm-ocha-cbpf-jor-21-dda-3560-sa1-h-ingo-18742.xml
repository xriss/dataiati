   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Ensuring uninterrupted access to quality sexual and reproductive health services in Irbid and Azraq hospitals.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Since 2009, IMC has been operational in Irbid governorate and its surrounding areas, including Ramtha, Ajlon Hakama, Barabusieh, and Sarih areas, as well as Jerash governorate, providing Health, Mental Health, Psychosocial Support, and Child Protection case management services. In September 2018, IMC, through complementary funds, commenced Sexual Reproductive Health (SRH) activities in Irbid Specialty Hospital (ISH) to address the needs of female refugees residing in the northern governorates. Between 1st September 2018 and 30th April 2021, IMC recorded 9,972 admissions and 8,197 deliveries. Similarly, since 2014, IMC has also played a fundamental role in the provision of health care support in Azraq camp running the only hospital within a camp of 42,681 residents (49.5% female, 50.5% male). In November 2015, with the support of UNHCR and UNFPA, IMC commenced operations as lead agency of Azraq camp hospital. Since commencement of operations within the facility, IMC has ensured implementation of activities via multiple sources of funding, including UNICEF, UNHCR, JHF, DFAT and ECHO.

The necessity for SRH services is further emphasized by the number of girls and young women reached who were under the age of 18. From 1st January 2020 to 30th April 2021, IMC in Irbid supported 275 deliveries, 49 gynecological procedures, 2,217 ANC, 779 PNC, and 215 family planning consultations. In Azraq, IMC supported 32 deliveries and 137 ANC and 36 PNC consultations. During the same period, for those under the age of 18, IMC conducted 19 abortions to save the life of each girl (1 in Azraq and 18 in Irbid) and, for those aged 18, IMC conducted 221 abortions (150 Azraq and 71 in Irbid) to save the life of each woman.

However, as a result of funding reductions from key donors such as BPRM, ECHO and DFAT (due to internal prioritization of funding towards Syria and the COVID-19 pandemic), IMC has experienced a significant reduction in funding for both Irbid and Azraq hospital facilities and is, therefore, currently requiring urgent financial support to ensure uninterrupted provision of care.

Under the proposed intervention, IMC will continue to build upon comprehensive Sexual and Reproductive health (SRH) services established in Azraq and Irbid. The SRH services will include: antenatal care (ANC)/postnatal care (PNC), health education (on topics such as early and exclusive breastfeeding, danger signs during pregnancy and in newborns, importance of immunization, among others), family planning, safe delivery services, medical and surgical management of obstetric and gynecological issues, and the clinical management of rape, as well as comprehensive emergency obstetric and neonatal care (CEmONC). 

These services will utilize the pre-existing hospital structures inside both Irbid hospital and Azraq camp, and will operate in synergy and coordination with other services and departments inside both facilities. Management of obstetric and newborn emergencies will be undertaken within these hospitals. Women and girls requiring advanced care, as well as high-risk cases, will be referred for further management to other facilities. IMC will provide the services in line with 3RP Health Sector requirements and Sphere&#x2019;s Core Humanitarian Standards. 

IMC will continue to adopt an SRH social protection lens to female reproductive health, ensuring the unique health and protection needs of female refugees and vulnerable host community members are met (adhering to the Sphere Protection Principles). For example, all activities will be integrated within IMCs&#x2019; existing MHPSS and Protection interventions, providing referrals to these services where needed. Beneficiaries will be identified on the basis of need with no selection criteria on the basis of age, ethnic origin, gender and other variables, such as disability.</narrative>
