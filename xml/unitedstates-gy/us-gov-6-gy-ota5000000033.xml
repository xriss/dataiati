   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In 2017, during the first year of the project with the Guyana Revenue Authority (GRA), advisors provided guidance in building robust anti-corruption measures, implementing HR reforms, organizational restructuring, and developing capacity for basic and specialized industry audits, in preparation for significant offshore petroleum reserves coming online. The GRA has established a Special Investigations Unit, hired new investigative staff, and agreed to implement a related action plan, organizational structure, and draft background investigations procedures manual. The GRA is implementing a new organizational structure that includes functional descriptions and position descriptions. The GRA agreed to establish a new petroleum revenue audit unit and approved OTA&#x2019;s proposal outlining the mission statement, organizational structure, staffing and action plan. Work in helped the GRA further solidify reforms in progress. A draft petroleum revenue audit manual and related implementation procedures is helping to prepare the staff at the new petroleum audit unit to begin more sophisticated audit work. (EGCI funding for the petroleum audit work concluded in October 2018.) Introduction of GRA-wide performance management and evaluation systems, leadership training for managers and other critical HR measures support a revitalized human resources organization. A combination of on-the-job and classroom based training at the new Special Investigation Unit (SIU) helps ensure investigators have the skills to effectively implement anti-corruption measures critical to boosting public confidence in the GRA. In 2019, work will include delivery of an extensive classroom-based and on-the-job training program for new recruits at the nascent petroleum audit section, beginning with basic audit and including petroleum industry practices. In HR, OTA will provide guidance on the introduction of GRA-wide performance management and evaluation systems, deliver leadership training for managers and supervisors, and help rewrite job descriptions and other critical HR measures, to support ambitious hiring plans. In anti-corruption, OTA will deliver advanced classroom-based and on-the-job training at the SIU, to equip investigators with the skills to effectively implement anti-corruption measures and boost public confidence in the GRA. OTA will also provide guidance on the implementation of a new organizational structure and the creation of a second deputy position to ensure effective management of these critical and simultaneous reforms.. Work with the Guyana Revenue Authority (GRA) in the following areas: 1. Build capacity in the Audit department to audit specialty sectors, such as banks, insurance, mining, and construction as preparation for the oil and gas industry; 2. Assist the Internal Affairs function in enhancing capacity to detect and deter corruption; and 3. Build on their first draft Strategic Plan, enhance capacity in planning and management.

OTA continued providing guidance on the implementation of a new organizational structure to ensure effective management of these critical and simultaneous reforms. Work in these areas will continue in 2020 and beginning this year, OTA will provide guidance in building capacity to detect, deter, and prosecute tax fraud and tax evasion within the Law Enforcement &amp; Investigation Division and Audit Division.. The goal of this project is to build the capacity of the Guyana Revenue Authority (GRA) to manage expected increases in domestic resources related to the burgeoning petroleum industry. Project components will focus on: 1) strengthening audit capacity; 2) implementing a petroleum revenue audit unit; 3) establishing a merit-based human resources system to improve recruitment and retention; 4) building a new organizational structure to balance the simultaneous tasks of implementing reforms and increasing workload; 5) establishing a robust internal investigation function to reduce corruption and safeguard revenue; 6) developing a comprehensive tax fraud, tax evasion program, and criminal investigation program; and 7) maximizing revenue through an improved tax debt collection process..

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">Guyana&apos;s economic growth, resulting from the expansion of its mining sectors, has not resulted in improved social and political development indicators. Challenges to Guyana&apos;s development persist, including weak infrastructure, deficiencies in its anti-money laundering and anti-terrorist financing regime, persistent crime, limited law enforcement capacity, drug trafficking, continued out-migration, and the ongoing threat from the HIV/AIDS epidemic. U.S. assistance to Guyana focuses on strengthening democratic institutions, improving citizen security, combatting illicit trafficking, and mitigating the impact of the HIV/AIDS epidemic through the promotion of local, sustainable country programs. Regional programs will advance citizen security through the Caribbean Basin Security Initiative in order to complement and enhance U.S. bilateral assistance.</narrative>
