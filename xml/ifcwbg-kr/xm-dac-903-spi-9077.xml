Description of Company and Purpose of Project    	The Company manufactures various types of power cables: extra high voltage (EHV), high voltage, and medium voltage.  Cables are used for transmission and distribution of electricity.  The largest purchaser is KEPCO.  The Company currently has one VCV and one catenary vulcanizing line (CCV) and plans to install the second VCV line in view of growing domestic demand in EHV cable.            IFC will play an essential role in assisting the Korean manufacturer to produce value-added power cables to meet domestic demand.  The Company is internationally competitive and has technical assistance contracts with leading cable manufacturers from Japan and Switzerland.  Its world class production facility achieves competitive productivity.      Environmental Category and Issues    	This is an environmental review category B project.

Air emissions from this facility will be negligible, light oil for boilers is stored in an underground tank connected directly to the boilers, and emissions of particulate matter, sulfur dioxide and nitrous oxides will fall within World Bank Group guidelines.  No process effluents are generated by the plant and sanitary effluent is treated before discharging to the public sewer. There are existing systems for the use, storage and disposal of solvents and hazardous wastes, and material handling is undertaken in a rational and planned manner.  The majority of solid waste (PVC, polyethylene, copper, aluminum and domestic waste) is recycled by professional companies under contract to the sponsor.  There is a committee for Health and Safety which meets on a regular basis with direct links to senior management.
