   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Summary of Project Information (SPI)       Project Name    Korea  Halim              Region    East Asia and Pacific         Sector    Food and Agribusiness      Project No009111   Projected Board DateAugust 24, 1998   Company NameHalim    Technical Partner and/or Major Shareholders    Halim is today Korea&apos;&apos;s largest and most efficient broiler producer, having some of the best production facilities in the world.  With a workforce of over 1,000, the Company is the only fully integrated broiler producer in Korea, currently processing 270,000 chickens a day. Halim has 23% of  Korea&apos;&apos;s broiler market compared to 6% for its nearest competitor, and its brand is well recognized in Korea. The Company was founded by Mr. Hong-Kuk Kim, in 1978. Mr. Kim successfully opened up the Company in 1991 through a private issue. In July 1997, the Companys stock became publicly listed.  Mr. Kim and his immediate family retain 38% of the shares and full control of the Company.     Project Cost including proposed IFC investment    IFC is considering a US$20 million investment in the form of equity and quasi equity.     Location of project and Description of site    The company is located in Iksam, in the Cholla Province, about 300Km. south of Seoul. All its farms and production plants are located within the North Cholla Province.     Description of Company and Purpose of Project    Halim has asked IFC to assist it in restructuring and strengthening its balance sheet by injecting US$20 million in equity/quasi-equity to refinance short term and medium term loans.  Due to the ongoing economic crisis and liquidity crunch, the Company has been obliged to rely on expensive short and medium term instruments to meet its working capital needs and refinance maturing loans. The Company is a success story in the Cholla region, an agricultural region traditionally deprived of investment funds by previous governments or foreign companies (the current President Mr. Kim Dae-Jung is from this area). Its network of more than six hundred loyal farmers (outgrowers) have benefited from Halims success deriving their primary or steady second income. The project is in line with IFCs strategy for Korea in that it will support the financial restructuring of a medium size enterprise, negatively affected by the on-going economic crisis. IFCs participation will also be crucial to entice other parties to inject additional equity to bring Halims debt to manageable levels.     Environmental Category and Issues    This is a category B project according to IFCs environmental review procedure because specific impacts may result which can be avoided or mitigated by adhering to generally recognized performance standards, guidelines or design criteria.  The review of the project consisted of appraising technical and environmental information submitted by the project sponsor, and the technical appraisal and site review completed by IFCs Technical and Environment staff.  The following potential environmental, health and safety impacts of the project were analyzed: air emissions and wastewater effluents; solid waste management and disposal; handling and storage of hazardous materials; use of CFCs in refrigeration equipment; hygiene practices in all facilities; fire protection and emergency response; and general worker health and safety. Based on its review of available information regarding potential environmental impacts and proposed mitigation measures, IFC concludes that Halims proposed project will meet World Bank environmental, health and safety policies and guidelines and requirements of the Government of Korea.    The  is  from the Public Information Center.       Date SPI sent to PIC     July 20, 1998      This Summary of Project Information is prepared and distributed to the public in advance of consideration of the proposed transaction by the Corporations Board of Directors.  It is provided for the purpose of enhancing the transparency of IFCs activities and should not be construed as presuming the outcome of IFC Board consideration.
