   <narrative xml:lang="EN">El Salvador II - Human Capital Project: This project will focus on preparing the people of El Salvador to better meet the demands of a global economy. MCC will invest in approximately 400 schools in the coastal zone of El Salvador, focusing on grades 7-12, where dropout rates are the highest. MCC will also support reforms in technical and vocational education and training to ensure an integrated system that better matches the skills delivered by education providers with the demands of the private labor market. Through improving the quality of education in El Salvador, students will graduate with skills that better meet the needs of employers.</narrative>
