   <narrative xml:lang="EN">El Salvador II - Business Development Services project: MCC will support the Government of El Salvador in its effort to eliminate and streamline regulations targeted towards improving the investment climate for the private sector. By supporting the implementation of El Salvador&apos;s public private partnership law, the compact will catalyze large-scale investments in key public services required for private sector-led growth. MCC and the Government will also co-sponsor the El Salvador Investment Challenge, an innovative grant facility designed to efficiently and transparently allocate scarce public resources and encourage private investment in the trade sector. With matching investments from the private sector and the Government of El Salvador, the challenge facility will leverage at least five dollars for every dollar of MCC&apos;s investment.</narrative>
