  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">MCC and the Government of El Salvador entered into force a compact agreement on September 9, 2015, to invest up to $277 million in regulatory reforms, education, and logistical infrastructure, with the goal of promoting economic growth and private investment in the country.

Over five years, the project trained over 4,500 teachers, school directors, and education specialists; constructed 32 schools; and launched El Salvador?s first two Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs).

Compact implementation was heavily impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, however, in a testament to El Salvador?s commitment to country ownership, the government has agreed to continue the funding and implementation of the compact?s projects.</narrative>
