  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">At the heart of the compact is a commitment from the Government of El Salvador to partner with the private sector to stimulate more investment and to prioritize and implement reforms needed to increase the effectiveness of key regulations and institutions. The compact also aims to improve the quality of education and skills development for Salvadoran students, thus increasing the labor productivity of future workers. Lastly, it will improve critical portions of the logistical corridor at the border crossing with Honduras at El Amatillo and a section connecting Zacatecoluca with El Salvador&apos;s international airport. The Government of El Salvador has committed to contribute $88.2 million on top of MCC&apos;s investment, constituting a combined total of $365.2 million.</narrative>
