   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Emergency Livestock Feed Support for Drought Affected and vulnerable Communities Living in  Guji Zone, Oromia Region</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project intervention area is located in Gorodola and Liben  woredas of Guji zone in Oromia region which is recurrently affected by drought caused as a result of failure/below normal performance of rainy season. Failure of seasonal rainfalls creates shortage of water for both human and livestock. The performance of the last consecutive rainy seasons (Haggaya and Genna)  in Guji zone was reported as variable, uneven and mostly erratic. The report from the Guji zone emergency task force pre-harvest assessment indicated that the amount of the rainfall and distribution was well below the expected average across the woredas and kebeles of the zone and especially in the pocket areas of Liben, Gorodola, Gumi Eldalo, Agewayu and Sebaboru woredas. 
The report from the Multi agency Belg/Genna assessment (conducted between may 22nd and 26th, 2017) also shows that the rainfall onset in low land areas of the zone was late by one week and the cessation was early by two weeks, the distribution was erratic and the amount/performance was extremely poor.  It also states that, the major weather adverse condition was the long dry spell condition in between the rains. This has resulted in a 40% loss in crop production and above 81,000 heads of livestock deaths due to lack of pasture and water.
Moreover, the recent situational report, issued in July 2017,  of Guji zone DRM Office states Livestock pasture and water availability is much below normal in the lowland woredas of Guji zone. Ponds and temporary rivers are currently without or with little amount of water to support the community until next season. The rain was not favourable for the pasture regeneration in particular for the grazers while there is relative improvement for the browsers.  
According to the report, livestock feed (particularly hay and concentrate) are required for 80,000 livestock in the zone and more than 50,000 animals need veterinary assistance in terms of emergency drugs and other medicaments.  
COOPI, as one of the humanitarian and development partner in the area, has already secured a fund from the 1st round allocation for a similar livestock feed provision in the same woredas targeting 850HHs. The project has already been started. Government bureaucratic procedures such as project appraisal and signing of MoU is underway. Selection of beneficiaries and procurement procedures for the purchase of the animal feed are under preparation. 
This project  is prepared in response to the prevailing drought in the area to reach more beneficiaries  through the provision of animal feed for core breeding animals, as the demand is growing. The overall objective of the project is preventing the deterioration of the food security situation of the targeted HHs living in Guji zone of Oromia region. The outcome of the project is protecting the core breeding animals of the (agro)- pastoralists through the provision of supplementary animal feed. 
This project aims to ensure the availability of feed mainly concentrate and hay to selected highly vulnerable HHs in Gorodola and Liben woredas. A total of 850 HHs  will be targeted under this project. And 3,400 heads of livestock (1800 shoats and 1800 cattle) i.e.2 shoats and 2 cattle per HH will be supplied with animal feed a period of sixty days</narrative>
