   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Responding to the critical needs of south Sudanese refugee in Assosa region, Ethiopia, through emergency water intervention</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">According to UNHCR, Ethiopia hosts 843,742 refugees as of 30 June 2017 . South Sudanese refugees form the largest refugee population group and are accommodated in existing as well as new refugee camps located in Gambella and Benishangul-Gumuz (Assosa) Regions. Most of the South Sudanese refugees arrived after the outbreak of violence in South Sudan at the end of 2013 and in September 2016. Specifically, renewed intensification of fighting in South Sudan since June 2017 has brought approximately 2,502 new refugees per month, with an average of 4,046 new refugees per day. As of 31st August 2017, Ethiopia hosted 388,086 South Sudanese refugees and asylum-seekers in Ethiopia (combined Gambella and Assosa camps), including 44,438 new arrivals that originate mostly from Upper Nile, Jonglei and Unity states (majority of women and children) since 1st January 2017 (UNHCR Ethiopia Update 31 Aug 2017). More arrivals are is anticipated in Gambella and Assosa as violence continues to limit humanitarian access across South Sudan and prompts  South Sudanese to flee to neighboring countries. (South Sudan-Crisis, USAID Fact Sheet #9, FY 2017 July 10, 2017). 
Benishangul-Gumuz (Assosa) Region is home to one of the oldest refugee camp hosting refugees from Sudan and other countries still in operation, Sherkole, which was opened in early1990&#x2019;s. Consequently, three additional camps were established in different locations around Assosa: Bambassi, Tongo and Tsore camps. In response to the increasing number of south Sudanese refugees arriving (16,274 arrived in March 2017), UNHCR and ARRA have established one more additional new camp, called Gure Shembolla camp, which is located along the Assosa Tongo road. The IRC has been active in Benishangul-Gumuz Region since 2002, when it began implementing water supply improvement interventions for Sudanese refugees in Sherkole Camp, and then has taken on the full WASH mandate in Sherkole, Tsore and Tongo camps as well as in the newly established Gure Shembola Camp. The IRC has responded to WASH needs in Gure Shembola through a variety of activities, including the installation amp operation of emergency water treatment plant, semi-permanent distribution system and sanitation facilities for the refugees, as well as hygiene promotion activities implemented through community health clubs, house to house sensitization, sanitation campaigns, solid waste management, etc.
This project aims to address the safe water supply increasing needs in Gure Shembola camp through improving the capacity of the existing water supply distribution system in Gure-Shembola expand to new areas to meet both refugee and host community needs and upgrade the system with more durable and permanent structures. The current water system was design as a temporary solution during the initial phase as an emergency response. As the camp settles into a more permanent site, the water system structure also has to adapt to meet higher demands.</narrative>
