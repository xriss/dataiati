   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Responding to the critical needs of South Sudanese refugees in Gambella Region, Ethiopia, through Sanitation and Hygiene interventions</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">According to UNHCR, Ethiopia hosts 783,340 refugees as of 31 October 2016. South Sudanese refugees form the largest refugee population group and are accommodated in existing as well as new refugee camps located in Gambella and Benishangul-Gumuz (Assosa) Regions. Most of the South Sudanese refugees arrived after the outbreak of violence in South Sudan at the end of 2013. However, a new outbreak of violence in South Sudan triggered a new influx of refugees in September 2016.
As of 6 December 2016, Ethiopia hosted around 331,000 South Sudanese refugees and asylum-seekers in Ethiopia (combined  Gambella and Assosa camps), including 46,062 new arrivals that originate mostly from Upper Nile, Jonglei and Unity states (majority of women and children) since 3 September 2016 (UNHCR Ethiopia Update 18 Oct 2016). More arrivals are is anticipated in Gambella and Assosa as violence continues to limit humanitarian access across South Sudan and prompts  South Sudanese to flee to neighboring countries (South Sudan-Crisis, USAID Fact Sheet #2, FY 2017 December 2, 2016)
Gambella Region is home to the oldest refugee camp hosting South Sudanese refugees still in operation, Pugnido I, which was opened in 1993. From 2013 - 2015, five camps were established in different locations around Gambella: Okugo, Pugnido II, Tierkidi, Kule and Jewi camps. One additional camp (Nguenyyiel) was established in November 2016 in response to the recent influx of refugees and takes the total number of refugee camps in Gambella to seven. The IRC has been active in Gambella Region since 2012, when it began implementing water supply improvement interventions for Sudanese refugees in Pugnido I Camp. The IRC then took on the full WASH mandate in Pugnido I camp in 2013. Since the, the madate has expanded to providing WASH services in two  more refugee camps: Pugnido II and Tierkidi, as well as managing the water supply in Kule camp. The IRC has responded to WASH needs through a variety of activities, including the construction of a range of water supply systems and sanitation facilities for refugees, the installation amp operation of water treatment systems, and the distribution of water treatment chemicals and jerry cans for safe water collection and household storage, as well as hygiene promotion activities implemented through community health clubs, house to house sensitization, sanitation campaigns, solid waste management, etc.
This project aims to address the sanitation and hygiene needs in two targeted refugee camps: Pugnido I and Pugnido II, through the construction of household latrines amp solid waste disposal pits, and the implementation of hygiene promotion activities. Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) services are at sub-standard level in the camps, and result in increased risk of communicable diseases, such as Hepatitis E, and diarrheal diseases, including Acute Watery Diarrhea (AWD). 
Pugnido I Camp is located in Goge Woreda it is situated 3km outside of Pugnido Town, 150km from the regional town of Gambella via a rough amp unpaved road, and 850km from Addis Ababa through the town of Gambella. Pugnido II camp is located in the same woreda of Goge and situated about 12 km from Pugnido town. 
Security remains a concern particularly in Gambella where major incidents occurred since early 2016, making access to refugee compass more challenging. The mixed ethnic composition, with Nuer refugees hosted in areas inhabited by Ethiopian Anuak creates further tensions, particularly when taking into account the historical context of tensionand conflict between both ethnic groups</narrative>
