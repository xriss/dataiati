   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Emergency Nutrition Response in Five Lowland  Woredas of Bale Zone , Oromiya Region, Ethiopia</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In 2017, an estimated 303,000 SAM cases and 2.7 million MAM cases* (1,371,235 MAM children and 1,372,758 PLWs) are expected to be critically affected and require emergency humanitarian assistance across Ethiopia. These estimated cases consider vulnerable woredas countrywide, though the prioritization for further response will focus on areas identified as highly vulnerable in priority 1 and priority 2 at the very least. In addition, infant and young child feeding in emergencies (IYCF-E) response will be required for 1 million children through their caretakers and to 550,000 pregnant and lactating women. Responses will have be designed to populations with special needs including the elderly, children with disabilities, women of childbearing age and teenage mothers in particular.Because of the prolonged drought, Bale Zone lowland woredas are in dire need of immediate emergency nutrition responses vital to save lives and protect livelihoods. Save the Children(SC) is proposing a nutrition program that will include early detection, management and treatment of Severe Acute Malnutrition and Moderate Acute Malnutrition (MAM) in PLW and children. In this project, Save the Children will implement TSFP support in Hotspot 1 Woredas in collaboration with WFP and Woreda Health and DPPO through the provision of energy and nutrient supplements. Save the Children will be actively engaged in supporting routine Community Health Day (CHD) and monthly screening to maintain smooth referral linkages among Targeted Supplementary feeding (TSFP), Outreach Therapeutic Feeding Program (OTP), Stabilization center (SC) and to improve the nutritional status of drought-affected communities. SC will employ community mobilization and conduct regular joint supportive supervision, on the job training and support on supply chain management and medical supplies through the provision of logistic support. The project will further focus on specific support to address mothers facing difficulties with breastfeeding, enhancing the capacity of health facilities and woredas to manage nutrition emergencies through coordination support, provision of regular program supervision, formal training on CMAM and IYCF&#x2013;E and on-the-job training and mentoring. Consolidating IEC/BCC activities by producing and distributing culturally sensitive counselling materials in coordination with FMOH/Regional Health Bureau. The project will incorporate provision jerry can amp water treatment chemicals to family of their children discharged from OTPs/SCs. In meantime also equipped selected heath facilities which not access potable water in order to delivered a hygienic nutrition services in the nutritional rehabilitation centers. Acutely malnourished children and moderately malnourished pregnant and lactating mothers (PLW) (and those at risk of this) will be priority targets for lifesaving health and nutrition activities. SAM children with medical complications will be referred to nearby stabilization centers that will be strengthened through capacity building of HWs, while MAM PLW will be referred to appropriate nearby treatment services. Children, PLW and communities affected by disease outbreaks will also be supported through enhancing lifesaving medical services. Health staff in health posts and health centers (HWs and HEWs) and HDA at community level will also benefit through capacity building. SC will be actively engaged in maintaining smooth referral linkage between OTP, SC and conduct community mobilization to strengthen the linkages. As part of making sure that beneficiary targetings are properly conducted and to ensure that limited resources are used appropriately, SC will continuously support monitoring the quality of actual measurement activities including but not limited to&#x2013; measuring weights, heights, MUAC, and edema. The project is designed to run for a period of 6 months  with 8 months is the eligibility period.</narrative>
