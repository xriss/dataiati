   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Following the recent call for proposal by EHF, Save the Children is proposing emergency nutrition responses in three Woreda of SNNP region namely Halaba, Mareko and Alle Woredas where recent project of Save the Children has phased out recently. The humanitarian situation in the mentioned Woredas is not showing any signs of improvement since last May 2017. The mentioned Woredas are known for recurrent drought attack which resulted acute food security, critical water shortage, and weak health service coverage. According to the June, 2017 hotspot classification three of the proposed woredas are categorized as priority one (P1) where there is a high need of humanitarian assistance including support on the management of acute malnutrition. Save the Children has been implementing a one-year emergency nutrition project in Halaba Woreda from June, 2016 to May, 2017 for a total of 12 months and from October, 2017 to May, 2017 in Mareko and Alle Woredas. Despite the continual interventions in the areas, the reports still show that the numbers for Sever Acute Malnutrition (SAM) and Moderate Acute Malnutrition (MAM) cases are still high indicating that the need for further intervention. Save the Children proposes to implement a nutrition emergency intervention to reduce the morbidity and mortality of infants and young children, pregnant and lactating women due to deterioration of the nutritional status and lack of safe drinking water among severely drought-affected communities in Segen Guraghe and Halaba Zones of the SNNPR. The project will have a duration of six months with a total budget of $ 324,000. The project aims to improve the nutritional status of drought-affected communities, through the provision of life -saving and protective nutritional services. Save the Children will implement the intervention focusing on the Community-based Management of Acute Malnutrition (CMAM) for the detection and rehabilitation of severe acute malnutrition (SAM) cases among children 0-59 months of age. The project will also support optimal Infant and Young Child Feeding in Emergencies (IYCF-E) practices of infants and young children under-24 months and supporting the nutritional needs and care of pregnant and lactating women. This project will give emphasis on community mobilization, building relationships and foster active participation of the community in order for achieve the project objective. The project will use the existing health system platform by strengthening the capacity of the government to respond for such types of acute shocks. In health facilities where there are nutritional services such as management of acute malnutrition and integration of IYCF-E, it strengthen the service delivery to the maximum quality by provision of regular technical and logistics support. In others where there is no systemic CMAM intervention, the project will establish and strengthen outpatient therapeutic program (OTP) and Stabilization Center (SC) sites as part of availing the basic nutritional supports for the affected community. The planned nutritional interventions include regular support for community mobilization and screening, establishing and strengthening OTP and SC centers for the treatment of acute malnutrition, strengthen referral linkages between CMAM components support, lactation support in delivery and infant care units in collaboration with Woreda Administration, Woreda Health Bureau, Woreda Disaster Prevention and Preparedness Office and World Food Program. In addition, the project will also provide capacity-building activities like regular onsite technical and operational support and case management trainings. Save the Children will support screening activities, ensures that woreda health staff and health development armies are adequately trained on operational guidance of IYCF&#x2013;E Interventions, support the linkage between nutritional program with routine and campaign immunization by covering logistics and mobilization cost.</narrative>
