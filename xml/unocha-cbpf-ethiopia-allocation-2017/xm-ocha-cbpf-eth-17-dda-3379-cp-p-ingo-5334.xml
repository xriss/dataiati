   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Somali regional state is one of the regions significantly affected by the current drought and effects of Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) induced drought as such, most of the Wordas in the region are classified as hotspot priority wordas. The region  currently hosts 397,254 displaced individuals in 59,502 households in 222 sites, out of which 50.2% are male and 49.8% are female, out of the total figure, 64.6% are 18 years old or younger.   5.6 million children and their families remain at risk due to the shortage of food and water, and the risk of disease outbreaks, over two million children are currently malnourished and require urgent nutritional support to enable them to survive this crisis early marriage and child labour are some of the negative coping mechanisms that are being employed during the crisis that increase the risk of violence for boys and girls.  The protection analysis generated from the Meher assessment which is conducted in Somali region  indicate a high prevalence of sexual violence and domestic violence against women and children,  due to cultural beliefs, which is exacerbated by drought and conflict, of which has been underreported.. T here are around 209 reported cases of violence against women and children that occurred at home. This finding also supported by IRC GBV rapid assessment in Fafen zone indicated a  higher prevalence of early/forced marriage within the IDP camps, which was largely the result of    the loss of assets and livelihoods. Young girls are often given to older wealthier men in exchange of money.  
According to the displacement tracking matrix (DTM) for Somali regi 90 sites reported harmful traditional practices and 11 sites showed child protection incidents.   Moreover, the 2017 HRD also stated that during displacement, due to the emergency, the needs of women and girls of reproductive age in terms of safety, security, as well as hygiene are significantly increased, and that pre-existing gender inequalities are exacerbated and thus put women and girls at higher risk of Gender Based Violence (GBV). GBV risks include rape and other sexual violence, abduction, forced marriage, and forced pregnancy. The document also highlights limited access to basic services for the most vulnerable groups, mainly people living with disabilities, the elderly, and Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs).  In addition, the Meher assessment conducted in 2016 also reveals that the most commonly reported child protection risks (reported in more than 50% of assessed woredas across most regions) include children migrating without parents, child marriage, psychosocial distress, and sexual violence against women and girls (including rape) while moving outside their home. These risks are considered to have significantly increased in the last three months . According to the Inter-Agency Protection Field Mission report  and IRC GBV rapid assessment report carried out in March and September 2016 in Fafan zones consecutively, access to basic services is currently inadequate, and the long distances that women and girls have to travel to fetch water and collect firewood is exposing them to various protection risks including sexual violence. Addressing women and girls exposure to the abuse and exploitation will narrow the existing gender gaps across the affected woredas. 
This project aims to address gender based violence and child protection gaps for IDPs and communities  living in drought affected districts (i.e. Gursum and Tuluguled) in Fafen Zone in Somali region through establishment and strengthening of temporary women and children safe spaces for life saving psycho-social support, strengthening referral pathways and community based structures, and curriculum based awareness raising activity to women, children and parents.</narrative>
