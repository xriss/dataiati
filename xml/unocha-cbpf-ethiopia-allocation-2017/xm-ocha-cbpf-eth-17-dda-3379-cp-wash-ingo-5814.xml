   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Emergency Water Trucking in Somali Region</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Project Summary :	The humanitarian situation in Ethiopia remains extreme a complete failure of both rainy seasons (the Gu amp Dyer seasons, 2016) has led to a new onset of drought particularly in Southern and South Eastern parts of Ethiopia, currently affecting 5.6 million people of which over 1.2 million are in the Somali region (HRD 2017). With drought and internal conflict displacing people from their communities, many are currently taking shelter in 222 Internal displaced Population (IDP) sites in the Somali Region (IOM, DTM, 2017). A total of 1.252.070 persons across all nine zones of Somali region are in urgent need of water 100.000 children are out of school 25% of boreholes are not functional and 95% of the surface water sources are currently empty (HRD 2017). 

The action aims to improve access to safe water through emergency water trucking to the drought affected communities and institutions Oxfam plans to reach 141.500 people with emergency water service &#x2013; 5 Lt/p/d for total 45 days. Also 120.000 individuals will be sensitised on hygiene promotion measures with focus on disease outbreak (particularly AWD) including training of community Hygiene Promoters, awareness campaigns, community mobilisation etc. 

The action will be implemented in the areas were Oxfam and its partners are already operating, including in Nogab, Erer, Fafan, Jarar, Korahey and Doolo zones, with a focus on six IDP sites in Jarar, Afder and Doolo Zones. Excluding Fafan, the action will cover at least 3 CTCs/CTUs in each of the targeted zones, therefore a total of 15 CTCs/CTUs will be covered at minimum. In each of the targeted zones, two distribution sites will be identified (subject to change based on AWD reported cases/sites) where 2 Roto tanks (12 in total) will be installed to facilitate safe distribution of water to the end beneficiaries. 

The project will be implemented by Oxfam in grant based partnership with its existing local NGO partners. While the final decision of engaging partner NGOs will depend on the target geography (to be provided by regional water bureau and endorsed by regional WASH cluster) Oxfam intend to partner with Organisation for Welfare and Development Action (OWDA) and Pastoral Concern (PC) in Doolo and Afder Zone.

Once the target areas are finalised for water trucking in consultation with WaSH Cluster and regional government, Oxfam would deploy semi operational approach to start implementation of the project. The semi operational approach means that in some places (Zones), Oxfam is going to have direct implementation (through its own staff) and in other places (Zones), Oxfam will have grant partnership with partners (local NGOs). Grant partnership with partners for their respective target areas will include activity cost (water trucking etc) and support cost (staff salaries, transport cost, MampE, other essential support costs to enable them to implement the project). The partnership with these local NGOs with deep knowledge of the area will help Oxfam safely accomplish the implementation of the project. 

Oxfam&#x2019;s current footprint in Somali region under water trucking initiative includes Doolo, Korahe, Fafan, Jarar, Afder, Nogobo, Erer and Korahey where currently close to 400.000 individuals are being reached through water trucking initiative. As part of Drought response strategy 2017, Oxfam plans to ensure continuous access to safe water for 500.000 individuals in the Somali region, primarily through water trucking with focus on AWD affected areas. Additionally Oxfam plans to continue to provide water to 85 institutions including schools and health facilities. This proposed action will largely complement Oxfam&apos;s existing water trucking initiative, with few other secured funding sources expiring by end of April/early May 2017, therefore will enable Oxfam to maintain the overall target and over the course of the next 30-45 days secure further funding to ensure this life saving activity isn&apos;t int</narrative>
