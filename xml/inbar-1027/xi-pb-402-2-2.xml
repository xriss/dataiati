   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Bamboo was planted in a new area of 140.79 hectares. 846(584M/262F) smallholder farmers planted bamboo in homestead and farm boundaries for resilience benefits. 42.10 hectares of bamboo forests have been undertaken in sustainable harvesting and management practices.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The bamboo seeds of three bamboo species of 60 kg. order procured from India for Kenya and Uganda. Around ~ 3750 hectares of bamboo planted in a new area in Ethiopia under Prime Minister Green Legacy Programme (The program supported seeds; poly tube; nursery tools; training, plantation awareness events to establish a nursery to produce quality planting materials in 6 regions with EEFCC &amp; Agriculture Bureau). 1329 smallholder farmers planted bamboo; overall progress 3614(1750 M/ 1864F) against the target indicator of 10000 smallholder farmers. The 121.94-hectare bamboo firm brought under the sustainable harvesting and management practices overall progress 987.13 hectares and 1683 smallholders benefited(709M/974F) against the indicators 5000 hectare/5000 farmers.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Three site species matching study; 5000 hectare planted; 10000 (7000 M/3000 W) smallholder planted bamboo; 5000 hectares of bamboo forests and farms under sustainable management benefiting 5000(50%) women smallholder farmer; three bamboo agro-forestry model validated. 

Three site-species matching studies are ongoing in collaboration with Ethiopia Environment Forest Research Institute(EEFRI), Kenya Forestry Research Institute(KEFRI) and National Forestry Resources Research Institute(NaFORRI). The objective of the research is to study and validate the growth and performance of indigenous bamboo species, introduced bamboo species both in theory and practice, shortlist and provide recommendation for expansion of selected species for different agro-climatic clusters and end uses. The research design, data collection methodology developed and field data collection is in progress. 

During year 1,  the programme  established 1295.97 hectare of new bamboo plantation accounting for 26 percent of the overall indicator. The bamboo plants were distributed to 1338 smallholder famer (595M/ 743F) . The sustainable management of forest and farms was initiated on 1400 hectare of land in Ethiopia, Kenya and Uganda and out of which 468.45 hectare were brought under sustainable management regime. The sustainable management of bamboo has benefitted 935 (170M/765F) beneficiaries</narrative>
