   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The programme initiated the identification of suitable locations for setting up two CPTC &#x2013; one each in Kenya and Uganda. A feasibility report has been prepared and shared with International Centre for Bamboo and Rattan (ICBR) China to identify the machines and tools for the Common Production cum Training Centre( CPTC). The programme strengthened the existing four CPTC (2 in Ethiopia and 1 each in Kenya and Uganda) with additional tools, materials, repair and rectification work to strengthen its operationalization. INBAR has entered into an agreement with ICBR to operationalise the Bamboo Mat Board (BMB) industry in Ethiopia. Support was also given to Ethiopia Productivity Improvement Centre(PIC) to prepare joint work plan, identify the potential private public partnership( PPP), identify cluster for supply chains of raw materials and formation of stakeholder groups. The existing CPTC in Moyo, Uganda is providing regular employment for 11 (6M/5F)youth and women, and CPTC Migori in Kenya is providing regular employment for 5 (5 M) youth and in Ethiopia two CPTC in Amhara and Oromia region generated consistent employment for 9(7M/2F) youth.</narrative>
