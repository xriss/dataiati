   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Archdiocese of Lilongwe is responding to the devastating impact of HIV and AIDS in the rural communities of Malawi in Lilongwe Districts. Accessing HIV testing and Counselling and anti retroviral treatment is a challenge throughout Malawi and in Lilongwe it very difficult especially for pregnant women and the sick who are unable to travel long distances to the available health facilities.

The Archdiocese has been working in the communities to provide palliative care and support to families and individuals most affected and living with HIV and AIDS. In addition the available rural  health facilities are under staffed and under resourced forcing most patients to be attended to in the home and in their communities. It is because of the limited number of nurses that has led to community led home based care and support.
Fuelling the further spread of the pandemic are a number of challenges inherent within the communities in Malawi, such as:
poverty and the hardest hit are women and children who in the end make them selves vulnerable through engaging in sex work
Sexual cultural and religious practices such as the initiation rituals often associated with coming of age, or upon the death of a spouse and these rituals expose women and girls at most and spread to the bigger community.
Stigma and discrimination continues to suppress openness about HIV and AIDS resulting in late treatment care and support as well as defaulting on treatment
This project aims at equipping a total of 197 volunteers with sound knowledge and skills in basic nursing at village and community level and how to organise the village savings and loans schemes, and how to provide sensitive and culturally appropriate psychosocial support an palliative care. The project anticipates to reach out to over 1,200 people with chronic illness and living with HIV an AIDS will be assisted.</narrative>
