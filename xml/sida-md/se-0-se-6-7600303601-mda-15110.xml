    <narrative xml:lang="EN">General question: Results related to the intended outcome 2015Question: Summarise results related to the intended outcome (this information will be sent to Open Aid)Answer: The development intervention&#xB4;s overall objective was &#x201C;Strengthening institutional capacity of the public administration for better policymaking, policy implementation and efficient use of public resources&#x201D;.

During the implementation of the Support to Central Public administration Reform in Moldova (2006- February 2014) the expected outcomes and outputs of the originally approved four project components have been fully achieved. Besides, the contribution has progressively evolved and became more comprehensive and more tailored to the changing and evolving needs of the national partner. Therefore, additional objectives were included with substantial progress registered in achievement of these additional outputs that went beyond the initial project document. 
 Among the key achieved results should be highlighted the following: 

1.Institutional reorganisation of Central Public Administration  
The Government reorganisation was guided by thorough horizontal Functional Review (2006) findings.  In 2010 an in-depth restructuring was carried out in 34 CPAs (central public authorities) and 16 subordinated public bodies aiming at establishment of an efficient, functional institutional frame that is capable to deliver high quality public services to the citizens. The number of central public authorities was reduced from 29 to 24; and the number of state agencies was reduced from 16 to 8, followed by a considerable reduction in staff (in some of the ministries and state agencies up to 60-70% of staff). 
A single legal frame on central governance has been developed and aligned to EU best practices. An important result was that the policy functions at the central government level were clearly delineated from the implementation functions. The institutional system has been streamlined and consolidated around key policy areas, with the Ministries playing a key role in policy development and coordination, M&amp;E of implementation.  
2.Government Policy Making Capacity
The Government &#xB4;s policy and decision making capacities across all central bodies have been considerably enhanced. Government made significant progress in strategic planning, aligned to EU integration course. With project support a new National Development Strategy &#x201C;Moldova 2020&#x201D; was developed in a participatory manner and approved by the Parliament in 2012. The Government adopted a Consolidated Government Action Plan 2011- 2014 (CGAP), encompassing all key priority actions for Moldova&#xB4;s EU integration agenda.   An improved web-based monitoring and reporting system across the whole government for CGAP has been developed and provides a coherent and standardised reporting by all central agencies. An Inter-Ministerial Strategic Planning Committee was established and is functioning. The Chancellery of State has become the lead institution in policy coordination. Annually the State Chancellery prepares a policy priority framework to inform the Medium Term Budgetary Framework. 
Capacities for strategic planning, policy elaboration and ex ante impact assessment, including assessment of the fiscal impact of the strategies and policies have been considerably enhanced.  In each line ministry there have been established dedicated Strategic Planning and Policy Analysis Units.  All line ministries and several central authorities have elaborated at least 50 Strategic Development Plans (SDP) based on EU best practices of good governance. 
Considerable progress was achieved in linking strategic planning to the resource planning. The SDPs were complemented by Sector Expenditure Plans in line with the rolling MTBF (2013-2015). Policy capacity in line ministries was further consolidated.  All line ministries have elaborated and approved 16 PPPs (Public Policy Proposals) aligned to MTBF and accompanied by ex-ante impact assessments.  The macroeconomic model, developed for &#x201C;Moldova 2020&#x201D;, has further enabled to assess the fiscal impact of the new policies.  
More than 450 civil servants were trained in strategic development planning.  About 95 per cent of all civil servants have enhanced their capacities through specialised training courses, delivered by the Academy of Public Administration in line with new training modules on better policy making. More than 75% of staff received at least 40 hours of training.

3.Increased transparency and participation in decision making.
The government decisions have become more transparent and overall the government has become more accountable for utilisation of public funds. During the reporting period about 85% of the government decisions on public policies were consulted with the civil society (as compared to 38% in 2009). 
The Law on Transparency was adopted in 2008. It has established equal opportunities to all citizens to participate in decision making. The opportunities for Civil Society, including private sector, to influence decisions and demand accountability from the state were considerably increased through establishment of a National Participation Council with a Secretariat,  and  through formal establishment  of a first ever  mechanism for participatory decision making.  The National Participation Council (NPC) consists of 30 NGOs elected on a 3-annual basis, and it has five functional working groups. Regular consultations between CSOs, NPC and the government take place on the government policy documents and decisions.
On-line consultations have become a norm and are used by all central authorities.  E.g. the first National Strategies presented for on-line consultations via www.particip.gov.md were &#x201C;Moldova 2020&#x201D; and the &#x201C;National Decentralisation Strategy&#x201D;, which gathered over 2000 comments. Currently,   about 80% of policy documents are being subjected to consultations through this platform.
In May 2013 Moldovan government has received for the first time the UN Public Service Award, which is the most prestigious international recognition for contribution in the development of public service, being ranked on the first place for the Europe and the North America region in the category &#x201E;Fostering participation in the decision-making process through innovative mechanisms&quot;. The award was given for the set of initiatives on increasing decisional transparency and participation of civil society in this process, launched and implemented by the State Chancellery during 2009-2012 for facilitating and promoting citizen participation through new institutional mechanisms, for encouraging responsiveness and administration&#xB4; transformation.

4.Efficient delivery of public services.
This additional objective has been introduced into the project on the Government&#xB4;s initiative. Considerable efforts were deployed in revising of the whole register of public services delivered to the citizens and enterprises. The Government has evaluated about 586 public services, provided by the state.  This analysis has created the basis for a more clear division of responsibilities between central and local authorities, thus linking the CPAR (Central Public Administration Reform) to the decentralisation of local governance. The services were catalogued; and new methodology and guidelines for service delivery were adopted in 2012. In February 2014, following the Decision on restructuring of the public services 2012-2015, the Government adopted a Strategy on Public Services Reform. The implementation of CPA Reform has been strongly linked to the Government E-transformation strategy. The key outcomes are diminished bureaucracy, improved (simplified and digitalized) access to services and procedures, and a more efficient, transparent and accountable delivery of public services to the population and businesses. At the moment of reporting more than 90 important public services has been made accessible on the new E-platform www.servicii.gov.md  and thus the service delivery has become more transparent, cost-efficient and effective.

5.Merit -based professional civil service
A Human Resource Management reform in central government has been implemented with the project support. Substantial progress has been achieved in development of a merit based civil service. The Law on Public Function and Status of Civil Servant, drafted in line with the EU good practices, was adopted in July 2008 and amended in 2012. The current legislative framework presents a good basis for a modern Civil Service. Other two important Laws (i) on Single Public Service Classification and (ii) on a new, more transparent Civil Service Pay System were adopted. 
The new remuneration system has been enforced and is expected to improve transparency in civil service pay and contribute to decreased staff fluctuation in administration. The results of the HR management reform are: increased transparency and competitiveness in recruitment; improved HR management due to enforcement of the modern personnel management procedures, complemented by on-going competence development programmes and mandatory performance appraisal of staff. 
Considerable progress was achieved in that area: in 2012 more than 71% of the staff in central government has been recruited through a transparent merit-based system, as compared to 16 % in 2009. More than half of the employees were hired based on the competition compared to totally lacking competition in 2008. About 99, 4 % of civil service positions in public authorities have job descriptions.  Currently, a merit-based civil service on the grounds of rule of law is institutionalised in all central administration bodies and in most of the Local PAs.

A digitalized Civil Service Registry &#x201C;Human Resource management Informational System&#x201D; has been developed, tested and installed in all line ministries. It was formally launched in November 2013.  By end of the operational period the system has been rolled out to the national level. The data on all public servants is currently introduced in the database, linked to Population Registry, Fiscal Inspectorate, payroll system, etc. The enforcement of the database will make the whole system transparent and will provide information for management decisions.
