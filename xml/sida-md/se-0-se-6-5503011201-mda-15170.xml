   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Programme &#x201C;Women in Politics&#x201D; (WiP) was implemented by UN Women jointly with UNDP in partnership with two civil society organizations - East Europe Foundation (EEF) and the Centre Partnership for Development (CPD) &#x2013; during 2014-2017 with financial support from the Government of Sweden.
The total amount of allocated funds by Sweden was 27.5 MSEK.
The overall goal of the Women in Politics Programme was to support the increased participation of women in politics and in the decision-making process by creating an environment conducive to their meaningful participation, and to support capacity development of women before, during and after the elections at the central and local levels.
The programme also seeks to promote increased public awareness of women&#x2019;s contribution to political leadership and supports the realization of women&#x2019;s rights and commitments undertaken by the Government of Moldova.
The programme has contributed to the following outcomes:
Outcome 1: Legal frameworks and policies to advance women&#x2019;s right to participate in decision making at national and local levels are reformed/adopted and/or implemented.
Outcome 2: Gender equality advocates influence legal frameworks and policies to increase women&#x2019;s leadership and political participation.The overall development goal of the contribution is increased participation of women in politics and in the decision-making process during and after the elections at the central and local levels.
The quantitative target was to achieve more than 30% of women representation at all levels. The progress towards the target was measured against the 2014 baseline data showing that the share of women the Parliament is below 20%, and the share of Mayors 17%, Rayon Councillors 14%, and Local Councillors 26%.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">UN Women  in cooperation with UNDP Moldova have applied to Sida for funding of 19 500 000  SEK to carry out the Project &quot;Enhancing Women&#x2019;s Political Representation through improved capacity and enhanced support in Moldova&quot; during the period 2014-2016.
The intervention aims at increased participation of women in politics and in the decision-making process during and after the elections at the central and local levels. The country is entering an important phase in its political development with Parliamentary elections forthcoming in the fall 2014, followed by the local elections in summer 2015. The elections provide a strategic opportunity to support democratisation processes overall and, in particular, to produce a development change in the country in terms of promoting gender equality and women rights. The development goal will be achieved through (i) wide advocacy and awareness raising among the political parties and their leadership aiming to increase the political will to nominate more women candidates for the elections and place them in winnable positions in the party lists; (ii) Capacity building of a broad group of actors (Women Political Organisations, Coalition for Free and Fair Elections, local women leaders and several other NGOs and initiative groups, local authorities, central and local media) to influence the political parties&#xB4; work and to demand equal representation and observance of women&#xB4;s political rights; (iii) creating an enabling environment for women&#xB4;s meaningful participation through capacity building for women candidates to stand for the elections at central and local level, as well as to perform their duties after being elected. 
UN Women will implement the intervention in partnership with UNDP Moldova and two local NGOs: East Europe Foundation and Centre partnership for Development. The contribution will complement and strengthen the ongoing Swedish support to the Parliament and CEC and civil society support programmes aiming to engage and empower the citizens and boost the democratic processes in Moldova. The proposal suggests several new approaches and methodologies, e.g. promoting the application of Special Temporary Measures through amendments to the Electoral Code and Law on Political Parties&#x2019; financing (such a quota for female representation, incentives for parties including more female candidates in the party lists), intensive work with media and consistent inclusion of men in all project activities. The intervention&#x2019;s total budget is 19 500 000 SEK, with no other donors funding.</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">The contribution has achieved many impressive results highlighted below:
Legal frameworks and policies to advance women&#x2019;s right to participate in decision making at national and local levels are reformed/adopted and/or implemented:The contribution provided consistent support in the legal drafting and elaboration of amendments, that finally brought to the legal initiative No 141 in 2014, later adopted as a Law Nr 71.
Top level expertise was provided to the government in support of the elaboration of the new National Gender Equality Strategy 2017-2021.
The Programme contributed to strengthening the capacities of the civil society and Gender Equality Platform since it was established. The Platform was instrumental in the adoption of the Law No. 71 (legalization of a gender quota in the Republic of Moldova) and has been recognized as a key actor in supporting Government efforts on gender equality, which is demonstrated by their inclusion as a partner in the new National Strategy on Advancing Gender Equality (2017-2022) approved by the Government in April 2017.
Considerable results were achieved through consistent advocacy and lobby by the partners in this contribution: The advocacy on TSM&#x2019;s adoption and further on the promotion of the newly adopted legal provisions has been carried out through TV public debates with political parties, TV shows and press conferences. Ten (10) TV spots on promoting gender quotas in politics and in the decision making, presenting the best practices examples of the states, which have already adopted the quotas, as well as TV spots on promoting the legislative innovations have been broadcasted on the national and regional TV channels. The Gender Equality Platform (GEP), supported by the programme, seized all the opportunities to advocate for TSM including through public forums, position papers, declarations, press conferences, press clubs and public actions in front of the Parliament.
Gender awareness raising: The public at large became more aware about the stereotypes existing in the society on women&#x2019;s involvement in politics and about the positions and profiles of women and men candidates elected at the local level due to the findings of a comprehensive research &#x201C;Gender Equality Barometer&#x201D; launched in May 2017. Main findings and legislative changes were illustrated in info graphics in three languages and widely disseminated via media and public events.
Capacities of the media on gender responsive coverage of political issues enhanced: Public at large became more aware and sensitive about women leadership due to increasing women&#x2019;s portraying in media. Since its launching, WiP Programme organized trainings which involved 93 journalists from various media institutions to build their capacities on gender sensitive reporting. As a result of the increased sensitivity of participating media and the high visibility ensured of the self-assessment process, a total 37 media so far (29 participating and 8 additional ones) signed a commitment to respecting gender equality principles, specifying concrete steps they will perform.
Women in Politics Programme focused specifically on the area of combating sexism in advertising and media, in partnership with the MHSPF (Ministry of Health, Social Protection and Family) and the Association of Advertising Agencies (AAPM). The legislation in the field of sexism in advertising and social advertising has been reviewed and relevant amendments have been proposed in order to correlate the national legal framework to the international standards. A Guideline to assess sexism in advertising has been developed and published. The draft Regulation for the establishment and functioning of the Experts&#x2019; Council in the field of advertising, with a special focus on sexism in advertising, was debated in a series of round table discussions and workshops with the participation of an international expert. Considerable work was done on advocacy and lobby of gender quota.
The WIP Programme has made significant contribution to increasing media reporting on positive and inspirational representation of women, as well as challenging public perceptions on &#x201C;typical&#x201D; positions and occupations of women and men. 300 &#x201C;success stories&#x201D; of women leaders from different walks of life &#x2013; politics, business, civil service, civil society, etc. &#x2013; and from all corners of the country, have been identified and featured on print, on-line and audio-visual media in the course of the year.
An additional 60 success stories about women entrepreneurship were developed and disseminated on different online platforms as well as in a brochure. Fifteen (15) short videos were developed featuring some of the most inspiring women leaders in business. The information about all existing resources for women entrepreneurs is presented on a web platform: www.platformafemeilor.md. Besides this, the journalists involved in the developing of success stories became more aware about how to present women and gender equality topics in a non-stereotypical way, as well as to avoid sexism in language and in photos/ images.
Capacities at all levels to promote women&#x2019;s participation in electoral processes both as candidates and voters enhanced: Over 10 organizations supporting women candidates and demanding women&#x2019;s equal participation within political party nominations have been receiving capacity development support (7 political clubs established in 7districts, 3 women&#x2019;s organizations of 3 political parties, Romani Women and Girls Network, Gender Equality Platform consisting of 30 organizations). Significant effort was invested to identify women candidates for local elections through nomination campaigns and outreach in the communities. In 2017, 205 women received support and capacity building to efficiently lead in their communities or at their workplace.
Support to gender movement: The WiP Programme from its very start was designed as a joint collaboration with two prominent human rights and gender NGOs: East Europe Foundation (EEF) and Center Partnership for Development (CPD) that are equal partners with UN Women and UNDP. One of the main objectives of EEF and CPD was to consolidate the platform of NGOs active in the area of gender equality promotion and to use it as a tool of pressure on the stakeholders responsible for TSM adoption. This objective was achieved with the establishment of the Gender Equality Platform in July 2015. Currently, the Platform brings together 30 prominent NGOs and individuals committed to gender equality.The WiP Programme has further strengthened the institutional capacity of the GEP through supporting its Secretariat function in 2015, 2016 and 2017 and the development of three key documents to guide its work in the upcoming period.
Capacities of the Election Management Bodies on gender responsive electoral management enhanced: In the course of 2014-2017, the Women in Politics Programme supported the efforts of the Central Election Commission (CEC) and the Center for Continuous Electoral Training (CCET) of Moldova in championing a strong gender perspective in election management and electoral processes. Prior to the electoral system change in Moldova from Proportional Representation (PR list) to a Mixed Parallel one, the Programme supported the Central Electoral Commission of Moldova (CEC) and the Center forContinuous Electoral Training (CCET) to inform people in a non-partisan and inclusive way about all electoral systems and their gender equality implications.
As result of pressure from the WiP supported Gender Equality Platform, specialized international bodies and the society at large, a series of Temporary Special Measures have been introduced in the new electoral law to encourage the nomination of women candidates in Single Member Districts (SMD), including: (a) 10% increase in the yearly public funding and a multiplication factor for each female candidate elected in a SMD for parties that will put forward 40% of women candidates in the respective constituencies and (b) 50% decrease of the number of signatures required to register a woman candidate in SMD compared to men candidates.
WEM International (unexpected and unplanned result): The CEC and CCET have gained international recognition in mainstreaming a strong gender equality perspective in elections (including but not limited to implementation of gender statistics in elections, gender-responsible electoral trainings) and led the establishment of the International Association of Women in Electoral Management &#x2013; WEM International, which aims at promoting a balanced representation of women and men in electoral management and in decision making processes at large. The Association was registered in Belgium in December 2017.
Women leadership: Women&#x2019;s leadership skills have been enhanced and they have taken a more active role towards solving pressing community problems and advancing gender equality, particularly at the local level. Over 2300 women have been involved in different capacity building activities during 2014 -2017 that enabled them to become more effective leaders. These include, but not limited to: Women Political Clubs in 7 districts that serve as knowledge and leadership centers for women before, during and after elections; pioneering Mentorship Programme that put women local councilors in the lead of 24 community initiatives in areas ranging from health to environment to violence against women; peer-to-peer learning and training sessions for women mayors and women local councilors that have led to them undertaking new initiatives to advance community well-being and good governance, mentorship program for women from communities where women are not represented, etc.
Over 920 women have been directly involved in activities of the local women&#x2019;s political clubs in seven districts since their establishment, which range from advocacy with local branches of political parties for voluntary quotas, identifying and trying to solve together community problems, raising awareness on the importance of women to participate in political processes, etc. Key results include the implementation of recommendations from Gender Audits carried out by the clubs, under the guidance of the lead NGO WPC 50/50. The gender audits covered 28 communities from 7 districts and represented an important learning experience for the clubs in analyzing key issues, developing recommendations and lobbing for their implementation.
Empowering women from different disadvantaged groups: Throughout the project period, 2014- 2017, a diverse range of initiatives has been undertaken to demand inclusion of women&#x2019;s needs at both national and local levels. These include: Gender Equality Platform, 5 Platforms of women representing women from different groups, 7 women&#x2019;s political clubs, Power mapping and needs assessment in 15 localities with predominant Roma population, GirlsGoIT (Programme contribution to other partners&#x2019; initiative) , Forum &#x201C;Partnership for an Inclusive and Prosperous Moldova&#x201D; , 3 regional workshops for business women, 5 NGOs conducted women&#x2019;s empowerment campaigns at local level, 24 small community initiatives undertaken by women local councilors at first mandate, 7 community small initiatives undertaken by women leaders from 7 communities with zero representation of women in decision making, National Network of Women with Disabilities has been launched, 10 peer-to-peer learning visits in 15 communities (12 headed by women mayors and 3 by men mayors) for women mayors, 3 regional initiatives launched by young Roma women and men, 16 Days Campaign on ending violence against women, including those led by women MPs and women mayors placing the survivors at the center, One of the two Roma women local councilors organized an initiative to encourage Romani women to participate in local council meetings.
One of the two elected Romani woman local councilors (Laura Bosnea) was supported to mobilize the Roma community around key issues they face in the town of Rascani. The councilor carried out a survey with Romani women to probe into their problems. A key problem identified, poor quality of roads, was tackled by Ms. Bosnea in her capacity as a local councilor, and reconstruction works were undertaken.
Support to Network of Women Mayors for community development: In 2017, the WiP supported Women&#x2019;s Network under the Congress of Local Authorities of Moldova (CALM) organized two high-level advocacy events that united 82 women mayors from all over the country in a dialogue with the Ministry of Education, Culture and Research, Ministry of Labor, Health and Social Protection and 5 Members of the Parliament representing the Public Administration Committee.
After implementation of the Mentorship Program &#x201C;INSPIR-O&#x201D;, 27,261 direct and indirect beneficiaries have been reached, which represents 7,8% of population from the targeted communities. 83 community mobilization actions have been carried, with implication of 699 volunteers (467 women and 232 men). Additional financial contribution has been collected to implement 7 small community projects, thus 345,760.54 MDL (19,963.08 USD) has been collected from individuals and 225,500.00 MDL (13,019.63 USD) represents the financial contribution of the local public administration. Several local community initiatives targeted environmental aspects.
Support to Women&apos;s Parliamentary Caucus: Significant tailor-made capacity development in the area of gender equality was provided to all key stakeholders in Parliament &#x2013; female Members of Parliament (MPs), newly elected as well as those in subsequent mandates, the Parliament Secretariat, including its leadership and staff of the 4 Parliamentary Constituency and Information Offices, Standing Committees. The contribution has cooperated well with another Swedish funded programme that supports parliamentary governance.
In October 2017, Moldova hosted the Regional Conference for Eastern Europe and Central Asia &#x201C;Parliamentarians for Gender Equality and Women&#x2019;s Empowerment&#x201D; organized by UNDP, UN Women and OSCE-ODIHR in partnership with the Parliament of Moldova and with support from the Government of Sweden. Moldova&#x2019;s gender equality achievements &#x2013; to many of which the Programme &#x201C;Women in Politics&#x201D; had an important contribution &#x2013; were showcased to over 90 parliamentarians, local elected officials and civil society practitioners from 12 CIS and Central Asia countries.</narrative>
