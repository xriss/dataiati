    <narrative xml:lang="EN">General question: Results related to the intended outcome 2017Question: Summarise results related to the intended outcome (this information will be sent to Open Aid)Answer: As from October 2011, the Government of Sweden has provided 9 million SEK (approximately &#x20AC;960,000) for the EBRD BAS Women in Business Fund (the &#x201C;WiB Programme&#x201D;) for Moldova to be implemented during 2011-2014, which has been extended until December 31, 2016 for utilisation of accumulated savings. The contribution was extended  yet for another 15 months till March 2017.   The EBRD BAS Women in Business Fund for Moldova was implemented during the period October 1011- March 2017 with excellent performance and even going beyond the stated targets.     Main results:   Since inception of the Programme 2011, 123 business advisory projects (including 28 with start-ups) have been started, with an initial target of 90 projects. Out of these, 113 have been completed and disbursed. The average gross project cost has been EUR 10,626 and the total subsidy budget committed is EUR 668,383. Client contribution has reached 48.86% of the total project costs and amounted to EUR 638,640.     Additionally during Programme implementation a series of Market Development Activities (MDAs) have been conducted, including trainings, mentoring programmes, networking meetings and visibility. Even though the Agreement has initially prescribed implementation of 15 MDAs with specific topics, a much higher number was implemented.    Advisory projects:   Within this Programme component, the assistance through the advisory projects targets women managed and/or owned companies or those with at least a 60% share of women employees, including start-ups. Advisory projects are implemented by local consultants and encompass support through project development, monitoring during the implementation and impact evaluation one year after completion.  During Programme implementation period, the team has started 123 projects with 118 beneficiary enterprises (hereinafter Beneficiaries), as 5 enterprises benefited from ASB support twice. ASB engaged 68 consultants for WiB projects implementation.    In addition to the above 123 projects, EBRD WiB  Moldova has started another additional 30 WiB projects during 2015-2017 through the ongoing funding from the regional EaP WiB Programme and savings made within WiB Fund for Moldova.     Out of total number of beneficiaries, 52% are women owned enterprises; 60% are women managed; 42% are both owned and managed by women; 64% of enterprises have more than 60% women-employees.    In terms of projects by types of advisory services, the majority were implemented in the field of Information Communication Technology (40%), followed by Marketing (39%), Quality Management (10%), Strategy (5%) and Engineering Solutions (4%), and Operations (1%).   60% of beneficiaries are service providers, the remaining 40% are companies specialised in production. 14% of the assisted enterprises either distribute or produce food and beverage, another 16% are textiles, apparel and footwear manufacturers; 12% provide health services, while another 14% provide retail and wholesale distribution services. The nature of these businesses reflects the economy structure and explains the high demand for advisory services in Information Communication Technology, Quality Management and Marketing.    WiB enterprises tend to be small, with around 77% of projects being started with beneficiaries that employ less than 50 people, while 12% with beneficiaries that have more than 100 employees.    Other relevant data:  - Location of enterprise: 17% rural versus  83% main cities (Chisinau and Balti);   - Average size of enterprises assisted: 50 employees;  - Average number of years of operation: 10  years;  - The average gross cost per project : EUR 10,626,  and the total subsidy budget committed is EUR 668,383.   -  Client contribution has reached 48.86% of the total project costs and amounted EUR 638,640.     During Programme implementation, ASB Moldova conducted Market Development Activities (MDAs), all aimed at promoting women entrepreneurship in Moldova, developing the women consultancy market and enhancing the competitiveness of Moldovan SMEs. Through implemented MDAs, ASB has reached out directly to more than 500 women, while the national wide coverage through all media appearances is even larger. Women entrepreneurs that have benefited from ASB MDAs are coming from various fields: tourism, textile, handicraft, wholesale, construction, consultancy, etc. which has created a very diverse environment and a unique networking opportunity for all women.    In addition, through the regional WiB EaP Programme, ASB has continued implementation of the Cherie Blair Mentoring Programme and has also developed the series of WiB workshops on &#x201C;Leadership in action&#x201D;, &#x201C;Going digital&#x201D;, &#x201C;Keys to financial management&#x201D;, &#x201C;ICT solutions&#x201D; and &#x201C;From entrepreneur to enterprise&#x201D;. During 2016, ASB has organised the first workshop &#x201C;Going Digital&#x201D; attended by 20 women entrepreneurs; &#x201C;From entrepreneur to enterprise&#x201D; workshop delivery is envisaged for 2017.    The team in partnership with the SME Development Organisation (ODIMM) has organised a business networking meeting for women entrepreneurs from Republic of Moldova. The event included several components: a short training on networking and partnership development techniques, presentation of WiB Programme, presentation of ODIMM success story, product presentation delivered by 2 ASB and 1 ODIMM beneficiary. The event was attended by 56 participants, with more than half representing top level management of local companies and institutions.    Visibility and dissemination:  The EBRD ASB visibility and dissemination activities showcased best practices and the successful stories of women entrepreneurs supported through the Programme. The activities raised public awareness of the role of women engaged in entrepreneurial activity and the contribution they make to the economy and to society in general, and promotion of entrepreneurship as a viable and feasible opportunity for women.     During the reporting period the Women in Business Communication Campaigns included:  1. Media outreach and communications on each WiB MDA, including regular publications on the BAS Moldova Facebook page;  2. WiB Newsletters;  3. Media briefing with selected media resources on Programme results;  4. Collaboration with EU during the campaign &#x201C;Europe for Moldova&#x201D; &#x2013; BAS women beneficiaries have been selected to be reflected on informative billboards regarding EU assistance to Moldova;  5. Collaboration with EU on creation of a movie aimed at increasing awareness regarding women entrepreneurship and support offered by the EU to the Republic of Moldova under the Campaign &#x201C;Vezi cu ochii tai sus?inerea Uniunii Europene &#xEE;n Moldova&#x201D; (video available at the link https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WlrwEf7DeM);  6. A set of promotional materials has been developed, including various brochures and WiB dedicated video have been created to support efficient programme promotion (video available at the link https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyQb2GHxfps).    In addition, during 2015 BAS has started the promotion of Business Lens - a product launched in all EBRD BAS countries of operation. Through a detailed online questionnaire (http://www.ebrdwomeninbusiness.com/) Business Lens zooms in on the management of company&#x2019;s business in seven key areas: financial management &amp;amp; performance, market knowledge, marketing &amp;amp; sales, human resources, strategy &amp;amp; organisation, risk management and operations. Business Lens analyses provided information to help women look at the business from a new perspective, helping them to identify strengths and most importantly opportunities for further development.     Training Courses &amp;amp; Mentoring Programme:  EBRD conducted 7 training courses dedicated to developing entrepreneurial and leadership skills of women targeted groups: start-ups, consultants, SMEs and trainers.  In total 145 women entrepreneurs have participated in training courses and follow up networking meetings. Women participants managed to increase their clients&#x2019; portfolio, expand sales volumes, enter foreign markets, launch company brands and set up new businesses. Some examples of diverse success stories of companies funded and managed by training participants are presented below:  1. Proimagine SRL, a company providing PR and communication services has launched its brand and increased by 50% the number of corporate clients in one year after the training;  2. Vioniservice SRL, an accounting company has developed its brand as a tool for better market promotion and attracting larger corporate clients and offering more complex services with higher value added;  3. Velitextil Plus SRL, a company working in the apparel industry has launched its clothing brand and opened a branded store in the city centre, also starting export to EU market;  4. NVMN SRL, an interior design company has expanded to cover the corporate sector and has also launched interior design courses, developing also export of its services to USA market;  5. Ana Popova Showroom, a company producing and selling handmade jewellery managed to expand its export operations.  EBRD cooperation with training participants has continued after courses finalisation.     Understanding the importance of dedicated advisory projects and their impact on business, the participants have started 10 projects with EBRD support. In addition, to further encourage start-up managers to consolidate their business idea and market presence, EBRD nominated 8 training participants for the Mentoring Programme.    Within current Programme, EBRD organised in premiere for Moldova the Mentoring Programme for WiB (activity continued as part of EaP WiB Programme). Five women entrepreneurs benefited from a one year relationship with international mentor matched according to their business needs. As a result, 2 participants expanded their business, and 1 was able to launch her business through the support of their mentors.    Achieved Outcome level results:  All WiB projects are evaluated 12 months after completion following the OECD Development Assistance Criteria (DAC) of project monitoring which entails questions related to the relevance, efficiency, effectiveness, impact, and sustainability of a project. The ratings range from Highly Successful, Successful, and Satisfactory to Unsatisfactory.    At evaluation stage, an assessment is made of the benefits derived from the project and its impact on the company in terms of increased productivity, turnover, number of employees, expansion into new markets and successful completion of the projects and the attraction of investment or approved loans if relevant.     Outcome level results:   Out of the 96 evaluated projects, 40 were rated as highly successful, 51 as successful and 5 as satisfactory. Another 26 projects are to be evaluated during 2017.   Five projects were implemented with energy efficiency as cross cutting issue, focused on the design of technical engineering documentation for the connecting of the beneficiaries&#x2019; agricultural land to electric power supply to modernise the irrigation pumping system, construction of trading centre and cold storage facilities, and re-construction of operational premises of businesses.    A year after project finalisation, enterprises have reported the following business results, which are very positive in the context of the current economy conjuncture:  - 69% of evaluated companies registered an increase in turnover on average by 142%;  - 45% of evaluated companies reported on average 25% increase in the number of employees;  - 60% of evaluated companies have increased their labour productivity on average by EUR 5519 per employee;  - 679 new job places have been created;  - 8 out of all evaluated companies have attracted external funding for a total sum of EUR         1,861,000 and an average of EUR 232,625.</narrative>
