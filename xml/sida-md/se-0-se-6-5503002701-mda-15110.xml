    <narrative xml:lang="EN">General question: Results related to the intended outcome 2015Question: Summarise results related to the intended outcome (this information will be sent to Open Aid)Answer: The finalized contribution was the third phase of a multi-year support to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and European Integration that provided technical support in helping Moldova promote its foreign policy priorities and, primarily, its EU integration agenda.  Among key results are:

The Moldovan national capacities to carry out negotiations and prepare for the implementation of the Association Agreement with EU have been substantially strengthened.  An Agreement on Visa Liberalisation with the EU was signed in April 2014 and Moldovan citizens got a free visa movement in the Schengen area. The Association Agreement (AA), including DCFTA was successfully signed in June 2014 and ratified by the Moldovan Parliament.  This is the most ambitious agreement negotiated so far between the EU and Moldova. It provides strategic opportunities for Moldova&#x2019;s reform agenda and county&#x2019;s further modernization. 

The Project resulted in a significant intensification of contacts with EU Member States and speeded up the process of ratification of the AA by their respective Parliaments. By March 2015, the EU-Moldova Association Agreement has been ratified by the Parliaments of 21 EU Member States.

In August 2014 the Moldovan Government has adopted a National Action Plan (NAP) on Implementation of the EU Moldova AA/DCFTA, subsequently revised by the new Cabinet in August 2015 that has re-confirmed its commitment towards EU Agenda. The capacity of public servants for monitoring and reporting on the implementation of NAP on AA using a specially designed electronic platform were developed and consolidated.

The Government&#x2019;s platform for the inter-agency coordination of the Association Agreement&#x2019; implementation and monitoring, led by MFAEI, was strengthened through professional development of EU- Coordinators at central level. However, an efficient implementation of the Association Agreement would require further efforts to ensure effective inter-institutional cooperation and coordination.  

The capacities of the Moldovan authorities in  eight key sectors &#x2013; Agriculture, Food Safety, Transport, Environment, Finance, Legal Approximation, Internal Affairs and Social Protection were strengthened through targeted and tailored expertise and capacity building. As a result, Moldova is progressing well in gradual approximation of national legislation to EU norms, standards and best practices, in compliance with the requirements set forth in the AA and DCFTA.  

The Project contributed to the implementation of the Government EU Communication Plan and facilitated achieving more transparency and accessibility of the information on the EU integration process and contributed significantly to the elimination of wrong perceptions and ungrounded stereotypes. While the rate of those firmly supporting the European vector of Moldova is decreasing, as a result of the joint communication efforts, the rate of those acknowledging good relations between Moldova and EU increased by 8% from May 2013  to April 2015.

An important achievement of the contribution is the substantially strengthened MFAEI&#x2019;s responsibility and ownership over the project results. During project operations, the Ministry was progressively engaged in direct implementation of a number of activities through the application of the national procurement and financial systems. 

The institutional capacities of MFAEI in strategic planning, monitoring and financial reporting were significantly strengthened. The Human Resources Management System (HRMS) at the MFAEI was further strengthened and aligned to the new Law on Diplomatic Service. The implementation of the new HRMS is expected to produce a positive impact on the efficiency of the national diplomacy.</narrative>
