   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In this project, 7iber will train six young professionals and recent graduates in the early stages of their careers in core skills for producing in-depth data-driven journalism. 7iber will be targeting participants from throughout Jordan, and aiming for regional and gender diversity. 

Through this strong and extensive training program, the participants will be provided with an opportunity to publish in-depth multimedia reports and stories with a focus on issues impacting their own communities. 

Thus, the project will not only be targeting these participants, but will also engage their communities through these reports. 7iber will implement an outreach plan to ensure the spread and reach of the reports to community members. 

In addition to that, 7iber will also be engaging its Jordanian readership through the fellows&#x2019; reports and pieces produced by 7iber&#x2019;s journalists, providing them with multimedia stories, and in-depth accountability and governance centred journalism. 7iber&#x2019;s readers, with whom we nurture a strong relationship of trust and engagement, is spread throughout Jordan, in the country-side, and the various governorates, in addition to the capital.</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">We launched the call for applications for the 3uyoun fellowship mid-February and continued accepting applications until the end of March. There was widespread interest in the fellowship with over 150 applications to join the program. To assess applications, we had 3 selection stages; an initial short-list in which we narrowed down the candidates to 30, and a second short-list narrowed down to 15 applicants. Those 15 applicants were sent an assignment to write a 700-word story. Finally the strongest eight applicants were selected, six of whom are women. We have fellows from Irbid, Madaba, Al-Zarqa, Al-Tafilah, and Amman.</narrative>
