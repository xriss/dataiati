  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Podoconiosis is a chronic disease that affects up to one million people in Ethiopia, and approximately 11 million people (18% of the population) are at risk in endemic areas nationwide.   In contrast to lymphatic filariasis caused by filarial parasites, podoconiosis (non-filarial elephantiasis) is non-infectious and found among individuals exposed to the red-clay soil of alkali volcanic rock.  The disease often occurs in subsistence farmers who work barefoot in the soil where microscopic mineral particles can be absorbed through the skin and lead to lymphatic system damage.

Symptoms of podoconiosis include burning, itching, and swelling of the feet and lower legs.  Affected individuals are often at risk for open wounds and infection.  These symptoms lead to an extreme physical, social, and economic burden.  Many are excluded from school, church, and community places. According to a study in Wolaita Zone, Southern Ethiopia, the total productivity cost of a patient suffering from podoconiosis was 45 percent of the total working days per year. 

IOCC is working to eliminate podoconiosis through a three step project: prevention, treatment, and shoemaking.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Prevention: distribution of TOMS shoes to identified children at-risk; Information Education Communication/Behavioral Change Communication (IEC/BCC) activities and community conversations. 

Treatment: weekly treatment sessions led by health volunteers, with sessions topics focusing on health education, foot hygiene and wound care.  

Shoemaking: establishment of a shoemaking operation in Debre Markos to produce shoes for patients involved in treatment meetings. 

Sustainability and community participation were strengthened through the development of patient-led treatment groups.</narrative>
