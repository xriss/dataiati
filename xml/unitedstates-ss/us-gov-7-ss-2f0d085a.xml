    <narrative xml:lang="EN">The U.S. government is poised to support implementation of the Agreement on the Resolution of the Conflict in the Republic of South Sudan (signed in August 2015), which offers the best chance to put South Sudan on a path towards development. Despite the complex situation created by the conflict, which has caused widespread suffering and left South Sudan&apos;s nascent economy in ruins, there is potential for steps towards consolidated peace by applying lessons learned from previous international engagement in South Sudan. The U.S. government&apos;s approach will therefore prioritize mitigating the war&apos;s human, economic, and social damage; assisting South Sudanese to rebound from trauma; and laying the foundation for a durable and just peace. To accomplish this, the United States will help build resilient and conflict-resistant communities by focusing efforts more intensively on conflict-affected states and areas of potential returns of internally displaced persons. By focusing assistance efforts on subnational and community levels wherever possible, U.S. government programs can more directly help the South Sudanese people, including the most marginalized populations, to benefit from peace dividends and improvements in living conditions. U.S. foreign assistance will continue to operate in close coordination with humanitarian efforts, and will remain flexible and responsive to meet evolving emergency, recovery, and development needs. As a Relief-to-Development Transition focus country, development funds will coordinate with humanitarian funding to support an integrated approach.</narrative>
