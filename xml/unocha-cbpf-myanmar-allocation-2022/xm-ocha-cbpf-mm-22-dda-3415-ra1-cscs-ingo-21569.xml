   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Multi-Sectoral Needs Assessment (MSNA) for Evidence-Based Aid Planning and Delivery in Myanmar</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Myanmar is currently facing a multi-faceted crisis characterized by armed conflict, inter-communal tensions and vulnerability to natural hazards, further complicated by the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19 and the impacts of the February 1st coup.

In order to meet the evolving information needs of humanitarian actors &#x2013; including Clusters, UN agencies, NGOs and civil society organisations &#x2013; REACH, in collaboration with UN OCHA proposes to conduct a Multi-Sector Needs Assessment (MSNA) in order to inform the 2023 Humanitarian Programme Cycle (HPC) process. REACH was formed in 2010 as a joint initiative of ACTED, its global partner IMPACT Initiatives (IMPACT), and UNOSAT, in order to promote and facilitate the development of information products that enhance the humanitarian community&#x2019;s decision-making and planning capacity. IMPACT is programmatic lead of the initiative, in charge of all strategic and programmatic oversight, the HR management of REACH international staff as well as of dissemination and external relations at the global level for REACH. As sister organizations and global partners, IMPACT and ACTED coordinate on field implementation. In all field operations of IMPACT/REACH programs, ACTED provides operational support (country registration, office space, accommodation, cars, national HR recruitment, security). A global MoU between the two organisations governs this partnership, with specific financial reporting requirements and internal reporting deadlines to be agreed and formalised through a project specific agreement. For the proposed action ACTED will be grant holder and will therefore proceed with signing a sub-agreement with IMPACT following signature of the contract between ACTED and OCHA. For the duration of the grant&#x2019;s implementation, REACH will be operating remotely from Bangkok.
The assessment will consist of a multi-sectoral quantitative household (HH) survey across all 15 States and Regions of Myanmar, and is expected to include key clusters including Education, Food Security, Health, Nutrition, Protection, Shelter/Non-Food Item (NFI)/Camp Coordination and Camp Management(CCCM), and Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH), as well as other cross-cutting issues, including Accountability to Affected Populations (AAP) and Disability.

REACH will lead the overall technical implementation of the MSNA and provide oversight to each phase of the MSNA research cycle including: research design, data collection, cleaning, processing, joint inter-sectoral analysis of MSNA data and production of outputs including:
- A Terms of Reference (TOR)
- A Data Analysis Plan (DAP)
- 1 final (clean) household MSNA dataset
- 1 disaggregated descriptive statistics
- 1 preliminary findings presentation

Further outputs will be created outside of this grant period under additional co-funding.

The MSNA will therefore provide data that will directly inform the 2023 Humanitarian Needs Overview (HNO)/Humanitarian Response Plan (HRP), fulfilling Core Commitment 5 of the Grand Bargain through the conduct of a joint, impartial, and collaborative needs assessment.</narrative>
