   <narrative xml:lang="EN">- Gas sector development/value-added processing: two-fold impact of supporting further development of gas as a cleaner and environmentally friendly source of energy, and helping to diversify the Venezuelan economy away from its heavy reliance on the oil sector.  This is particularly important in countries such as Venezuela where oil accounts for about 25% of GDP, 80% of exports and 50% of fiscal revenues.  - Promotion of local value-added to primary products by supporting secondary processing facilities:  about two-thirds of Metor&apos;&apos;s production will be exported, while the balance will be further processed by local downstream customers in making fuel additives to improve vehicle emissions, and for general industrial purposes.  - Create employment opportunities and community impact:  the company employs about 160 people.  Given the economies of scale in petrochemical operations, the expansion project will only require about 40-50 additional permanent workers; however there is a multiplier effect and industry sources estimate there are about 6 indirect jobs created for every one direct.  Up to 2,300 jobs will be supported during the construction phase of the project, about 90% of which will be local.  Eight of the nine-member management teams are locally recruited.  The company contributes about $300,000/year through its Social Responsibility Program, which focuses on housing, health and education for employees and the local community.   - Improve environmental and safety standards:  the project will adopt strict environmental, social and safety standards which, in turn, will provide a demonstration effect to other similar projects in Venezuela.  - Taxes and export earnings:  the project is estimated to pay an incremental $900 million in taxes over the life of the proposed IFC loan.  Although Venezuela generates major foreign exchange receipts from its oil exports, it is nonetheless worth noting the company is forecast to generate about $2.1 billion in exports over the life of the proposed IFC loan.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Metanol de Oriente S.A. (Metor or the company), a Venezuelan company established in 1992, is a leading Latin American producer of methanol with a nameplate capacity of about 750,000 metric tons per year (mtpa).  The company exports about 80% of its output to the U.S. and Europe.  Metor, an IFC client and partner since 1993, has requested an IFC A loan of up to $50 million to help finance the expansion of its existing plant, located at the Jose Petrochemical Complex in the State of Anzoategui, which would increase its production capacity to up to about 1.6 million mtpa. The feedstock for the project would be provided by Petroleos de Venezuela S.A. (PDVSA), the Venezuelan state energy company.  The projects output would be sold through off-take contracts with its three major shareholders (see Sponsor section).  The project is expected to be completed during the last half of 2009.</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project is located in the East Petrochemical Complex (Complejo Petroquimico de Oriente) at Jose.  The Jose complex encompasses a total area of 2,177 hectares, located on the coast approximately midway between Puerto Espiritu and the cities of Barcelona and Puerto Cruz. The site is excellent and well suited for the project from both operations and logistics (for export) standpoints.</narrative>
