   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Summary Of Project Information (SPI)       Project Name    Venezuela - EDC II      RegionLatin America and Caribbean   Sector   Project No010117   Projected Board DateJanuary 10, 2000   Company NameC.A. La Electricidad de Caracas (EDC)   Technical Partner and/or Major Shareholders    	C.A. La Electricidad de Caracas (EDC) is the major private utility in Venezuela and is owned by over 68,000 shareholders, none of which own more than 14% of the company.     Project Cost Including proposed IFC investment    	The proposed investment is an emergency loan to EDC of US$30 million for IFCs own account.    Location of project and Description of site    	Venezuela has been devastated by extensive flooding and mudslides caused by three days of heavy rains from December 15 to 17, 1999. Estimates of the number of dead, in what authorities describe as the worst natural disaster in modern times in Venezuela, vary at this time, but exceed several thousand. In the Caracas area, the poor residents of the shantytowns that climb the mountains surrounding Caracas were particularly affected, leaving many homeless. The hardest-hit area was a 60-mile stretch of coast in Vargas, an area just north of Caracas. Vargas is within the concession area of Electricidad de Caracas. EDC estimates its damages at about US$100 million. In addition, it is incurring extraordinary expenses for emergency work and participation in the rescue operations.    Description of Company and Purpose of Project    	The proposed project is to reinstate electricity service to poor neighborhoods that were devastated by the recent flooding. This includes restoration of public lighting and providing electricity service to small stores, gas stations, remote water and sewage pumping stations, schools, medical clinics and public offices. The bulk of the investment will be focused in the Litoral coastal area where 90% of the 90,000 residences were largely destroyed. Overall, EDC estimates that about eight percent of its electricity distribution system was damaged by the flooding and that the cost of repair will exceed US$100 million.	   EDC has agreed to use the IFC investment exclusively for poor and middle income areas, which are the least profitable sectors of the companys business. The IFC loan will encourage rapid repair of the system in these areas, which otherwise would receive lower priority or be done after and to the extent that the company has received insurance proceeds.    Environmental Category and Issues    	During appraisal of a June 1999 IFC loan to EDC (project number: 009624), it was established that EDC has a strong internal environmental capability and corporate policy. The environmental review summary for this category B project, which was issued on May 24 and is available from the Infoshop, also describes the company&apos;&apos;s approach to the development of distribution infrastructure. EDC has also reconfirmed its intention to comply with all applicable World Bank environmental and social policies and guidelines. Environmental clearance of this loan has therefore been given on the basis that it complements the June 1999 loan and in consideration of the emergency situation in the project area. The emergency loan is believed to be beneficial as it will be used for reconstruction of existing facilities to equivalent or better standards, providing enhanced public safety and street lighting. IFC social specialists will visit the disaster area as soon as possible and advise EDC on project implementation.    The ERS for the June 1999 loan to EDC (project number: 009624) is available from the Infoshop.       Host country location of environmental documents    The ERS for the June 1999 loan to EDC (project number: 009624) is available at:      C.A. La Electricidad de Caracas   Avenida Vollmer   San Bernardino   Apartado 2299   Caracas  1010-A   Venezuela	      Date SPI sent to InfoShop December 27, 1999   This Summary of Project Information is prepared and distributed to the public in advance of consideration of the proposed transaction by the Corporations Board of Directors.  It is provided for the purpose of enhancing the transparency of IFCs activities and should not be construed as presuming the outcome of IFC Board consideration.
