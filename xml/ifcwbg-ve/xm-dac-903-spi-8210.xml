(Movilnet)   Technical Partner and/or Major Shareholders    	Movilnet is a 100% subsidiary of Compania Anonima Nacional Telefonos de Venezuela (C.A.N.T.V.), Venezuelas national and international telecommunications carrier.  CANTV was partially privatized in 1991, when the Government sold 40% of the equity and management control to VenWorld, a consortium owned 51% by GTE Corporation, and transferred 11% of CANTVs equity to employees.  In November 1996, CANTV launched an international initial public offering that resulted in the Government reducing its shareholding from 49% to 14%, and CANTVs shares being listed on the New York and Caracas Stock Exchanges.    Project Cost Including proposed IFC investment    	US$178.4 million (over the 1997-1998 period).  IFC would provide a Senior A Loan of US$25 million for its own account, and syndicate a Senior B Loan of US$50 million for the account of participant banks.    Location of project and Description of site    	Venezuela - nationwide mobile cellular telecommunications network.    Description of Company and Purpose of Project    	Movilnet is one of two companies awarded a 20-year license to operate a national mobile cellular network in Venezuela.  In 1996, Movilnet had net revenues of US$127 million, and total assets of US$324 million.  The project is to help finance Movilnets capital expenditure program for 1997 and 1998, which consists primarily of:  (1) expanding its mobile cellular telephone network throughout the country; (2) providing new services to its subscribers; and (3) continuing its modernization program to install digital technology.  The expansion is expected to increase Movilnets subscriber base from 214,000 at the end of 1996 to 370,000 at the end of 1998.  IFC will continue its catalytic role of mobilizing long-term bank financing, which it began in 1996 with a US$260 million loan to CANTV for modernization and expansion of its network and financial restructuring.

Environmental, occupational health and safety issues associated with this project include:  radio tower site selection, access road alignment and other land acquisition, development of previously undisturbed land, and employee exposure to noise, other physical agents.
