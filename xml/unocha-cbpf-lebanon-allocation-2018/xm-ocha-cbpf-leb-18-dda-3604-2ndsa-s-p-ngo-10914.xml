   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Increase access to basic services and meeting basic and specific needs for the most vulnerable PRS and PRL elderly People  in Tyre Palestinian camps and gatherings</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">What was generally noticed is that elderly people prefer to get money more than any other assistance because they don&#x2019;t trust service providers anymore, but other types of services could be implemented tackling elderly needs, especially clothes and food items. Naba&#x2019;a has deduced that the most beneficial type of intervention is the selective intervention. In fact, targeting families as a whole unit can be unfair to certain groups such as the elderly, the new-babies, the people with disabilities, the pregnant women&#x2026; 
the  proposed 8 months project aims to  Increase access to basic services and meeting basic and specific needs for the most vulnerable PRS and PRL elderly People in Tyre Palestinian camps and gatherings through  Identification of specific needs through registration, recording, verification and profile for Displaced   PRS, and PRL elderly people aged 60 and above . 
-	120 PRS and PRL elderly people sheltering in Tyre camps and gatherings are provided with one shot shelter self-improvement grant rounding $500. Technical assessment will be carried out per each shelter, agreeing the BoQs with each HHs and signing an agreement with both the owner and the renters . the payments will be released in two checks  a percentage of 40% will be paid as soon as the agreement is signed with families , whils the rest amount ( 60%) will be paid when 100% of the work is done . 
-	Persons Displaced from Syria Have their Basic Rights (incl. access to territory, legal stay, civil documentation) Respected and Specific Protection Needs Fulfilled through provide one time emergency fund vary from $100 to $200 according to the type of case  transportation to hospital , basic needs , legal stay ... 
the grant will be targeting approximately 200 elderly whom are in need to urgent cash , while the number of beneficiaries could exceed the planned number due to the amount provided to elderly ( based on case management report )
-	Provision of psycho-social support in three static centers and mobile safe spaces, ( sanabil in RACHIDIEH , Nabaa at buss and burj Chamali though  engaging  the elderly in activities aimed at empowering them and helping them feel useful and needed, such as DIWAN (public speaking series in which the elderly tell their story or a story from their life to the community), TA3LEILY (musical activity between the elderly and youth. Mainly focusing on the old songs elderly share with youth and new songs that youth share with elderly), and Moone (the elderly prepare traditional food supplies &#x2013; can be done with the involvement of youth)
It&#x2019;s obvious that the current emergency we are passing through will  leave behind a lot of traumatic and physical chocks especially on the most vulnerable groups which are the children, women and elderly people as well. But there are a lot of local and International NGOs who are taking care for the children and women issues, but unfortunately without including elderly peoples.The main theme of the mentioned above project  is to enhance the elderly daily life, and encourage them to defense their issues by themselves so their voice is more heard and affected in front of  their community and also emergency service providers , while through this intervention Nabaa aims to enhance the life standards of disadvantaged elderly positively especially those who were affected by the Syrian war and sheltering within tyre camps and gatherings</narrative>
