   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Strengthening Protection of Elderly Women through inclusive SGBV Prevention and Response in Akkar.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The proposed intervention targets elderly women at risk, a vulnerable group whose needs are not adequately addressed by the humanitarian response. The IRC will build on the establishment of a comprehensive Women&#x2019;s Protection and Empowerment (WPE) program in Akkar in 2012 and will adapt it to programming inclusive of elderly. The IRC&#x2019;s proposed intervention will consolidate its ongoing strategy of increasing access to life saving Sexual and gender-based violence (SGBV) prevention and response activities and ongoing community-based interventions to women who have survived or are at risk of SGBV. The proposed intervention will focus on addressing the needs of an underserved target group, elderly women, through inclusive and comprehensive support, including case management, focused and non-focused psychosocial support, community engagement and risk mitigation activities. 
Inspired by the humanitarian inclusion standards for older people , the intervention modalities will include the operation of one mobile team to remote areas of the Akkar and Wadi Khaled. The IRC will also strengthen the protective environment through capacity building with local organizations and associations and will train SGBV and non-SGBV actors on skills and knowledge critical to the provision of quality services for women, including safe referrals.
IRC will continue to collaborate with the Lebanese Red Cross (LRC) mobile team in Akkar where there is a critical gap in services available for SGBV survivors. Through their regular mobile services, LRC can cover a broader spectrum of needs tailored to elderly women. Additionally, LRC is well positioned to provide these critical services, given their extensive acceptance in communities across Lebanon, including entrance to areas inaccessible to many organizations. 
IRC and its partner LRC will implement a similar model of capacity building and support to continue mobile services in Akkar and Wadi Khaled. Additionally, both organizations will aim to build sustainable SGBV capacity across SGBV and non-SGBV actors through targeted capacity building based on a jointly developed training plan. The project will also be an opportunity to enhance collaboration with key governmental actors such as the Ministry of Social Affairs through ensuring coordination and safe referrals to institutional care programmes for the elderly.
Through this action, the IRC will aim to achieve the following results:
1. Elderly women affected by or at risk of SGBV have access to critical response and prevention services through the mobile approach.
2. A protective environment for elderly women within their communities is created through community mobilization and engagement with communities.
3. Capacity of local actors and community members to provide quality comprehensive SGBV response and prevention services through the mobile approach is strengthened.</narrative>
