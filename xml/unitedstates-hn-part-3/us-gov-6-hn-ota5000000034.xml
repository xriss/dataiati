   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Governance refers to the exercise of political, economic, and administrative authority to manage a country&apos;s affairs at all levels, including the capacity to formulate, implement, and enforce public policies and deliver services. Good governance includes modes of administrative authority that are inclusive, participatory, transparent, responsive, effective, and accountable. This includes support for strengthening legislatures and local governments; capacity-building; security sector reform; separation of powers through institutional checks and balances, between the executive and legislative branches, in particular; and avenues within government structures for accountability, oversight and meaningful public participation. In conflict or post-conflict environments, this includes support for reconstruction of state institutions and systems.</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">Alarming levels of crime and violence, high levels of poverty and food insecurity, and ineffective governance and corruption all threaten Honduras&apos; fragile democracy. U.S. foreign assistance plays a critical role in supporting Honduras&apos; development as a safe, democratic, and prosperous nation that offers hope to Hondurans so they see their future in Honduras and not elsewhere. U.S. assistance supports civil society engagement in shaping public policy, a necessary component of a healthy democracy. The President&apos;s Feed the Future (FTF) program also figures prominently in the programs to reduce extreme poverty and increase economic opportunity in the poorest rural areas of the country. These activities will be provided through technical assistance, grants, and loans. By supporting targeted activities in these areas of intervention, USAID will also help address the underlying factors contributing to migration to the United States. In October 2014, the U.S. government launched the U.S. Strategy for Engagement in Central America (Strategy), which complements the work undertaken by national governments and multilateral development banks, to support the priority objectives identified in the Plan of the Alliance for Prosperity in the Northern Triangle. The Strategy focuses on three overarching lines of action: 1) promoting prosperity and regional economic integration; 2) enhancing security through continued and expanded Central America Regional Security Initiative (CARSI) activities; and 3) promoting improved governance. Therefore, the Department of State and USAID&apos;s FY 2017 request of $750.0 million in bilateral and regional assistance for Central America - a part of the Administration&apos;s $1.0 billion whole-of-government request for appropriations and financing assistance to support the Strategy - includes and aligns the resources necessary to increase economic opportunity, reduce extreme violence, strengthen the effectiveness of state institutions, address climate change and food insecurity, and address challenges that have resulted in an influx of migration.</narrative>
