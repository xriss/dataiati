  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">2SCALE is an incubator and accelerator program that manages a portfolio of public private partnerships (PPPs) for inclusive business in agri food sectors and industries. 2SCALE provides a range of support services to Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs), who act as lead firms. Together with producer organizations, agribusiness clusters and other grass root actors, we enable them to produce, transform and supply quality food products to local, national and regional end-user markets, including BoP consumers, while at the same time developing fair and sustainable relations with smallholder farmers and other local entrepreneurs. Partnerships have also been developed with Dutch companies doing business in Africa with inclusive business agendas.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The program focuses on establishing agribusiness clusters around business champions such as entrepreneurial producer organizations or local SMEs that trade or process farmer produce and want to build commercially viable strategies in African food industries through: &#x2022; sustainable sourcing, based on mutually beneficial relations with smallholder farmers, and &#x2022; by serving local and regional Base-of-the-Pyramid (BoP) markets. These companies are the drivers of inclusive business; they are called inclusive business champions. The program supports these champions to develop BoP products and markets. The program intends to set up and support partnership and business models with significant potential to attract and employ the youth, to engage and empower women, and to improve food and nutrition security, both at grassroots level and at the consumer end of the value chain. Specific goals have been formulated, related to the FNS result framework of the Dutch Ministry in regards the number of BoP consumers, farmers, MSMEs (including POs) and across these groups specific targets for women and youth, of which the terms of inclusion or terms of access to food will be improved: &#x2022; Improve access to nutritious food in 40 BoP markets, and for at least one million BoP consumers, through inclusion in value chains and local-end markets. &#x2022; Empower, improve productivity and net incomes of 750,000 farmers (50% women, 40% youth) through inclusion in agribusiness clusters and (regional) value chains. &#x2022; Support 250 small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs, of which at least 125 female-led) to improve their inclusive business activities; and to develop leadership in industry platforms / networks. &#x2022; Strengthen capacity of 5,000 micro, small and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs, of which at least 2,500 are female-led and 1,000 are young entrepreneurs) through inclusion in value chains4.[1] &#x2022; Create 20,000 additional non-farming jobs (of which at least 10,000 for women and 8,000 for youth).</narrative>
