   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project was to send a fourth team of health care personnel to support the fight against Ebola in Sierra Leone coordinated by DFID. The medical staff was deployed by the Danish Defence, which was responsible for the selection, training and monitoring of the team. The task was to treat Ebola patients and train international and local health workers. Upon an appeal from DFID, a request was made to the Danish MFA for funding to enable the deployment of a fourth Danish Team from April 2015 to continue the previous work of team 1-3. After the MFA approval of an amount of 3,3 million DKK, the Danish Defence initiated the recruitment. The composition of team 4 included one military team leader, five doctors, five nurses and tree bio analysts - a total of 14 persons. Team 4 deployed from Denmark to UK on 12 April 2015 for an initial &#xBF;pre-deployment Ebola treatment training&#xBF; in London. On April 20 2015 the team deployed to Sierra Leone. Upon arrival, it was assessed that the number of patients suffering from Ebola had decreased drastically. Subsequently additional tasks were undertaken by the team, such as health care advice to locally employed staff. Initially team 4 was accommodated in the International Humanitarian Partnership (IHP) camp, established and run by the Danish Emergency Management Agency. As the demand for the IHP Camp reduced with time, it was decided to shut down the camp. Consequently team 4 moved to another base camp on 10 May 2015. After various modifications the camp was considered suitable for accommodation in relation to health conditions and infrastructure. Despite this assessment an increase occurred in the number of stomach infections among the personnel. The specific source of these infections was not detected. As the number of Ebola patients continued to fall in numbers there was an surplus capacity of treatment facilities in the area. As a result, team 4 terminated and returned to Denmark on 10 June 2015 as initially planned.</narrative>
