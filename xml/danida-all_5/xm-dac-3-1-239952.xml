   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Due to 20 years of war and repeating draughts Somalia is in one of the world&#xBF;s biggest and longest lasting humanitarian crises. During that past year the situation has deteriorated. One million people are in an acute need of lifesaving food support &#xBF; a number that has increased with 20 % in 2014. Additional 2.1 million need humanitarian assistance to not fall back into an acute need for food. The number of malnourished children is alarmingly high with 218.000 acutely malnourished children under five hereof 20 % so malnourished that they will die if they are not given medical treatment and food. Most of these people are internally displaced and are relocated in the conflicted southern and central regions where humanitarian access is still a challenge. The deteriorated situation is caused by a combination of negative factors among these conflict, a rise in the price of food, climate and reduced humanitarian access. In addition financing of humanitarian aid in Somalia is historically low. The UN&#xBF;s strategic response plan for 2014, USD 933 million, is only financed by 39 percent.</narrative>
