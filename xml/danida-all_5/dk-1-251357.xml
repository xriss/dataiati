   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The overall objective is to address the critical and ongoing physical and psychosocial needs of vulnerable displaced families affected by the shocks of displacement and the lasting impact of the conflict with Islamic State. The project addresses the needs of displaced populations in Ninewa, Dohuk and Kirkuk Governorates. Through its activities the project aims to: 1) meet the basic needs of displaced people, both immediately after displacement and as the extension of the crisis necessitates further assistance for the most vulnerable (by providing 550 newly displaced families with immediate relief items, and reaching 600 families who have been displaced for some time with hygiene kits and hygiene awareness); 2) promote the psychological and social recovery and resilience of children and youth affected by the conflict (reaching 1,500 children and 750 youth with child-friendly and youth-friendly spaces); 3) enable basic sanitation conditions for families returning to their place of origin (supporting 300 households with cash for work for sanitation facilities); and 4) strengthen local organisations which represent most-vulnerable groups to overcome gaps in capacity and mind-set to meet the needs of displaced people and promote reconciliation (by providing training and setting goals for improvements with 1 local NGO).</narrative>
