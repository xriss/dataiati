   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project support the construction of new buildings at Calmette General Hospital in Phnom Penh which is the only public hospital in Cambodia capable of performing specialist medical treatment. 

The construction of the new buildings as well as the furbishing of the National Cancer Center is a prerequisite to the much needed capacity expansion in terms of bed capacity to deal with all the referrals from hospitals across Cambodia and subsequently the job creation.

The HR staffing plans are an integral part of the project, and included in the scoping of the project and as the Calmette hospital also serves as the only teaching and university hospital in the country, the majority of the staffing will be managed through increase in capacity in student-intake.</narrative>
