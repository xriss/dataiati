   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Danish support allows targeting young rural entrepreneurs and the provision of advisory services. Three key steps in the promotion of rural youth entrepreneurship and talent retention is foreseen:

1)	Pre-financing support, which will include information dissemination to attract young rural talent to the scheme, thus ensuring that the highest impact in terms of income and job generation is achieved. Subsequently, potential applicants will receive pre-financing training aimed at filling business gaps. 

2)	Finance and business launch facilitation which will focus on assisting applications in developing bankable business plans, which comply with banks&#x2019; requirements. IFAD will provide matching grants to successful applicants who have secured credit from banks and subsidies from IFAD. Financially, the matching grant constitutes the core of the support and will constitute 40% of the investment cost up to USD 25,000. 

3)	Post-financing support and impact evaluation, will follow up on the businesses financed and assist those who face particular challenges thus ensuring higher success and repayment rates. Moreover, specific efforts will be made to evidence the impact made in terms of incomes, employment and rural poverty reduction.</narrative>
