   <narrative xml:lang="EN">1. Shelters have been strengthened internally through capacity building of staff in core shelter competencies to ensure a shared understanding of the methodological approach to working with VAW.

2. A shared professional platform for Afghan shelters has been formalized with a secretariat to ensure and strengthen collaboration across the shelter organisations and to strengthen the network for political and professional cooperation as well as exchange of experiences.

3. The link between partner organisations / shelters and other actors working in the field of VAW in Afghanistan is strengthened (including the local and government authorities, other NGOs and international donors).</narrative>
