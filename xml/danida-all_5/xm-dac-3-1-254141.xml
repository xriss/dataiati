Description
The overall long-term vision of the LO/FTF Council Partnership Programme in the MENA region is to contribute to industrial peace and social dialogue in the labour market and to the development of sound democratic trade union organisations, thereby contributing to economic growth and job generation.

The fundamental right-based strategic approach of the programme is based on the development assumption, that protection of civil rights is not only a prerequisite for the construction of a democratic society, but is equally important to obtain economic growth, the latter which in turn is required to reduce the level of poverty and thereby secure the economic and social rights of the population. Throughout the region, the trade union movement plays a fundamental role in fighting for and/or safeguarding both the social and economic rights and the civil and democratic rights. 

The program includes partnership activities in Morocco, Tunisia, Egypt and Jordan as well as continued dialogue activities under the two established MENA-DK networks on youth and equality, respectively.</narrative>
