  </title>
  <description type="2" xml:lang="EN">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The support consists of two development engagements: 

The objective of development engagement 1 is: &#x201C;Energy Efficiency Building Codes are developed and introduced with the aim of gradual enforcement in Georgia; labelling of energy efficiency levels on products are enforced and in line with European standards; national monitoring and reporting on end-users energy consumption is reformed and in line with EUROSTAT methodologies and legislation on integration of renewable energy into national power system is introduced&#x201D;.

The engagement is based on a government-to-government agreement between the Georgian Ministry of Energy and the Danish Ministry of Foreign Affairs (DMFA) to support Georgia&#x2019;s efforts in ensuring its compliance with the requirements of the AA/DCFTA with EU regarding energy efficiency and sustainable energy. 

The support is implemented by the Danish company NIRAS that won the public tender.

The objective of development engagement 2 is: &#x201C;Energy efficient building design demonstrated in buildings through the energy renovation of public buildings in selected municipalities and supporting capacity building&#x201D;.

A Trust Fund Agreement, between DMFA and the Nordic Environment Finance Corporation (NEFCO) is established for the provision of Danish support through a window to Georgia. 

Funds are earmarked to (1) finance technical assistance and capacity building activities related to  demonstration of energy efficiency and renovation demonstration showcases in public buildings (2) train and certify a pool of energy auditors and (3) develop energy awareness campaigns in municipalities. The implementation of energy saving measures in public buildings will be financed by NEFCO loans up to 37.5 million DKK and supplementary grant from EBRD&apos;s environment window (E5P;  Eastern Europe Energy Efficiency and Environment Partnership) with an expected ratio of 60/40.</narrative>
