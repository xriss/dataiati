   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Strategic Sector Cooperation on Health is a peer-to-peer cooperation between the Danish ministry of Health and the mexican Federal Secretariat of Health / Secretariat of Health in the state of Tabasco. The cooperation will strengthen capacity in primary healthcare and the management of pharmaceuticals in Mexico.


A Strategic Sector Cooperation (SSC) is a partnership aiming at improving sector framework conditions in a partner country. The initiative is a flexible and adaptive instrument for exchanging experiences, learning and capacity building, which builds on a consolidated strong relationship and trust between the involved authorities. The commitment to finance the Danish authorities&#x2019; participation is sequenced in phases; an inception phase of approximately one year resulting in a project document; followed by phase one, two and &#x2013;if need be &#x2013; a phase three during which the cooperation is deepened and developed. All SSC partnerships are supported by a sector advisor at the embassy, who impel progress and stir the partnership in the direction agreed upon. Annually, the SSC projects deliver a report on project progress and results achieved. Progress on selected outputs are displayed in openaid.

In order to prepare a phase 2 of the SSC cooperation, phase 1 has been extended to 2021.</narrative>
