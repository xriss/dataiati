   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Danida Innovation &amp; Business Explorer (DIBE) offers financial support to Danish companies, including start-ups, that wish to investigate concrete business opportunities contributing to the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals and the Paris agreement. The programme has covered 3 rounds of energy audits in Morocco of hotels and a university hospital. For all hotels, the technical audits revealed huge potential for energy saving within HVAC, pumps, insulation, heating systems, hot water production and lightining. The latest audit was done after the signing of an MoU with the Moroccan Ministry of Energy &#x2013; AMEE &#x2013; where the agreement is that the AMEE will appoint a pilot project within the public sector and use this as demonstration project for both the private and the public sector. The end goal is to implement the project at the Hospital through the company DEEP P/S &#x2013; a Danish EE company jointly owned with the SDG-fund managed by IFU providing the equity while debt financing will be provided through local banks. EKF to provide a K6 export guarantee based on Danish manufacturers and service providers taking part in the project. In all the Business Explorer has enhanced DEM&apos;s knowledge and understanding of Moroccan market opportunities and business culture but first and foremost it has steered our approach in the direction of including ministerial entities into the business model thus insuring project due diligence and credibility for all parties.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Dansk Energi Management (DEM) embarks on a process that could lead to large sweeping energy efficiency in office buildings in Morocco. This will be done by producing independent analysis of the potential savings that are guaranteed and access to financing, via EKF guaranteed loan with collateral on only the equipment delivery.  The concept focuses on Danish suppliers to become the main suppliers. The type of equipment DEM identifies as worn out can be replaced with Danish high-tech components from Danfoss, Grundfos, Velux, Rockwool, Kampstrup Metro, Logstor etc.</narrative>
