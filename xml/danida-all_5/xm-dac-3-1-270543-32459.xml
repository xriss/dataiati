creating a conducive environment for productive dialogues among various stakeholder groups.

     <actual value="The project was organizing a national conference in April 2019 designed to bring together representatives of Libyan constituencies and agree on steps necessary to end the transition.

In the aftermath of the postponement of the National Conference, UNSMIL and UNDP organized two consultation meetings in May and June 2019 with a number of the original invitees to hear from the stakeholders their views on what Libyan political engagement was possible to support UNSMIL&#x2019;s efforts to end to the current conflict. Participants included revolutionaries, supporters of the former regime, Islamists, the National Alliance, the business sector, NGOs, women and youth. They proposed a number of solutions including a way to address distribution of wealth. These meetings were funded under the Danish contribution."></actual>
