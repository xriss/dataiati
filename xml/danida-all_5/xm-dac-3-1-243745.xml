   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The overall objective of the program is to ensure that populations affected by the Iraqi crisis receive efficient and adequate humanitarian assistance. Specifically, the action will enhance the access to health care services for the populations directly affected by the Iraqi Crisis reaching 70,000 beneficiaries of the most vulnerable populations in three governorates in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq and in Baghdad governorate. 

The programme will ensure that internally displaced and vulnerable host communities in Iraq have improved access to primary health care services provided by four IRCS Mobile Medical Units - MMU (Result I). Furthermore, the health of the displaced Iraqi populations and vulnerable host communities will be improved through health and hygiene promotion and participate in health awareness activities (Result 2). Special emphasis will be put on enhancing the medical and health promotion services to marginalised groups and to minorities, including vulnerable Yazidi and Christian IDPs. Medical and health services activities will be provided for both Syrian refugees and IDPs, living in camps, informal settlements or in host communities. The activities comprise the provision of primary health care services, disease prevention and hygiene promotion activities and referral to specialised services. 

Through this programme, IDPs and refugees will reduce their suffering and become empowered to better cope with their difficult living conditions. Host communities will also benefit from the MMU activities as the IDPs in many cases live amongst families in the host communities.</narrative>
