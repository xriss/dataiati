  <description type="2" xml:lang="EN">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project is aimed at improving local governance systems and practices in Belarus through catalytic pilot engagements with government institutions at the central and local level, civil society organizations, the private sector, and academic/training institutions in the country, by incorporating transparency, accountability and human rights based approaches in local governance policies and practices through capacity development and practical pilot solutions at the local level.

Specific objectives:
1.	To improve the system of civil servants&#x2019; selection, training and performance assessment based on best international experience in order to enhance the local level civil servants&#x2019; abilities and possibilities for engaging citizens in the planning, monitoring and evaluation of local governance processes through capacity building activities, as well as through development of necessary methodologies and legal frameworks (as specified in Project Output 1). 

2.	To develop mechanisms to ensure inclusive participation of citizens in local governance processes and programs, in particular with regards to public service delivery at the local level by piloting mechanisms and platforms through which local governments can deliver more efficient, transparent and responsive public services, as well as for citizens to provide feedback to inform its delivery at local level (as specified in Project Output 2).</narrative>
