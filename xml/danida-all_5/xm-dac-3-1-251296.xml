   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The priority of this project is to offer a holistic and comprehensive response to improve children&#xBF;s protection and wellbeing, through the provision of in-kind assistance in Syria, and through setting up static/mobile child protection teams to address CP concerns, to provide basic education and advance educators teaching skills and knowledge, especially on interactive teaching methodologies and psychosocial support. 
In order to ensure that vulnerable children and their caregivers have access to quality psychosocial support, child protection and non-formal education services in Southern Syria, Save the Children will support four child protection teams that may be either mobile or center-based depending upon the security situation on the ground, to run child protection and education activities specifically adapted to the Syria crisis context. Basic education is also integrated into the proposed CFS interventions because access to education is a fundamental right even in crisis situations and because of the impact education has on the cognitive development of the child.

This project will contribute to meeting basic needs of vulnerable households in Syria. Save the Children aims at providing 10,000 household hygiene kits and 2,500 layette baby kits to the most vulnerable households. Finally, the project will improve the learning experience in schools in Southern Syria through provision of learning and recreational materials for 40 schools.</narrative>
