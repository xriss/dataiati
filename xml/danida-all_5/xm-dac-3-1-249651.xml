   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The grant supports the SOS B&#xF8;rnebyerne project: Let me learn and play

The aim of the Let Me Play and Learn project was to improve the opportunities for the children&#x2019;s play and learning at Chanika and Zingizwa ward in Ilala Muncipal Dar es Salaam. The project was originally a three-year project, which was extended for a year and was implemented between 2017 and 2020. The main focus was to improve the learning environment and strengthen the quality of education in the project area. Furthermore, the project supported out-of-school children to re-enter school by developing the capacity of a Government-led accelerated learning programme also known as the MEMKWA and provide pre-school children a stimulating and playful environment in nursery school and let children age 4-6 benefit from a caring and stimulating environment in a model community day care centre. The project and the activities were in line with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG 4 on quality education) and Tanzania vision 2025, which both focus on addressing inequality, provision of quality education, health care, and child protection.</narrative>
