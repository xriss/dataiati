   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Danish contribution to LDCF in 2019 amounted to 150 m DKK making Denmark the 6th largest donor to the Fund. The LDCF has been successfully providing services tailored exclusively to Least Developed Countries (LDCs) which face challenging circumstances to adapt to the impacts of climate change. The LDCF remains the only fund entirely dedicated to supporting climate adaptation action in LDCs. By April 30, 2018, 51 LDCs accessed a total of $1.25 billion for 260 projects from the LDCF for the preparation and implementation of National Adaptation Programmes of Action (NAPAs) and the National Adaptation Plan (NAP) process, through project investments and enabling activities. 
The goal of the LDCF Adaptation strategy is to strengthen resilience and reduce vulnerability to the adverse impacts of climate change in developing countries, and support their efforts to enhance adaptive capacity. To achieve this goal, the strategy emphasizes three strategic objectives for the LDCF:
&#x2022; Objective 1: Reduce vulnerability and increase resilience through innovation and technology transfer for climate change adaptation 
Objective 2: Mainstream climate change adaptation and resilience for systemic impact; and
&#x2022; Objective 3: Foster enabling conditions for effective and integrated climate change adaptation.</narrative>
