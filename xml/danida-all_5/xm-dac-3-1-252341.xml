   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Danish Agribusiness Fund (DAF) is a public-private-partnership investment fund established by IFU in cooperation with MFA and Danish Pension Funds. The overall purpose of the fund was to contribute to sustainable economic growth, improved competitiveness and decent employment in developing countries by enhancing profitable and sustainable investments within agricultural production, food processing and related industries based on input of Danish capital, technology and know-how. DAF will invest in projects, which in addition to strong business cases, will generate significant development effects, such as employment, food production and safety, smallholder inclusion, transfer of know-how and technology etc.

It was envisaged that DAF would be invested from 2016 &#x2013; 2021 and that a total of about DKK 615 million would be invested in around 25 projects. DAF was established with a total capital of DKK 800 million of which DKK 300 million was provided by MFA and IFU and the remaining DKK 500 million by three Danish pension funds. Only about 50% of the funds have been invested. With the establishment of the SDG Fund in 2018 it was decided that the role of DAF should be integrated into the SDG Fund and no new DAF investments should be initiated. In 2018 it was further decided to integrate Landbrugsinvesteringsfaciliteten (with the MFA commitment to DAF) and three IFU operated facilities were integrated into IFU&#x2019;s ground capital

The objective of DAF is to contribute to sustainable economic growth in developing countries by enhancing profitable and sustainable investments within agricultural production, food processing and related industries.

The main indicators include:

&#x2022;	DKK 626 million invested during the period 2016 &#x2013; 2021
&#x2022;	Investment in 25 projects during 2016 &#x2013; 2021
&#x2022;	13,000 direct jobs out of which at least 30% will  be women created by 2025. Indirect employment generation is expected to be at least at the same level.
&#x2022;	IRR of at least 12%
&#x2022;	New techn</narrative>
