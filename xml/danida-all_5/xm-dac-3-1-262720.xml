   <narrative xml:lang="EN">According to the latest Annual Report, the YEI MDTF at the end of 2019 had committed $15 million (77% of the funds available) and disbursed $492,607 (3%). The results expected from 2019 activities include the capacity building of over 1,400 youth-led MSMEs and start-ups, with subsequent access to finance for at least 40% of them; improved business environment for young entrepreneurs in 3 countries; and maximized impact for youth employment of two Bank projects. These outputs will contribute to the creation of 2,240 direct jobs.

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In 2018, Denmark granted 25 million DKK over four years as its second contribution to the African Development Bank&#x2019;s &#x2018;Youth Entrepreneurship and Innovation Multi-Donor Trust Fund&#x2019; (YEI MDTF) in support of the implementation of the Bank&#x2019;s &#x2018;Strategy for Jobs for Youth in Africa, 2016-2022&#x2019;. The purpose of the YEI MDTF is i.a. to address youth unemployment and the root causes of forced economic migration.

Creating jobs and business opportunities for young women and men in Africa is a primary concern for Denmark. Support to YEI is highly relevant for Danish development policy priorities as outlined in e.g. Denmark&#x2019;s strategy for development cooperation &#x2018;The World We Share&#x2019;. YEI is particularly relevant to SDG 8.

The implementation of YEI MDTF activities spans across three major components: i) facilitating access to Business Development Services and finance for youth-led start-ups and MSMEs through Enterprise Support Organisations; ii) facilitating technical assistance to governments allowing them to create an enabling environment conducive to entrepreneurship, business growth and job creation; and iii) increasing knowledge and evidence on entrepreneurship ecosystems, enabling environment and designing projects with high employment outcomes for young people.</narrative>
