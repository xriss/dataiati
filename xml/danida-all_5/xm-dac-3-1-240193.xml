   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The NAMA Facility was set up by Germany and the UK in 2013. 
Through the NAMA Facility, Denmark seeks to attribute to demonstration short-term of successful leverage of finance for implementation of ambitious and transformational NAMAs. The facility provides funding for technical support and institutional and regulatory capacity development combined with or closely linked to development financial instruments to leverage public and private finance.
The NAMA Facility is at present the predominant international financing mechanism for supporting implementation of NAMAs in particular as the Green Climate Fund is not yet operational. The UK and DE have up until now allocated Euro 119 million and both countries pledged additional funding for 2015/2016 in December 2014 at COP20 in Lima. The Facility is open for other multi- and bilateral donors. Through Climate Envelope 2014 Denmark joined the NAMA Facility as an additional donor providing financing amounting to DKK 73.8 million for a third call announced by the Facility at COP20. The EU Commission also contributed Euro 15 million to the Facility.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The objective of the NAMA Facility is to facilitate transformation towards a low carbon society in countries with NAMA Support Projects. This is achieved by supporting the realisation of ambitious NAMAs in climate-relevant sectors in developing countries and emerging economies. This contributes to direct reductions of Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions and shows how nationally adapted, but also ambitious, NAMAs can be financed and implemented, thus encouraging and enabling more countries to develop NAMAs and mobilise additional public and private financing.</narrative>
