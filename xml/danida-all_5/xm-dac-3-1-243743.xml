   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project helped vulnerable displaced families, and particularly women and children, to meet their immediate needs and rebuild a sense of normalcy as they recover psychologically from the traumas of their displacement. Over 10,500 displaced people have been assisted through this project in northern Iraq, including Dohuk, Ninewa and Kirkuk Governorates. The project provided for basic needs in the form of cash (reaching 432 families) and non-food items (reaching 1,424 families) to existing and newly displaced populations. This was complimented by psychosocial support activities which focused on the specific needs of women (reaching 153 women) and children (reaching 902 children). These activities promoted a return to normal childhood activities and helped affected women recovery positively from the specific difficulties they experienced.</narrative>
