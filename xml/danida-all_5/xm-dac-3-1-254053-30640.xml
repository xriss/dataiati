Result:
4437 Tunisian HRDs from different regions in Tunisia participated in joint events with EuroMed Rights within the fields of EU-Tunisia relations, justice reform, women&apos;s rights, eco-soc rights and migration. At least 50 events were done in partnership with or through support to EuroMed Rights partners. Through several field missions to the regions, new organisations were supported and included in networking activities. A meeting in January with key partners confirmed that the thematic priorities identified in 2015 were still the most relevant to continue in 2016 and they were throughout the year discussed at coordination meetings with partners and members.  CSOs involved in partnerships with EuroMed Rights were further able to exchange experience, build capacity in relation to EU-Tunisia relations with regards to these themes.</narrative>
