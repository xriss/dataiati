   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The overall objective is to consolidate a local demcratic governance that encourages local inclusive economic development and the integration of unemployed, particularly women and young persons, in the employment market.   
The three main areas of intervention of the project are: 
1) Support to decentralisation and democratic transition with a focus on the central government led decentralisation reform process; 
2) Support to strengthen the capacities of municipalities in terms of local governance and service delivery with a point of departure in the twelve municipalities that have already been supported, to which others will be added; 
3) Support to strengthening the capacities of municipalities in terms of local economic development in view of promoting employment and the economic attractiveness of selected cities.
Through the three intervnetion areas, the project aims to enhance the participation of partner municipalities in the drafting and review of legislative and core texts, in particular the organic law on municipalities (communes); moreover that 50 % of the partner municipalities have put in place a new tool or project in the area of urban democratic governance and 50 % of the partner municipalities have put in place a new tool or project for local economic development that encourages the integration of unemployed particularly women and young persons in the employment market.</narrative>
