   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The overall development goal of WWF DK&apos;s Framework Agreement is one planet future where people live in harmony with nature. The immediate objective is that Civil Society effectively exercise their rights and are enabled to participate in influencing decisions related to sustainable use and equitable sharing of benefits from natural resources and environmental services for the long term prosperity of nature and people. WWF DK has with the Framework Agreement in 2015 been implementing work in two geographic regions - East Africa, which covered work in Uganda, Kenya, Tanzania and Mozambique and the Greater Mekong which covered work in Vietnam and Myanmar. WWF DK has been working both at the regional, the national and the local levels. In these regions WWF DK has been working in tree sectors namely the forest sector, the seafood sector and the energy sector. Within these tree sectors WWF DK has been working with 4 areas of intervention, which is 1) Empowerment, where civil society has been empowered to influence and work with government and private sector towards sustainable use/management of natural resources in focus sectors, 2) Governance, an enabling environment for civil society engagement and social, economic and environmental sustainability in focus sectors has been created, 3) Sustainable market transformation, where partnerships between civil society, private sector and/or governments for innovative market based solutions within focus sectors have been promoted, 4) Conservation for development, where the inter-linkages between a healthy environment and human wellbeing in a local to global perspective have been promoted. The main target groups and beneficiaries under the Framework Agreement are: CSOs and networks, community groups and small scale producer groups, the private sector including processors, buyers, retailers, suppliers and investors and the governance institutions at local, national, regional and international level.</narrative>
