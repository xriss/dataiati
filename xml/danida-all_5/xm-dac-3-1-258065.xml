   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Strategic Sector Cooperation on Health is a peer-to-peer cooperation between the Danish Ministry of Health and the Vietnamese Ministry of Health. Through the cooperation, the Vietnamese ministry will strengthen primary healthcare in Vietnam for prevention, detection and management of non-communicable diseases at primary health care level.

A Strategic Sector Cooperation (SSC) is a partnership aiming at improving sector framework conditions in a partner country. The initiative is a flexible and adaptive instrument for exchanging experiences, learning and capacity building, which builds on a consolidated strong relationship and trust between the involved authorities. The commitment to finance the Danish authorities&#x2019; participation is sequenced in phases; an inception phase of approximately one year resulting in a project document; followed by phase one, two and &#x2013;if need be &#x2013; a phase three during which the cooperation is deepened and developed. All SSC partnerships are supported by a sector advisor at the embassy, who impel progress and stir the partnership in the direction agreed upon. Annually, the SSC projects deliver a report on project progress and results achieved. Progress on selected outputs are displayed in openaid.

2019 marked the successful completion of phase 1 of the project. 
the project was assigned 298.104 DKK in additional funding, for preperation of Phase 2. Due to restrictions caused by Covid19, the preperation of phase 2 has been delayed, but is expected to be finalised medio 2021.</narrative>
