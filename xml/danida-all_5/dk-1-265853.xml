   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The thematic programme will seek to help Niger address the many development and security challenges facing the country through a series of strategically targeted actions carried out through a range of selected actors identified as vectors of positive change. This will be done through four engagements: In the area of security, the programme will principally buttress the capacity of the Haute Autorit&#xE9; pour la Consolidation de la Paix (HACP) to provide both short and long term responses to communities at risk, thereby furthering Danish support provided through multi-donor interventions since 2012 (EU in particular). As implementing partner of this development engagement, UNDP will accompany HACP in its efforts. The preservation and extension of the democratic space will be promoted through support to two independent institutions, the National Human Rights Commission (CNDH) and the High Council for Communications (CSC), and to civil society organisations (CSOs) working in the field of human rights, the media, and conflict transformation. This will be complementary to the long-standing support of the Danish Institute for Human Rights to actors in this field (since 1994).  Work to further the demographic transition and increase reproductive health rights will be carried out via the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), in continuation of Denmark&#x2019;s support of UNFPA&#x2019;s existing Country Programme (2014-2017). A large part of UNFPA&#x2019;s work is carried out by downstream CSO partners. In the domain of migration, the program seeks to contribute to strengthening the management of migration flows in Niger, including preventing irregular migration and helping migrants who wish to return home. The project will be implemented by IOM in close collaboration with central and local authorities.</narrative>
