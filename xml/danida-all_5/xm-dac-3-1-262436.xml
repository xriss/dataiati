     <narrative xml:lang="EN">SSC contributions in 2019 to framework conditions within efficient and low carbon heating and cooling in Turkey: &quot;4 &quot;.

Score from 1-5, 1 lowest and 5 highest.

The planned output targets in the project have been met in 2019.

Heating:
Throughout 2019, continued good progress was witnessed in the SSC on heating &amp; cooling.
Crucial support was provided both in terms of increased capacity, improved knowledge about current framework conditions and to some extend drafting new legislation. Thereby important input to improving relevant framework conditions within the area of heating has been obtained.

OSW
2019 marked the only year of a shortened Phase I of the new OSW track in the SSC project in Turkey on energy. The progress throughout this year was good and activities were completed in accordance to plan. 
There has generally been a strong support and interest for the activities conducted in 2019 with high-level participation of Turkish stakeholders in meetings and workshops. Furthermore, there has been open dialogues - both in terms of Danish experiences, how to use these in a Turkish context and next steps to develop an improved framework for OSW development in Turkey.</narrative>
