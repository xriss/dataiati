   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The aim of the project is to promote sustainable market development in Ethiopia by increasing productivity of local and smallholder farmers in the dairy value chain, and to enhance the nutritional value of high-quality milk-based products to fight malnutrition. In contrast to previous efforts in Ethiopia, the GAIN Nordic Partnership will drive development through a &#x201C;pull approach&#x201D; by i) stabilizing and increasing demand for local dairy products through local marketing and communication efforts, ii) working closely with local processors on product and process innovation, and iii) supporting smallholder farmers to improve quality, safety and yields of milk and access to market through regular milk collection. On this bases, sustainable market development can be developed for all actors in the value chain; serving as an inclusive business model for scaling up potentially also in other regions and countries. The project is driven by Arla Foods Ingredients (AFI), who has a strategic interest in supplying ingredients for nutritious affordable food products targeting low-income markets. In collaboration with GAIN, DanChurchAid, and Danish Industries, and local partner Loni Agro Industry PLC, the partners will ensure sustainability and scalability of the solution from a comprehensive dairy value chain perspective. 
The Danida Market Development Partnerships programme (DMDP) is designed to support commercially oriented partnerships for sustainable market development in developing countries. In addition to reporting on individually determined outputs and outcomes, all DMDP projects report on five key programme indicators. These five indicators are the same for the whole project portfolio, enabling strategic and programme level monitoring, and aggregation of results.
At the programme level, three key outcomes which are related to three of the five key programme indicators, have been chosen for results reporting: Outcome 1: Increased employment (decent jobs) for women, men and</narrative>
