   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Somalia and the Horn of Africa are well on the way to become another one of the worlds forgotten humanitarian crises. More than 2 million Somalis have been displaced protracted crisis that has lasted 25 years and affected three generations of Somalis. In Somalia the combination of armed conflict and violence, food insecurity, drought, and the destruction of housing due to floods have led to an almost chronic humanitarian catastrophe. On the Horn these factors have caused mixed migration flows, encompassing both refugees and migrants.

UNHCR&apos;s humanitarian response in the Horn of Africa aims at aiding the Somali refugees and internally displaced people along with their host communities. The aid will cover both the most immediate needs for food, water, shelter, health and protection along with longer-term solutions aiming at making people self-supporting. UNHCR&apos;s plan is to support a sustainable repatriation and reintegration in Somalia, where this is made possible by safe and dignified conditions.</narrative>
