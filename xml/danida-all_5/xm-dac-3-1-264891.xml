Since 2003 the U4 Anti-Corruption Resource Centre has studied how corruption threatens development outcomes. Together with global research networks and practitioners, it pursues emerging topics and
advance the anti-corruption field. It is a unique multi-donor partnership under the Christian Michelsen Institute in Bergen, Norway and is hailed as one of the leading resource centres with regard to the topic of fighting corruption, and provides assistance and services to both members, developing countries and donors. U4 supplements Danish governance
programmes in partner countries among others by providing anti-corruption trainings. As a member of U4, Danida also benefits from privileged access to the U4 knowledge and resources among others through their helpdesk and to the network and expertise of other U4 members such as Australia, Finland, Germany, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland and the UK. The membership fee of 222,000 Euro per year is equivalent to core funding and the work plan and budget are based on
U4&#x2019;s overall organisation strategy.
