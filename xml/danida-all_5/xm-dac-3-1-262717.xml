   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project is a partnership between Arla, SEGES, CARE and CORET to support job creation and market driven sustainable growth in the dairy value chain in Nigeria. The objective is to establish a well-functioning dairy value chain in Nigeria. The project will achieve this objective through training and capability building, so farmers produce more and better-quality milk; dairies produce more and better products; market for local dairy products is developed; and collaboration among key stakeholders in the dairy value chain is improved. By creating a stronger commercial link to the formal market, the goal is that the beneficiaries &#x2013; farm clusters related to MILCOPAL and Godilogo Farms &#x2013; will be long-term partners of Arla and locally produced dairy products will be part of an Arla Nigeria brand. The project model is open-ended and scalable, so involvement of more beneficiaries in the project is an option.
The Danida Market Development Partnerships programme (DMDP) is designed to support commercially oriented partnerships for sustainable market development in developing countries. In addition to reporting on individually determined outputs and outcomes, all DMDP projects report on five key programme indicators. These five indicators are the same for the whole project portfolio, enabling strategic and programme level monitoring, and aggregation of results.
At the programme level, three key outcomes which are related to three of the five key programme indicators, have been chosen for results reporting: Outcome 1: Increased employment (decent jobs) for women, men and youth. Outcome 2: Increased income opportunities from improved market linkages. Outcome 3: Additional capital raised (investment leverage).</narrative>
