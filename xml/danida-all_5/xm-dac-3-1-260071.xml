   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Training Seminar on Performance Audit with Environmental Perspective</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2" xml:lang="EN">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">At the request by the State Audit of Vietnam (SAV), a training seminar will be held on 25-26 October 2016 with participation of two experts from the State Auditor of Denmark. The seminar&#xBF;s objective is to improve SAV&#xBF;s capacity in carrying out performance audits with environmental perspective, an area where SAV has not had much experience and skills. 

The seminar will be organized in the form of an interactive training with group work sessions with a view to create a targeted and practice-oriented learning environment where participants are inspired to develop approaches and tools for concrete audits. Around 40 audit experts and staff of SAV are expected to attend the training. The Embassy and SAV will co-fund the seminar. 

The activity is committed in the action plan 2016 under the Vietnam-Denmark Comprehensive Partnership Agreement. Though with small funding, the project is expected to contribute to improvement of economic governance in Vietnam.</narrative>
