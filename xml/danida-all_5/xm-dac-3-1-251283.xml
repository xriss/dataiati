   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The support is a bridging grant between the current phase of PFM Reform support, ending mid 2015, and the forthcoming PFMR Development Engagement under the Governance Thematic Programme, part of the Kenya Country Programme 2016-2020. 

The project shall ensure that Financial Statements are made as per legal requirements of the Constitution and the PFM Act. The financial year 2013/2014 meant a landmark achievement in this regard as it was done for the first time. This was done through above-mentioned DANIDA support. 

The means to achieve this is a three year capacity development project that builds of Technical Assistance Consultancy Services provided by an auditing company. The design is such that on the one hand the service provider delivers training as well as it on the other hand ensures that the output as such, the financial statements, are delivered until the adequate capacity is established within the Accountant General&#xBF;s Department. 

Consolidated and quality financial statements are also an important and positive factor with regards to the external audit made by the Office of the Auditor General. Hence there is strong element of contributing to accountability 

The rationale and justification for this one-off grant is hence to build on and sustain the momentum gained through the current PFM support. The forthcoming Public Financial Management Reform Development Engagement should ensure results on an effect level as well as sustainability.</narrative>
