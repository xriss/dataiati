   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The objective of the real-time evaluation is to enable learning at project level and at the overall programme level during the implementation and to document interim results of the partnerships.
The pilot nature of the programme calls for an early capture of results and challenges and a learning attitude across the programme. A result matrix for the individual projects will be developed during project preparation in 2017, and the projects will be expected to report on activities and outputs according to these. However, the projects will not track outcomes during the implementation and it is widely recognised that results in private sector development should be measured more widely than just with the involved partners in order to capture intended or unintended effects in the value chain or with competing firms. The RTE will aim to strengthen results measurement and assess progress towards outcomes for the individual projects. The RTE will also provide lessons learned in regard to the implementation process, which is important not only for the immediate results, but also for the sustainability of the projects.</narrative>
