   <narrative xml:lang="EN">With this project, Save the Children aims to contribute to the objectives outlined in the 2015 Strategic Response Plan for Syria and the No Lost Generation initiative. Children and their families in besieged and hard to reach areas of Syria will benefit from improved and life-saving access to food, protection and education. 
In the besieged/hard to access areas in Syria, the main goal of the project is to diminish the negative effects of the conflict, which has drastically affected the food security and nutrition status of children. In particular, there is a clear need to address the lack of food and mitigate the risk of malnutrition amongst the most vulnerable families. This is done through distribution of food and multi-purpose cash grants. This project also aims to strengthen the child protection environment and boost psychosocial support for children in Syria. Moreover, in recognition that the winter will bring dire protection threats for children, this intervention will provide winterization support to protect children from the cold.
Finally, this project aims to improve access to education for children through alternative education programmes and remedial classes. Providing access to education opportunities will protect Syria&#xBF;s children and have a transformative effect on their futures and the economic growth and stability of Syria and the region. Education in emergencies not only conveys knowledge but also life skills and resilience that children and youth can use to deal with problems in their daily lives.</narrative>
