  <description type="1" xml:lang="EN">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project is a partnership between CARE Denmark, Chr. Hansen and CARE Kenya, CGA and Nairobi University to advance sustainable and resilient agriculture in Kenya, by introducing the biological plant protection and inoculant product, NEMIX&#xAE; C4 on sugarcane, potatoes maize and flowers. The goal is to support farmers, especially smallholders, with safe technologies that enable them to increase their profit and strengthen their development opportunities. The project will develop local competencies by working with Kenyan partners to conduct efficacy trials, local distributors, farmers and their organisations to implement activities. Values will be generated for farmers by increasing their yield, for the distributor through increased sales, for the science and local communities through capacity support and for the environment by decreasing the use of harmful chemicals. More decent jobs as a result of safer working environments are anticipated.
The Danida Market Development Partnerships programme (DMDP) is designed to support commercially oriented partnerships for sustainable market development in developing countries. In addition to reporting on individually determined outputs and outcomes, all DMDP projects report on five key programme indicators. These five indicators are the same for the whole project portfolio, enabling strategic and programme level monitoring, and aggregation of results.
At the programme level, three key outcomes which are related to three of the five key programme indicators, have been chosen for results reporting: Outcome 1: Increased employment (decent jobs) for women, men and youth. Outcome 2: Increased income opportunities from improved market linkages. Outcome 3: Additional capital raised (investment leverage).</narrative>
