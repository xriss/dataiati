   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project development objective was to to help Jordanian municipalities and host communities address the immediate service delivery impacts of Syrian refugee inflows and strengthen municipal capacity to support local economic development. The project aimed to support municipalities in improving service delivery by providing funding to mitigate impacts of population growth and fill immediate gaps, and by improving municipal capacity in technical and management areas &#x2013; including communications with local residents. By improving service delivery and municipal capacities in these aspects, the ESSRP aimed to enhance social cohesion and resilience within local beneficiary communities.</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">1. Municipalities have greater resources to put into service delivery: 
Participating municipalities were provided with significant financial support through ESSRP municipal grants to enhance service delivery to local communities. A total of 45,152,854 USD has been disbursed across participating municipalities for all three years of the project. Through the provision of financial, technical and capacity building support, the project achieved its immediate development outcome of mitigating the impact of population increase on service delivery and infrastructure, especially for waste management. A relatively large proportion of community members in all assessed municipalities perceived these three services to have improved over the past three years. Tangible improvements reported in municipal waste management services include: (i) increased frequency of garbage collection, (ii) increase in number of waste bins, (iii) more reliable service, and (iv) decrease in waste accumulated in public spaces. Moreover, at least 40% of community members in all assessed municipalities perceived newly opened and rehabilitated roads to have (v) improved access to markets and services for community members. Community discussions  revealed that perceived impacts of investments in public roads led to improvements on day-to-day lives include improved mobility and access to other areas of town; increased road safety and reduced risks of car accidents; and reduced costs for car maintenance. 

2. Social cohesion enhanced: 
By increasing opportunities for intra-community engagement through community consultations, expansion of public road networks, rehabilitation of public leisure spaces, and creation of livelihood opportunities, ESSRP was able to enhance social cohesion to a certain degree. Findings from case studies indicate that each of these interventions had specific outcomes which increased opportunities to enhance social cohesion. For example, community consultation processes increased municipal-community interaction and municipal responsiveness, as well as enhanced intra-community relations by bringing community members together to discuss common needs. Rehabilitation of public leisure spaces provided a space for community to gather and interact and as such, increased opportunities for intra-community engagement. By bringing women together in one workplace, the Sarhan sewing hangar increased interaction among women and their families from different villages of Sarhan. The hangar also increased job opportunities and reportedly contributed towards mitigating intra-community tensions arising from job competition. Finally, insights from FGDs indicate that road construction and maintenance interventions improved community&#x2019;s access and thus increased opportunities for them to visit community members, or attend community gatherings in other areas.</narrative>
