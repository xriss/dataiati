  <description type="1" xml:lang="EN">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">A bilateral agreement between Denmark and Cuba on the debt relief of the Republic of Cuba was signed in June 2016 following an agreement between the Republic of Cuba and its creditors in the Paris club signed in 2015. Cuba&apos;s debt to Denmark consists of export credit debts to the Danish Export Credit Agency (EKF). As a result of this bilateral agreement, Cuba and Denmark agree that the principal and interest on Cuba&apos;s debt will be paid back over a period of years from 2016-2033. Late interest due to delayed payments will be cancelled at the same rate as the principal and interest are paid off. As debt relief counts as development aid according to the rules of OECD&apos;s Development Assistance Committee, expenses for the cancellation of late interest are covered by the Danish Ministry of Foreign Affairs.</narrative>
