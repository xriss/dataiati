     <target value="1. A platform for youth&#x2019;s engagement in civil society work and for voicing their vision for society has been formed and implemented.
2. CCPA&#x2019;s SSP-approach builds a bridge between the youth and stakeholders across relevant sectors. which will increase trust between the parties so that they can jointly work to prevent criminalisation and radicalisation. The focus is particularly on early detection mechanisms. 
3. The youth will be engaged in meaningful and potentially income-generating work through sports and become part of a greater network providing for stronger resilience and social cohesion. As role models they gain responsibility. which is of vital importance in resilience. They will work to prevent crime and radicalisation rather than become part of it."></target>
