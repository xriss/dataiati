   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In addition to the overall programme objectives, the 2015 DIHR programme had four specific objectives:

1. NHRIs are established and in practice recognized by governmental structures, civil society, and the international community as independent catalysts to promote, protect, and fulfil human rights.

2. Government human rights focal points influence the level of protection and inclusion of human rights in public policy.

3. Civil society organisations have consolidated and applied their understanding of human rights, and coordinate for effective public participation in human rights promotion and protection.

4. Actors in the Middle East, North Africa and Denmark are engaged in dialogue and academic cooperation on human rights issues of common interest, and the public is informed about issues and progress.

The DIHR DAPP programme has remained on track towards this objective during 2015 with achieved outcomes in all components of the regional/cross-cutting project. This has included public debates,
research exchange visits, regional training courses, and the continued development of the MENA DE.MA Programme on Democratic Governance, Human Rights and Democracy with the European Inter-University Centre and universities in Lebanon, Morocco and Palestine.</narrative>
