   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The long-term vision and aim of the programmatic approach of the LO/FTF Council is &#x201C;to eradicate poverty and support the development of a just, productive, job-rich and democratic society&#x201D;. This overall goal is anchored within the framework of ILO&#x2019;s &#x201D;Decent Work Agenda&#x201D; (DWA). The DWA consists of four pillars with the following underlying goals:
1. Creating decent jobs &#x2013; an economy that generates opportunities for investment, entrepreneurship, skills development, job creation and sustainable livelihoods.
2. Guaranteeing rights at work &#x2013; to obtain recognition and respect for the rights of workers. All workers, and in particular disadvantaged or poor workers, need representation, participation, and laws that work for their interests.
3. Extending social protection &#x2013; to promote both inclusion and productivity by ensuring that women and men enjoy working conditions that are safe, allow adequate free time and rest, take into account family and social values, provide for adequate compensation in case of lost or reduced income and permit access to adequate healthcare.
4. Promoting social dialogue &#x2013; Involving strong and independent workers&#x2019; and employers&apos; organisations is central to increasing productivity, avoiding disputes at work, and building cohesive societies.

The four pillars of the DWA is indeed a rights-based agenda at all levels and it does inherently contain a great number of the priorities of the Danish and international &#x201C;development&#x201D; agenda. In fact, the fulfilment of all four DWA pillars comes close to the above description of the obtained rights of the Danish workers today.
All the LO/FTF Council partnerships are confined within one or more of the DWA pillars.</narrative>
