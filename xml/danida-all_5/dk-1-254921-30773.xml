      <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Jordanian, Egyptian and Tunisian societies are to different extents in danger of conflicts and are characterized by polarization and lack of mutual understanding among youth across geographical, ideological and other divides. Multi-party dialogue and cooperation is not taking place and the building of trust in democratic institutions and procedures risks being undermined by increasing sectarianism and ideological segmentation. Meanwhile, lack of knowledge and negative stereotypes about youth in the MENA region remains abundant among Danish youth and vice versa.</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">It is an on-going challenge to support and promote equal participation and opportunities of young
men and women in projects carried out by Danish youth organisations supported by DUF. DUF has chosen to address this challenge in two ways. Firstly, to offer guidance and training on how to work with gender related issues, for instance how to conduct gender analysis of context and projects. Secondly, to demand that all project applications have taken into consideration how young men and women will have the opportunity to contribute and exert genuine influence on all aspects of the partnership and the intervention. Hence, all project applications are evaluated specifically with regards to their approach to gender.</narrative>

The means of verification are project completion reports and interviews with DUFs members organizations and their partners, partly at DUFs obligatory evaluation seminars (two per year), and partly during monitoring visits.

Capacity building for advocacy is defined by the following activities:
a) Impact duty bearers in own organization
b) Train members/volunteers in advocacy
c) Strategy process in the organization with the aim of increased impact on society.</narrative>

      <narrative xml:lang="EN">DUFs member organizations and their partners have good experience with influencing their own societies by mobilizing youth and developing young leaders. However, none of the youth organizations have long or extensive experience with working strategically with influencing external duty bearers trough advocacy. Some have started out by small actual advocacy activities while others have started building awareness internally within the organizations on the importance of working with advocacy as an element in their project strategy, but have not yet done actual advocacy activities.
At the end of 2014 six MENA organizations work with capacity building for advocacy. Two organizations have had external advocacy activities in 2014. Five MENA organizations did not have any advocacy work in their projects. Status, September 2015: Ten MENA organisations are in a process of training members or staff for advocacy activities or are actually engaged in advocacy.</narrative>
