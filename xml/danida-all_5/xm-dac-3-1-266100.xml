  </title>
  <description type="2" xml:lang="EN">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The purpose of the RTE is to provide independent evidence regarding the achievement of outcomes and regarding relevant changes in the programme context in relation to key engagement areas. This assessment is primarily intended for the country programme management (the embassy and the national authorities in Mali) and should allow them to revise the theory of change and adapt the interventions accordingly.

The real-time evaluation is distinguished from the programme monitoring work (including the work of the M&amp;E team) primarily by being external to the programme management and in having a focus on assessing higher level results (outcomes and outcome to objective levels), and in assessing developments in selected risk factors and assumptions for the programme. 
It is envisaged that the RTE will particularly relate to the thematic programmes for peaceful coexistence and for decentralisation and focus on the following engagements: 
&#x2022; The Fund for Reconciliation and Resilience of Civil Society (FAMOC), 
&#x2022; The Centre for Humanitarian Dialogue and 
&#x2022; Decentralisation in Sikasso.

During the last year of the programme (2022), the RTE Team will provide a summative assessment related to the RTE focus areas of the programme.</narrative>
