  <description type="2" xml:lang="EN">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Currently, about 2 million internally displaced people are located in the northwestern Pakistan in the border areas with Afghanistan. Of these, more than 500,000 displaced as a result of the military offensive against armed non-state actors in North Waziristan, which began in June. In its wake came the military offensive in the Khyber province in October, where nearly 600,000 were displaced, of which 81 per cent were women and children. In addition, almost 4,000 families in the area are not registered which makes them particularly vulnerable. The majority of the displaced are resettled in public buildings and in camps.

The UNHCR bears a large part of the burden in the efforts to help the IDPs. The efforts in the northwestern part of Pakistan include three tracks: 1) protection of internally displaced persons with a focus on vulnerable groups, especially women and children, equal and unhindered access to basic services provided by the Pakistani authorities and humanitarian partners; 2) meeting the urgent needs, including the provision of tents, blankets and other basic necessities; and 3) coordination and support to accommodation for IDPs in public buildings and in camps. The relief to the internally displaced in the northwestern provinces of Pakistan is acute in the light of the cold winter that will hit hard and cause suffering to the already very vulnerable IDPs. UNHCR&#xBF;s appeal is currently only funded with almost 38 per cent.</narrative>
