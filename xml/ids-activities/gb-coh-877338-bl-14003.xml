  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">AURA is an action research programme aimed at strengthening the individual
and institutional capacities in up to nine African institutions to improve research
and teaching practices, research communications, and learning outcomes.
The overarching aim of AURA is to reduce poverty through investments in
people-centred innovations in universities that will bring about economic
prosperity and democratic, responsive governance. These continent-wide
goals were expressed at the UNECA annual conference (2014).
AURA is funded by the UK Department for International Development (DFID)
and the programme will run until March 2018. It is a learning partnership
led by the Institute of Development Studies (IDS), UK, in collaboration with
Loughborough University, UK.</narrative>
