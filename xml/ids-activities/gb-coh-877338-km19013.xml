   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The evaluation will focus on the following areas of inquiry: 
&#x2022;	Assess the achievement of the overall impact and outcome targets and whether or not the activities and outputs of the GODAN initiative (GODAN Secretariat and GODAN Action) have enhanced accountability and transparency, improved service delivery, innovation and economic growth and whether or not there have been any unintended outcomes;
&#x2022;	Assess the programme theory of change (ToC) to see if the logic, supporting evidence and assumptions held up against implementation experience? Is there any evidence which challenges the programme design or rationale?  
&#x2022;	Consider whether or not the programme has had a beneficial impact on women in terms of providing a greater voice in decision making; greater choice in opportunities to benefit from paid work and to have sufficient income; and greater control over their income, productive assets and other resources.
&#x2022;	To assess the overall sustainability of the programme.</narrative>
