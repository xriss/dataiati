   <narrative xml:lang="EN">For 7 years, the military conflict in the east of Ukraine continues to have a serious impact on the population, exacerbating the vulnerability associated with poverty. 3.5 million people have been affected by the conflict in eastern Ukraine, of which 1.1 million people on both sides of the demarcation line suffer from food insecurity.  Over time, the problem of ensuring food security in the territory not controlled by the government of Ukraine has not only not lost its relevance, but on the contrary has become even more acute as a result of restrictions caused by COVID-19, the closure of small and medium-sized enterprises, the reduction of the business sector, rising unemployment, rising prices and, as a result, lack of livelihood. All these factors directly continue to have a negative impact on millions of people.  The situation of many has become even more vulnerable compared to previous years. The most vulnerable groups in need of humanitarian assistance are still the elderly and people with disabilities and serious medical diseases. In conditions of insecurity, people cannot or do not want to leave their homes. To survive, they often rely on their meager income and the ability to access basic services at their place of residence, relying on the help and support of other family members or neighbors.  The lack of means of subsistence not only threatens food security, but also increases vulnerability, constantly forcing people to make impossible choices between food, medicines, payments for water, gas, heating and the purchase of clothing and shoes. The analysis of the situation shows that in order to make ends meet, people resort to negative survival strategies, such as reducing food and healthcare costs, the conflict has had a significant impact on the agricultural sector, which is traditionally the main sector of life support in these territories. For households in rural and semi-urban areas, subsistence agriculture has always been an important activity to support food security. In particular, ensuring food security through agricultural activities of poultry farming, beekeeping and animal husbandry is extremely necessary for both the elderly and people with disabilities, since this is a very important and necessary if not the only source that partially covers the needs for food or makes it possible to purchase basic necessities, in particular: clothing, hygiene and sanitation products, medicines, due to the sale of surplus products.  The main difficulties faced by people who run a subsistence economy are the lack of money for the necessary resources: agricultural equipment, greenhouses, irrigation systems, milking machines.  Based on the results of past interventions and observations on the ground, the CO&quot; ICF &quot;MIRA&quot; concluded that in the areas of the Donetsk NGCA, where the scale of hostilities has decreased, support for small-scale agriculture has been effective in restoring the livelihoods of vulnerable households, especially households headed by women, who cannot access other forms of employment either due to the inability to find a job, or due to lack of mobility or caring responsibilities.  Many households, both in the zone up to 20 km from the demarcation line and beyond, are equally experiencing an urgent need to ensure sustainable sources of livelihood.</narrative>
