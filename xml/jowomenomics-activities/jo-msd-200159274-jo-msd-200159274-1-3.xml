Outputs &amp; Activities: 
A1: Two active partnerships established with reputable organizations [Completed year 1]
As partnerships with international and local groups are an essential aspect of our effort to help the Think Tank achieve greater sustainability, JWomenomics collaborated with the &quot;Brookings Institution&quot; and TRANS4M to deliver training sessions, guidance, and mentorship to the fellows who are a group of selected emerging young leaders. Fellows have been selected to build their capacity and support them to understand and advocate for feminist policies in Jordan using solid evidence. 

The partners delivered training sessions, guidance, and mentorship to the fellows on how best to incorporate and apply the methodology to not only the Think Tank&apos;s activities, but also its operations and culture as a whole. 
A2: Conduct one Gap Analysis [Completed year 1] 
The gap analysis was considered the foundation that was used to conduct the fellowship training. This is crucial in applying international learnings to local laws rather than formulating general assumptions and analysis. The aim of the Gap Analysis thus aimed to move beyond traditional knowledge generation by using interpretative research methods to impact the social and policy discourse in constructive and realistic ways.

This Research is broken down into two main parts: Social Security and Taxation. However, both these laws are considered the basis of human protection and security. The Social Security section is after that divided into sections beginning with a historical background that aims to create an existing landscape of the social security system in Jordan. The next section includes identifying the gaps on a national level while considering the role that the key actors, power players, and influencers play in the delivery of equal opportunities and advantages in economic empowerment regarding social security. The following section focuses on the current efforts put in place to reform social security on a national and global level by highlighting best practices and lessons learned that could be applicable and feasible within Jordan&apos;s cultural and societal context. 

The paper then moves on to the next section, which analyzes gender bias in taxation and is also divided into sections. The tax section begins exploring the different biases that can exist in tax systems: explicit and implicit. The next section moves on to explore implicit gender bias worldwide such as gender bias based on broad based consumption taxes levied on different goods and services and gender bias which is the outcome of joint filing systems that subject a spouse to a higher marginal tax rate based on the income of the primary earner. Thereafter, the paper goes on to discuss gender bias in income tax systems and biases found in allocation of non-labor income, deductions and exemptions, the allocation of income from a family business and the responsibility of filing and compliance, all while drawing examples of these biases in different tax systems worldwide.
JWomenomics contracted a social security consultant, Mai Qatawneh, to conduct a gap analysis for gender bias in the Social Security law based on international best practice and grounding the Jordanian law to respond to international standards that provides social protection for women based on several international conventions, including the ILO. The analysis benchmarked the ILO floors for social protection. A research assistant was also contracted to assist in the desk review and preparation of data required for the study.

Similarly, a Tax consultant Wail Akasheh was contracted to conduct a Gap Analysis for the tax law based on international best practices. The Jordanian law was further analyzed for gender bias after benchmarking it with International best practices. A master researcher and an assistant were contracted for the completion of this task. 

The gap analysis stages of development require feminist research within communities to understand the root of inequities within both these laws. It also requires an understanding of the perception of women who have suffered such inequities in the Social Security and Tax Law. To that end, the young research fellows conducted community-based focus group to validate much of the findings of the gap analysis. (See stages of research in Annex 2).

A3: Develop and conduct one design thinking- integral development training curriculum for 20 participants on research [Completed both year 1 and year 2] 
A5: Candidates for research trainings are screened, two rounds
A fellowship flyer was designed and prepared, this was followed by a call for participation which was issued on social media channels and LinkedIn. The Advertisement got positive response and a total of 23 respondent were interviewed. For the requirements of the fellowship and selection criteria see (Annex 3)

A4: Develop and conduct research methods training curriculum for 20 participants 
[Completed year 2]
JWomenomics coordinated for conducting two training activities. The details of the trainings are found below:
 
&#xF0FC;	Brookings Institution and TRANS4M as follows:
&#x2022;	The first training by Brookings and TRANS4M was conducted in March 16th &amp; 17th 2021, where the young-selected fellows have been trained on research skills (mode 1 research).
&#x2022;	The second training, conducted by TRANS4M in March 24th &amp; 25th 2021, where the young-selected fellows have been trained on methodology (mode 2 research).
&#xF0FC;	Post-training, four selected fellows conducted FGDs and KII&apos;s to identified communities and specialists. Then, a multidisciplinary report has been prepared to present different perspective into mind.  
&#xF0FC;	The candidates were selected based on the following criteria:
o	Volunteering time
o	Commitment and dedication to research
o	Unemployed 
o	Geographic location
&#xF0FC;	Candidates selected were Farah Jarrar, Elham Darwazeh, Zeina Hanandneh and Suhair Al Kayyed.
&#xF0FC;	The communities targeted by the focus groups (fikr sessions) were located in six governorates (15 localities) to ensure that a representative sample of rural and urban residents is polled. Additionally, as seen in the table below, the communities are distributed into North, Center, and South regions.
Table I.1 : Communities Targeted by Ficr Sessions 
Region	Governorate	Location

A5: Screenings of candidates for research training, two rounds [Completed year 2] 
For the Design thinking integral development training conducted in year one, the project team created a fellowship flyer, followed by a call for participation on social media and LinkedIn. The Advertisement had a positive response and a total of 33 respondents were questioned after two calls for participation.  The final selected number for the fellowship after the two rounds of calls for participation is ten candidates and 4 internal staff who joined the fellowship training. 

For the Research Methods training conducted by JWomenomics, a flyer was prepared and distributed throughout social media platforms. Kalamantina, the local women recruitment company, and shared on JW&apos;s website. A total of 52 potential fellows applied, 31 were short-listed and interviewed, and 20 fellows attended the training.

A6: Develop and conduct two training on research for FP committee candidates 
[Completed year 2]
Two external consultants were assigned to assist the fellows who became part of the FP committee to conduct research. The consultants were Allison Anderson carrying a Ph.D. Degree in Feminist Economy and Patrick Odimnfe who is a Trans4M consultant.  The consultants supported the Fellows by conducting training sessions and providing ongoing mentoring and support for research, writing, and analysis. The training sessions helped the Fellows understand integral and feminist development.  
 
On December 15, 2020 and December 22, 2020, Allison Anderson conducted training with FICRI Fellows on how to write short policy-focused research pieces to reach policymakers on topics related to integral development, gender equality, feminism, feminist economics, gender policy, gender gap analysis, feminist research, and gender-based discrimination. She then conducted ongoing mentoring with Fellows from December through August on their research and provided feedback on their policy pieces. Two pieces were selected for publication on the FICRI website in August 2021. 
 
Patrick Odimnfe from Trans4M conducted six mentoring sessions for the team. The sessions were divided into identifying the inner call, outer call, community activation, phenomenology and feminist research and integral conscious awakening.
 
A7: Four FP Committee members selected [Completed year 2]
Based on the training in A6, the team selected two fellows to become part of the FP technical committee. The team then identified three candidates who are established Jordanian leaders to join the FP committee. The members have been selected based on their active role in Jordanian community and their position and active roles they are playing in promoting women rights.

A10: Develop and conduct one co-creation training curriculum for 20 participants [Completed Year 2]
The co-creation material has been developed by Mr. Patrick Odeminie. The aim of the training curriculum is to understand the Integral Worlds thinking to social innovation and development. After receiving the training the participants will be able to, define and the Integral Worlds and thinking and apply Integral Worlds approach to social innovation and development. The learning activities of the curriculum are estimated to take around four hours and are distributed over 2 stages; lecture readings and pair group discussions. 
The lecture series consists of three parts covering the dimensions of integral worlds thinking, social innovation and development. The following graph depicts and introduction of the worlds&#x2019; principle. Please find the material attached in Annex 4)
 
Picture1.1: Introduction to four worlds principle

A11: One dissemination method training curriculum for 20 participants [Completed Year 2]
JW, in collaboration and close cooperation with Brookings, was able to obtain the materials for the dissemination-training program, which consists of a series of workshops, the majority of which are comprised of two modules. More detailed information you can find in A13.
This workshop series was created for FICRI Fellows from sessions on research capacity building developed for the Echidna Global Scholars Program, a visiting girls&apos; education fellowship hosted by Brookings&apos; Center for Universal Education. The approach has been evolved over the previous six to eight years in collaboration with global champions of girls&apos; education who have various degrees of expertise doing policy-oriented research.
The workshop series takes a critical feminist approach to evidence-based decision-making, with an emphasis on the opinions and perspectives of marginalized groups. It aims to incorporate marginalized perspectives into policy and decision-making at all stages, from the generation and construction of evidence to the dissemination of knowledge and recommendations, as well as the consideration and potential remediation of unintended consequences and impacts of the evidence-based decisions.
This workshop series assumes that participants have a basic to advanced understanding of research&#x2014;either through direct experience doing academic or evaluation research or through indirect experience reading academic research or evaluating the quality of other researchers&apos; work. The workshop series is not intended to serve as a primer on research technique; rather, it is intended to elevate participants&apos; understanding of how to leverage research and translate evidence for greater policy impact.
A12: Conduct two screenings of candidates for dissemination trainings [Completed Year 2]
As of August 30, 2021, we have screened 45 applicants for dissemination trainings, and 20 will be chosen to participate as Fellows in a 14-15 September 2021 training, as well as ongoing mentoring and volunteering as part of the Fellowship.

Professor Christina Kwuak from Brookings conducted sessions along with our partnership at the Jordanian Royal Film Commission to train on short-targeted filmmaking. 

A13: Develop and conduct two trainings on dissemination &amp; co-creation for FP Committee candidates 
[Completed Year 2]

On Tuesday and Wednesday 14-15/9/2021 JWomenomics conducted the third fellowship programme for FICRI. The fellowship programme was held in cooperation with the Brookings Institution and the Embassy of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, under the name of Strategies for Dissemination of Research for Influencing Policy. The program targeted young women and men interested in research dissemination studies, in order to provide them with the skills to use modern technology in research dissemination, and the importance of research dissemination in influencing policies.

Twenty-five fellows attended the two days programme (fifteen hours of training): 14 young women and 11 young men. Fellows bring a variety of educational experiences and backgrounds to the program, primarily from the fields of media and sociology.
First Day:
Dr. Mayyada Abu Jaber, Chief Executive Officer of JW, opened the first day of training for the FICRI III Fellowship by welcoming participants and introducing the fellowship programs offered by FICRI in collaboration with the Brookings Institution and funded by the Dutch Embassy.
Then Her Excellency Reem Badran discussed the role of women in various economic, social, and political activities, as women&apos;s participation in Jordan is believed to be somewhat late in comparison to men&apos;s, as evidenced by the studies and statistics accessible to us. She clarified the importance of youth and think tank research in influencing society to increase women&apos;s economic and political participation. &quot;Women are a readily available resource, but they are underutilized.&quot; To amend policies through extensive dialogue among them and then present them to decision-makers in conjunction with meetings with civil society to clarify the rationale and positive objective for amending these policies, as well as the negative consequences of failing to improve or amend them on Jordan&apos;s society and economy. &quot;Your function is critical and primary in transferring knowledge and study from the theoretical stage to the decision maker in order for them to make an informed decision.&quot;
Her Excellency Dina Al-Bashir highlighted to the participants the stages that decisions in the parliament go through prior to becoming legislation. Her Excellency stated that Any legislation passed by Parliament, whether it is related to women or not, has a direct impact on women&apos;s lives. She defined the House of Representatives&apos; committee structure, emphasizing that each suggestion made by the committees must be backed up by data, numbers, and research in order to offer a compelling argument to the opposing side. &quot;You, as a party outside the House of Representatives and as a member of the local community, are interested in the motivations and reasons for amending this article, and it is here that the significance of studies, numbers, and proofs become apparent.&quot;
Her Excellency pointed out the importance of a think tank in using modern scientific research methods and using them in specialized studies. &quot;When I first saw the FICRI logo, I was fascinated by this slogan, which emphasizes the importance of our thinking outside the box. Thinking limited and using traditional tools always brings us back to zero.&quot;
She indicated the importance of a media apparatus that uses all modern means in a correct manner to defend societal issues, especially women&apos;s issues and issues that affect women.
Following the inaugural program, Dr. Mayyada Abu Jaber introduced the third fellowship program and explained the stages that fellows will go through during the program. The fifteen hours will be spent training colleagues to develop political reform strategies, particularly those related to social security and taxes, and then studying strategies for disseminating these policies&apos; reform. Fellows are required to volunteer for ten hours in the distribution of the political reform plan after completing the program.
The training sessions began with an introduction to integrated development and the four worlds approach, and to ensure that the trainees understood the material, the four worlds activity was applied individually to each student so that they were aware of their basic route and worlds.
The second topic discussed on the first day was the development of a communication strategy. Christina began by outlining the concept of communication strategy and the fundamentals of strategy. 
Then the blog&apos;s theme was discussed, with instructions on how to write a blog and how to focus on fascinating things relating to the blogger&apos;s primary topics. Christina outlined the stages necessary for effective writing.
The trainees&apos; comprehension was checked during the course through practical exercises, as well as through the activities they were required to perform following the first day of training and which were discussed on the second day.
There were mini sessions with inspirational speakers during the two training days to refresh the trainees&apos; activity and re-energize the sessions.
Mrs. Rana Al-Husseini was welcomed on the first day; She spoke about her work in the media, her concentration on publishing things linked to honor killings, and how to start adopting phrases used in the media about sexual harassment, rape and honor killings. It took a lot of effort to get concepts like honor issues, violence against women, and child abuse into the headlines today. The session was characterized by the use of questions, which prompted new questions from the trainees, which Mrs. Rana graciously responded.

Second Day:
The second day began with a review of what was presented and discussed on the first day through interaction with the trainees, followed by the trainer Samar Tabbalt&apos;s stalemate-breaking activity designed to emphasize the trainees&apos; atmosphere of cooperation and acquaintance.
Dr. Mayyada Abu Jaber began by emphasizing the value of long-term volunteerism and asking the trainees to share their experiences.
Dr. Mayyada Abu Jaber then discussed the stages of the FICRI program, beginning with preparing research with 40 trainees to evaluate gender discrimination in Jordan. The next stage is to publish findings that will help bring about change. Dr. Mayyada stated that accomplishing change needs first studying the reality, then conducting think tanks and individual interviews in the governorates to identify the gap and give recommendations.
Mrs. Mai Qatawneh spoke on societal protection and its three axes: social security, labor market policies and non-governmental practices in terms of aid, aid and social care. Mrs. May comprehended social security and discussed its comprehensiveness, conditions, insurances, symbiotic system, stages of legislation, and organizational structure.
It was also mentioned in the event how the Security Law differentiated women and men, including the age for old-age pension, the period of participation for early retirement, lump-sum compensation in addition to maternity insurance, and the possibility of combining her pension salary and her share of her deceased husband&apos;s salary without any deduction from either salary or share.
The following session was an overview of the feminist movement&apos;s history, led by Ms. Alison Anderson. Ms. Alison discussed the feminist movement&apos;s history and then led a debate about what it means to be a feminist. What is a feminist&apos;s image or stereotype? 
As part of the workshop, Ms. Christina Kwak reviewed the first day&apos;s material before moving on to topics like communication and publishing for influence. She also discussed activities and sites via which they might promote their work. I also discussed the general and strategic goals of reports and panel discussions.
Christina&apos;s practical activities with the trainees included a presentation on research and policies relating to girls&apos; education. The study examined panel discussion planning, warnings, critical strategic and logistical documents, a draft agenda, speaker strategy, mediator selection, and the importance of varied opinions and ideologies. Additionally, research of communication stakeholders and audience segmentation are beneficial. As on the first day, the trainees were divided into groups, and Christina demonstrated how to complete the forms necessary for reaching decision makers, as well as how to implement the communication plan.
On the second day, two inspirational figures were welcomed: Her Excellency Mrs. Reem Abu Hassan and Her Excellency Bayan Al Tal. Mrs. Reem Abu Hassan began her discussion on social protection by saying, &quot;Young people have hope... and Jordan has leadership in social protection issues like as violence, women&apos;s protection, and child protection.&quot; Following that, she discussed the role of the Royal Committee for the Development of the Political System, its objectives, and His Majesty&apos;s motivation for establishing this committee, noting that one of the committee&apos;s objectives is to empower women. Mrs. Reem Abu Hassan, Her Excellency, received lots of questions about the Ministry of Community Development&apos;s role, honor issues, cyber-bullying, and encouraging women to make significant life decisions.
Her Excellency Bayan Al-Tal discussed the media&apos;s role in disseminating research and studies in a way that influences politics, as well as the critical function of media and information education in enabling researchers to publish findings in an ethical manner and refrain from spreading rumors.
Her excellency Senator Haifa Al-Najjar was invited to end the program&apos;s activities with a speech of motivation and encouragement and to present certificates. Her Excellency stated that young people should work for change and be the change themselves. &quot;I do not believe that all solutions originate in Western countries, but that the magic solution is within us in our capacity to learn from others and be receptive to others.&quot; and she urged young people to take an active role at the local and regional levels. &quot;We are not a passing statistic; we are located in the heart of the world and have triumphed over our difficulties, and Jordan is a significant regional player in the region,&quot; she remarked.

A14: Selection of candidates for the FP committee members [Completed Year 2]
Following the training program (in A13), four more fellows have been selected to join the FP Committee which increases the total number to eight. On Wednesday October 6th, the dissemination strategy workshop was held to work on producing the dissemination strategy in collaboration with Mrs. Mai Qatawneh form the social security department and led by Dr.Mayyada Abujaber the JW CEO. 
Dr. Mayyada Abu Jaber expressed concern regarding the messages we intend to transmit, the brand we will employ, and the words that would encapsulate our project&apos;s goals. She gradually integrated the components of the access plan, reviewed them with colleagues and offered examples, and then prepared for Mrs. Mai Qatawneh to begin debating the position paper that will serve as the basis for the access strategy. Following that, Mrs. Mai Qatawneh explained social security as a general takaful insurance system aimed at social and economic protection. And underlined key elements that could be included in possible Social Security Law revisions. Mrs. Mai Qatawneh concluded her discussion of the position paper, in which she discussed the provisions of the Social Security Law that discriminated against women.
