   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Since 1957, Denmark has hosted a number of UN organizations and is today hosting units from WHO, UNEP, UNIDO, UNFPA, UNICEF, UNHCR, UN-Women, UNDP and WFP, and the HQ of UNOPS is located in Copenhagen. The establishment of the UN City in Copenhagen unites all resident UN organizations in one building with a view to promoting synergies and efficiency.
The grant consists of one-off payment for costs related to the move of UNCHR units from existing locations to the new UN City, with the overall aim to improve the organisational effectiveness of UNHCR, thereby freeing up resources for refugees in need. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs covers the costs for the move itself, and costs related og office equipment such as furniture, telephone, IT and security systems. The last instalment was paid in 2014. As of July 2015 the MFA approved that the grant could cover not only the move of the Private Sector Fundraising unit in Phase I, but also one-off costs related to Phase II of the reallocation of other units. The aim is to have more than 150 UNHCR staff reallocated to the UN City by the end of 2016. As of December 2015 around 90 staff was installed.</narrative>
