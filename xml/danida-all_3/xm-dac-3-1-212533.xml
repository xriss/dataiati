   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The purpose of the project is to support the operation of Zanzibar Interfaith Centre and Upendo Means Love (hereinafter ZIC) which aims at building bridges between people belonging to different religions, especially Muslims and Christians, thereby promoting peace in society as a whole. ZIC works with religious leaders in addressing conflicts at the national level through a joint committee of religious leaders for peace in Zanzibar and at the local level through more than 300 local peace committees throughout Unguja and Pemba. The Youth Department facilitates interfaith programs such as English courses, computer courses, sports club and various seminars. Also, ZIC is building up a study centre where local and international students can study issues related to Christian-Muslim relations and peace building in general.

Furthermore, ZIC aims at empowering women in Zanzibar to fight poverty and become role models within their families and communities. It provides high quality sewing and life skills education and welcomes women of all faiths to study and work together to promote peace and understanding between people of different religions.
The main objective of the project is to ensure a continued dialogue between people of different religions in Zanzibar thereby contributing to the maintenance of peace on the isles.</narrative>
