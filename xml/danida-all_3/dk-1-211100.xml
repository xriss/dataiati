   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Approximately 3.5 billion people live in resource rich countries of which many are developing countries. More transparency around how a country manages its natural resource wealth is necessary in order to ensure that these resources can benefit all citizens and help poor countries out of poverty. The EITI is a global coalition of governments, companies and civil society working together to improve transparency and accountable management of revenues from natural resources to ensure that revenue from extraction benefits countries and their citizens. The EITI maintains the EITI Standard which requires oil, gas and mining companies to disclose payments to implementing countries and the government of those countries to disclose the revenue from such payments. Denmark har provided financial support to EITI since 2011 with DKK 1.5 million annually. A new grant committed in December 2013 has as its objective to continue, consolidate and strengthen Denmark&apos;s support to EITI in 2014-2016 with annual contributions of DKK 2 million and support EITI&apos;s efforts to promote its new and stronger standard for transparency in payments from the extraction of natural resources, not least in the many developing countries that are currently either implementing the standard or considering to do so.</narrative>
