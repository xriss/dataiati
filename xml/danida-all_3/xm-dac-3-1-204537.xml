  <description type="2" xml:lang="EN">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Lack of economic empowerment of women and Gender Based Violence (GBV) are two issues that contribute significantly to maintain and enforce women&apos;s subordinate status vis-a-vis men, and are great obstacles for women to fully enjoy their human rights. Being considered as a force of change, focusing strategically on human and women&apos;s rights helps identifying and confronting underlying power structures that continue to discriminate against women and girls. Through information on women and human rights, women are given incentives to demand accountability from their policy makers. For that reason, this programme is based on a human rights approach. GEWE II comprises efforts to combat GBV and efforts to empower women economically which are closely interrelated. GBV results from a combination of patriarchal gender norms, lack of law enforcement, lack of knowledge of rights and economic and social discrimination that give privilege to men over women. Economic and social marginalisation of women has proved to reinforce patterns of gender inequality that tend to make girls and women more vulnerable to GBV. This is due to the fact that they have no financial power and resources to free themselves from their abusive marriage, to confront cultural practices and leaders or to enrol in education or start a business. In this way, denying a woman decision power over assets and land, and thus depriving her from the option of making use of her resources, a woman is said to be a victim of economic violence. Also, being a victim of GBV is a great mental and physical obstacle towards initiating a resource generating activity, and thus empower oneself financially. On this ground, there is a clear connection between economic marginalisation and sexual, physical and mental abuse, as improvement in one area will have an effect on the other.</narrative>
