  <description type="2" xml:lang="EN">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Sustainable Energy for All (SE4ALL) was launched by the UN Secretary General in 2011. The initiative aims to achieve three goals by 2030: 1) Universal access to modern energy services for all, 2) a doubling of the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix, and 3) doubling of the global rate of improvement in energy efficiency. The initiative has succeeded to create both political momentum and broad support from civil society and engagement from private business. 

A Global Facilitation Team (GFT) is located in Vienna with a sub-office in the UN Secretariat in New York. 

The short-term objective is to sustain the momentum created by SE4ALL, thereby promoting the platform for public-private collaboration, and to promote energy as one of the priorities of the post-2015 development agenda though the establishment of a Sustainable Development Goal on sustainable energy. Energy is also relevant as a cross-cutting goal, the so-called nexus&#xBF;: Energy-health; energy-water; energy-food; and energy-women&#xBF;s empowerment. The support will also sustain focus on these nexus areas.</narrative>
