   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Multinational Force and Observers (MFO) is an independent international organization, headquartered in Rome. The origins of the MFO lie in Annex I to the 1979 Treaty of Peace between Egypt and Israel. the parties negotiated a Protocol in 1981 establishing the MFO as an alternative to the envisioned UN force. The Protocol defines the MFO&#xBF;s mission, provides for the appointment of a Director General to be responsible for the direction of the MFO, and stipulates that the expenses of the MFO &#xBF;which are not covered by other sources shall be borne equally by the Parties.&#xBF; The MFO plays a critical stabilizing role in the border areas between Israel and Egypt, including the Gaza border, and throughout the Sinai itself. The MFO&#xBF;s verification and monitoring work is its core mission, but its role is more than mechanical verification. Its mandate also provides for a &#xBF;best efforts&#xBF; function to consolidate the peace between the two parties, and in this respect the MFO plays a number of confidence-building roles.The MFO at its North Camp at el Gorah, Egypt, is one of the largest private sector employers of local Bedouin residents in the northeast Sinai. The BEP offers productive employment in the formal economy with a legal work status and opportunities for youth employment (age below 30) and promotion. 

 

Objective: Improving the lives of the Bedouin community in this region is a critical MFO goal for stabilization and security reasons in this, the poorest and most challenged Governorate in Egypt.</narrative>
