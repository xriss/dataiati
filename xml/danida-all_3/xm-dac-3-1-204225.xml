   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The High-Level Task Force for ICPD (HLTF) was launched on October 1st 2012 with the purpose of countering the increasing pressure on the objectives regarding sexual and reproductive health and rights in the ICPD/Cairo Programme of Action and in order to strengthen and promote the Programme of Action. The HLTF consists of 26 international prominent persons from governments, civil society and the private sector and is headed by the former Finnish president, Tarja Halonen, and the former president of Mozambique, Joaquim Chissano. Denmark is represented by Her Royal Highness Crown Princess Mary of Denmark.

The HLTF works to achieve the following results:
1) Preserve the integrity of and promote implementation of the ICPD Programme of Action 
2) Advance sexual and reproductive health and rights commitments beyond 2014. 
3) Integrate sexual and reproductive health and rights as central elements of the post-2015 development agenda.
4) Secure meaningful participation of civil society in ICPD+20 and the post-2015 processes. 

The goals of the HLTF should be met by applying integrated strategic efforts including policy-oriented advocacy, the building of alliances and coalitions as well as communication and out-reach.</narrative>
