   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Information and knowledge about reproductive and sexual health issues, combined with services are the key to empowerment and well-being of adolescents, particularly adolescent girls. Adolescent girls&apos; access to information in Tanzania is particularly limited for many reasons, including customary attitudes, early marriages, and absence of basic literacy, lack of adequate support system in school, economic dependence and gender inequalities in families and in society at large. Because of such discrimination, adolescent girls often lack the knowledge and skills they need to advance their status in society. Gender Based Violence (GBV) and sexual reproductive health are closely linked. Adolescent girls, both in-school and out-of-school, therefore, may require special support to acquire the skills they need to protect themselves. Helping adolescent girls and young women, especially those who have left the school environment, acquiring life skills and leadership skills is therefore paramount in improving their quality and capacity in determining their personal growth and development. Toward this direction, TAWODE seeks to contribute into empowering adolescent girls and young women in Tanzania by imparting life and livelihood skills to out of school adolescent girls and young women. The focus of the project is in the Tanga region. The main objective of the project is to enhance the quality and capacity of adolescent girls and young women in determining their personal growth and development.</narrative>
