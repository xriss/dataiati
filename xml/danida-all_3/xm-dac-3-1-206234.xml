With support from Norway and Sweden a mangrove rehabilitation projects was developed . The program started working in 2008 with three components: 1. a regional policy and strategy coordination unit based in Bangkok, 2. a small and medium grants facility to finance concrete investments and trial projects in mangrove depending communities and 3. a regional training and learning component in support of national programs. In 2012 Denmark joined the program with special focus on climate adaptation and gender and with special focus on Bangladesh, Vietnam and Indonesia. 
The program is a partnership program with participation of governments, NGO&apos;s and increasingly private sector. Implementation is being supported by IUCN as the lead agency with UNDP taking the lead in Thailand and Indonesia. FAO and UNEP are technical partners as is Wetland International.
