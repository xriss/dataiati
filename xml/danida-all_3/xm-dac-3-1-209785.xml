  </title>
  <description type="2" xml:lang="EN">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The PEGASE mechanism aims to help build and bolster the institutions of a future independent Palestinian state. Through PEGASE, the EU donors provide a significant amount of direct financial support to the PA in order to support sustained delivery of basic public services in the West Bank and Gaza. The financial support goes towards: 
- salaries of PA civil servants and pensioners, to ensure that essential public services, such as schools and hospitals, are kept operating;
- social allowances to some of the most vulnerable Palestinian households in support of the existing Ministry of Social Affairs-cash transfer programme; 
- settling of PA arrears to the East Jerusalem hospitals;
- settling of PA arrears to private sector businesses in order to reduce the PA debt to the private sector and to address one of the major causes of the crisis of the private sector 
- and, at large, the Palestinian economy; 

The support that Denmark provides is direct financial assistance (DFA) to the PAs budget through the payment of the salaries of selected civil servants. Denmark contribution to PEGASE aims to safeguard the effectiveness, legitimacy and viability of the PA institutions by ensuring that civil servants in post remain productively engaged with citizens the people to promote sustainable development.</narrative>
