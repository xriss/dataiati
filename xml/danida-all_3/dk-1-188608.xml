   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The CGIAR-centres are conducting research at solving agricultural and food security problems in developing countries. The research results are freely available and considered international public goods. Denmark has for several decades financed a number of selected CGIAR-centres. The CGIAR-system has lately been going through a reform aiming at establishing a reduced number of thematic research programs across the centres with the participation of a large number of other partners. Furthermore, as a result of the reform a common fund for all CGIAR-centres administered by the World Bank as well as common dialogue and decision structures have been established. The Danish financial contribution in 2010 was DKK 30 million ear-marked to the program &quot;Climate Changes, Agriculture and Food Security - CCAFS&quot;. The two main objectives are: 1. Climate changes resilience and adaptation in the food production sector of the planet&apos;s poorest population and; 2. Consideration and coherence of climate changes and agricultural policy aiming at poverty reduction. In 2011, a grant of DKK 35 million was approved for an ear-marked funding of the program &quot;Policies, Institutions and Markets&quot;. The research program will contribute to knowledge and capacity building within economic, policy and institutional aspects related to food security, growth and employment in developing countries. International Food Policy Research Institute, IFPRI, is lead centre of the program. To strengthen Denmark&apos;s support to the reform process, the commitment of DKK 35 million was in 2012 made as core funding to the CGIAR Fund. In 2013 the yearly commitments were changed into a multiannual grant of in total DKK 105 million covering three years. The disbursement was made in January 2014. The 2015 disbursement was likewise made in the first quarter of the year. Denmark is thereby in full alignment with and contribute to the financial stability and predictability required in long-term research programming.</narrative>
