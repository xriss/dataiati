   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Egypt Development Marketplace (DM) aims to contribute to job creation, poverty reduction and rural development by providing nascent and existing social enterprises and inclusive businesses that are part of the agriculture supply chain with scale-up funding and access to finance.

The Egypt DM aims to directly contribute to initially creating jobs for at least 100 poor young men and women with a focus on poverty pockets in rural Egypt with some spillover effects on urban pockets of poverty through marketing activities, etc.

Intermediate goals include supporting approximately 40 social enterprises in scaling-up their impact and developing financially viable models. Through such scaling-up support, these social enterprises are expected to create more jobs as they continue to grow over the coming years.

The focus on agriculture supply chains has been chosen to reach some of the poorest young men and women in rural areas and help those secure sustainable livelihoods for themselves and their families. Those include rural-based agricultural waste management, clean energy and food processing (employing poor rural youth in general) as well as handicrafts/fair trade programs (mainly employing poor rural young women).</narrative>
