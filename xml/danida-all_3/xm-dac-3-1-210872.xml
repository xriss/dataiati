   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Due to the deteriorating situation inside Syria the number of refugees crossing the border into the neighboring countries increased significantly. Host communities in neighboring countries to Syria generously receive refugees, but due to the increased number, support to the host countries/ communities was urgently required. The project provided Syrian adolescents and youth in Jordan and Lebanon with access to informal education, protection and psychosocial support, ensuring that they continued to learn and were protected from abuse, neglect and exploitation. In Jordan, project outcomes included enhanced psychosocial wellbeing and improved access to informal education for 1,492 adolescents and youth residing in the Za&#xBF;atari Camp. Essential knowledge and skills were provided to, not only cope with their displacement, but also to improve their families&#xBF; livelihoods. In Lebanon, project outcomes included enhanced access to quality education and strengthen resilience of 880 children and youth in Tripoli and Bekaa Valley. The activities in Jordan were slightly delayed due to the changing situation in the Za&#xBF;atari Camp and winter storms. In Lebanon, some of the activities were move from Bekaa Valley to Tripoli due to the security situation. However, the project has been completed within the planned timeframe and the expected results have been achieved.</narrative>
