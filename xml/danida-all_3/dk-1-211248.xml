   <narrative xml:lang="EN">SCIP supports climate change activities through capacity building of strategic institutions and actors. Thus, the program even if it will not directly support members of the public or community based activities; it will ultimately benefit marginalized people to better coup with climatic shocks. This is done through the projects and by improving flow of information on climate change to and from local level. Thus, it addresses the issue of rights, participation and improving transparency and accountability. In order to achieve this, the program operates as a funding facility with criteria; management and monitoring that ensures addresses strategic issues and focuses on achieving results. 

The programme is structured around three results pillars; (1) government and development partners (2) civil society and academia and (3) the private sector. The first two are delivered through the SCIP Fund Manager KPMG. The Fund Manager solicits proposals for activities related to climate change which are both institution-building and strategic. The third pillar, support to the private sector, is provided through the establishment of a Climate Innovation Centre.</narrative>
