   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Marie Stopes International (MSI) is one of the world&apos;s largest family planning organisations with more than 620 international centres in 40 countries. MSI is an efficient, innovative and well respected organisation. MSI recently changed its organisational structure and overall strategy in order to strengthen the human rights aspect in its approach and operations.

Denmark provides core contribution to MSI in support of MSI&apos;s global Power-of-Ten strategy, which seeks to make the biggest contribution possible to achieving Millennium Development Goal 5 on improving maternal health - one of the Millennium Goals lagging the furthest behind. Through its network of reproductive health clinics, MSI is one of the main suppliers of reproductive health services in many low income settings and reaches a large number of vulnerable and marginalised women and young girls. 

Aware of the systemic, political, cultural and social barriers that prevent women and men from securing their sexual and reproductive health and rights, MSI focuses on advocacy and policy engagement with governments and civil society. In collaboration with MSI, Denmark focuses attention on the human rights element of MSI&apos;s work, such as reaching the most vulnerable and marginalised groups and addressing the more sensitive aspects of sexual and reproductive health and rights, including safe abortion, sexuality education for youth etc. 

Denmark&apos;s combined core support contributes to MSI&apos;s global targets of averting over 44,000 maternal deaths and 8.3 million unsafe abortions between 2014 and 2016.</narrative>
