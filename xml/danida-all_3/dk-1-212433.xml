  <description type="1" xml:lang="EN">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">PSNP/HABP is the main government programme in Ethiopia addressing the food security of the vulnerable population.. The current phase of PSNP/HABP will be implemented up to end 2014. Discussions between GOE and donor partners on a new phase have been going on since November 2011. The programme provides much needed support to around seven million chronically food insecure households in the country in order to close the food gap for part or all of the year. PSNP is a safety net programme that addresses the productive basis of the country&#xBF;s agricultural sector. It is based on food/cash for work on public works such as communal infrastructure and natural resource management projects. HABP directly seeks to build the assets and productive capacity of vulnerable households through a range of capacity, technical assistance, market and credit interventions. 
PSNP/HABP has improved food production, food security and resilience in the targeted areas. PSNP/HABP has a high priority in government plans to combat food insecurity. It is supported by multiple donors, has a total combined budget of USD 2,855 million, and is considered an aid-effective and well-harmonised programme. PSNP/HABP is funded from humanitarian as well as development funding and it constitutes a crossover between a humanitarian and a development approach. 
Within PSNP/HABP specifically, the Climate Smart Initiative (CSI) is an initiative starting in 2013, which implements targeted climate adaptation and resilient NRM and agricultural activities and, through this, promotes the technical quality of PSNP and HABP, furthers climate resilience in the public works undertaken within PSNP and informs future programme implementation. The CSI strengthens PSNP and HABP in relation to climate change. The CSI is supported as part of component implementation</narrative>
