   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The African Youth Panel (AYP) is a platform of youth leaders from different African Countries and consists of members with diverse skills and backgrounds including academics, civil society experts and politicians. It was initiated by the Danish NGO Forum to provide input to the Danish Africa Commission on youth employment.
 
Main monitoring activities have been jointly undertaken by the steering committee of the African Youth Panel and the Danish NGO Forum through its meetings during the regional summits and also through monthly Skype meetings between the SC members and AYP.
 
The main objective of the project is to strengthen the capacity of African youth as actors in the development process in Africa by popularizing the African Youth Charter, empowering youth for sustainable development, documenting best practices and networking with relevant stakeholders.
 
In line with the main objective, specific objectives are:
- To popularize the African Youth Charter and advocate for its ratification,
- To empower / build the capacities of Africa&apos;s youth for the promotion of peace, transparent governance and sustainable development in Africa,
- To document best practices and facilitate information sharing / opportunities amongst Africa&apos;s youth.</narrative>
