   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project includes rehabilitation of clean water and sewerage treatment facilities in the Ndola Region in the towns of Ndola, Luanshya and Masaiti. The existing transmission and distribution network will be rehabilitated and extensions to new areas will be provided. 
 
The overall project objective is to contribute to improvement of the environment and public health in general, which is considered to be a pre-condition for economic growth and reduction of poverty. 
The project is in line with the national development strategy including the National Urban Water Supply and Sanitation Programme, which is in compliance with the 2015 targets outlined in the Millennium Development Goals.

Project sustainability and energy efficiency have high priority. Currently 50-70% of the clean water is lost due to a wide range of problems such as: broken pipes, pipe leakages, illegal pipe connection, unnecessary high pipe pressure, lack of institutional systems to handle repair and maintenance, weak reporting systems, inefficient revenue collection and consequently no funds for maintenance and new investments.</narrative>
