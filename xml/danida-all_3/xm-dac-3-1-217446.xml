   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Study on Illicit Financial Flows from five African Countries</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2" xml:lang="EN">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Developing countries, including in Africa, are losing billions of dollars each year due to illicit
financial flows - funds that could otherwise have been used to invest in development. The
Washington based think tank Global Financial Integrity (GFI) has conducted research which
reveals that developing countries in 2010 lost between USD 859 billion to USD 1,138 billion
due to illicit financial outflows. The MENA region had the highest growth rate of illicit capital
in real terms in 2001-2010 (26.3 per cent per annum on average), followed by Africa (23.8 per
cent) and Asia (7.8 per cent). The major part of illicit financial outflows stem from trade mispricing, in Africa 65 per cent.

The strategy for Denmark&#xBF;s development cooperation gives key priority to Danish efforts to
fight against tax loopholes, address illicit financial flows and promote a fair taxation of natural
resources in the world&#xBF;s poorest countries. Locally in Danish priority countries, not least in Africa, the issue of curbing illicit financial flows, not least in countries with recent large oil, gas
and mineral finds, is increasingly part of Denmark&#xBF;s and local development partners&#xBF; on-going policy dialogue with the government. The grant will fund a more detailed analysis on the magnitude of illicit Financial outflows and possible measures against such flows in 5 Danish priority
countries in order to complement Danish policy efforts in this field and provide data and analytical
tools for relevant Danish embassies in their efforts to try to lift this agenda locally together with other development partners. The Objective of the study is to analyse the magnitude of illicit capital outflows stemming from mispricing of trade in Ghana, Kenya, Mozambique, Tanzania and Uganda and outline and outline possible policy options against such flows.</narrative>
