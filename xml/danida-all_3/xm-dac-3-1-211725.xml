  <description type="2" xml:lang="EN">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The objectives of the study will be to:

- provide analytical input and advisory support to assist Danida in creating a revised Natural Resources, Energy and Climate Change (NEC) Strategy. 

Activities and outputs:
To accomplish this, WRI will pursue - in close collaboration with Danida - a series of analyses and activities that address three questions:

- How can Green Growth contribute to poverty alleviation within the framework of a rights-based approach?
Output: Short summary brief per theme answering the sub-questions

- How could development assistance scale up Green Growth and natural resource-based solutions to poverty alleviation within the framework of a rights-based approach?
Output: A summary brief(s) that articulates which development cooperation interventions show most promise for scaling up natural resource-based solutions to poverty alleviation within the framework of a rights-based approach, relative to the green growth themes of sustainable food production, enhanced access to energy and water, and integrated climate interventions.

- In light of the above, which development assistance approaches should Danida prioritize and how should the portfolio shift?
Output: A high level guidance &#xBF;working note&#xBF; that articulates which development cooperation approaches Danida should consider prioritizing within the framework of Green Growth (and the NEC strategy). The note should be concrete, ambitious, yet realistic about how much of and how fast Danida&#xBF;s existing body of work can change. 

The assignment will be initiated mid November 2012 and will last for five months with final reporting by end April 2013.</narrative>
