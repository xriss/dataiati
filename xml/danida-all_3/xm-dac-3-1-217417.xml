   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The National Education Strategic Plan II vision forms the Education Support Programme to Afgahnistan II&#xBF;s immediate objective for the on-budget support to NESP II, which comprises five programmes each with specific development goals. The NESP II is the guiding framework to support the implementation of the strategic vision of ANDS. NESP II was prepared in 2009 and finalised in 2010 to cover the period 2010-2014. The vision of NESP II is to develop human capital based on Islamic principles, national and international commitments and respect for human rights by providing equitable access to quality education for all to enable them to actively participate in sustainable development, economic growth, and stability and security of Afghanistan. 
The primary education policy and planning framework under the auspices of the Ministry of Education (MoE) is specified in the NESP II, which includes the goals of Education for All, the MDG 2 on equal access for all children to primary education, and parts of the MDG 3 on the rights of girls and women to education. The NESP II covers five areas of education; (i) General and Islamic Education; (ii) Curriculum Development and Teacher Education; (iii) Technical and Vocational Education and Training; (iv) Literacy; and (v) Education Management. These are reflected in the organisational structure of the Ministry of Education as this flows along the programmes with one dedicated deputy minister responsible for each respective programme.</narrative>
