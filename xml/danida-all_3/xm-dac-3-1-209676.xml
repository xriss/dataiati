   <narrative xml:lang="EN">There are still persistent and systematic violations of human rights in Central America of people living in conditions of vulnerability. Denmark has for many years supported human rights in the region. 

The Danish Government on this background has decided to continue supporting the respect for human rights in the region with DKK 50 million initially for 2.5 years with special focus on vulnerable groups, in particular indigenous peoples, women, and human rights defenders, such as trade unionists, with a particular emphasis in Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua. The development objective of the program is: Improved respect, protection and defence of human rights, especially for indigenous peoples, women and human rights defenders in Central America, with emphasis in Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua. 

The programme has two components with the following immediate objectives:
&#xBF;	Component 1: Strengthened defence of human rights of people living in condition of vulnerability, especially indigenous peoples, women and human rights defenders in Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua.
&#xBF;	Component 2: Strengthened capacity of participation and empowerment of people living in conditions of vulnerability, especially indigenous peoples, women and human rights activists to demand effective protection and respect for their rights in Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua. 

The environment programme builds on Danida experiences between 2005 and 2012, which have been used to select the partners and the areas of intervention. At the regional level, the expected result will be to strengthen indigenous peoples&#xB4; capacity to negotiate and implement co-management agreements of protected areas that overlap with indigenous territories.</narrative>
