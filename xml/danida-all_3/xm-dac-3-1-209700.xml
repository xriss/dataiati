   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Climate Envelopes 2012 og 2013: IFU - Danish Climate Investment Fund</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2" xml:lang="EN">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The government program from October 2011 stated that the government would set up a fund to promote climate investments in the developing countries. In December 2012, the Danish government established the Danish Climate Investment Fund (DCIF) under management of the Investment Fund for Developing Countries (IFU). The main objective of the climate investment fund is to mobilise public and private capital for investments with a positive climate impact in developing countries. DCIF serves thus the purpose of mobilizing private capital to climate finance which is of particular importance in order to meet the increasing investment needs for adaptation and mitigation in the developing countries. 

DCIF will through advisory services and investments on commercial terms increase the use of Danish climate technology and promote Danish climate investments in the developing countries. The investment fund is in accordance with the strategy for Denmark&#xBF;s development cooperation &#xBF;The Right to a Better Life&#xBF;. Moreover, DCIF will contribute to the UN Secretary General&#xBF;s SE4ALL initiative. 

In 2013, IFU started a campaign to mobilise capital from institutional investors. The first major result is a new ground-breaking public-private partnership that was formally agreed in January 2014: institutional investors, the Danish state &#xBF; represented by the IFU &#xBF; will invest 1.3 billion DKK in the DCIF. The contribution from the government is 275 mDKK.</narrative>
