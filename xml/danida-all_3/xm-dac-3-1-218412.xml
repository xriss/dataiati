   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The purpose of this project has been to create an environment for good policy-making through sound and timely research and to strengthen local capacity to conduct research in public policy. The Institute of Economic Affairs should undertake important studies on economic and governance issues confronting Ghana. The studies were based on pertinent governance and economic challenges facing Ghana. It was further agreed that the outcome of each study would be discussed extensively at seminars to which Danish Embassy staff would be invited. The seminars were aimed at stimulating debate and raising awareness on key policy issues confronting Ghana, with the ultimate aim of influencing and informing government policies. It was also agreed that the research findings would be published and disseminated to over two thousand (2000) most influential personalities in Ghana. Copies of all publications produced would also be submitted to The Danish Embassy and be made available on the IEA website.

An annual dialogue meeting was held during the course of this cooperation to discuss strategic issues and progress made towards the attainment of the proposal objectives. The IEA should also submit Annual Narrative progress reports and audited financial reports to the Embassy. 

The project was initiated as a pilot phase. Depending on the assessment of this the Embassy would consider entering into a long term agreement with the IEA. The agreement with IEA should support the new Danish strategy for the partnership with Ghana, the Country Policy Paper, with its increased focus on political and commercial cooperation.</narrative>
