   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Program Support Part ll will be phased in harmonized with part l, which in 2011 started Denmark&apos;s long-term development cooperation with Africa&apos;s newest country, South Sudan. The gradual implementation of the long-term cooperation takes the massive challenges that South Sudan faces after independence into account, where the country&apos;s own capacity is severely limited, and long term aid needs to operate in parallel with other instruments (political, humanitarian, peace/stability, military) The Program Support Part ll continues the previous focus on the connection between development and security/peace- and state build-up in accordance with South Sudan&apos;s own development plan and the principles in New Deal, where South Sudan is a pilot country.
The goal is a peaceful and stable South Sudan capable of upholding the respect for Human Rights, Good Governance and access to social services. Part ll consolidates and enhances the two present components, Governance and Human Security, which are highly prioritized from political side in South Sudan. The support is directed through multilateral channels and is adjusted to national systems. In the area of governance the central and decentralised capacity of authorities will be strengthened with focus on accountability and transparency and service delivery to rights holders, meaningful participation in decision-making processes and access to social services at local level. In the area of security focus is on conflict prevention in marginalized local communities as well as the government&apos;s capability to take responsibility for the population&apos;s right to a life in security and anti-discrimination. The peace- and stabilization funds will focus on security sector reform.

Indicators for the program are developed on component level.</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">Initially (before 2013 crises): to support and enable the development of a New Deal Compact in South Sudan. Support for this work was provided in 2013 but interrupted by the conflict in 2014. 

After 2013 crises: Reallocation towards supporting the Aid Information Management System (AIMS) upgrade in late 2014. The support for the AIMS upgrade aimed at making the system more user-friendly, and to maintain and continue to improve an important aid coordination capacity in government during the crisis. An improved system simplifies data management processes for both government and development partners, and is in accordance with the principles and objectives of the New Deal, with its focus on national ownership and leadership.</narrative>
