   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The programme proposal, &quot;Cooperation between Lantm&#xE4;teriet and AREC to provide Digital Data to Strengthen Democracy - Cooperation for Digital Democracy&quot; is drafted jointly by the two land administration agencies in Sweden and in Macedonia. It builds on previous cooperation and achievements and aims at;
Strengthened capacity in AREC, having developed business practises, enabling exchange of high-quality and updated digital data via new and improved services in a strengthened democracy - contributing to smooth EU integration and improved living conditions of all inhabitants of Macedonia.

The expected outcomes of the cooperation (2018-2022) supported by Sida will contribute to this impact are; 
- One unique, accurate and sustainable Address Register System established,
- Establishment, development and maintenance of a modern geodetic infrastructure, 
- a capable, self-sufficient and sustainable ICT-organization,
- NSDI (national spatial data infrastructure) - updated, accurate and well-maintained spatial data used by major stakeholders, 
- archived documents scanned and digitized, available via Internet.

Lantm&#xE4;teriet (the Swedish Mapping, Cadastral and Land Registration Authority) is a state agency with three areas of activities; Cadastral services, Land and Geographical Information services and Land registration. AREC is the national Agency for Real Estate Cadastre, with a corresponding mission in Macedonia. They are also the coordinator for NSDI (national spatial data infrastructure) in Macedonia.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project Cooperation for Digital Democracy has an overall objective to &#x201C;To strengthen the capacity in AREC in developing its business processes, and to enable exchange of high-quality and updated digital data via new and improved services in a strengthened democracy, while contributing to smooth EU integration and to improved living conditions of all inhabitants of Macedonia&#x201D;
To contribute to the achievement of the overall goal, the project will work towards&#xA0;outcomes described in 1.1, briefly:- establishment of one unique,&#xA0;accurate and sustainable Adress Register System,- establishment, development and maintenance of a modern geodetic infrastructure,- a capable, self-sufficient and sustainable ICT-organization,- increased amount and access to updated, accurate and well-maintained spatial data on the National NSDI geoportal,-&#xA0;scanned and&#xA0;digitalized documents from the central and local archives,&#xA0;available via existing software infrastructure of AREC.
The theory of change of the proposed intervention is as follows - IF the capacity of AREC is&#xA0;strengthened and its business processes are developed by establishing: (1) a unique, accurate and sustainable Address register system, which is available for and utilized by other stakeholder institutions; (2) by modernization of the geodetic infrastructure, in compliance to the EU standards; and (3) by updating the NSDI geoportal in the benefit of all major stakeholders; AND, IF AREC is serviced by (4) a capable and self-sufficient ICT-organization;&#xA0;and (5) all important documents are registered and properly archived in a digitalized format; THEN AREC will provide high-quality services and accurate data to its clients and it will increase its transparency and accountability level. This will&#xA0;enable&#xA0;all&#xA0;people in Macedonia, including the most vulnerable, to exercise their basic rights to register their property and place of residence, and thus to exercise their right to vote and to influence the decision-making in their own communities. At the same time, AREC will reach a level of accuracy, service and function required for integrating into existing EU systems.</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">From CoP March 2021:
Below is a summary of results that the partner have reached during the period May - December 2020.&#xA0;
The period was strongly characterized by the outbreak of covid-19 and as a result, no international travel could be&#xA0;made. Hence, activities were implemented via remote support from Lantm&#xE4;teriet using&#xA0;tools for digital meetings. Activities that could not be implemented remotely have been postponed or delayed. The delay of activities has, to a varying degree, had an impact on&#xA0;all five components (address register, geodesy, ICT sector support, NSDI and scan&#xA0;centre). However, while covid-19 posed a challenge to the project, some important progress were still being made:
Component 1:&#xA0;One unique, accurate and sustainable address register system establishedThe graphical part of the register has been populated with descriptive and spatial data on streets and house numbers for another 350 settlements in eleven municipalities. The data has been collected, checked and entered into the electronic cadastre database, i.e. the graphical register for streets and house numbers for settlements.&#xA0;The data will be&#xA0;used for the census scheduled for 2021.&#xA0;
Component 2: Establishment, development and maintenance of a modern geodetic infrastructureDuring 2020, improvements and modernisations of the geodetic infrastructure were achieved. For instance, procurement of software for GNSS networks data processing and adjustment including training of AREC staff were completed. Also, awareness about the&#xA0;Graphic Register among the municipalities and other&#xA0;stakeholders of the register improved.&#xA0;
Component 3:&#xA0;Capable, self-sufficient and sustainable ICT organisationAn analysis of the current situation within the ICT Sector has been carried out. The analysis led to the insight that there is a need for a well-documented ICT strategy to use as a cornerstone when communicating with various stakeholders.&#xA0;An initial draft of a strategy has been produced during 2020.&#xA0;
Component 4:&#xA0;NSDI &#x2013; updated, accurate and well-maintained spatial data used by major stakeholderFor this component, the key achievement during the period is an increased awareness about monitoring of the NSDI implementation and setting-up of services for data sharing among the subjects in the NSDI-cooperation in the Republic of North Macedonia. Online workshops and trainings has enabled this positive development.&#xA0;
Component 5:&#xA0;Archived documents scanned &amp; digitized, available via internetA number of actions have been taken to lay the ground for the pilot scanning project - a very important step in the establishment of a Scan Center at the AREC. To mention some activities,&#xA0;hardware and software for the pilot project have been procured,&#xA0;primary training of the staff in using the equipment (scanners) have been carried out and a&#xA0;work procedure for the scan center has been prepared.&#xA0;
In addition and as a side-effect to the consequences of covid-19, personnel of the ARECimproved their ability to host meetings. As Lantm&#xE4;teriet is not allowed to install themeeting application Zoom, the role of meeting host was transferred to the AREC, whotook on a more active role in the partnership.</narrative>
