   <narrative xml:lang="SV">Nordmakedoniens statliga statistikkontor (vidare SSO) ansvarar f&#xF6;r  officiell statistik, f&#xF6;r samordning av det  statistiska systemet och internationellt samarbete inom statistikomr&#xE5;det.

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The State Statistical office of North Macedonia (further SSO) has the responsibility to produce official statistics in the country, to coordinate the National Statistical System and international cooperation in the field of statistics. SSO has also an important support role to provide official statistics related to the EU negotiations.  

The project &#x201C;Increased availability and use of official statistics in North Macedonia&#x201D; is jointly prepared by SSO and SCB, with an overall project goal to increase user confidence in North Macedonia, by the means of increased availability and use of official statistics in the country.  

To contribute to the achievement of the overall goal, the project will work towards improved efficiency of the statistical production; increased range and improved quality of statistical production; improved communications and strengthened coordination of the National Statistical System (NSS), and improved efficiency of human resource management within the organization.

Users increased confidence in the accuracy and reliability of provided statistical data will enable the state institutions to prepare their social policies, and the researchers and NGO&apos;s to utilize the data to argue for the rights of the poor. At the same time, SSO will comply to the existing EU requirements (2019 Communication on EU Enlargement Policy, North Macedonia 2019 Report - Chapter 18, and the European Statistics Code of Practice), and the Agenda 2030 (SDG 5; SDG 16 and SDG 17).

The requested project budget is SEK 14 000 000, for the period September 2019 - December 2021.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project Increased availability and use of official statistics in North Macedonia, is about partnership cooperation between the Statistics Sweden and the State Statistical Office of North Macedonia. The overall project goal is to reach increased user confidence in North Macedonia, by the means of increased availability and use of official statistics in the country.  

To contribute to the achievement of the overall goal, the project will work towards the following outcomes: 
- improved efficiency of the statistical production process;
- increased range and improved quality of statistical production;
- improved internal and external communications;
- improved efficiency of human resource management.

The theory of change of the proposed intervention is as follows - IF the availability and use of official statistics in the country increases: (1) by increasing and further developing of the institutional capacity and knowledge at SSO and thereby by improving the efficiency of statistical production process; (2) as well as by increasing the range and improving the quality of statistical production; (3) by improving the communication of statistical data in the public; AND, IF SSO (4) improves efficiency of its human resource management; THEN SSO will contribute to increased users confidence in the accuracy and reliability of provided statistical data. This will enable the institutions to prepare their social policies, and the researchers and NGO&apos;s to utilize the data, and to argue for the rights of the poor. At the same time, SSO will comply to the existing EU requirements (2019 Communication on EU Enlargement Policy , North Macedonia 2019 Report - Chapter 18 and European Statistics Code of Practice) and the Agenda 2030 (SDG 5; SDG 16 and SDG 17).

The project budget is 14,000,000.00 SEK for the period September 2019 - June 2023.</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">Below is a summary of progress within each component, focusing on the period January - December 2021. 

At a general level, the pandemic continued to be a large challenge during 2021. It led to that the Census of Population, Households and Dwellings was postponed from April to September, which led to further delays within the project since most SSO staff were involved in preparing and conducting the census in August and September. The EU funded IPA project with Bulgaria (which will end in September) has also continued to take staff resources at SSO. 

Nevertheless, 2021 was also the year when the project finally gained momentum with the posting of a resident LTA (in August) and the first on site missions conducted (in October).

A kick-off event was organised in October to celebrate that project implementation could finally start for real with a resident LTA in place and physical missions commencing. The event included speeches by high level officials and a panel discussion on the theme How can we increase use of official statistics in North Macedonia.

Component objective 1: Improved statistical production process efficiency

An updated situation analysis was made during a mission in November which showed that the previous needs analysis remains valid. The mission concluded that SSO is still in need of reforming its planning and monitoring practices and challenge existing management practices. Another conclusion was that the national IPA project is oriented towards production capacity strengthening and complements rather than overlaps with strategic planning and monitoring.

The first step in reforming SSOs planning and monitoring practices was taken towards the end oy the year through the establishment of a planning team. The team is led by a coordinator at the Sector for Support of the Directors Activities and will be the driving force and act as a one stop shop for planning and monitoring at SSO.

Component objective 2: Improved range and quality of statistical production
Following the recommendations from a preliminary Price Statistics mapping in 2020, SSO started to collect price data for services in January 2021 and has since then collected data quarterly for road transports, postal services, and telecommunications. During two digital missions during the year, the results of SSOs data collection were reviewed, and the sample selection was discussed. During the second mission, that was originally planned to be physical mission but was changed to a digital, preliminary index calculations made by the Swedish advisers were reviewed and discussed.

Through several digital meetings during the reporting period, and a digital workshop in May, Statistics Sweden and SSO continued to assess the current situation and define how to structure the development work. As in 2020, this was an effort combining subject matter and IT experts who tried to make a depended assessment of the current state and elaborate on a model for data and metadata. This proved to be difficult to do online but some conclusions were drawn about how data should be transferred to SSO and how it should be stored. These meetings also led to that staff from SSO and SCB started to get to know each other and that the first physical mission, which was planned to be conducted in the fall but was postponed to January 2022, was very well prepared and became highly successful.

Component objective 3: Improved internal and external communications 
A communication strategy was developed during the autumn and was approved by the executive board of SSO before the end of the year. The strategy, that is now available on the web page, sets the overall frames of external communication and will serve as a tool and support to define communication towards different target groups.

Component objective 4: Improved efficiency of human resource management
Not much progress has been made within this component during the reporting period. The two HR trainings that were planned for 2021 were both postponed to 2022. SCB has though continued to develop management training material for heads of departments and heads of sectors at SSO.

In addition to the reported progress within each component, a few other achievements were made

- Through frequent meetings in the project management team, information gaps have been addressed and the project strategy has been assessed. This has led to an adjusted results and monitoring matrix, more usable for continuous planning, monitoring and evaluation.

- SSO has started to cooperate with PARIS21 (a partnership in statistics for development established by the UN, OECD, IMF and the WB) which has improved the conditions for understanding the users needs. During the autumn of 2021 SSO became member of the PARIS21s NSDS (National Strategy for the Development of Statistics) reference group that works with updating NSDS guidelines. The NSDS is a tool that helps countries all over the world to implement statistical plans. By being part of the reference group, SSO gets access to support and expert input that can be used as influence when developing the new 5-year statistical programme.</narrative>
