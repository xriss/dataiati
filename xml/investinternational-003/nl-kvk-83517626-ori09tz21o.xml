   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Zanzibar consists of two large islands, Unguja, which is the largest and most populated island and the smaller and less populated island Pemba. Zanzibar is part of the United Republic of Tanzania but is semi-autonomous. The number of Zanzibar people that currently benefits from appropriate medical hospital care is limited. The percentage of healthcare facilities that are able to deliver the most essential healthcare is by far not sufficient in particular first aid in trauma related cases as well as maternity care. Healthcare of newborn children and women is threatened by a lack of basic medical services and availability of critical medical services. Especially the Neonatal Mortality Rate. Which is said to be 78 deaths per 1,000 births continues to be high, being two times higher than the already high Tanzanian rate. In general both Primary Healthcare Units and the Mnazi Mmoja hospital are not equipped understaffed and the staff is often not well trained.Zanzibar consists of two large islands, Unguja, which is the largest and most populated island and the smaller and less populated island Pemba.
