   <narrative xml:lang="EN">IRC&#x2019;s proposed 12 month Action aims to respond to the unmet education needs of 15, 023 children across Badghis (Qadis, Muqur, Ab Kamari districts) and Helmand (Lashkar Gah, Nada-e-Ali, Nawa, Greshk districts). 
In Badghis a total of 6, 650  children will be targeted &#x2013; 3, 150 out-of-school (OOS) (60% girls) and 3, 500  children currently enrolled in 15 MoE hub schools that are at risk of drop-out. In Badghis, children are conflict affected and from both IDPs and host communities. In Helmand, 8, 373 children that are currently enrolled in 15 MoE hub schools will be targeted that are at risk of drop-out. In Helmand, host community children who are conflict and recently flood affected will be targeted. 15 schools that were flood affected in April 2019 remained closed for 20-30 days after the flood, students then undertook examinations and then went on holidays. Schools are expected to open in September 2019. The UNICEF OOS children report estimates that 86, 947 children in the target districts in Badghis are OOS. IRC conducted a rapid needs assessment in June 2019 which confirmed high levels of unmet needs across education and WASH in education. In Badghis, communities confirmed that CBE classes can support children to engage in education, as well as the provision of learning/teaching materials, recreational activities and textbooks. Less than half of communities have MoE trained teachers and just 20% of communities report having people with skills to volunteer as CBE teachers. Within MoE hub schools, reports confirm that water points are non/partially functional/accessible and that latrines need repairs/upgrades. The majority of teachers that are available are not trained/familiar with protection principles. In Helmand, similar challenges are reported. In addition, near 50% of communities confirmed that school water points need to be rehabilitated and are not fit for drinking. In Badghis, (a) 90 CBE/ALP classes will be established (10month cycle) 90 teachers will be recruited and trained using the EiE harmonized teacher training package student, teacher and classroom learning and basic recreational materials will be distributed WASH facilities (latrines) in/near CBE/ALP classes will receive minor needs based upgrades students will receive hygiene promotion awareness and trainings will be provided to school management shuras (SMS) (b) 15 MoE hub schools will benefit from 100 teachers being trained provision of basic teacher and classroom learning and recreational materials WASH facilities (latrines and water points) will receive minor needs based upgrades and rehabilitation students will receive hygiene promotion awareness and trainings will be provided to already existing SMSs. In Helmand, 15 flood affected MoE hub schools will benefit from 170 teachers being trained provision of basic student, teacher and classroom learning and recreational materials WASH facilities (latrines and water points) will receive minor needs based upgrades and rehabilitation students will receive hygiene promotion awareness and trainings will be provided to already existing SMSs. At all times protection mainstreaming is considered and IRC through its ongoing programming in Badghis and Helmand will facilitate referrals as needed. This Action will complement IRC&#x2019;s ongoing Education Cannot Wait (ECW) intervention, by expanding the reach to an additional 15, 023 children in existing ECW districts, to reach a total of 46, 819 children. IRC will coordinate at all times with the PEDs/DEDs as well as SMSs to increase transparency, sustainability and community acceptance. The proposed intervention has been designed in coordination with all relevant focal points at the provincial and capital level including the EiE Working Group. A local partner will be engaged (to be identified within 3 months of project commencement) in Helmand to support the IRC with hygiene promotion activities in the 15 target MoE hub schools.</narrative>
