   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Winterization Response in Place of Origin in Muqur and Bala Murghab Districts of Badghis Province</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Badghis province, located in west Afghanistan, is characterized by intense external and internal conflict, with instability from Turkmenistan to the north and along its border with Faryab Province. Due to the limited resources, remoteness and accessibility, most people live in dire poverty. 

Christian Aid (CA)/RAADA team conducted a rapid need assessment on August 27-29, 2019 followed by a detailed assessment on October 9-12,2019 in Muqur and Bala Murghab Districts of Badghis Province. Specially improvised questionnaire, interview guide, areas of observation and FGD checklists were developed for this process. The assessment was conducted with over 50 representatives from 1800 HHs in the mentioned district.

Key findings of the assessments Estimated 3000 HHs have been displaced internally (from one village to another village within Muqur and Bala Murghab) as well as to outside (from Muqur and Bala Murghab to Sanjitak and Kharistan sites). The assessment identified that the target population is in high need of winterization support, emergency shelters/shelter up-gradation, improvement of water points, food and NFIs. They also required support to return to their places of origin. Households were heading towards crisis situations as they were left with no means of heating, warm clothes, and other important materials essential for winter life. People were highly vulnerable to the upcoming harsh winter in the absence of essential supply. Children, women, people with disabilities and people with poor economic conditions were especially on the brink. Limited resources, remoteness, and inaccessibility, abject poverty, absence of support mechanisms, etc. are going to add newer dimensions of threat in the coming months.  

The most critical needs, aligned to HRP 2019, identified by the assessment in Muqur and Bala Murghab are: -
 Reintegration to their place of origin
 Winterization assistance 
 NFIs assistance 
 Repairing of shelter/house and water points
 Food shortage

This proposed humanitarian intervention will build the resilience of 1800 IDPs and returnees (returned to their place of origin) HHs in Muqur and Bala Murghab Districts of Badghis province. 
Key humanitarian interventions of the project will be: -
1. Distribution of cash for heating/fuel to 1200 HHs (1000 HHs in Muqur and 200 HHs in Bala Murghab)
2. Distribution of cash for emergency NFIs to 882 HHs (682 HHs in Muqur and 200 HHs in Bala Murghab)
3. Distribution of cash for transportation for voluntarily return to the place origin (from Sanjitak IDP site to Muqur district and inside the district) to 600 HHs in Muqur district
4. Distribution of cash for shelter/house upgrade/repair to 600 newly returned HHs in Muqur district

CA/RAADA will select the target beneficiaries in a transparent manner to ensure that the most affected receive the assistance. The selection will be done in the presence of the community elders and local authorities. The project duration will be 6 months (Nov 1, 2019 to April 30, 2020).

CA&#x2019;s goal is to empower people to live with dignity, able to respond successfully to disasters, risks, and opportunities. CA is a strong believer in inclusion and the localization agenda - an imperative of the World Humanitarian Summit (WHS) 2016. Long-lasting partnership with RAADA (since 2007), the experience of implementing various emergency response projects in the region, and knowledge in technical and managerial issues will give an extra advantage to CA in implementing this project.  CA in partnership with RAADA rolled out a similar ongoing project from ES-NFI/AHF in Qadis district of Badghis. CA has and recently (May 31, 2019) completed another ESNFI/AHF winterization project, where 1979 HHs were supported with winterization assistance in Qala-e-Naw and Muqur districts of Badghis.

CA will be accountable for project design, financial compliances, coordination, and reporting works.</narrative>
