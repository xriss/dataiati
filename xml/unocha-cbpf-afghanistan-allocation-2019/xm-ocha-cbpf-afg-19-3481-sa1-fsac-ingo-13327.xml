   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Livelihoods Recovery Assistance for flood affected farming communities in Faryab Province.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">According to FSAC Gap analysis Report of May 2019, estimated 226,044 people affected by floods whereas a total of more than 42,000 people have been displaced in 23 provinces of Afghanistan. Heavy rains caused flash flooding on 27, 28 and 29 March 2019 in four provinces - esp. Faryab province in the Northern Region. These are the first major floods in the Northern Region in the season. Mainly in Faryab province severe floods destroyed cultivated land and affected livestock, irrigation systems and shelter and mainly affected livelihoods in four districts (Andkhoy, Khancharbagh, Qaramqal and Qurghan) of Faryab. 
The above-mentioned region is already affected by continuous conflict esp. Faryab whereas last year drought and recent floods badly affected to the livelihoods of targeted province of Faryab. Further, in targeted province - the emergency response with regard to emergency livelihoods support to farmers was very limited and severely underserved during drought of 2018. Frequent emergencies and continuous loss to livelihoods and income, heavily affected the capacity of farmers to recover hence the situation also contributed to very low agricultural production. In June 2019, ZOA Afghanistan together with FAO conducted Flood Assessment in Faryab province.. 
The assessment was conducted in 4 most flood affected districts of Faryab i.e Andkhoy, Khancharbagh, Qaramqal and Qurghan. The assessment data shows that local farmers cultivated cereal crops on 172,532 Jarebs (local land measuring unit- 2 jarebs equal to 1 acre) out of which 73,409 Jarebs (42.5 % of total cultivation of staple crop) were destroyed due to floods. More than 7,300 farmers expressed that their cultivated land is heavily affected by the recent floods. During the assessment people expressed that continuous loss of livelihoods and agriculture severely undermined their food security &#x2013; the majority of the population has poor food consumption score whereas during assessment 56% responded that they don&#x2019;t have access to one complete meal in a day. 
Farming communities shared that due to last year drought they could not produce or save sufficient seeds however they purchased wheat seed from market with the loan with high interest rate or with the condition of crop share. The recent flood destroyed their crops and expected future savings. Further, it was observed that affected farmers exhausted their coping strategies  and farming households are forced to displaced and  are malnourished. The proposed seed provision and irrigation system repair assistance will provide 3,000 flood affected households a chance to recover from multiple disaster shocks hence it will also contribute to production and availability of good quality seed locally for next cropping season. The proposed intervention  includes the most vulnerable groups i.e. women headed households/widows and female farmers who lost their crops due to floods.
The objective of this assistance is to support flood affected farming families with immediate agriculture protection assistance and Cash for Work activities to rehabilitate irrigation water structures. The proposed intervention will enable the provision of emergency agriculture inputs, including wheat seed, Urea and DAP fertilizers to 3,000 farmers who lost at least 50% of their crop and Cash for Work (CFW).  CFW activities will target 2,000 beneficiaries to repair and rehabilitate 40 irrigation water infrastructures in the 4 targeted districts of Faryab province. 
The project will also target disabled people, female headed households and female farmers during distribution of agricultural inputs and Cash for Work activities. 

With this intervention ZOA intends to respond to the needs expressed by the flood affected communities and the livelihoods protection response prioritized by FSAC cluster for Faryab province.</narrative>
