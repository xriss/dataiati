    <narrative xml:lang="EN">Results&#xA0;
In general terms AT management have been
1) committed to its set goals and targets, and
2) aware about the complexity on working with tax policy reform.
As a result of this, and of the support from Sweden and other donors to the fund, Mozambique does have one of the highest tax ratios to GDP in the region. &#xA0;
Specific results:&#xA0;
- The tax collection increased in relation to earlier years, with 7 percent over the set goal, mostly due to IVA collection from medium and large tax payers (companies).
- Advancing the roll-out of the e-taxation project. This has been an expensive and delayed process, but is seen as neccessary in order to make the tax payments registered with an online tool. It is a major achievement step towards increasing the tax payment system&apos;s effectiveness that this system is now up and running on almost all of the country&apos;s regional tax offices.&#xA0;
From the Swedish perspective the e-taxation system is also an important reform that will help AT combat corruption and fraud, since it will make it difficult for tax payers in the system to cheat.
- Advancing the customs IT-reform &quot;Janela Unica&quot; that will simplify control and transparency of export and import of goods, as well as make the work flow more efficient by cutting time on each transaction/case.&#xA0;
- AT works in an increasingly focused way to increase tax collection, by communicating better with citizens and businesses and by enrolling more citizens and firms in the tax register.
Lessons learned:&#xA0;
-&#xA0;The years 2016 and 2017 were influenced by the hidden debt scandal in the Mozambique government, which negatively affected the trust and relations between the state administration and donors.
- Sweden remained an active donor to AT, however many other donors decided to freeze their direct funds to AT and to in some cases rechannel them to specific projects such as the e-taxation project. In 2017 Sweden made its last disbursement to the fund, deciding not to continue supporting AT through the CF mechanism.&#xA0;
- The e-taxation project - meant to set up an IT-based tax payment system for the whole country - is expensive and results have been slow. Due to financial shortage AT has not paid the invoices to the implementing firm Novabase, leading to a halt in the development of the system.&#xA0;
- AT:s focus is - as in many other developing countries - more on control instruments (audits, inspections, visits) than on simplifications for taxpayers. This broader focus on tax compliance is needed as it is important in order to set up a sustainable revenue system. This is also in line with the Swedish experience on improving our own tax collection system.
- Audit reports have been a constant problem the last few years. The audit reports are often of poor quality, depending primarily on the low quality of audit firms inMozambique. The delays in processing the procurement of the audit firms, as well as the delays in getting the requested information from AT:s side in time, are also contributing to the poor quality. There have been a number of qualifications in the auditors&apos; management letters in the years 2013-2017.
- In 2017 there was a verification audit conducted, commissioned by donors. This showed that there had been some cases of fraud within the AT administration that had to be investigated further. AT presented an action plan for this, and has since made monthly withdrawals from the two staff members involved in the fraud to compensate for the lost funds. Full repayment to the fund was made in 2018.</narrative>
