    <narrative xml:lang="EN">General question: Results related to the intended outcome 2014Question: Summarise results related to the intended outcome (this information will be sent to Open Aid)Answer: Note that this Statement on Narrative and Financial Report concerns the EoS&apos;s appraisal of the narrative part of the Completion/Final Report for Diakonia&apos;s sub-programme within the AGIR programme, covering years 2010-2014 (hence not only for 2014 as stated in the Trac heading for this section). It also includes the EoS appraisal of the financial part of the Completion/Final Report for Diakonia&apos;s sub-programme within the AGIR programme, with strong focus on year 2014. The AGIR intermediary partner organisations (IPOs) are not, as per agreement, required to provide a final financial report that covers the entire AGIR programme phase (2010-2014), but are rather required to annually provide financial reports and audit reports (audit reports appraised in the Statements on Audit). Hence, this appraisal covers the years 2010-2014 in terms of operations and results, but covers the year 2014 in terms of finances.

At the Common Progress Review Meeting with all the intermediary partner organisations (IPOs) at the end of 2014, the EoS encouraged the IPOs to begin to glance at the Guidelines for multi-annual reporting when drafting their Completion/Final Reports for AGIR I. The underlying rationale was that it provides a good opportunity to &quot;test&quot; the content of the Guidelines. Hence, it is not a contractual requirement, but rather a voluntary choice that could help to identify potential needs to reformulate some reporting requirements and improve the content of the Guidelines. 

Diakonia opted for this voluntary choice and submitted a report that, more or less, followed the proposed structure as per the Guidelines. They have included all sections as per the Guidelines, but added two additional ones; &quot;Quality Assurance&quot; and &quot;Capacity Building of POs&quot;. The size of the report does, however, not follow the limit of the Guidelines, which states a maximum of 40 pages excluding annexes where Diakonia submitted 70 pages excluding annexes.

Since this Trac question concerns a summary of results, it mainly concerns the results sections of the report. Other included sections e.g. Organisational Changes, Funding Mechanisms and Strategies, Application of Upholding Principles, etc., are commented on in the section &quot;Other comments and concluding remarks on the narrative and financial report&quot; below.

Results in the Completion/Final Report submitted are presented in different ways. In the report body text results are found within the section on &quot;Capacity Building&quot; (in terms of results from the capacity building of partner organisations (POs) and in the section &quot;Sub-Programme Results&quot;. There are also aspects of results in the section on &quot;Transversal Questions&quot;. Additionally, the two annexes include results information; Annex 1 being the results framework where Diakonia is providing an account of what was achieved in a more systematic way (per foreseen result and impact established at the outset of the sub-programme in 2010), and Annex 2 being four detailed stories of change where the sub-programme has made a difference. However, the initially submitted report did not include a detailed reporting back on the results framework on which e.g. the Annual Work Plan for 2014 was based (based upon which the EoS included results to follow-up as part of the Results Register), hence, this was also subsequently submitted to the EoS.

Within the Completion/Final Report the following represents results reportedly achieved within three thematic areas of Diakonia;


SUMMARY OF RESULTS WITHIN ORGANISATIONAL STRENGTHENING:

Diakonia has included a table within its final report on results in the area of capacity strengthening of its POs. Here Diakonia reports that training in results based management has provoked some POs to undertake their strategic planning based on a results approach. Also, Diakonia report that the POs&apos; reports now contain less descriptions of activities and more results (effects and changes) than before. 

Training in HRBA has triggered a few of the POs to ensure they have a programme that is sensitive to the issue of human rights. 

Training in Administrative &amp; Financial Management has led to a better segregation of powers within the POs and to a situation where almost the totality of POs now present audit reports in line with the requirements and without qualifications. Diakonia also reports that the administrative and financial management of the POs has become more and more transparent and budget plans, as well as financial reports, have improved. Additionally, that the POs&apos; Boards have improved their follow up of the financial and administrative management of the POs.

Training was also provided in gender equality and six out of the total 12 POs now have a gender policy approved, and nine out of 12 are now reported to problematise around gender as part of their planning process.

Similarly, training in HIV/AIDS was arranged and four out of 12 POs now have HIV/AIDS policies in place, and 9 out of 12 are reported to be more sensitive to issues of HIV/AIDS and considers such as part of their planning (see more about results vis-&#xE0;-vis cross cutting issues further below).


SUMMARY OF RESULTS WITHIN THEMATIC RESULTS:

In the area of participation and social accountability, Diakonia, at a general level, reports that mechanisms that allow for the monitoring of and participation of rights holders, and mechanisms that ensure accountability of duty bearers, were established. However, while there were such important gains, partner organisations (POs) with provincial delegations encountered a challenge, namely, to expand these mechanisms to provinces and districts in the country in order to also increasingly improve the performance and accountability of local government structures through right holder participation and through right holders&apos; monitoring of governance.

Diakonia provides various results categorised by implementing PO. Here a few examples within Participation and Social Responsibility;

ACAMO (Associa&#xE7;&#xE3;o Mo&#xE7;ambicana dos Cegos e Ambl&#xED;opes) reports that the participation of visully impaired persons in demanding respect for rights and accountability has led to that schools and teachers are increasingly skilled and open to deal with students with visual impairment; that manuals and lessons in driving schools include the protection of and sensitivity to people with visual impairment (total and visually impaired users e.g. with white canes); some districts (Mopeia, Maganja da Costa, Gil&#xE9;) have now included actions that aim to adress issues within the area of disabilities in their annual plans; in the province of Niassa quarterly coordination meetings between ACAMO and the Office of Women and Children within the Provincial Directorate of Social Action are established where concerns of people living with disabilities are heard and discussed; a participatory process involving the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Institute of Training and Adult Education (IFEA) has established a &quot;inclusive module&quot; as well as additional materials on literacy and inclusive adult education in Mozambique that is now integrated in the new curriculum of adult education.

CEDE (Centro de Estudos de Democracia e Desenvolvimento) reports that groups for local governance monitoring are under establishment in a twelve districts where four are already up and functional with ten duty bearers and twenty rights holders in each that togther discuss and interpret the results of undertaken monitoring.

Parlamento Juvenil (PJ) reports that they see, as a result of their efforts, that leaders have become more sensitive to the problems of youth, for example, PJ has established a permanent dialogue between the Governor of Niassa province and a group of organised young people from the districts of the province where the youth have a space to make the leaders listen to their concerns. PJ also reports that more youth now participate in the consultative councils and meetings by district governments. There is a greater openness to youth participation in the development observatories (space arranged by the Government for dialogue with civil society). Also more youth particiapted in the observation of the general and legislative elections in 2014 and the local elections of 2013.

AMMCJ (Associa&#xE7;&#xE3;o Mo&#xE7;ambicana das Mulheres Juristas) reports the participation within the revision of the Penal Code reverted the initial suggestion of revision that would have made the Penal Code worse from the perspective of women&apos;s rights and especially their sexual and reproductive rights. This was a really important gain in Mozambique in 2014. They also report that provincial judges and prosecutors were sensitised about legal instruments relating to women&apos;s rights and have began to act in accordance with the law. 

LDH (Liga dos Direitos Humanos) reports that their efforts led to that the Ministry of Justice, during the reporting period, initiated the monitoring of human rights standards in national prisons.

Here a few examples within Legal Responsibility and Human Rights;

AMMCJ reports that more disadvantaged groups of the society have had access to justice and got their rights respected through provided free legal assistance. AMMCJ and MULEIDE (Associa&#xE7;&#xE3;o de Mulheres, Lei e Desenvolvimento) both report that judicial institutions are found to have, during the reporting period, become more aware of the need for greater protection of the Family Law, and that there has been an increase of cases of violence against women denunciated, which in turn contributed to a current trend of a reduced number of cases of domestic violence.

LDH reports that their access to monitor the conditions in prisons improved during the reporting period, which has led to an identified improved care and protection of the human rights of prisoners. They also report that the possibility of impunity has reduced e.g. the news outlets (newspapers and TV) reports more frequently about police officers that violate human rights and denunciate crimes such as trafficking in human organs.   

Rede da Crianca / Rede CAME report that the contributions from civil society organisations to the revision of the Penal Code were crucial in improving articles that concern the rights of children. For example the age to be criminalised was increased. Moreover, Rede CAME reports that religious leaders in Southern Africa as well as prosecutors in Mozambique have become more aware about the issue of trafficking in women and children in the SADC region, and continue to work for an improved definition of strategies to protect against such crimes - there is a need for a harmonization of laws in the Southern Africa region in order to be able for the protect especially children from trafficking. 

There are also reports about an increased awareness about human rights among duty bearers. For ex;

AMMCJ &amp; AWEPA (Associa&#xE7;&#xE3;o dos Parlamentares Europeus com &#xC1;frica) report that their awareness raising efforts with Parliamentarians led to an improved knowledge among them about women&apos;s rights, which culminated in the adoption of the revised penal code that, for example, decriminalises abortion. This is also a very important and noteworthy result from 2014.

MULEIDE (Associa&#xE7;&#xE3;o de Mulheres, Lei e Desenvolvimento) report that there has been an increase in complaints and requests for assistance by victims of domestic violence.

In terms of Political Responsiblity and Multiparty Democracy:

AWEPA reports that members of municipal assemblies, as a result of the capacity building procided and close collaboration, are better able to monitor and represent the interests of their constituents. AWEPA also reports that parliamentarians, more generally during the reporting period, have played a more proactive role in the development of policies that concern sectors related to the Millennium Development Goals as well as other economic issues and that they better exerice their watchdog function especially the monitoring of internal and external resources as public goods. Politicians are more enlightened about their role and the contact they need to ensure with their voting public. 

In this area, CEDE reports about the important work undertaken in terms of developing the new electoral law package during the reporting period. A Commission on Public Administration, Local Power and Social Communication was established with the aim of interacting with civil society in the task of reforming the electoral package in order to have a regulatory law that prevents ambiguities that causes different interpretations of the various recommended procedures covered by the electoral law. Draft laws were considered and partly approved by Parliament in 2012 as the Law on Public Probity, as well as the Electoral Law approved and promulgated by the President of the Republic. 

CEDE also reports about an increased awareness among district administrators (in Maganja da Costa, Marromeu, Ang&#xF3;nia, Angoche, Mocimboa da Praia, Zavala, Jangamo, Changara) about the added value of government interaction with citizens - something which is reported to be reflected in the fact that the management of local development funds are now better handled. Also members of the provincial assemblies are reported to have improved their role as legislators and representatives of the people in the supervision of public affairs (e.g. they now manage to better supervise the budget execution within their provinces). Provincial assemblies, provincial governments and district administrators have during the reporting period taken steps towards closer cooperation on good governance and on local local development, for example, through joint planning of their monthly meetings and joint monitoring plans.

PJ prepared a youth manifest for monitoring and presented it to the public in 2013. They also undertook common advocacy with the political parties in order to ensure that the youth&apos;s priorities are included in the electoral manifests by all parties. 

OE (Observat&#xF3;rio Eleitoral) reports that the political space for different political parties to participate and discuss the electoral legislation has become more inclusive during the reporting period.


SUMMARY OF RESULTS FROM WORKING WITH CROSS CUTTING ISSUES:
Diakonia has a specific section in its Completion/Final report where is reports on its work of implementing transversal questions such as gender, environment, conflict sensibility and HIV/AIDS. Diakonia acknowledges in the report that the integration of cross cutting issues has constituted a challenge and to attain a more satisfactory level a lot of capacity development has been necessary. 

Diakonia starts off providing an account about the fact that the intergration of cross cutting issues (Gender and HIV/AIDS) were not harmonised among the four IPOs in the AGIR programme at the outset. An common approach was hence in 2011 undertaken in order to ensure such a harmonisation. 

However, the issue of mainstreaming these issues remained a challenge, and to achieve a more satisfactory level of quality there was much work to be done. It was in the context of cooperation and harmonisation of training actions that Diakonia, together with other intermediary (IBIS, Oxfam Novib and WeEffect), in 2012, held a training in the areas of gender and HIV. It aimed at strengthening the technical and institutional capacities of partner organisations to better integrate gender equality both internally in the organisation and externally to their operations. That same year, 2012, Diakonia initiated a new training methodology to partners i.e. &quot;training of trainers&quot; in gender mainstreaming issues in programs and projects. This training benefited two representatives from each partner organisation (one from the Secretariat and one from the Board) thus making a total of 23 participants from Diakonia&apos;s POs. Furthermore, each IPO and hence also including Diakonia, has under the whole sub-programme implementation phase provided its POs with support in terms of developing guidelines and other methods aiming to integrate gender and HIV/AIDS in any internal and external actions undertaken by the POs. Finally, Diakonia, in its report, describes that monitoring of cross cutting issues is also added where both the integration of gender equality and HIV/AIDS at the POs&apos; headquarters is monitored, as well as their application of the cross cutting issues at provincial and district level.

So with these actions (training and monitoring) it was expected that partners would be assisted in establishing internal systems and action plans on gender equality and endow them with knowledge in order to ensure qualitative content in, and implementation of, their guiding instruments (policies, plans, strategies) in the area of gender, as well as qualitative tools for planning, budgeting and monitoring activities based on gender (development of gender sensitive indicators / measuring instruments outcomes / impacts).

Diakonia reports that two of the planned capacity building events (one in HIV/AIDS and one in environment) were not undertaken due to the fact that the POs indicated they had already received training in HIV/AIDS and due to the fact that Diakonia shifted from normal training to train the trainer. It is not clear the EoS why this would lead to that no capacity building event in environment took place? Diakonia in general says nothing about the integration of environment within its programme within the report. Other challenges, mentioned by Diakonia as to why this integration of cross cutting issues has been an issue, include the fact that there is poor knowledge about how to fight HIV and AIDS in society in general, and that this, therefore, is also reflected within the organisations i.e. how they should ensure the cross-cutting integration theme in their programmes / projects. Aditionally, that there is a general challenge of acceptance, within the Mozambican society, of balance within gender relations.

Diakonia does, however, report on some advances; within the Diakonia sub-programme there were for example at the end of the sub-programme period 9 of their 12 POs with good infrastructure in terms of mainstreaming gender and HIV/AIDS in their plans of operation at the level of headquarters, but also at potential level of delegations through assigned focal points. Also 6 of the 12 POs have gender policies and 4 of the 12 POs have HIV/AIDS Policies.</narrative>
