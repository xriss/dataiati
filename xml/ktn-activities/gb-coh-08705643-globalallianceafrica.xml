   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Working in partnership with the UK&#x2019;s Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) and Innovate UK, KTN Global Alliance Africa drives knowledge transfer and collaboration that foster long-lasting, strategic partnerships between Nigeria, Kenya, South Africa and the UK. In doing so, it aims to accelerate innovations that promote inclusive economic growth, job creation and reduction of poverty.

Global attempts to address development challenges have undergone a shift in recent years. Whether seeking to create employment opportunities, promote economic growth or reduce poverty, innovation and technology are increasingly viewed as fundamental contributors of solutions to long-term problems. Different players &#x2013; including the UK government &#x2013; are taking action.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Global Alliance Africa project is delivered through 4 key interventions: i) Place Based Innovation, ii) Open Innovation, iii) Innovation Governance Knowledge Exchange and iv) Strengthening the Investment Pipeline.

A summary of each intervention has been provided below:

I) PLACE BASED INNOVATION 

Much of the current support and investment in innovation in our partner countries of Nigeria, South Africa and Kenya has concentrated upon particular urban centres. However, pan-African and many African national innovation strategies cite regional self-sufficiency and resilience as a top priority. Our own research reinforces that there is a strong demand for the shortening of supply chains, promotion of circular design and better links with the informal sector on a regional scale. Our Place-Based Innovation intervention will strengthen the capacity and resilience of local innovation ecosystems through first working to better understand regional challenges, capabilities and potential for innovation, and then supporting action-orientated local innovation networks in areas of high potential.

II) OPEN INNOVATION

Global Alliance Africa&#x2019;s Open Innovation intervention aims to develop and maintain a collaborative culture between industry players and their associated supply chains or government agencies. By applying KTN&#x2019;s well-established methods for supporting Open Innovation, we will provide a safe space for diverse collaborators to respond to shared industry challenges in a mutually beneficial way. Challenge holders will be supported in finding innovative solutions to key challenges and identifying collaborative solutions. Solution providers will be provided with opportunities to form new partnership and gain access to new market where their innovations can make a difference.

III) INNOVATION GOVERNANCE KNOWLEDGE EXCHANGE

Heavily bureaucratic, or ineffective governance structures inhibiting a quick response under changing circumstances are often a barrier to innovation progress. If innovation governance systems are unable to respond and adapt quickly, they are under-prepared to facilitate the kinds of game-changing innovations needed for rapid development impact. Our Innovation Governance Knowledge Exchange intervention aims to ensure a strategic, coherent and demand-driven approach to linking African innovation policy stakeholders with their international peers to share best practice and generate insights on how to best overcome these barriers.

IV) STRENGTHENING THE INVESTMENT PIPELINE

Lack of access to finance can be a major barrier to innovation. Often this has less to do with lack of funding, and more to do with visibility and understanding between sources of funding and innovators seeking that funding. Our Strengthening the Investment Pipeline intervention will work to improve mutual understanding of needs and opportunities between investor and innovator communities through a combination of community and capacity building, upskilling innovation support and match-making activities.</narrative>
