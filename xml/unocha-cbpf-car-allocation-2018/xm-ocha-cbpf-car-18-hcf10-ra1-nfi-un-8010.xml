   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Emergency Shelter Assistance to Conflict Affected Individuals in Paoua</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">On December 27, 2017, intense conflict broke out between armed groups causing mass displacement of people in the Ouham Pende Prefecture. Many of its residents got displaced from Pessah, Bioko, Bemol, Bah Bassar, Bediere, Mia - Pende, Gouzi and moved towards the Paoua sous &#x2013; prefecture to seek refuge and protection. As of March 5, 2018, according to the Commission Mouvement de Population (CMP), there are 76,238 IDPs (11,469 households). This update was shared during the last coordination meeting held in Paoua. Before these displacements, Paoua had a population of about 23,000. The displaced population has tripled the population size of the city resulting in massive congestion in host families. IDPs are occupying abandoned and unfinished buildings while some are sleeping in the open air. 

In the context of multiple and prolonged crises in the country including Paoua, this project seeks to respond to the most urgent needs of the affected population. IOM seeks to provide emergency shelter (communal shelters) assistance aimed at providing dignified and secured dwelling place for those affected by the crises. This action will help to reduce congestion in host families and provide secured place for those in abandoned and or unfinished buildings. This will include the construction of 25 communal shelters to accommodate 300 IDP households (estimated 1,500 individuals) and 7 communal kitchens at 9m x 3m. Each shelter measures 20m x 10m to accommodate a maximum of 12 households (estimated 60 individuals). The communal shelters will be constructed at a site already identified by the local authorities. The project will be implemented in close coordination with the local authorities, IDP representatives and relevant humanitarian partners intervening in the zone, particularly the CCCM/Shelter/NFI, protection, WASH and health cluster partners in order to foster complementarity especially with regards to IDPs&apos; access to other humanitarian services (including WASH, protection, NFI, etc.) funded through the same funding mechanism. 

The shelters will be constructed using timbers and tarpaulins while the kitchens will use metal sheets as roof and dwarf wall.  

In coordination with the local authorities, IDP representatives and partner agencies, IOM will target beneficiaries in congested host families as well as those occupying abandoned/unfinished buildings. IOM recognizes that almost all individuals affected by the crises have some level of vulnerability, however, this project will target extremely vulnerable households including: 
	Single women heads of households
	Single women breastfeeding (1 &#x2013; 3 months)
	Single pregnant women
	Elderly persons more than 60 years of age
	Disabled persons    

The above vulnerability criteria is not exhaustive as IOM will be open to receive where possible additional criteria from cluster&apos;s partner to consider in the beneficiary selection process.  

The shelter management committee (smc) will be established among beneficiaries to continue creating awareness on good practices to prevent the structure from sustaining damage against flood and fire outbreak. IOM already has some awareness materials from past projects that can be used for this activity. The materials help to guide beneficiaries in applying relevant steps to protect their shelters against flood and fire outbreak.</narrative>
