       <narrative xml:lang="EN">As the world celebrated 100 years of the life and legacy of Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela, the United Nations Development Programme, signed a memorandum of understanding with the Thembekile Mandela Foundation as a pledge of our support to the Leading Like Mandela Leadership Programme. The programme will contribute to the transformation of South Africa by cultivating a cadre of thought leaders who embrace the leadership qualities and values lived out by the iconic Nelson Mandela. Values that include selflessness, inclusivity, transformation, accountability and self-application. The UNDP contributed towards the development and improvement of the curriculum as well as tracking the programme for the purposes of documenting and sharing lessons and best practices in comparison with similar programmes across the world.

The National School of Government (NSG) conducts the leadership training aspect of this programme, as such, the NSG also signed an MOU with the Thembekile Mandela Foundation. NSG introduced transformational constitutionalism as a starting point for ethical leadership. Challenges to building ethical leadership exist, amongst which were a limited understanding of transformative constitutionalism and an absence of an effective affirmative economic development strategy, unable to change the social inequality; and the effect of unemployment across the landscapes of peri-urban landscapes.

As the Leading Like Mandela Programme is being introduce, there are notable injustices and atrocities that continue to plaque the world with millions of people being denied the right to be human as a result of poverty, the unavailability of basic necessities such as food, jobs, water and shelter, education, health care and a healthy environment. This calls for conscious leaders who selflessly strive to improve the lives of their people sustainably. &#x201C;Granddad&#x2019;s leadership style was inspired by his attendance at tribal council. This programme provides the space to empower leaders with a deeper awareness and understanding of the characteristics and qualities required to Lead Like Mandela.</narrative>
