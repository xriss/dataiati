The World Bank Group&apos;&apos;s &quot;Information and Communications for Development Report&quot; 2009 sites a 1.38% increase in economic growth in low- and middle-income economies for each 10% increase in broadband penetration.  3)	Innovation/International competitiveness: Broadband enables access to ideas and idea exchange globally, thus transforming research and development. It facilitates trade in services and globalization and improves countries&apos;&apos; competitiveness. According to the World Economic Forum report, &quot;The Global Information Technology Report 2010-2011&quot;, there is a direct correlation between the Network Readiness Index, which measures the use and development of ICTs and countries&apos;&apos; international competitiveness.  4)	Improved performance of social services: Availability of broadband improves public services and enhances national business environment and competitiveness. Access to broadband and consequently to greater data transparency and mobility also strengthens the ability to monitor service delivery and accountability in health, health insurance system for the poor, education, early childhood development etc.  5)	Competitive Environment: The project will contribute to competition while promoting broader product offerings and higher quality of service.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">1)	The project aims to support the expansion of mobile broadband connectivity, improving significantly the performance of mobile networks countrywide. Despite high mobile penetration, a relevant portion of mobile data  is still under 2G/3G technology. Meanwhile, 3G cells have a very high utilization rate as a result of growing demand for data and penetration of smartphones. This investment will support the rollout of much needed additional data capacity, eventually putting Telecom Personal at par with regional peers.  2)	Productivity enhancement/Economic growth: Broadband directly contributes towards improving private sector productivity and has a transformative effect on economic and social development.
