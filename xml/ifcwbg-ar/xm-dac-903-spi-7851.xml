   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Summary Of Project Information (SPI)       Project Name    Argentina-Patagonia Mint            Region    Latin America - Argentina        Sector       Project No007851   Projected Board DateNovember 24, 1997   Company NamePatagonia Mint S.A.   Technical Partner and/or Major Shareholders    	The Project will be equaly one-third owned by (a) A.M. Todd Co., a privately held company based in Michigan and which is one of the largest mint oil processors and dealers in the world; (b) Wyckoff Farms, also privately held, and a large producer of mint primarily in Washington state; and (c) Pe&#xF1;aflor S.A., a large Argentine privately held company, which produces grapes, wine and fruit juices, and is based in Mendoza.    Project Cost Including proposed IFC investment    	Total project cost is estimated t US$18.5 million. IFC is considering a US$11.0 million investment in SBT, of which US$6.0 million for IFCs own account (A Loan of US$5 million and C Loan of US$1 million) and US$5.0 million for participants accounts (the IFC B Loan).     Location of project and Description of site    	About two thirds of the plantation will be located in the Mendoza province and the remaining one third in the Cordoba province. Studies have been conducted on the soil and water quality at the intended production location, and have been found satisfactory; in general agro ecological conditions are similar to those of established mint production areas in the US.    Description of Company and Purpose of Project    	The Project consists of developing approximately 2,800 hectares of mint plantation and a mint oil distillery. About two thirds of the plantation will be located in the Mendoza province and the remaining one third in the Cordoba province.   The plantation will utilize modern irrigation and harvesting equipment. Production will primarily target export markets, where mint oil is used for flavoring commercial products such as candy and toothpaste. Mint production is presently concentrated in few countries, and the Project responds to demand from mint users, primarily multinational consumer goods companies, for a broader supply base to ensure more consistent quality and procurement reliability.   The Project supports investments in rural areas of the country, and will convert low value, currently unused land into a modern plantation. The Project involves substantial technology transfer to Argentina from leading companies in the international mint industry. The Project is expected to generate employment for about 120 people, and provide export earnings of US $ 8 to 9 million per year. Successful implementation of this project may lead to diversification of Argentinas agricultural exports and Argentina becoming a major mint producer in the world.    Environmental Category and Issues    	This is a category B project according to IFC&apos;&apos;s environmental review procedure.  Key environmental issues associated with this project include  pesticide handling and application,  water supply, liquid and solid waste disposal, power supply, air emissions, employee training, provision of personal protective equipment, and fire protection.The mint oil distillation process produces little waste.  The extracted plant matter is returned to the farm as a soil amendment, and small amounts of wastewater are likewise used for irrigation.  Pesticide use, handling and storage follows US regulatory specifications and meets the World Bank guidelines.  The company has a detailed health and safety training program in place and the distillery meets international health and safety standards.    The  is  from the Public Information Center.
