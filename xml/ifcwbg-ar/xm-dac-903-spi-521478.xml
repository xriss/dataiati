   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Van der Wiel Stortgas b.v (VWS) business focuses on consulting, soil remediation/clean up, collection and re-use of waste, landfill gas extraction, landfill gas utilization project development and operation, and treatment of landfill leachate and contaminated groundwater.  VWS is owned by Van der Wiel Holding b.v. (VWH), which is based in Drachten, the Netherlands.    VWS is developing a landfill gas (LFG) collection and flaring project at the Villa Dominico landfill in Buenos Aires, Argentina.  The project collects LFG through pipes that are (being) installed in the landfill, LFG extraction using blowers, and LFG flaring.  The project is being implemented in phases, with the first phase becoming operational in the 3rd quarter of 2005. The project is expected to reduce emissions from the landfill by up to 5.3 M tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) in the form of Certified Emission Reductions (CERs) under the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) of the Kyoto Protocol by the end of 2012. However, high volumes of leachate in the landfill are expected to limit the overall volume of CERs that will be generated to less than 3 M.   The first two stages of the project are designed to deliver more than the volume needed to satisfy the delivery requirements under an emission reduction purchase agreement with the IFC-Netherlands Carbon Facility (INCaF).  A surplus will be generated for contingency purposes and/or for sale to other buyers.  Subsequent phases will be installed to generate and sell additional CERs to other buyers.  INCaF will be the senior buyer until the INCaF contract commitments have been satisfied.  VWS and CEAMSE, the landfill owner, will assess the economic feasibility of removing leachate with a view to increasing gas collection.  VWS may also install an optional facility to use gas to generate electricity for on-site use.</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">The landfill gas project is located near the southern suburbs of Buenos Aires in the District of Avellaneda, Province of Buenos Aires, Argentina. The site is bordered by the Santo Domingo Channel to the north, Tomas Espora Avenue to the south, the Rio de la Plata River to the east, and the West Buenos Aires-La Plata Highway to the west.  The landfill is owned by Coordinacion Ecologica Area Metropolitana Sociedad del Estado (CEAMSE), a government entity responsible for waste management in the Buenos Aires region.  The landfill accepted municipal solid waste from the greater Buenos Aires area between 1978 and 2004.    The landfill holds 47,000,000 metric tonnes of waste in 27 modules in an area of almost 298 hectares with an estimated average depth of approximately 15 m.  No flaring of landfill gas occurred on the site prior to the initiation of a pilot test project by VDWS in mid-2004.  The landfill gas collection system consisting of vertical and horizontal wells and pipes is being installed in phases; start-up of Phase 1 occurred in September 2005.  The project is expected to eventually cover a majority of the landfill.  Gas will be piped to the flare facility.  The gas extraction facility will cover 204 square meters, while the flare will cover 16 square meters.</narrative>
