   <narrative xml:lang="EN">IFC is considering providing Noble Argentina SA (Noble Argentina or the company) financing of up to $40 million in the form of an A loan (the Loan) to support the companys $230 million construction and operation of a soybean crushing facility (the Plant) in its port terminal in Timbues, Santa Fe Province, Argentina. The balance of the funding will be in the form of a $75 million A loan from InterAmerican Development Bank (IDB), $45 million syndicated loan by IDB, and $70 million in equity and subordinated shareholder loans.   The plant includes:    - an 8,500 metric ton (mt) per day soybean crushing facility,    - a soybean dehulling facility,    - a steam and 17MW electrical energy cogeneration unit,    - meal storage capacity of 110,000 mt,    - oil tanks with 45,000 mt capacity,    - storage facility for 300,000 mt soybean, and    - handling facilities.     The project expands the capabilities of the companys existing grain river port terminal beyond origination, port services and exporting of grain, to include crushing and exporting product.   Noble Argentina is a commodity trader based in Argentina that offers a range of agricultural commodity products, as well as logistics and technical services. The company has been operating for slightly more than 5 years, and within that period has grown to become the 10th ranked exporter of soybean, corn and wheat from Argentina.   Noble Argentina was established in 2001 following Noble Group Limiteds purchase of Andre &amp; Cies Asia assets and subsequent expansion into producing countries such as Argentina. Noble Group Limited (Noble Group or the Group) remains the 100% indirect owner of Noble Argentina.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project is expected to provide identifiable positive impact to the company and to several local communities. For the company, this project provides opportunity for further growth and diversification from trading and export of beans to crushing and production of product. For the local communities, expected benefits include the creation of employment and the increased demand for goods and services linked to the storage and processing activities, as well as linkages with local farmers and intermediaries in rural areas who provide raw materials to the company. There are also benefits in the form of various taxes (income tax, export taxes, etc.) paid to the government. However, in view of the export tax differential between oil/meal (32%) and soybean (35%), the project is also expected to result in some forgone export taxes for the government.</narrative>
