   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Summary Of Project Information (SPI)       Project Name    Argentina-Terminal 6 S.A.               Region    Latin America and the Caribbean      Sector   Project No007058   Projected Board DateOctober 31, 1995   Company NameTerminal 6 S.A.   Technical Partner and/or Major Shareholders    	Terminal 6 is owned by four large Argentine agricultural companies: Aceitera General Deheza (22.4%), Aceitera Chab&#xE1;s (22.4%), Buyatti (32.8%) and Guipeba (22.4%). Terminal 6 is operated as a cost center for these companies, each of which ships large quantities of goods through the facility.    Project Cost Including proposed IFC investment    	Estimated project cost is US$19.8 million, including civil works, equipment, contingencies, start-up costs, value added tax, working capital, financial fees and the refinancing of an existing US$4 million IFC loan. IFCs proposed investment includes an A loan of US$10.5 million and a B loan of US$6.5 million.    Location of project and Description of site    	Terminal 6 is situated in the San Martin area, approximately 450 km north of the mouth of the Paran&#xE1; river. The terminal has 56 hectares of land, 1 berthing facility for 80,000 DWT vessels, a barge pier, 5 flat-floor storage silos, 10 concrete vertical silos, a rail unloading station, 2 truck unloading stations, office buildings, a laboratory and workshops.    Description of Company and Purpose of Project    The project consists of the expansion of an existing rail receiving station, the construction of two new storage silos, the refurbishment and improvement of an existing barge pier and the refinancing of an existing IFC loan. Terminal 6 is an agricultural port and storage facility which principally handles oilseed by-products and grains. Terminal 6 currently handles approximately 3 million tons of by-products and grains annually, with the bulk of its throughput provided by its sponsor companies and the remainder by third party users. The aim of the project is to increase Terminal 6s throughput capacity by increasing its rail receiving and storage capacities. This will enable the company to capitalize on the expected increase in Argentine agricultural production and recent improvements in Argentinas rail network.    Environmental Category and Issues    	This is a category B project according to IFCs environmental review procedure. Principal issues include: air emissions, liquid effluents, solid wastes, spill prevention, fire prevention, emergency response, and employee exposure to noise and dust. Dust emissions due to the handling of grain or oil extracted meals are controlled with suction systems that convey the dust to cyclone separators, where it is reclaimed. Stormwater and wash water effluent can contain grain dust, but no toxic substances are employed in the products handled. Fire prevention is designed into the plant through the selection of sealed and anti-static equipment and through housekeeping and operating practices.    The  is  from the Public Information Center.
