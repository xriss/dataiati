   <narrative xml:lang="EN">- Raise industry standards and improve sustainability:   FVs expansion program is expected to have a catalytic effect in developing and improving the quality and environmental sustainability of local suppliers and producers. Additionally, it is expected that the small companies acquired by FV will benefit from introduction by FV of good and prudent managerial and operational practices and its well established distribution network.  - Expansion of Argentine export base:   FVs ability to increase export is dependent on the proposed project, as the plants are now working at almost full capacity and are mainly sourcing the local market. In addition, the project includes the necessary investment to enhance FVs presence in export markets. Finally, the production facilities upgrade and increased economies of scale will improve FVs competitive position and enhance its export possibilities.  - Job creation:  FVs expansion is expected to create about 200 new job positions within the company and about 500 indirect jobs in the supply chain. Because of the importance of design, as well as level of quality and consistency required for the manufacturing process, many of these jobs will be of highly skilled nature.  - Creation of consumer surplus:   FVs cost optimization is expected to eventually translate into relatively lower prices to end users, primarily within the construction sector. Lower prices for building materials will benefit the housing sector.</narrative>
