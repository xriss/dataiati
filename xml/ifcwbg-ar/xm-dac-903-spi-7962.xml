   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Summary Of Project Information (SPI)       Project Name    Argentina-Terminal 6 S.A.            Region    Latin America and the Caribbean        Sector       Project No007962   Projected Board DateMay 9, 1997   Company NameTerminal 6 S.A.   Technical Partner and/or Major Shareholders    	Terminal 6 is owned by four Argentine agricultural companies: Aceitera General Deheza, Aceitera Chab&#xE1;s, Buyatti and Guipeba-Ceval. Terminal 6 serves as the port facility through which the sponsors export their pelletized meal after crushing.    Project Cost Including proposed IFC investment    	The estimated project cost is US$24.8 million, including civil works, equipment, contingencies, value added tax, working capital and financing fees. IFC&apos;&apos;s proposed investment would include an A loan of US$10 million and a B loan of US$11 million.    Location of project and Description of site    	Terminal 6 is an agricultural port and storage facility located in the San Martin area approximately 450 km north of the mouth of the Paran&#xE1; river. The terminal has 56 hectares of land, 1 berthing facility for 80,000 DWT vessels, a barge pier, 7 flat-floor silos, 10 concrete vertical silos, a rail unloading station, 2 truck unloading stations and ancillary office buildings, workshops and a laboratory.    Description of Company and Purpose of Project    	The project consists of the expansion of the port facility to accomodate additional volumes from a new 4,800 ton per day soybean crushing plant located adjacent to the port. Major civil works would comprise the construction of 2 additional flat-floor and 34 vertical storage silos and the construction of an additional berth.  Terminal 6 currently handles an estimated 4 million tons of oilseed by-products and grains annually, with the bulk of its throughput provided by its sponsor companies and the remainder by third parties. The aim of the project is to increase Terminal 6&apos;&apos;s storage and loading capacity to accomodate new volumes from a proposed crushing plant located adjacent to the port. IFC&apos;&apos;s Agribusiness Department is considering the financing of the new crushing plant, T6 Industrial, which will be owned by Terminal 6&apos;&apos;s shareholders. Given the current efficiency of the port terminal and its proximity to the crushing plant, the project would contribute to the creation of a highly competitive soybean crushing complex.    Environmental Category and Issues    	This is a category B project according to IFC&apos;&apos;s environmental review procedure. Principal issues include: air emissions, liquid effluents, solid wastes, spill prevention, fire prevention, emergency response, and employee exposure to noise and dust. Dust emissions due to the handling of grain or oil extracted meals are controlled with suction systems that convey the dust to cyclone separators, where it is reclaimed. Stormwater and washwater effluent can contain grain dust but no toxic substances are employed in the products handled. Fire prevention is designed into the plant through the selection of sealed and anti-static equipment and through housekeeping and operating practices.    The  is  April 9, 1997 from the Public Information Center.       Date SPI sent to PIC     April 8, 1997      For Additional Information contact:  Corporate Relations Unit -   telephone: (202) 473-7711   facsimile: (202) 676-0365  Environmental documents for this project are available at http://www.ifc.org and from the World Bank InfoShop (http://www.worldbank.org/html/pic/aboutinfo.html).</narrative>
