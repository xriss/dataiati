   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Outsourcing: TIBA is performing in Argentina services that are otherwise carried out in-house (mainly in the US) by Tier 1 content providers (i.e., Disney, Fox, ESPN, etc.). By outsourcing, the industry achieves efficiency, as broadcasters concentrate in their core business of producing content, while players like TIBA specialize and bring higher service quality to critical parts of the value added chain.  

Position Buenos Aires as a LAC media and entertainment center: Over the last few years, Tier 1 broadcasters have relocated Spanish-speaking support and creative resources to Argentina, lured by low/medium salary levels for an otherwise highly creative HR pool. 

Targeted advertisement: By providing efficiences (i.e., in spectrum usage, in compression, in content management, etc.), TIBA allows its customers to open new feeds of the same channels.  This permits the streaming of more relevant and dedicated content and advertising to local audiences throughout LAC.

Non-traditional, high-value added export: Over 90% of TIBA&apos;s revenues consist of export of services, thus increasing fiscal revenues and hard currency generation for the country.

Increased delivery of content: Virtuous cycle, whereby more content drives new distribution channels and services, which create more demand and larger audiences. This improves cost structures and economies of scale, which provides better access to affordable relevant information.

Employment: TIBA contributes to increasing the employment of technical skilled labor.  The Company is seen as cutting edge in LAC&apos;s broadcasting industry.  For many technicians, TIBA is their first job, thanks to agreements with Engineering universities.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project consists of equipment financing and the strengthening of the balance sheet of Telepuerto Internacional Buenos Aires S.A.s (TIBA or the Company) to support its growth plans in Argentina and the LAC region.  TIBA is LACs leading independent teleport operator, providing key services to the broadcasting industrys value added chain. The Company began its activities in 1993.  It operates a state-of-the art teleport in Martinez, Province of Buenos Aires. Specifically, the Companys services include: 
Content management services, such as digitalization, storage, ads insertion and subtitling; 
Resale of satellite capacity, on both a permanent and occasional bases; and
Uplink services of both data and video.

TIBAs services allow the broadcast industry to leverage under-utilized media and telecoms infrastructure and increase availability of content and information in the region. Its location in Argentina will allow the country to move further up the value chain in the information technology/ media space, thus creating highly specialized technical jobs, promoting local generation of content and increasing the affordability and accessibility of content by charging its clients a fraction of the cost of managing these services in-house.</narrative>
