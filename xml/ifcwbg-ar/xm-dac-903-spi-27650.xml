   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Contribution to growing the LAC IT sector: LAC represents approximately 3% of the worldwide IT market, and is growing at a strong pace, with CAGR of 12.8% projected for 2007-2011. There is very little venture capital activity in the IT sector in LAC, and even very few IT-specific dedicated VC funds. An investment in ASSA would:   - promote higher-end technology service development in LAC, thus supporting the regions consolidation trend and - move towards achieving greater efficiencies and economies of scale; and  - provide scarce capital to a young, but growing IT offshoring sector.  Showcase LACs potential to develop competitive application offshoring of IT services: The vast majority of the IT offshoring activity has gone to India. Latin America, however, has assumed an important role, especially in the application offshoring trend and the region is becoming increasingly more attractive for US and European companies desiring to achieve efficiency gains from proximity, same time zone advantages, and a well-educated labor force. An investment in Grupo ASSA will support a mid-stage high-growth LAC IT-services company scale up its business and become globally competitive and will demonstrates the ability to produce world-class IT services companies in Latin America, as an alternative to Indian peers.  Job creation: Companies like ASSA benefit local IT professionals through creating high quality job opportunities and developing skills in the value-added IT services sector. ASSA offers an opportunity to LACs IT-educated individuals to apply their talents and knowledge to innovative technical solutions in many sectors such as manufacturing, packaged goods and retail.</narrative>
