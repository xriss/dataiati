  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Pan American Energy LLC is engaged mainly in exploration, development and production of oil and gas. Pan American Energy LLC, Argentine Branch (PAE or the Company) is the second largest oil and gas producer in Argentina and has blocks located in the countrys three major hydrocarbon basins  Golfo San Jorge, Neuquina and Northwest.  IFC has been asked to mobilize a corporate loan facility of up to $400 million, including up to $100 million for its own account.  The investment will partially fund its 2015/2016 capital expenditure program. The Project is focused on further development of PAEs oil and gas assets in the Cerro Drag&#xF3;n block in the Golfo San Jorge Basin and in the Lindero Atravesado block in the Neuqu&#xE9;n Basin (the Project) and will be financed with a combination of debt and internal cash generation. The Project will include activities covering drilling, secondary recovery, facility expansions, improvements, and parts of the 2015/2016 investment program that will support increasing oil and gas production.  By the end of the Project, the planned activities are expected to increase PAEs oil and natural gas production.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Project will contribute to growth in a key sector of Argentina&apos;&apos;s economy with further development of primary energy sources in Argentina. The expected benefits will come in the form of: 1. Increased supply of hydrocarbons, including natural gas: PAE&apos;&apos;s upstream production will increase from the current level. Continued support for domestic gas production to help alleviate energy constraints and reduce gas imports. The increased levels of gas production will also mitigate Argentina&apos;&apos;s dependence on gas imports which are negatively impacting current account balances. 2. Contribution to government revenues: the Project will result in increased production and sales which will increase associated provincial taxes, royalties, and federal income taxes, an important source of increased revenue to the federal and provincial governments. 3. Significant local employment: PAE has a significant impact on employment in the regions in which it operates. At the national level, PAE has 2,288 direct employees and approximately 10,047 contractors, almost all of whom are national hires. 4. Local/National sourcing: The Company procures most of its goods and services in Argentina from national contractors. A large portion of the 2015-2016 capital expenditure is expected to be sourced locally/nationally. 5. Strong community development and linkages program: In line with the Company&apos;&apos;s growth, PAE continues to spend on social development programs ranging from education, health, environmental and local development programs to SME support programs in its areas of operation. IFC plans to monitor the following indicators during supervision: (i) annual production of natural gas in Argentina (mcf); (ii) payments to governments (US$); and (iii) purchases of domestic goods and services (US$).</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Project will contribute to growth in a key sector of Argentina&apos;&apos;s economy with further development of primary energy sources in Argentina. The expected benefits will come in the form of: 1. Increased supply of hydrocarbons, including natural gas: PAE&apos;&apos;s upstream production will increase from the current level. Continued support for domestic gas production to help alleviate energy constraints and reduce gas imports. The increased levels of gas production will also mitigate Argentina&apos;&apos;s dependence on gas imports which are negatively impacting current account balances. 2. Contribution to government revenues: the Project will result in increased production and sales which will increase associated provincial taxes, royalties, and federal income taxes, an important source of increased revenue to the federal and provincial governments. 3. Significant local employment: PAE has a significant impact on employment in the regions in which it operates. At the national level, PAE has 2,288 direct employees and approximately 10,047 contractors, almost all of whom are national hires. 4. Local/National sourcing: The Company procures most of its goods and services in Argentina from national contractors. A large portion of the 2015-2016 capital expenditure is expected to be sourced locally/nationally. 5.
