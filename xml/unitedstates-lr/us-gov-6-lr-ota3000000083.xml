    <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Ebola Virus Disease outbreak of 2014 - 2015 dramatically affected the progress that Liberia had made towards sustained development since the end of the 14-year civil war. While Liberia demonstrated strong leadership and partnership with the international community in successfully controlling the outbreak, the emergency highlighted institutional flaws, which undermined the population&apos;s trust in the Government of Liberia (GOL). Though the disease outbreak was largely brought under control by mid-2015, Liberia continues to suffer the social, economic, and health consequences of a national crisis that cut off access to basic services, slowed domestic trade, and curtailed international travel and commerce for an extended period. U.S. assistance in FY 2017 will continue to be an essential part of helping to bring the country back onto a sustainable development path. The United States will continue to promote a secure, stable Liberia with enhanced rule of law, broad-based economic development, and improved education and health systems.</narrative>
