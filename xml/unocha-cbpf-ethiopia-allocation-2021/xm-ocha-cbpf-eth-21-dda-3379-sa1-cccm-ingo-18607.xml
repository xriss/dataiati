  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">IDP communities living in Afar and Somali Regions in Ethiopia are increasingly facing multi-sectoral gaps in service delivery, while existing vulnerabilities are exacerbated by the outbreak of COVID-19, the protracted drought in Somali and the ongoing conflict in Tigray and subsequent displacement across bordering Afar. Despite this, the difficult situation for IDPs is further exacerbated by the fact that both humanitarian and government agencies are focusing attention and resources on humanitarian challenges within Tigray Region of northern Ethiopia, entailing fewer resources for other regions in need, notably Somali and Afar Regions.

In regard to pressing gaps in service delivery &#x2013; confirmed by the needs assessments conducted by WHH and ACTED in Somali and Afar Regions in December 2020 and January 2021 respectively &#x2013; these largely stem from a lack of Camp Coordination and Camp Management (CCCM). In the absence of CCCM, unmet needs persist due to poor information sharing on service gaps as well as insufficient levels of coordination and advocacy required to mobilize a holistic response. Communities living in IDP sites therefore constitute key vulnerable groups within target areas, particularly in facing increased exposure to protection risks due to inadequate service provision. 

Moreover, the Action takes seriously the responsibility of addressing all forms of marginalization, exclusion and inequalities in access while upholding the principles of gender equality and non-discrimination. WHH and ACTED will therefore address the susceptibility to marginalization in participatory processes of vulnerable groups by prioritizing inclusive policies in program design and implementation. Women, men, girls and boys, among other groups, often experience crises very differently due to their different roles within the family and society, as well as unequal power dynamics that exist between and among them. Specific attention has therefore been allocated in the design of the present intervention to prevent and reduce those vulnerabilities. 

In response, WHH and ACTED aims to improve the living conditions and protection of 4,578 HHs (comprised of 22,890 individuals) in Afar and 1,317 HHs (comprised of 7,040 individuals) in Somali Region by providing CCCM in five target Woredas. In doing so, a total of 5,895 HHs (comprised of 29,475 individuals) are expected to benefit from the proposed action.

The action, led by WHH and implemented by ACTED, aims to address key gaps in coordination of service provision and camp management through the delivery of a CCCM response, contributing towards HRP Strategic Objective 1 &#x2018;the physical and mental wellbeing of 5.7 million crisis-affected people is improved&#x2019;, as well as aligning with the Ethiopia CCCM Cluster objective and namely &#x201C;to promote the safety and dignity of 2.2 million conflict and disaster affected people, through targeted, community-centered multi-sector interventions that &#x2018;do no harm&#x201D; and contribute to social cohesion outcomes. 
WHH as administrative grant holder will be responsible for overall monitoring and compliance related issues, including but not limited to ensuring contractual obligations are followed, guidelines and procedures are adhered to and visibility and communications are addressed. WHH as lead agency will compile narrative and financial reports (including verification of expenditure support documents) from ACTED and submit quality reports to EHF. ACTED however in close consultation with WHH  will be leading on the management and implementation for all CCCM activities.</narrative>
