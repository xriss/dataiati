  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project will provide integrated ife saving responses including Education and Protection reaching 27,000 ( 7,830 Girls, 7,560 Boys, 5,940 Women, and 5,670 Men ) people in need living in East Hararghe (Chinaksen Woreda), Guji (Liben and Goro Dola Woreda), East Wollega (Kiramu and Sasiga Woreda), and West Wollega (Mena Sibu and Kiltu Kara woreda) zones of Oromia region.   

The first pillar of the project will enhance access to equitable, safe, and inclusive education for 5,660 (50% girls, 4% CWDs) emergency-affected pre-primary and primary school aged boys&#x2019; and girls&#x2019; in these seven selected districts. In line with the Ethiopia 2021 MYR Humanitarian Response Plan (HRP), the project mainly aimed to increases access to equitable, safe, inclusive and quality education through non-formal learning opportunities using accelerated learning programs. It will also support education service delivery systems and partners by strengthening their institutional and technical capacities and building resilience of children, communities, parents, and existing education structures through capacity building, coordination and information management support. The main education pillar activities includes provision of Temporary Learning Spaces (TLS), teaching and learning materials, recreational kits, recruitment and deployment of facilitators/teachers for the implementation of Accelerated School Readiness (ASR) for age 5-6 and Accelerated Learning Programs (ALP) modalities for age 7-4, and teachers will be trained on Accelerated learning programs, gender responsive and sensitive curriculum, and Psychosocial Support (PSS). The project will also implement safe schools protocols in time of COVID19 by providing PPE like facemasks and sensitizing teachers, school principals, Center Management Committee/PTAs, Children, and the communities at large on COVID19 transmission and protection mechanisms. 

The second pillar of the project is to enhance access to safe and protected child protection services for 21,340 crisis  affected individuals including unaccompanied and separated children and other vulnerable groups including children with disabilities and women through safe protection and case management services and enhance local response capacity by capacitating social workers, community-based structure, protection service providers including BOWCSA, Police, Justice, and Education, and through specialized and non-specialized MHPSS/PSS services at IDP sites and host communities. This will be made possible providing psycho-social support and awareness among crisis affected women, men, girls and boys including people with disabilities, UASC, and GBV survivors. 

The project will be implemented  in a consortium approach by Imagine1day and Developemnt Expertise Center (DEC). Both organizations have ample years of experience implementing education, protection, and WASH in emergency projects  in Ethiopia. They are all actively present in the project target areas. The consortium members will capitalize on their collective best experiences in their effort to deliver effective and sustainable program for IDP and host communities in targeted areas. The consortium partners agreed on the geographic share based on their operational presence. Imagine1day will implement the project in East Hararghe and Guji Zones and DEC will be implementing in East and West Wollega.</narrative>
