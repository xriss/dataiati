   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Emergency response to acute and complex health emergencies and increased access to health care service for vulnerable populations in Tigray Region Ethiopia</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project responds to the emergency health needs of conflict-affected and vulnerable communities in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. The project targets Enderta, Kilete Awulalo and Wukiro, Endega Hamus and Sasie Woredas in Tigray Region where GOAL has current operational presence in responding to the complex humanitarian needs in the sectors of health, nutrition, WASH, ESNFI and protection. The current health activities include capacity strengthening of health facilities, supporting Mobile Health and Nutrition Teams (MHNT) and the provision of essential medical supplies that are affected by the conflict. This application will be a great opportunity to ensure complementarity of GOAL&#x2019;s programmes in the region. The project is proposed for a six month period and  will improve the capacity of health facilities to provide lifesaving and essential health care services through minor maintenance of damaged health facilities. The project will also equip essential service rooms and drug stores, and procure and provide emergency medical supplies, which will ensure the provision of basic health care services for conflict affected population in the targeted health facilities.
Health-care services in Tigray are alarmingly limited, leaving hundreds of thousands of people, including those who are chronically ill and others who were injured during the fighting, without adequate access to essential medicines and basic services. Of the nearly 230 health centers in Tigray, only 29 are fully functional, and 5 are partially functional. Ongoing assessments by WHO indicate that 141 of the 198 assessed hospitals and health centers were either partially or fully damaged. All hospitals and health centers urgently need more medical supplies, drugs and equipment, according to WHO.
Child and maternal services have been drastically disrupted. Less than 16 per cent of the health facilities are providing vaccination services while only 17 per cent are providing maternal services, such as antenatal care and birth delivery, according to health partners. Access to drugs also remains critically low at 16 per cent. Most Woreda health offices are not yet functional, according to the Health Cluster. This project&#x2019;s targeted woredas are categorized under priority one by the health cluster, because of the damage to the health system and the presence of internally displaced communities. In our current health facility assessment in the project targeted woredas 95% of health posts and 50% of health center and hospitals are totally damaged. Based on the needs on the ground, feedback from local government and recommendations from the regional health cluster, COVID-19 prevention and control intervention needs to be strengthened as a priority issue. 

To achieve the intended outcome of the project GOAL proposed the below activities: 
1. Provide capacity building training for health care workers on essential health services. 
2. Procurement, preposition and distribution of emergency health and Reproductive health  supplies and equipment for the affected Health Facilities
3. Procurement and distribution of office furniture needed for minimum health care service delivery in the affected Health Facilities
4. Support minor rehabilitation in selected Health Facilities.
5. Support the release of timely and transparent health information using different IEC materials. 
6. Support routine and mass vaccination campaigns in response to vaccine preventable outbreaks.
7. Deploy one Sr. Health officer per Woreda for the overall Coordination of the Health program activities. 
8. Logistical support for the comprehensive activities including COVID-response awareness creation.
9. Strengthen and support Public Health Emergency Disease Surveillance. 
10. Procurement and provision of COVID-19 prevention, preparedness and response supplies for the selected Health Facilities.
11. Support MHPSS services in health facilities and appropriate psychosocial referral services.</narrative>
