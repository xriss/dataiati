   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Emergency Shelter NFIs Response to Conflict Affected IDPs in Fenti/Zone 4 of Afar Region, Ethiopia</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The conflict along the Afar-Tigray regional border has resulted in massive displacements, damage to infrastructure and disruption to livelihoods and essential services. As the result of the conflict situation scale up in the area nearly 1500 HHs IDPs are identified as severe need of humanitarian assistance in shelter response of core relief NFI items Yalo woreda of Fenti Zone 4 of Afar region is identified as &#x2018;Extreme severity Prioritized Woredas&#x2019; by national shelter cluster as well as sub-regional cluster coordination hub. According to the national shelter cluster coordination out of nearly 25,000 caseloads only 36% of the shelter NFIs need has been met so far. As of August 2021, there is existing a huge gap of IDPs people in need of the humanitarian assistance in terms of core relief items for this reason this project intends to cater the gaps and address the need for nearly 1,500 HHs.  This project therefore aims to reach 1500 displaced HHs settled in communal shelters and host communities with core relief items (NFIs Kits V2). 
The project will be implemented in coordination with sub national cluster, zonal and woreda DRMOs, Kebele administrations and by engaging affected community members. Affected communities will be actively engaged in beneficiary selection, identification, and verification. Target households will be selected based on Beneficiary Selection Criteria established by national Shelter and NFI cluster. The response will be in-kind distribution whereby each household will be provided with a full package of NFI kit V2 (2 bed sheets, 2 bed mats, 1 kettle, 2 plates, 4 cups, 1 cooking pot, 1 ladle and 1 mosquito net, 1 washing basin, 1 jerrycan, 1 litter liquid soap and 3 pieces of laundry soaps)
The project will be implemented through CAID&#x2019;s local partner the Ethiopian Evangelical Church Mekane Yesus Development and Social Service Commission (EECMY-DASSC) Dessie branch office and afar field office . The actual distribution of items will be conducted as per ES/NFI cluster Guidelines. The distribution time, date, and the number of people showing up at a time will be evenly planned to avoid the risk of queueing. Social distancing will be maintained whenever they come to receive and collect the shelter NFIs items from distribution sites. Households will be notified of the time and duration of the distribution in advance.
The project will be implemented in response with COVID19 protection and prevention protocol set by the Ethiopian public health institute and ministry of health as well as national shelter and NFIs cluster guidelines. The distribution process will be carefully planned, and appropriate precaution protocol will be followed. CAID/EECMY project staffs will work closely with local government and the sub-regional coordination to ensure that basic principles of CHS, Accountability to affected people, protection of GBV and PSEA will give primary focus in line with COVID -19 Prevention and control protocols and guidelines. Post distribution monitoring (PDM) will be conducted after each distribution to assess appropriateness, efficiency, and coverage of the NFIs response and to identify the extent to which CA and EECMY was able to meet the differentiated needs of women, girls, boys, and men in displaced communities impacted by conflict.</narrative>
