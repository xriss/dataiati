   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This proposal is developed in response to the humanitarian crises due to drought in the Oromia region resulting from the failure of both &#x2018;hagaya&#x2019; and &#x2018;ganna&#x2019; rains. According to the Borena zone Non-food need assessment report for by November 2021, the situation in this zone is particularly concerning, where about 539,679 people need critical humanitarian assistance. Based on the health related assessment that the health facilities were not ready to accommodate the affected population. There are shortage of medications to treat the cases and the burden it extended on primary health care provisions on routine healthcare activities. As per the zonal public health emergency preparedness and response plan for EFY2014 showed that epidemic prone febrile illness (Measles, Meningitis, Malaria), diarrheal diseases, and skin infection (scabies) were among major anticipated diseases/health events. The woreda health offices emergency preparedness plan lacks a reproductive health component. The proxy GAM for under-five children screening was 6.1% and 57%, this shows a radically increasing malnutrition cases which resulted from factors such as high loss of live stocks and improved screening programs. Regarding caseload burden, Taltele (205), Arereo(165), Moyale(147), Dillo (119) Dubuluk (45) and Wacile (45)  are among the highest SAM burden contributions in the Borena Zone. There are several GBV and disability related crimes identified during the previous period and of the current emergency in the zone, which exacerbated the problem. In addition, there have been high staff turnover due to the weather condition, lack of transportation and inaccessibility of some major kebeles. These may affect community-level diseases prevention activities like immunization which may create a risk of vaccine-preventable diseases outbreak (Especially measles). It is difficult for the community to receive urgent and life-saving essential health service care, or mental health and psychosocial support (MHPSS). Women and children are at heightened risk of abuse and exploitation. 
The goal of the proposed project is to contribute to the improvement of quality of life of the drought-affected population in selected woredas of Borena Zone through MHNT and strengthening by surging the pre-existing health facilities to improve access to primary health care services, MHPSS, basic services, and building the local capacity of service providers. Towards this end, FIDO will implement a comprehensive project which focuses on increasing access to basic health care services for hard to reach areas through MHNT and surging of prioritized health facilities through provisions of basic medication and medical items, immunization services, MCH services, SRH services, and clinical offloading, provision of psychosocial support services and GBV case management to prioritized health facilities through MHNT and trained health workers, strengthening of surveillance for epidemic-prone diseases, etc. Moreover, FIDO is planning to address cross-cutting issues such as PSEA, AAP, and Gender to make protection a center of the proposed intervention. This project also integrates COVID_19 activities in the project implementation to prevent infection and curb the possible spread of the virus as well as support the children affected by the pandemic. Some of the planned COVID-related activities include: developing information education communication (IEC) materials and messaging relevant to COVID and conducting awareness-raising activities that address COVID-related issues in line with the national guidance of social distancing and avoiding large group activities etc. 
The proposed project will take place in 4 woredas of the Borena zone Arero, Dubluk, Wacileand Taltalle for 06 months with a total budget of $ 300,000. The proposed project will prioritize the most vulnerable section of the population and will reach a total of 45,700 through these health interventions.</narrative>
