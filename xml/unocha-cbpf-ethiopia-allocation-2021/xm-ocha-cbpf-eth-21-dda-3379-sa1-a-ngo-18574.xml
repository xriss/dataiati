   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Emergency Seed and animal health support for war-affected communities in three  woredas of Tigray region</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">As per DRM-ATF update, agriculture was an important sector in Tigrai before the outbreak of the conflict in early November last year as more than 85 percent of the population were living in rural areas and depend directly or indirectly on agriculture for their livelihoods. The current conflict has negatively affected rural communities. Farm families have been displaced food stores and animals have been lost, looted or destroyed.
This emergency support project is a 6-month response to assist Embalaje 2268 HH, Endamehoni 3783HH and Wajirat 3949 woredas in tigray region. The intervention aims to ensure that farmers affected by the conflict suffering is reduced through the provision of agricultural inputs (seeds) and animal health support in the targeted areas in order to enhance the food production and supply system of the most vulnerable population of the Tigray region. 
The objective of this 6 months intervention is to contribute to the restoration of resilient livelihoods for 10,000 HHs in the three targeted Woredas. This submission is part of the 2021 first EHF allocation to address the recovery needs of farmers affected by the war. 
MCMDOs proposed interventions are in line with the objective of this round of allocation plan that focuses on humanitarian assistance with elements of recovery, specifically through provision of seeds appropriate for planting in the coming Meher season (June to August) on the selected staple food crops. 
This will increase their resilience capacities and reduce the need for emergency assistance. It is planned to provide crop seed and animal health support for Embalaje 2268 HH, Endamehoni 3783HH and Wojerat 3949 HH beneficiaries. In collaboration with key figures of the community, MCMDO will develop the beneficiaries&apos; selection criteria. The selection criteria will be verified and approved by the community. The selection of the project beneficiaries will be against the approved criteria. The list of the selected beneficiaries will also be presented to the committees and community members for approval.
 MCMDO has practical demonstrated experience in emergency seed and agricultural tools support projects in similar situations. It has implemented the same project in oromia and SNNP Regions West Guji and Gedeo zones respectively with the support of OCHA and FAO. MCMDO has got different lessons and learning from previous similar projects which help to implement this project successfully. Moreover, MCMDO is operating in Southern zone of Tigray Region targeted woredas emergency nutrition and health projects for conflict-affected communities which can be considered as an opportunity to integrate among the projects. It has well-established and strong partnerships with community representatives. This is also a major input for the successful execution of the project activities. 
MCMDO has a regional office in Mekelle, Tigray, and field offices in ten woredas of Tigray region. MCMDO has a long-standing partnership with the regional and Woreda government offices. Currently MCMDO is implementing similar project supporting farmers to get emergency seeds with the support of FAO. The procurement process of the seed will be first MCMDO invites potential candidates for bid to purchase certified seed by announcing through magazine then based on the fixed date to open the bid the winner identified in front of bidder or their legal representatives. After knowing the provider at the onset of quality seed ensuring process sample checked and verified by the zonal and woreda expertise after their confirmation distributed those certified seeds tagged with crop variety, category, Lot.No, Date of sealing, purity %, Germination%, Net weight(kg), Moisture content % and Thousand seed wright(grams).</narrative>
