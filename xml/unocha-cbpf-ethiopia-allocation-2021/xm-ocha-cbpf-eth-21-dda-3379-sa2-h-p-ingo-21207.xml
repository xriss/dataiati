   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Ethnic conflict between Jarso/Oromo and Geri/Somali has been ongoing for many years but was historically resource-based with minimal civilian displacements. Since 2015 the nature of the conflict has changed. Destruction of property, mass displacements, and occupation of land have become more common. The security situation along the border of Chinaksen woreda, Oromia Region and Tuliguled Woreda, Somali Region has been volatile since 2017. Large civilian displacements began in 2017 because of the worsening conflicts. A series of peace-building efforts in July 2019, involving traditional leaders and government authorities, resulted in the return of over 25,000 Jarso people to Tuliguled and around 42,000 Geri people to Chinaksen5. Since then, minor clashes have been reported along the regional border, occasionally causing injuries and casualties. The continued movement of people across the regional border, ongoing tensions between ethnic groups, and the increasing severity of clashes is leading to growing concerns for the safety of host communities and IDPs.

Immediate resource mobilization is required to address the urgent needs of the affected populations. Emergency food relief, protection, and emergency health responses are top priorities for the affected populations. Some IDPs are still living in makeshift shelters, exposing them to the elements and increasing their risk for communicable diseases. Damages to critical infrastructure, such as health facilities and water systems, remain critical challenges for IDPs and host communities. Furthermore, there is a need to encourage peacebuilding activities to address the underlying issues causing tensions in the area. Strategies for the eventual return of IDPs also need to be developed to encourage voluntary return.

CARE has proposed multi-sectoral emergency response to address the priority health and protection needs of IDPs and host community. Mothers and children not getting proper health services at the woreda, due to lack of equipment and trained health professionals and some of the health facilities are damaged due the conflict. As the IDPs and returnees are in dire situation, there might be protections and GBV risks around the collection sites. 

With this project, CARE plans to reach 34441beneficiaries in total:
1.	31341 beneficiaries (10157 men, 19797 women, 693 boys and 693 girls) with emergency health response.
2.	3100 beneficiaries (1550 women, 1550 girls) with protection response.</narrative>
