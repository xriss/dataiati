   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Responding to the increased nutritional needs among conflict-affected people in five woredas of Assossa and Metkel Zones of Benshangul Region.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Plan Int`l together with its local implementing partner Mothers and Children Multisectoral Development Organization (MCMDO) aims to provide emergency Nutrition lifesaving support to conflict-affected vulnerable IDPs and host communities living in Assossa and Metekel Zone of Benshangul Region, with a focus on the full components of Community Based Management of Acute Malnutrition (CMAM). Further, this emergency nutrition intervention includes Infant and Young Child Feeding (IYCF) promotion activities with will be strongly integrated with CMAM. The project activities will target 5 woredas in the Assossa and Metekel Zone of the Benshangul Region. The support will mainly be focusing on IDP sites and catchment health facilities particularly in conflicted affected intervention woredas in Metekel Zone, besides the nutrition interventions will also extend to the hosting community which is also affected by the presence of a large number of IDPs in the woredas. Therefore, the project will cover all kebeles of the targeted five woredas with enhancing the local health system including OTP and SC sites to deliver quality CMAM and IYCF service provision to conflict-affected communities. 
This project primarily focuses on providing life-saving Acute Malnutrition treatment, care, and support to affected and displaced under-five age girls and boys, and Pregnant and Lactating Women (PLW) who are suffering from Severe Acute Malnutrition (SAM), and Moderate Acute Malnutrition (MAM). The project will also strengthen further the local health system and build the capacity of health workers (HWs) and health extension workers (HEWs) to respond to already doubled primary health care and nutrition services in all targeted intervention woredas. Besides, the project strongly works with district health offices in maximizing Family MUAC, best practices of IYCF including positive parenting, and Mental Health and Psychosocial Support (MHPS) throughout the implementation period of this project. 
Plan Int`l with its implementing local partner MCMDO will deploy Nutrition technical project staff in all of the targeted woredas. The deployed technical teams will directly implement the SC whenever government staff is not available. They will provide technical and logistic support whenever the government manages to redeploy its staff. 
As there are no focused GBV response services in any of the targeted woredas (except Debate and Wonbera), Plan Int`l and MCMDO will build the capacity of locally recruited CSWs, as well as HEWs and WCAO staff, to provide in-person and remote support services for GBV survivors. The project will further train health workers, CSWs, and other key focal points who may encounter survivors, in basic supportive response and referrals. Also, survivors of Gender-Based Violence (SGBV) and a person with a disability are specifically targeted to get appropriate and adequate health and Nutrition care and support from this project. In addition, protection concerns are further considered to be addressed through a mainstream approach in each of the planned activities of the project such as incorporating topics of protection and gender during the provision of basic and in-service pieces of training for Health Workers (HWs), Health Extension Workers (HEWs) and Community Social Workers (CSWs). The CSWs will strongly work in raising awareness of the community on SGBV and protection concerns along with the other WASHY and health life topics
In addition, beneficiary feedback and compliance will be also addressed through establishing and functioning a strong feedback mechanism at each kebeles of targeted intervention woredas. Beneficiary participation will be further strengthened through ensuring participation of beneficiaries during project start-up workshop, beneficiary selection, distribution of project input, project review amp FGD</narrative>
