   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In Ethiopia Conflict has remained the main driver of humanitarian needs in the country in 2021. Though the NEC remains the most significant humanitarian situation in the country, there have been humanitarian crisis in the other parts of the country, notably in Oromia, Benishangul-Gumuz and Afar-Somali border areas. According to the recent OCHA Humanitarian Bulletin, released on 20 December 2021, about 22 million people estimated to require humanitarian assistance in Ethiopia in 2022. 
The trend of displacement has increased over the last three years from 3.2 million internally displaced people (IDPs) in 2018 to 4.2 million at the latter part of 2021 were about 85% of them displaced due to conflict. The displaced people have limited access to nutritious food, protective shelter, safe water and sanitation facilities, as well as services to meet their basic needs.
In Oromia, the security situation in Wellega, Borena, Guji and parts of Hararghe remains volatile and unpredictable as a result of expanding operations of Unidentified Armed Groups (UAGs). The region currently hosts an estimated 1.16 million IDPs and IDP returnees where their humanitarian need is dire. 
Gujji Zone is one of the zones in Oromia Region affected by multiple hazards including conflict, and drought. From the recent government led Meher Assessment report, the zone has 185,427 IDPs where 78% of them are displaced due to the recent UAG movement and the rest 22% are from the 2017 ethnic conflict between Oromia and Somali boarder. The most recent IDPs are living in seven woredas of the zone including Gorodola. Most of the IDPs are dispersed in the host community but are without basic humanitarian assistance. Gorodola Woreda is one of the top priority locations by the ESNFI Cluster for response under this EHF 2021 SA-2. 
ANE is proposing to intervene at Gorodola Woreda in terms of cash for rent assistance for the most vulnerable conflict affected 780 HHs. The project aims to provide Cash for house rent assistance to 780 HHs. 
During beneficiary targeting, the shelter cluster beneficiary selection and targeting guideline will be adhered while the most vulnerable community group including child-headed household, the separated child in need of shelter, children at risk, female-headed household, elders, and people with underlying chronic illness, a large family with more dependence with no alternative livelihoods will get the priority. The project will strictly follow and adhere COVID-19 specific beneficiary&#x2019;s targeting, registration, and distribution operation procedure to mitigate the outbreak. ANE will identify and mitigate potential GBV and protection risks that might be evolved due to the cash for rent injection. 
Cash for rent market and feasibility assessment will be conducted by ANE team prior to the provision of cash. A financial institution will also be identified that who will be disburse the cash for the intended beneficiaries. Tenancy agreement will be made with the house owners to ensure the safety and dignity of the beneficiaries while using the rental house. Post distribution monitoring survey will be done to lasses and earn the cash for rent assistance intervention effectiveness and satisfaction of the response. 
ANE will thoroughly coordinate and liaise with the local authorities and affected community to ensure transparency and accountability. The field team as well as the head office project team will actively and regularly coordinate with the sub-national and national ESNFI clusters, OCHA and with other implementing partners. 
Besides, to minimize the risks of protection and GBV for the beneficiaries during targeting, registration, and assistance delivery, ANE will provide PSEA and GBV training to the local government&#x2019;s staffs and targeted community representative committees. The project will end for nine months and, a total of 165,000.00 USD is proposed to undertake the above-mentioned activities reaching 780 HHs.</narrative>
