   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Emergency Nutrition Response for people affected with drought and conflict in Borena zone, Oromia- Ethiopia</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">CARE has planned to respond to Nutrition need of communities in Borena zone of Oromia region who are affected by food insecurity and under nutrition that happened due to climate change induced drought, desert locust infestation (DLI) and human conflict. Drought, shortage of clean water and occurrence of other emergencies in the proposed woredas has led to the emergence of multiple public health concerns such as undernutrition, and other health problems. Multiagency rapid assessment conducted Nov. 2021 in Borena zone indicated that the last &#x201C;Gena&#x201D; rain able to support only 30% of the expected production. The assessment also noted that &#x201C;Hageya&#x201D; rain which was supposed to rain b/n mid sept. to Nov. was totally failed in most of the woredas including those proposed for this response. Due to shortage of enough rain fall during the last rain season (Hagaya) dreadful pasture condition was observed in all the visited woredas. Particularly enormous land degradation and the resultant pasture depletion is common in most woredas due to the prevailing drought. In addition, DLS is also reported in 7 woredas, including those proposed for this response, and fueling the scarcity of pasture. Communicative effect of drouth and DLI, that hampered availability of water and pasture, resulted in emaciation and death of livestock mainly cuttle, which are livelihood back bone of the community in Borena. The assessment indicated that over 69,008 livestock died, and 114,264 are emaciated with high likelihood of dying. Of the total livestock death, 5622, 4231, 19469 and 7055 are in Guchi, Wachile, Dillo and Dubluk respectively where this project planned to support. Subsequent effects of the drought and the death/deterioration of livestock has led to serious food insecurity and under nutrition. This situation has been raising the need for humanitarian intervention primarily Nutrition and Health among others. The government of Ethiopia in coordination with UN agencies and INGOs has been providing support. Yet, the support is far less than the need and the strain of health service provision including nutrition continue to exist because of increasing cases of acute malnutrition and in adequate local capacities. Therefore, CARE proposes Emergency Nutrition support to communities affected by acute under nutrition, children, and women in particular, in Guchi, Wachile, Dillo and Dubluk woredas.
The project will also mainstream protection to the nutrition response by integrating PSAE, and protection of GBV. Basic PSAE/GBV training will be provided to HWs and community volunteers, Individual and group counseling on PSAE will also be provided to target community by the trained HWs and volunteers. The project will also establish and support network of reporting to law enforcement body of any SAE and GBV incidents in the project operation area.
The project targeted to reach 34744 beneficiaries in total (double counting controlled). Below is targets by type. 
881 children under 5 suffering from severe acute malnutrition
12964 Children under five suffering from moderate acute malnutrition (MAM)
16899 pregnant and lactating mothers suffering from MAM 
34744 individuals with IYCF-E and COVID-19 prevention and control messages
1800 individuals with counseling on PSAE and prevention of GBV</narrative>
