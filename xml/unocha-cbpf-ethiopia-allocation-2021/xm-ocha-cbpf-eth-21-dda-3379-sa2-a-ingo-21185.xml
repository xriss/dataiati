   <narrative xml:lang="EN">With funding received from EHF, the Agriculture Task Force proposes a strategy in line with the proposed HRP framework to scale up existing interventions with support to frontline actors with a presence on the ground extending capacity and effectiveness to respond promptly to the conflict-affected households. The DRM-ATF proposes to also address critical gaps in the conflict-affected locations by prioritizing the immediate and short term lifesaving activities in multiple crisis scenarios that correspond to the OCHA EHF allocation strategy criteria of strategic prioritization identifying the &apos;high priority funding requirements to address critical gaps in the context of the revised HRP 2021. 

In light of this, this project is designed in line with this strategic broader scenario and context put forward by EHF 2nd Round Standard Allocation and DRM ATF. Accordingly, the proposed activities in this emergency response  project include the following:

1. Vulnerable households in IDPs and host communities receive emergency animal feed -  a total of 800 households in the two targeted woredas (Afdem 400 HHs and Miesso 400 HHs) will benefit from a daily supplementary feed provision to their breeding stock for 90 days. 

2: Vulnerable households in IDPs and host communities receive emergency veterinary support - the emergency veterinary support which includes vaccination campaigns against major diseases and voucher-based treatment services are vital for protecting livestock assets from animal diseases. This will be implemented through a voucher-based animal health service delivery engaging community-based animal health workers and local private Veterinary Pharmacies (PVPs). Strengthening private pharmacies and linking them to well-trained and equipped Community Animal Health Workers will ensure access to animal health care. Livestock vaccination against Transboundary Diseases is one of the activities under this output. In some exceptional cases where healthy livestock is moving into an area in search of pasture or the face of an outbreak, vaccinations will be administered. A total of 63,000 TLU of animals belonging to 7,000 HHs in the two woredas Afdem and Mieso will receive animal health services based on a voucher scheme for treatment and a mass vaccination campaign for immunization.

3: Vulnerable households in IDPs and host communities receive Cash Transfers and emergency seed packs maize/sorghum seeds and farm implements: -  Unconditional cash will be provided for a total of 300HHs (150HHs in Afdem and 150HHs in Miesso) - this intervention will meet the immediate food and non-food needs of the vulnerable households while it also protects core breeding animals and household assets. The activities under this proposal, such as (animal feed, animal health, and seed interventions), are aimed to contribute to the DRM ATF strategy. These interventions are planned in line with the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development&apos;s &#x2013; Livestock Relief Interventions in Pastoralists Areas of Ethiopia and the global Livestock Emergencies Guidelines and Standards (LEGS). Target beneficiaries will be supported with fast-growing and early maturing seed varieties to revitalize their agricultural livelihoods and support them to recultivate their lands through the provision of farm implements. A total of 100 HHs in two woredas (50 HHs in Afdem 50 HHs in Mieso) will benefit from emergency seed and farm implements provision. 

The project is based on the previous experience of VSF-Suisse in the area and ongoing interventions. Therefore, participatory monitoring and evaluation mechanisms will target better community accountability and enhanced learning. Gender and protection will be mainstreamed and monitored in the project.</narrative>
