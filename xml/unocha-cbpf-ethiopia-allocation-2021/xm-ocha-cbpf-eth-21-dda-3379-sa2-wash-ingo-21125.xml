   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Emergency WASH response for Drought and Conflict affected Oromia region in Guji, West, and East Harerghe zones.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">According to the Oromia 2022 DRMC drought and conflict plan, over 2.9 million people in the Oromia region need water assistance, 10 lowland zones and 76 woredas are affected by recurrent drought where the areas are recognized as WASH services are very low originally. More than 2.6 million people need emergency water trucking in Southern and Eastern Oromia, in total 226 water trucks are required to deliver life-saving water supply.  IMC is providing comprehensive WASH service in eight woredas of these drought and conflict-affected zones of Guji, West Harerghe, and East Harerghe funding from BHA/OFDA and partially three woredas (two from Guji and one from EH) complemented by EHF.  IMC will strengthen and extend WASH services in these three zones affected by drought and will cover 14 woredas.  According to the recent Guji zonal Disaster and Risk Management Office (DRMO) report and the drought response plan 208,641 people affected by drought. Further there are 15,612 IDPs in Agawayu, 28,941 IDPs in Wadara, and 18,817IDPs in Gumi Eladalo and 3,852 IDPs in Sebaboru woredas that need urgent emergency WASH services which exacerbated the drought effect in the targeted woredas. Accordingly, IMC will create access to safe water by rehabilitating two motorized water schemes and six shallow wells to reach 13000 individuals, provision of HH WTC for 2000 HH (average 10,000 individuals) and providing safe drinking water by water trucking for two months for Saba-Boru and Wadera woredas drought-affected community and health facilities.  IMC will provide WASH NFIs which include 540,000 sachets of HH WTC, for 3000 HH (15000 individuals), 18000 pieces of 250gm  bathing and 18000 pieces 200 gm laundry soaps for 6000 individuals as per the SPHERE standard, provide sanitary pad and underwear for the most vulnerable 1500 adolescent girls,  conduct hygiene promotion through dedicated hygiene promotion and community mobilizer staff at woreda level to reach 60000 individuals (15000 individuals per woreda) during the project period, and maintain four latrines and provide cleaning materials for the health facilities. International Medical Corps has been working on an integrated WASH and health intervention at more affected woredas of West Harerghe namely Meiso, Darolebu and Gumbi boarded since Sep 2021. IMC will scale up the WASH interventions being implemented in Meisso, Darolebu, and Gumbi boarded (planned to expand) under BHA/OFDA funding. IMC will further expand the service under EHF  in Burk Dihmtu, Hawi guiding, Gumbi Boarded, and Meiso woredas and will provide safe drinking water by water trucking in Burka dihmtu, Hawi gudina, and Meiso, provision of safe water by rehabilitating one motorized borehole in Meiso, and three shallow wells in Hawi gudina, provision of HH WTC for 2000 HH (10,000 individuals), provision of 12000 Soaps for the most vulnerable community members and conduct hygiene promotion in all targeted four woredas. Under the extension program, IMC will expand the WASH services in Kumbi, Meyu, Midega-tola, Gola-Oda, and Chinakson. Currently, IMC has been Implementing WASH program in Kumbi, Meyu, and Chinakson under BHA funding and the additional EHF resources will complement the ongoing WASH support and cover the huge gaps in the zone.  Further to improve the WASH services, the wash intervention will complement the health and Nutrition program started earlier in these woredas. Under the scale-up up project, IMC will provide safe drinking water by water trucking for the most drought affected kebeles and health facilities in Kumbi, Midegatolla, and Gola Oda woredas, rehabilitate four shallow wells in Midegatolla, provide 24000 Soaps for bathing and laundry for the most affected 4000 communities members, and provide 360,000 sachets of HH WTC for 2000 HH (10,000 individuals), and conduct hygiene promotion in all woredas in collaboration with the HEW.</narrative>
