   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Somali and Oromia region has been affected by the drought and conflict as a result of delayed and sub-optimal rains for the last three seasons and intercommunal conflicts both resulting in internal displacements of people. Consequently, crop planting was delayed or missed, while pasture and water sources were not replenished. The effects of the drought are being felt in most of Somali and pastoralist areas of Oromia, SNNP and Afar regions. Reports of deteriorating food and nutritional security, water shortages and worsening livestock body conditions and livestock deaths have increased, while concerns are rising over pipeline breaks in emergency supplies and interruption of life-saving operations due to funding shortfalls. Some of the drought-affected areas are also hosting increasing populations due to migration of pastoralists in search of water and pasture for their animals. Disease outbreaks such as measles and cholera, are further stretching the meagre Government and partners&#x2019; resources and adding another layer of complexity. 

Acute malnutrition remains a major public health concern especially for those that develop the severe acute malnutrition because of the associated high mortality. The situation may be worsened in the presence of disease outbreaks such as Cholera, measles and diarrhea and severe pneumonia. Although the risks of mortality are due to the immunological changes that occur in the affected individual, avoidable factors such as lack of skilled health care workers, lack of medicines for the treatment of medical complications can be resolved. In the months of October/November 2021, a cholera outbreak was reported and responded to in Dawa zone, the presence of disease outbreaks such as cholera further risk the deterioration of nutrition status of the community. Additionally, Fafan zone and Dawa zone have a high concentration of IDPs requiring food assistance, WASH, health and nutrition services 
.Food insecurity and malnutrition coupled with disease outbreaks and weakened immunity and vulnerability after over a year in displacement in over-crowded and sub-standard living conditions have increased the risk of morbidity and mortality of affected communities. 

Therefore, the project will support and strengthen the regional, zonal and woreda health bureaus&#x2019; capacity to manage cases of severe acute malnutrition in line with the revised national guideline for management of acute malnutrition in drought and conflict affected woredas and improve quality of care for children hospitalized for SAM with medical complications in the referral level stabilization centers ensuring availability of additional essential drugs in the selected hospitals in Somali region, and Oromia regions</narrative>
