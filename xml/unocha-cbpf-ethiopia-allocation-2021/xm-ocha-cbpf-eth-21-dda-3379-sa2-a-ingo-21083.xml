   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The proposed project supports vulnerable Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) and host community households affected by the conflict in protecting their livelihoods and thus contributes to the stabilization of their living situation. The activities target agro-pastoral and pastoral households in Chinaksen Woreda of East Hararghe Zone. Caritas Switzerland (CACH) will coordinate the project and implement the activities in coordination with local stakeholders. The project will be implemented during a duration of 8 months from February 2022 until October 2022. The planned implementation period has deliberately been estimated very conservatively in order to be prepared for possible activity suspensions due to (occasional) armed conflicts which are considered rather likely in some of the suggested working areas and may lead to interruptions of access. CACH has successfully implemented projects since 2017 in southern Ethiopia and has a long-time implementation experience in the suggested working area (e.g.  ETH-20/DDA-3379/SA2/A/INGO/17565, &#x201C;Improving the Sanitation and Hygiene Situation and Introducing Innovative and Efficient Ways of Use of Water&#x201D;, East-Hararghe, and, &#x201C;Support the Trachoma Prevention and Control Programme in Oromia&#x201D;, East-/West Hararghe).

The project aims to support 10,475 (around 50% women) host community and IDPs Chinaksen Woreda (East Hararghe Zone) in addressing their immediate needs through
a)	Animal feed distribution - 675 households will benefit
b)	Provision of access to medical treatment for livestock - 1,495 households will benefit
c)	Facilitation of governmental vaccination campaigns - estimated 8,125 households will benefit
d)	Distribution of seeds and agricultural inputs - 600 households will benefit
e)	Capacity building for local government experts, mainly Development Agents (DA) and Community Animal Health Workers - 38 Government Experts will be trained

The 10,475 people results from the total no. of beneficiaries of activities b) and d) = 2,095 HHs, equal to around 10,475 people. Double counting is avoided as HHs receiving support under the other activities a), c) and e) are alreadycovered by the activity b). 8,125 HHs or around 40,625 people benefit further through the vaccination campaigns but as the number is not yet clear those beneficiaries are not mentioned here.

CACH will closely cooperate with local Government of Ethiopia (GoE) line offices right from the start of the project to align the action with local efforts and foster the localization of aid. The project approach is community centered, which is why communities will be actively involved in decision-making steps e.g. during beneficiary selection. Both implementation partners will ensure to incorporate specific activities to address all cross-cutting matters such as Protection against Sexual Exploitation and Abuse (PSEA), Accountability to Affected People (AAP) and Gender. 

The suggested activities were identified in consultation with the zonal/woreda line offices and are in line with the 2021 EHF 2nd Standard Allocation Strategy Paper and the Humanitarian Response Plan Ethiopia, the Mid-Year Review from August 2021, and the Agriculture Clusters prioritization from December 2021.</narrative>
