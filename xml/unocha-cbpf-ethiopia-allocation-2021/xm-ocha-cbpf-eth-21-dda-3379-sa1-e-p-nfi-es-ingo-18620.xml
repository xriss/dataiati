   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Conflict displacement, disease outbreaks including COVID-19 global pandemic, rain shortfalls in parts of the country and floods in others are key drivers of humanitarian needs in Ethiopia in 2021. According to Humanitarian Response Plan Ethiopia (HRP) 2021, COVID-19 has also slowed the country&#x2019;s economic rate to 3.71 per cent down from the projected 10 per cent growth rate for 2020. As a result, the number of people requiring food and non-food assistance had already doubled from 7 million to 15.1 million by mid-2020.On the heels of continuing inter-ethnic conflicts, climatic shocks, a severe desert locust infestation, drought and the recent military confrontations between the Federal Government and the armed forces of Tigray regions have created an alarming political tension with adverse humanitarian consequences 
The result of continued ethnic based violence and attacks in Metekel Zone of Benshangul Gumuz Region have resulted in death, injuries, damage of properties and displaced thousands of people while leaving many in trauma. According to Benishangul Region DRMO, more than 200,000 people are displaced as a result of the violence, as of April 2021, and have lost their livelihoods. Most of the displaced people are within 6 woredas of Metekel zone while the other significant number are displaced to Awi Zone, Amhara Region
To respond to the increasing need of the people, Amhara Region has established Emergency Coordination Centre (ECC). According to ECC, more than 80,000 people are currently displaced to or being hosted in Awi Zone. A significant number of IDPs are in Chagni town at Chagni Ranch collective site while the rest IDPs are dispersed and living with the host community in 11 woredas. Out of these woredas, Guangwa woreda hosted the second majority of the displaced population next to Chagni Town. 
This project therefore intends to response for the emergency needs of IDPs in the critical sectors of ENFI provision, Protection more particulary Child protection, WASH and Education in emergency services in integrative manner.
This project is designed in close consultation and coordination with CP/SGB, Education and Shelter and NFI, WASH and Health all project targeted Regional sector offices as well as respective Zone and targeted District key stake holders to prioritize targeted districts and the actual gaps in Child, protection, Education, ES/NFI, WASH and Health. Prosed project is in line with Education, Child protection and SGB, Wash, ES/NFI and Health cluster Operational Response plan and Objectives, as clearly indicated in the 2021 Ethiopia HRP. Recognized that EN/NFI, Health, WASH, Child protection and Education are major and critical gaps in the area and need huge intervention. 
Plan International planned this project to supplement and scale up on the current ongoing efforts by the government with giving high focus on maximizing access to Child protection services, Education, ES/NFI, WASH and Health service deliver and improvement at all level. Furthermore, the proposed project is in line with the Ethiopia Humanitarian Fund prioritization as it is most lifesaving, time critical and critically enabling, providing immediate support to the most vulnerable population suffering from shortage of ES/NFI, Education, Child protection, WASH and basic health services. While also building local capacity to respond and manage such cases independently now and in the future</narrative>
