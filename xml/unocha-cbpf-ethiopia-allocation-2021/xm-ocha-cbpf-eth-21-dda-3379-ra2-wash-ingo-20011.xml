   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The onset of armed conflict in the Tigray region in early November 2020 has led to a dire humanitarian crisis. Clashes between Ethiopian federal forces and regional security forces in Tigray have destroyed critical infrastructure and led to widespread displacement. Access to water in Tigray&#x2019;s woredas is inadequate. Water coverage is currently at 40%, which is well below the national average of 56%. To illustrate, partners confirmed during a Rapid Needs Assessment (RNA) the proposed sites that people have access to less than 3L of water/person/day from unprotected sources, which is well below the minimum Sphere standard of 15L/person/day. The extremely vulnerable&#x2014;individuals with chronic illness or disabilities, pregnant/lactating women, and the elderly&#x2014;have compounded challenges with accessing water, because they are often forced to depend on others for support. In Southern Tigray, the RNA noted that water vendors were selling water from the river at inflated prices and that the cost of personal hygiene products like soap had also increased since the conflict started. Long lines at functional water points have become a source of conflict, since more IDPs have increased strain on water infrastructure in regional towns. Furthermore, when armed forces are present, they assume control of the water supply, which limits the amount of water available for communities in need. Catholic Relief Services (CRS) and local partner, Ethiopian Catholic Church Social and Development Commission Adigrat Branch (ECC-SDCOAdB), have decades of experience in the Tigray region. To support the recent emergency needs, CRS has supported an emergency WASH response, the distribution of shelter and essential NFIs to over one million people through the support of donors including USAID/BHA, UNICEF RRM, charity: water and private funds.

CRS and ECC-SDCOAdB have selected four woredas from Central, and Southern zones of Tigray regions. Due to the current security problem and access challenge, Adewa, Korem, Mohoni and E/Arbi woredas are selected for this response as feasible operation areas. The overall objective of this response will be to provide a lifesaving emergency WASH response for 42,945 people in the selected woredas. The project will improve access to safe water and reduce diarrhea and infectious diseases in the affected areas. Furthermore, women and girls will benefit from the implementation of this project and the availability of closer water sources as they are the primarily individuals responsible for collecting water.

The following activities from the list of prioritized activities under the WASH Cluster in the 2021 strategy allocation document will inform project activities proposed by CRS and ECC-SDCOAdB:
 Rehabilitation and maintenance of water schemes and Pipeline expansion.
 Provision/distribution of essential life-saving WASH NFIs, including water treatment chemicals. 
 Emergency water provision through Water trucking
 Sanitation and hygiene promotion.

The project will be implemented for a six-months period in the selected sites and will directly benefit 16,945 IDPs (3072 men, 3706 women, 4914 boys and 5253 girls) and 26,000 members of host communities (4714 men, 5686 women, 7540 boys and 8060 girls). The project will work to strengthen the capacity of the community to operate, maintain, and manage any new, improved, or repaired water systems sustainably. Health facilities in the area will use these water systems as feasible.The project will also complement the existing UNICEF RRM and USAID BHA projects which have significant  hygiene and sanitation activities.</narrative>
