   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Camp Coordination and Camp Management (CCCM) response for Internally Displaced People/ IDPs located at East and West Wollega Zones, Oromia Region</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">According to the Displacement Tracking Matrix (DTM) report as of October 2021, there are estimated 4,239,636 million Internally Displaced People (IDPs) across nine regions of the country in about 1,577 sites and it is continues to be an issue of concern in the country. The main drivers of displacement include conflict and drought. Climates induced floods yearly affected millions of people and displace thousands every year. Of the total displaced population, the main causes of displacement were conflict which displaced 3.5 million IDPs (85%), drought which displaced 307,871 IDPs (7%) and seasonal floods which displaced 139,199 IDPs (3%). 
The updated figure shows that the number of IDPs living in Oromia region is about 506,133 (DTM Site Assessment Report, Round-27). These displaced people face numerous challenges including limited access to basic services (including food, health, water and sanitation facilities, education), and protection, as well as a loss of housing land and property. 
According to the recent multi-agency assessment report, In 2021, renewed conflicts and displacement have been reported across Wellega different zones. Multiple displacements reported and results of ethnic conflict between communities and violence by UAGs. Data from zones showed that, at least 11 new woredas are added to IDP hosting list, which makes a total of 24 woredas hosting IDPs only in East and West Wellega zones. Overall, the number of people that need humanitarian response has increased significantly requiring comprehensive response. However, response have been minimal and challenged due to lack of partners, funding and security issues in the Wellegas. (Wellega and Kamashi Zone IDP Response Plan December, 2021). 
To address the gaps, needs and requirements of the IDPs living in camps, camp like settings and with host communities, CCCM activities will be implemented that linked to four CCCM pillars. To this end ANE will implement among other site level coordination meetings and support for Camp Management, support CFM formation and referral systems , conduct daily service mapping, conduct on basic CCCM training. Ensure Gender, Accountability to Affected Population (AAP) and Protection from Sexual Exploitation and Abuse (PSEA) initiatives will be mainstreamed in all our activities. 
Moreover due to lack of information and misinformation, vulnerable groups facing increased protection risks. This and others factors necessitated the demand for coherent and standardized Camp Coordination and Camp Management (CCCM) intervention which the project is expected to overcome. 
In delivering all activities ANE will pay due attention for humanitarian principles, do no harm, uphold principles of gender equality and non-discrimination and hold responsibility to address all forms of marginalization and exclusion and enhance participatory processes of vulnerable groups.
The overall aim is to improve benefits and the living conditions and protection of IDP HHs living in Manasibu and Gimbi woredas of west Wollega zone and Guto Gida and Sasiga woredas east Wollega zone of Oromia region by providing support IDPs through full-fledged CCCM activities linked to four pillars of CCCM. 
Considering its vast experiences in field operation, physical presence and in coordination with local communities and local authorities, ANE will manage and be fruitful in the implementation of the stated projects. ANE in all steps will engage IDP and host communities and coordinate with other cluster partners as well. And will ensure project performances and financial reports will be regular submitted on timely manner. 
The project will be implemented for nine months in targeted four woredas to reach about 40,392 conflict affected communities and ANE proposes 449,999.80 $ to intervene the CCCM activities</narrative>
