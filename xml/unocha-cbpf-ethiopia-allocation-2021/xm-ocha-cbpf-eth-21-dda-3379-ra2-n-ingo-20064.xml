   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Emergency Nutrition Response In Tigray Region</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Going into its eleventh month, the conflict in Tigray persists and has even expanded into the surrounding regions of Amhara and Afar. A ceasefire on declared in late June by the Ethiopian ultimately has not held and access to the region remains limited. According to the UNOCHA Tigray: Humanitarian Access Snapshot (July 2020), &#x201C;electricity, telecommunications, and banking services continue to be disconnected throughout Tigray, while commercial cargo and flights into the region remain suspended. This is having a major impact on relief operations. Partners are having to scale down operations and reduce movements due to the lack of fuel. Partners&#x2019; inability to pay staff salaries or procure essential materials severely impacts the delivery of aid to the population. The blockade is impeding the payment of salaries to thousands of civil servants across the region. Instead of their monthly wages some health workers are receiving food aid as compensation.&#x201D;  

Health care services in Tigray are alarmingly limited, leaving hundreds of thousands of people, including the chronically ill and injured, without adequate access to essential medicines and basic services. With limited food, clean water and proper shelter, incidences of malaria, cholera, measles, and COVID-19 are expected to rise. Looting of health facilities was reported and there is just an overall shortage of essential supplies, including medicine, disinfectant, and cleaning materials. With little or no transportation and no fuel, staffing remains a constant issue and mobile health clinics have had to stop operations. In addition, some of the health facilities have sustained full/partial destruction or damage because of the conflict. Currently, only a few health facilities are operational/functional, and minimal services are provided. In addition, health extension programs have no supplies to resume their community-based health services.

The project will provide technical support to the woreda health office to establish a regular active/outreach acute malnutrition screening, establish well-functioning treatment centers for acute malnutrition avail outpatient treatment for SAM through RUTF, Vitamin A. and albendazole in the health facilities. The project will ensure equitable promotive, preventive, and curative health and nutrition services are provided to the community and IDPs, through providing a clear guidance /direction to the zonal and woreda health offices. The project will screen children under 5 and pregnant and lactating women (PLW) and support IYCF teaching aids and on job training to the health workers on management of acute malnutrition and IYCF activities.</narrative>
