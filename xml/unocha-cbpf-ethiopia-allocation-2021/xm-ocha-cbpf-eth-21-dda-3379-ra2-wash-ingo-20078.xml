   <narrative xml:lang="EN">With over 2,105,387 people displaced in the Tigray region, the humanitarian needs remain dire. Humanitarian access has improved in the last two months. However, access to electricity, banking services, petroleum fuel, internet, mobile telephone services among other services have been affected. This has had negatively affected the ongoing humanitarian activities. The affected population cannot access the much needed lifesaving interventions as essential supplies either delay or are not able to reach the region. 

The proposed project aims to provide life savings assistance in line with the HRP 2021 in Tigray region. They will be implemented in Woredas which are classifies as priority 1 Woredas by the Tigay WASH Sub Cluster. The Woredas include Axum, Raya Alamata, Raya Azebo and Raya Chercher Woredas in Southern Zone and Adet and Naeder Woredas in Central Zone in the Tigray Region. All the IDPs are affected by conflict except for Tumuga Kabele in Alamat Woreda which is affect by floods following the ongoing rains.

Inadequate access to potable water is affecting the displaced population, the host community members and institutions like Health Facilities and schools. According DTM report, 75% of water sources in the Southern Zone are unprotected. They include rivers, rivers, unprotected springs, ponds among others. LWF plans to support access to safe water through durable solution by rehabilitating 5 motorized water schemes and 28 shallow wells in the targeted Woredas. 4 Health Facilities will be supported by installation of Plastic water tanks to enhance water storage capacity. 

There is 63% gap in access to improved sanitation facilities in the selected Woredas in the Southern Zone. Sanitation facilities in the schools where IDPs are staying have been overstretched. Most of them have been filled and need frequent emptying. Some have been damaged and rendered none functional. Inadequate water couple with overcrowding in the IDP camps have made it difficult to maintain proper hygiene standards and behavior. This exposes the IDPs and the general population to risk of water related diseases besides Covid-19 pandemic. There are also threat of Cholera outbreak in the targeted Woredas. In response to the poor sanitation and hygiene condition, LWF plans to support construction of improved VIP latrines in 4 Health Facilities. Communal latrines will also be constructed in IDP Camp in Axum Town. This will be carried out together with hygiene promotion both in the community and the targeted institutions. WASH will also prioritize construction of communal latrines and hygiene promotion.

LWF is already supporting ongoing response in Tigray region. LWF works in partnership with Ethiopian Evangelical Church Makane Yesus-Development and Social Services Commission (EECMY-DASSC) which is national organization and has branches and members in all zones of the Tigray region. LWF currently has projects in Southern South Eastern and Mekelle City Administration. The projects include emergency food assistance, WASH, emergence shelter and NFI and protection activities.</narrative>
