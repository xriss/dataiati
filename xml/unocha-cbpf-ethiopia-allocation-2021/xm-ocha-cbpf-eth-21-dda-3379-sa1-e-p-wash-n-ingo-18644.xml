   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Integrated Multi-Sectoral Life-Saving Response to Crisis Affected Children and their Families in Moyale, Hudet, Mustahil,and Babile woredas of Somali Region</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Save the Children is proposing an integrated multi sector lifesaving response in an IDP site identified as high risk, located in Moyale, Mustahil, Hudet,and Babille woredas of Somali regional state. The proposed project aims to provide lifesaving emergency assistance for children and their parents through Nutrition, WASH, Child Protection and Education intervention.  The population faces uncertainty over political transition, ongoing regional and ethnic conflict and recurrent displacement, climate shocks (droughts/floods) as well as a severe locust invasion resulting in the loss of livelihood and deteriorating food security. Somali region has experienced different humanitarian crisis that have aggravated the humanitarian needs in the region, and drought is currently the most significant crisis that in the past resulted extensive loss of livelihoods and massive displacement. The region is continuing to battle with the residual impact of Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) weather phenomenon in 2017, coupled with the recent floods in 2019 and 2020, the inter communal conflict have also large-scale displacement. On the other hand, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic since March 2020 has disproportionately impacted crisis-affected communities. According to the recent Somali region drought response plan, 2,76 million people are need of humanitarian assistance. The prioritized sector of intervention includes Nutrition, WASH, Protection and Education. The Target host community and IDP site have poor access to safe drinking water, and poor hygienic practices which contribute to health risks. Open defection due to limited availability of latrines and low handwashing rates due to limited access to hand washing facilities are other factors observed in the target locations. There is limited knowledge and practice concerning proper hygiene and a need for improved management of community assets and resources including water points, to minimize exclusion of vulnerable and minority groups, and mitigate protection risks. Acute malnutrition is also expected to rise over the next nine months due to deteriorating food security situation (caused by harvest losses, desert locust infestation, high market prices, etc.), as well as the increased prevalence of infectious diseases (cholera, measles), inadequate WASH and poor access to health care. In emergency cases, children in particular and community at large lacks access to basic services including health, protection and education. SC intends to benefit children and youth in IDP sites and Host communities of Moyale, Mustahil, Babile and Hudet woredas of Somali region through accessing comprehensive case management and psychosocial support through the child protection sector. Through the education response SCI aims at creating access to quality, safe and inclusive education for 7725 crisis affected children through constructing temporal learning spaces, rehabilitating damaged schools, providing learning materials and school feeding for crisis affected children. In education attention will also be given to build capacity of woreda education officials, teachers, PTA members and parents enhance their technical capacity in EiE service delivery, information management and resilience building Collaboration with Nutrition, WASH, Education and protection activities in the target woredas will ensure an integrated approach to holistically respond to spikes of malnutrition, diseases outbreaks, protection, WASH and education needs of crisis affected children. The multi-sectoral response in the target area will add further benefit to the proposed project through complementarity of services, with an overall aim to improve access to and quality of lifesaving services. In Moyale, Mustahil, Babile and Hudet woredas, SCI has extensive experience delivering humanitarian projects and long-term development programs across conflict and drought affected Woredas.</narrative>
