Drought, shortage of clean water and occurrence of other emergencies such as conflict, and flood has led to the emergence of multiple public health concerns such as disruption of primary health care, outbreak of human disease epidemics, undernutrition and other health problems. The proposed woredas recently been reported that health facilities and other public assets has been looted by TPLF forces making the primary health care weaker. According to the report from south Gonder zone health office, one hospital, 4 health center, and 9 health posts were looted and primary care service is temporarily interrupted in lay gaynet and Guna wworedas. In addition, the proposed areas of intervention have become among the areas in Ethiopia indicating increasing trend of under nutrition while the existing primary health care services are downing because of the recent conflict in between TPLF and Government of Ethiopia and inadequate capacity of the local health system. These situation has been raising the need for humanitarian response intervention primarily Nutrition and Health response among others.
