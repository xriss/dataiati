   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Emergency health and agriculture response to acute and complex emergencies by increasing access to health care and agricultural service for drought affected communities in Oromia Region</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The drought conditions observed since mid-April 2021 in Oromia and Somali regions continue to affect communities and their livelihoods following water rationing measures across affected communities. There are increasing immediate and basic needs, as the need to accelerate early detection and treatment of emergency health conditions and provide essential health services to the drought affected population. Health-care services in the target woredas (Medawelabu, Dolomena and Harenabuluk) in Bale zone of Oromia region are limited, leaving hundreds of thousands of people, including those who are chronically ill, displaced, and unable to purchase essential drugs, without adequate access to essential medicines and basic services. There are nearly 18 Health Centers and 61 Health Posts in the targeted woredas however, 45% of them are not fully functional in terms of providing essential health service and addressing the needs of the most vulnerable parts of the community such as mothers, children, elders, people with disability, and internal displaced communities. To address the critical emergency health needs of the targeted community, GOAL is planning to provide essential medical supplies and equipment, clinical mentoring and capacity building to the health staff, logistic and technical support to the woreda health offices and health facilities on Public Health Emergency Management (PHEM) activities, deploying Mobile Health and Nutrition Team (MHNT), integrated with COVID response activities.
To achieve the intended outcome of the project, GOAL proposed the following activities: 
1.	Provide capacity building training for health care workers on essential health services. 
2.	Procurement and distribution of essential medical supplies and office equipment for health facilities and MHNT
3.	Community mobilization and awareness raising for better acceptance of health service, COVID prevention measures and vaccination rollout. 
4.	Restoration of health care facilities through minor maintenance rehabilitation.
5.	Deploy MHNT one per Woreda for the overall implementation of MHNT service and coordination of the health program activities in the targeted Woredas. 
6.	Logistical support for MHNT drugs which will be donated from WHO/UNICEF to the targeted Woredas 
7.	Logistical support for the comprehensive activity including COVID-response awareness creation.
8.	Strengthen and support Public Health Emergency Management activities. 
9.	Procurement and provision of COVID-19 prevention, preparedness, and response supplies for the targeted Health Facilities.
10.	Supportive supervision, on the job support and provide clinical mentorship for health care providers in the targeted health facilities. 
11.	Gender and social inclusion training to Health workers and Health extension workers:- heath workers will be trained on social norms, and discriminatory practices that are barriers to maintain health of a community. The issue of gender inequalities, gender roles and responsibilities, gendered based practices as well as social norms in relation to self-wellbeing will be major focus of the training. GOAL will use its global gender manual along with ISAC Gender handbook for humanitarian action specifically focusing on health to tailor training to the specific community. Social inclusion concepts that can help program inclusiveness of older people and People with disability will also be included as a training package. A  result of these trainings, GOAL assumes that practitioners will become more gender and inclusive sensitive as well as deliver quality service. 
12.	PSEA and Protection training to Health workers and Health extension workers:- assuming health workers are in the front line to meet project beneficiaries, GOAL believes that delivering training on PSEA and protection specifically linked to GBV and referral systems are mandatory. GOAL will use PSEA network training agenda and guideline to deliver its training to health workers.</narrative>
