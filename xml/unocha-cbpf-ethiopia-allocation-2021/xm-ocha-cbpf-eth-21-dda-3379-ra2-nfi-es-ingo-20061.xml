   <narrative xml:lang="EN">After 11 months of conflict, the fighting in Tigray has now expanded into the surrounding regions of Amhara and Afar. A ceasefire declared in late June by the Ethiopian Defense Forces ultimately did not hold and access to the region, specifically at the borders, remains limited. According to the UNOCHA Tigray: Humanitarian Access Snapshot (July 2020), &#x201C;electricity, telecommunications, and banking services continue to be disconnected throughout Tigray, while commercial cargo and flights into the region remain suspended... Partners are having to scale down operations and reduce movements due to the lack of fuel. Partners&#x2019; inability to pay staff salaries or procure essential materials severely impacts the delivery of aid to the population. The blockade is impeding the payment of salaries to thousands of civil servants across the region.&#x201D;  

After fleeing the fighting, internally displaced persons (IDPs) and returnees are living in overcrowded settlement sites and collective centers (UNOCHA Situation Report, August 19, 2021) protection concerns for the most vulnerable are pervasive with women and girls specifically at risk of gender-based violence (GBV). Through the Displacement Tracking Matrix (DTM) Round 7, a total of 2,105,387 internally displaced people (IDPs) (449,492 households) have been found to be displaced across 377 sites in Tigray, Amhara and Afar regions thus far. According to the DTM, 2,036,398 IDPs (432,358 households) were found in Tigray region, 49,001 IDPs (9,102 households) in Afar region and 19,988 IDPs (8,032 households) in Amhara region. IDPs living in collective centers report increased lack of household items for sleeping, cooking and personal hygiene. Returnees indicate not being able to buy basic construction materials in addition to the need for basic supplies.

The National Shelter NFI Cluster identified 28 &#x201C;extreme&#x201D; woredas in Afar, Amhara and Tigray. Following recent increased conflict on the Tigray/Amhara border, Dessie, located in the Amhara region was added to the list. To support the shelter needs and NFI needs of IDPs, CRS will provide the following to IDPs and returnees:
-	First Line Return Package kits to 4900 returnees (980 households) in Abergele (TG) Woreda, Central Zone, Tigray
-	First Line Return Package kits to 3875 returnees (775 households) in Selewa, Southern Tigray
-	First Line Return Package kits to 3750 returnees (750 households) Bora (TG) Woreda, Southern Tigray
-	First Line Return Package kits to 2600 returnees (520 households) in Keyhe Tekli, Central Tigray
-	NFI kits to 5250 IDPs (1050 households) in Dessi Town, South Wollo Zone, Amhara region

The content of the First Line Return Package and NFI kits will be consistent with the standards set by the national and sub-national Shelter and NFI Cluster. The project will support communities with beneficiary targeting and registration, use local transport and conduct a PDM at each site.

In addition to the above, the project will also support with the following: GBV and PSEA training and the distribution of handwashing materials.

CRS will work with our local church partners, Ethiopia Catholic Church - Social amp Development Commission of Adigrat (ECC-SDCOAd) and Ethiopian Catholic Church &#x2013; Social and Development Commission of Bahir Dar Dessi (ECC-SDCOBD) to implement project activities. Both ECC-SDCOAd and ECC-SDCOBD have decades of experience implementing humanitarian and development activities throughout Tigray and Amhara. The project will leverage their existing presence in the community to facilitate the swift implementation of activities. In addition to providing technical support and backstopping, CRS will oversee all aspects, including working with partner programs, MEAL, and finance teams support the efficient implementation of activities implemented effectively and the best use of resources.</narrative>
