  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">After more than 5 months of conflict, the humanitarian situation in Tigray remains precarious. A total of 61,740 refugees fled to and remain in Sudan IDPs exist across Tigray and in neighbouring regions of Amhara and Afar an additional 1.3 million people are in need of immediate humanitarian support and there is an estimated shortfall of $40.3 million to support current response plans for the Region. Much of the population have not been provided with humanitarian assistance, and reports indicate a worsening situation, with most areas in Central, Eastern and North Western Zones still inaccessible to humanitarian actors (UNOCHA Feb 12, 2021). 

With basic services restored in limited parts of Southern, South Eastern Zones and Mekelle Town, the majority of Tigray have remained with no access to telecommunications, electricity, cash and fuel since November and many local markets are still reportedly not functioning. The security situation remains volatile, with clashes reported in various locations across the Region (North Western, Central, South, South Eastern and Eastern Tigray). 

Gross violations and abuses against civilians, including killings, abductions and sexual violence against women and children have been reported since the beginning of the conflict. These reports are widespread across the Region and perpetrators include various parties to the conflict. While there are some recent reports of rape survivors seeking medical care, the numbers remain small in comparison to the scale and magnitude of suspected violations. There remains a clear recognition that these incidences are greatly under-reported due to fear of stigma, discrimination and repercussions related to reporting (UNOCHA Feb 28, 2021). 

Additionally, SGBV response capabilities are greatly hindered by the current state of health services which have been severely disrupted since the beginning of the conflict. Of the 40 hospitals in Tigray, only 11 are currently fully functioning (Health Cluster&#x2019;s Hospital Assessment) and many facilities across the Region are not functioning due to looting, shortage of supplies and equipment and lack of health workers who have not been paid for 3 months. The result is that only 20 per cent of the population have access to drugs and only 12 per cent of IDPs are able to access free health, nutrition and mental health and psychosocial support. 

Incidents of house searches, looting, killings and sexual gender-based violence (SGBV) against civilians continue to be reported and access to affected communities has remained limited due to security constraints. Additionally, people in displacement sites are also reported to be at particular risk with many of those seeking safety having expressed serious security concerns. 

Given the current conditions, CARE is proposing an intervention to provide immediate and urgent SGBV priority services to conflict affected IDPs within two woredas (Ganta Afeshum (Adigrat) and Axum town) of Eastern and Central Tigray Zones. These woredas have been classified as &#x2018;priority one&#x2019; for emergency response by the Tigray Region DRMC. Meanwhile, the woreda has also been under attack resulting in loss of lives, incidences of SGBV and displacement of households.  The host community has experienced a loss of assets (including cash, livestock and household items) and members of both communities remain with a level of conflict induced trauma. Houses were burned and looting also targeted institutions such as schools, clinics, farmer training centers and shops. As indicated by CP/GBV sub-cluster response plan a total of 32.5 USD is required to address the CP and GBV response gap, while only $6.3 funding is confirmed. 
Importantly, CARE was already implementing the USAID funded livelihoods for resilience project in these woredas prior to the conflict and is currently working to scale up emergency response across priority sectors, including food and nutrition, WASH, Shelter and NFIs and protection.</narrative>
