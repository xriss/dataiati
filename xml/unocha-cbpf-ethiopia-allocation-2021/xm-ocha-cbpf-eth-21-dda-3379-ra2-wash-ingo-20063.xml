   <narrative xml:lang="EN">According to Ethiopian Humanitarian needs overview, 2021 (unreleased), Ongoing conflict, desert locust invasion, recurrent climatic shocks such as floods and droughts, and socioeconomic impact of COVID-19 are the key drivers of humanitarian needs in Ethiopia. Amidst the political transition, armed conflict and community violence remains a critical concern across Ethiopia, from Benishangul Gumuz, to Oromia, to Tigray. Over the last months, the conflict in Tigray is spreading to neighboring Afar and Amhara regions. In Amhara region, the broadening conflict that started along the Amhara-Tigray regional border is further increasing the number of IDPs. Due to insufficient Belg rains, close to 600,000 people will be exposed to food insecurity. A further 600,000 people are likely be affected by floods this year and 22,000 individuals are expected to be displaced. There are currently no humanitarian actors providing food /nutrition responses in North Shewa, South Wello, and Oromia special zones. Over 400,000 IDPs across Amhara have received little or no humanitarian assistance. Pre-positioning of materials and supplies particularly for health, nutrition, shelter, ES/NFIs, protection and WaSH is also urgently required.	

Through this intervention  CARE in consortium with ANE and APDA aims to reach a total of 89,884 IDPs and Host communities in Afar  Zone 4 (Gulina, Teru, Yallo, Awra) and Zone 1 (  Semera/Logia) and Amhara regional states (Debark woreda),The project has been designed in line with the National WASH cluster response plan document and the proposed woredas are part of the WASH prioritized woreda for EHF 2021 2nd Reserve allocation. Key activities will include  Pipe line expansion work from the existing deep well, construction of Gender segregated semi-permanent latrine with hand washing facilities and bathing facilities for IDP sites and schools, provide trainings on hygiene promotion, installation of hand washing facilities with soap and distribution of WASH NFI, HHWT chemicals and hand-sanitizers. 

The project has planned to reach the targeted communities  by creating access to safe drinking water through rehabilitation of non-functional water supply schemes, water trucking and provision of House hold water treatment chemicals. The project will also addresses basic WASH NFI needs of the affected communities in the targeted five Woredas. Hygiene and sanitation promotion is one of the key interventions planned in this project. The water trucking operation will be held to address critical water needs in Teru and Logia Woredas targeting IDPs. 

Semi-permanent latrines will be rehabilitated/maintained and or constructed in the IDP collection sites to enable the affected communities to eliminate open defecation and further minimize the effect of  WASH related diseases.

Over all the project will address  89,884 individual (Male- 44,044 and Female- 45,840) beneficiaries affected by the armed conflict and displaced. out of the total target, 78%  are IDPs displaced from their home due to the conflict and who are living in collection sites. 

The project is intended to ensure accountability to the affected communities, prevention of sexual exploitation and abuse as well prevention of gender based violences. Participation and engagement of  of the affected communities, joint program monitoring and evaluation will be integral part of the report. The project will also distributes dignity kits for reproductive age women and girls, who are affected by the war. 

The project will coordinate with the existing Protection, RRM and other projects at community level to maximize the impact at affected community level.</narrative>
