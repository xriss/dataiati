   <narrative xml:lang="EN">International Medical Corps (IMC) is a US-registered independent affiliate organization of International Medical Corps UK (IMC UK), with which IMC UK shares the same name and charitable objectives and mission. IMC UK and IMC work together to deliver assistance programs in an accountable and effective manner to pursue their commonly held charitable objectives. IMC UK will engage IMC to implement its programs in the field, with IMC UK oversight, according to the terms and conditions of the agreement that results from this proposal and the terms of the parties&#x2019; administrative service agreement. Together with IMC Croatia, IMC provides administrative and operational support to IMC UK and the programs on the ground, including but not limited to financial management, banking and cash management, procurement management/international procurements, and logistics. Since November 2020, the armed conflict between the Tigray People&#x2019;s Liberation Front (TPLF) and the federal government has affected the lives of thousands of people, causing mass displacement and increased humanitarian needs in the Tigray regional state. According to the regional cluster more than one million people have been displaced by the latest surge of violence, all of whom require the provision of life-saving services. Based on local authority information and cluster meeting update, the total number of internally displaced people in the four targeted Woredas Axum, Adwa, Shire, and Shiraro is around 1 million. There are 573,814 individuals at 17 IDPs sites and hosting communities in the Shire woreda that require humanitarian support,10 IDP sites in Shiraro accommodating 98,516 individuals, 10 IDP sites in Adwa accommodating 221,866 individuals, and 13 IDP sites in Axum, which accommodate 116,196 individuals, who are all in dire need of life-saving humanitarian assistance. There are critical gaps in the quality and quantity of WASH service provision in the targeted conflict-affected woredas for IDPs. There are a limited number of functioning and accessible water sources of safe water, inadequate sanitation facilities and hygiene practice increases the risk for WASH-related diseases and exposed women and girls to a critical protection challenges while they travel long distance to access water. The proposed WASH interventions will scale up the existing IMC&#x2019;s WASH program funded by BHA In three woredas at North Western Tigray Shiraro and Shire and also Central zone Axsum. This wash program will cover the WASH needs/gaps among conflict-affected IDPs, and host communities in North Western (Shiraro, and Shire) and Central Tigray (Adwa and Axum) by increasing access to WASH services through rehabilitation/maintenance of existing water supply schemes, construction of temporary sanitation facilities, strengthening hygiene awareness and provision of WASH NFIs. The proposed WASH activities include the rehabilitation and maintenance of 24 existing water systems, two months of water trucking in the absences of other alternatives for IDPs, provision of spare and fuel, for eight water systems distribution of 60,000 strips of HH WTC, construction of 216 (36 blocks, each have six rooms) gender, age and disability appropriate sanitation facilities (latrines), installation of 36 hand washing facilities, distribution of 20,000 hygiene kits., capacity building for 168 WASHCO members, hygiene promotion in four targeted woredas to reach 80,000 individuals and environmental health -solid waste management at 10 IDP sites and provision of hygiene kits for 4000 adolescent (menstruating) girls, awareness creation training on the mensural hygiene management. IMC in consultation with cluster will procure and provide one set of tool kits for maintenances of shallow wells, provision of borehole camera, and deep meter for BH maintenance. Further, IMC will work on cholera preparedness and immediate response. IMC will start the intervention immediately since there are 16 staff deployed at proposed location.</narrative>
