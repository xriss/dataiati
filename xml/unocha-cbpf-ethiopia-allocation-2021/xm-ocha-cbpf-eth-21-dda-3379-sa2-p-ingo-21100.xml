  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This proposal is developed in response to the existing humanitarian crises related displacement of people in West and East Wollega zone of Oromia region. According to the Inter agency multi sectoral assessment conducted in West and East Wollega as well as Kamashi zone in August 2021 a renewed conflict in Kamashi of Benshanul Gumuz in 2021 resulted in new crisis displacing many to the nearby East and West Wellega zones. The conflict have exposed the community to a deplorable and far below minimum standard of living condition, and restricted access to basic and essential service due to insecurity and threat to physical safety. The economic breakdown and limited livelihood opportunities have negative impact on the wellbeing of the affected population especially that of women and children as well as people with special needs who strive to survive in the mist of insecurity and poverty. Thus, World Vision Ethiopia intends to implement a project that strengthen the protection, and resilience of the community affected by inter-ethnic conflict and improve access to appropriate service for children and women affected by the inter-ethnic conflict in 7 target woredas. The target Woredas are: Gimbi, Guliso, Menesibu and Bambel  in West Wollega Zone, and  Guida-Ayana, Sasiga and Ebantu  Woredas in East Wollega Zone of Oromiya Region. World Vision will work to prevent, and resolve conflicts, and to promote reconciliation. World Vision will work with faith actors, civil society and youth to establish and support platforms for dialogue, conflict prevention, humanitarian response and social cohesion, as well as to promote constituencies of peace and non-violence. World Vision partnered with local faith communities to leverage Do No Harm for Faith Groups in fragile contexts and emergency response. World Vision equips girls, boys, young women and young men to be agents of peace in their communities, agents of change and healing among their peers and in their communities.

The overall goal of the project is to improve the protection of the affected vulnerable children amp women. Towards this end, WVE will use a multi-faceted approach to achieve these major outcomes over the project life. These include Family Tracing and Re-unification (FTR) of unaccompanied and separated children, provision of psycho-social support for vulnerable children amp women, strengthening of case management systems in all target Woredas, conducting awareness raising sessions on CP amp GBV, providing capacity development trainings on CP amp GBV related issues to different stakeholders and provision of multi-purpose case for survivors of GBV. In the course of the project implementation, World Vison envisages to consolidate the ongoing protection responses in its current operational zones of East amp West Wollega.

The range of services will contribute towards prevention and mitigation of violence against children and women ensure recovery and restoration of the victims as well as strengthening the community-based protection system including prevention of and responding to child protection concerns facilitate referral and follow up mechanisms. Through a serious of capacity building and life skills training interventions, the project will boost the resilience of adolescent girls and survivors of GBV in the target sites. The project also aims to address the protection needs of IDP and returnees as well as host communities and access to basic services through building the capacity of government stakeholders and community based structures towards mitigating and responding to child protection and GBV risk factors. 

The project will prioritize most vulnerable section of the population and will reach 70,430 affected people through these packages of services within 9 month. WVE&#x2019;s interventions are in line with the protection cluster suggestions in terms of prioritized location, intervention and budget and will ensure close collaboration with the cluster.</narrative>
