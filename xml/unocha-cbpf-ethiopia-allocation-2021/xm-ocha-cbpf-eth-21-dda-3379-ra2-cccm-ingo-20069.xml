   <narrative xml:lang="EN">IDP communities living in Afar Region in Ethiopia are increasingly facing multi-sectoral gaps in service delivery, while existing vulnerabilities are exacerbated by the Tigray conflict spill over as well as the continuous challenge of COVID-19, and extended dry periods.

According to the regional Disaster Prevention and Food Security Program Coordination Office (DPFSPCO), the recent conflict and movements into Afar has already displaced around 70,000 people in Zone 4. Communities in ten woredas bordering Tigray have been hosting and assisting nearly 50,000 IDPs (of Tigrayan and Afari origin) since conflicts began in November 2020. An additional 500,000 people in three zones (Awsi, Kilbati, and Fanti) are at high risk of displacement if the current conflict continues. In regard to pressing gaps in service delivery &#x2013; confirmed by the needs assessments conducted by WHH and ACTED in Afar Region in January 2021 respectively &#x2013; these largely stem from a lack of Camp Coordination and Camp Management (CCCM). In the absence of CCCM, unmet needs persist due to poor information sharing on service gaps as well as insufficient levels of coordination and advocacy required to mobilize a holistic response. Communities living in IDP sites therefore constitute key vulnerable groups within the target areas, Ewa Woreda, particularly in facing increased exposure to protection risks due to inadequate service provision. 

Moreover, the Action takes seriously the responsibility of addressing all forms of marginalization, exclusion and inequalities in access while upholding the principles of gender equality and non-discrimination. WHH and ACTED will therefore address the susceptibility to marginalization in participatory processes of vulnerable groups by prioritizing inclusive policies in program design and implementation. Women, men, girls and boys, among other groups, often experience crises very differently due to their different roles within the family and society, as well as unequal power dynamics that exist between and among them. Specific attention has therefore been allocated in the design of the present intervention to prevent and reduce those vulnerabilities. 

In response, WHH and ACTED aims to improve the living conditions and protection of 23,800 individuals (comprised of 20,000 IDPs and a further 3,800 host community individuals) living in Ewa Woreda of Afar Region, by providing coordination of humanitarian response, information sharing and empowerment of site residents through establishment of governance structures, cash for work for site improvements and increased protection for most vulnerable individuals. Due to the mixed nature of IDP sites in Afar, which typically include IDPs and host communities, ACTED will formalise the inclusion of the latter as beneficiaries through their representation in Site Maintenance Committees (SMCs) and Camp Management Committees (CMCs). More broadly, host community members will benefit from various other activities under this Action.


WHH as administrative grant holder will be responsible for overall monitoring and compliance related issues, including but not limited to ensuring contractual obligations are followed, guidelines and procedures are adhered to and visibility and communications are addressed. WHH as lead agency will compile narrative and financial reports (including verification of expenditure support documents) from ACTED and submit quality reports to EHF. ACTED however in close consultation with WHH will be leading on the management and implementation for all CCCM activities. Furthermore, ACTED remains flexible regarding the location selection criteria, as ACTED is in close and constant contact with government authorities and other relevant stakeholders.</narrative>
