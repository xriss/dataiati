   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Ongoing conflict, desert locust invasion, recurrent climatic shocks such as floods and droughts, and socioeconomic impact of COVID-19 are the key drivers of humanitarian needs in Ethiopia. Amidst the political transition, armed conflict and community violence remains a critical concern across Ethiopia. Heightened competition over resources due to pressures from climatic shocks, COVID-19 containment measures, and desert locust infestation in certain areas, create further inter-communal tension, violence, and displacement. 
Ethiopia is also experiencing its worst desert locust outbreak in 25 years, which exacerbates an already alarming food security and nutrition situation. The desert locust infestation has so far damaged 365,015 hectares of cropland across multiple regions, devastating crops and livelihoods in at least 76 woredas. The 13.2 per cent increase in admissions for Severe Acute Malnutrition (SAM) treatment reflects a rapidly deteriorating nutrition situation. Somali Region is the highest number of persons with the most severe protection concern, and Mustahil town IDP sites is among the identified sites by Shelter/NFI cluster which demands an integrated response to protection, GBV cases and fears to the safety, dignity, and wellbeing of women, children, people with disability and other who have a special vulnerability .

Adventist Development and Relief Agency (ADRA) and Ethio-Somali Mother and Child &#x2013; Health Organization (EMCO) is proposing in Mustahil town IDP site, integrated Agriculture, Education, and Nutrition emergency response project through implementing the following activities.

Productive and reproductive states of the core livestock breeding stock protected and restored. A total of 1,500 households in the Mustahil woredas (owning 6,000 animals) of Shebelle zone with 3,500 core breeding animals (Shoats) will benefit from a daily supplementary feed provision to each animal for the duration of 90 days. Targeted households will be supported with voucher-based treatment interventions and vaccinations. This activity is planned to provide curative treatment for sick core breeding stock of 1,500 households. In the action controlled but emergency animal health services will be provided by CAHWs for the identified beneficiaries for a period of two months in order to protect their livestock assets. Private veterinary pharmacists (PVPs) will be allowed to bid to supply the necessary veterinary drugs and equipment&#x2019;s for the CAHWs.

Under Nutrition: 
provision of access to nutrition services for the treatment of severe and moderate acute malnutrition (SAM and MAM) among children aged 6-59 months and pregnant and breastfeeding women through IYCF-E hygiene promotion integrated with COVID-19 response. Special focus given to routine nutrition screening (to support health workers/health extension workers [HW/HEWs] at the health facility level as well as in their outreach activities to include mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC) screening at community level) promotion, protection, and support of adequate infant and young child feeding (IYCF) practices (including during cholera and measles outbreaks) with respect to IFE guidance, baby-friendly hospital initiative (BFHI) and breast milk substitute (BMS) code and promotion of adequate practices including nutrition counseling, safe food preparation, WASH and fecal contamination, health-seeking behaviors (Anti-natal care/Post-natal care), caring for a sick child, immunization), growth monitoring and promotion.
