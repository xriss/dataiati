   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Due to ethnic conflict between Somali and Afar communities that led to an outbreak of fighting on 2nd April 2021, hundreds of people have reportedly died  b in various locations along the regional boundaries. The security situation is still volatile and according to the protection cluster weekly bulletin updates from 29 March&#x2013; 23 April 2021, Afar Region hosts 80,343 IDPs, which includes 45,343 displaced due to the Tigray conflict and 35,000 displaced due to the Afar-Somali/Issa conflict. Gewane woreda is one the worse affected woredas due to the insecurity. 
This multispectral project will be implemented in consortium where GOAL will take overall leadership on the project implementation and health and nutrition sectors, while sub grantees MCMDO and DPO  will implement education and protection sectoral activities. 
This project aims to make a significant contribution to the reduction of and response to gender-based violence and child protection problems in  Gawane  woreda. To address the humanitarian needs related to protection, GOAL and Development for Peace Organization (DPO) will establish and maintain coordination among humanitarian actors, identify survivors of human rights violations, facilitate referrals of individuals with specific protection cases, and cash support labelled for specific protection cases that involve case management to enable beneficiaries to cover their transport, food costs during counselling and medical treatment, cost of medical consultations and treatment and per diem for care givers. In addition, tailored psychosocial support is recommended by the Cluster and in line with the EHF 1st round allocation.
 
GOAL will provide capacity building training for Health staffs to manage Severe and Moderate Malnutrition at accessible and decentralized Nutrition service delivery sites (OTP and SC).  Based on the need and identified gaps new OTP sites will be established and existing OTP sites will be strengthened with the provision of job aid CMAM intervention materials and supplies. In the project period a total of 25,817 target beneficiaries will be addressed through Nutrition and Health intervention in Gewane woreda. 

GOAL will integrate COVID-19 Risk Communication and Community Engagement (RCCE), infection prevention, and control measures into the project. The protection monitoring will be conducted using standard Kobo data collection tool and questionnaire developed by the donor, or UNHCR through smartphones. 
Through the provision of case management services, psychosocial supports, capacity building activities, referrals, community awareness sessions and strengthening the coordination and local capacity of the community, GOAL Ethiopia will address GBV and child protection problems in all intervention woreads and contribute to the achievement of cluster objectives. 

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, flood crisis and conflict, education is among the compromised and disrupted basic services in many regions in Ethiopia. In the targeted woreda, education was stopped for long period due to the COVID-19 pandemic where the Government of Ethiopia restricted movement and decided to close schools in an attempt to contain the spread of the corona virus. Furthermore, there was a flood crisis in Gewane which affected education infrastructures. The project intends to provide support to schools for the prevention and control of the COVID-19 pandemic by training teachers, PTSAs and school club members on the school based approaches towards the prevention and control of the pandemic. Currently MCMDO is implementing similar projects in different regions including projects funded by UN OCHA and it will ensure coordination and complementarity among the key actors in the ground.</narrative>
