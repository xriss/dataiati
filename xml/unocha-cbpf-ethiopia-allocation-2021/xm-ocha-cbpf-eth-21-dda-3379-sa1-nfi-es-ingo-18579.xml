   <narrative xml:lang="EN">NFI Response for Conflict Induced IDPs in Efrata-Gidim, Shewa-Robit and Debre-Berhan in North Shewa Zone of Amhara Region</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The inter-communal conflict in North Shewa and Oromo Special Zone that erupted on 18 March and escalated further on 17 April resulted in an undetermined number of casualties, destruction of social and community infrastructure, looting and destruction of private property and left many people displaced/affected in both Zones according to NDRMC and UNOCHA reports and situation updates. The conflict that started on 18 March between the Amhara and Oromo communities in and around Ataye Town of North Shewa Zone was further escalated when Unidentified Armed Groups attacked Ataye Town and its surroundings on 17 April, 2021, leaving some 330,000 people (253,000 in North Shewa and about 80,000 in Oromia Special Zone) have been displaced/affected according to the National Disaster Risk Management Commission. The number of IDPs have since then increased from time to time and now reached over 400,000 in North Shewa zone alone. 

The recent conflict resulted in an undetermined number of casualties, destruction of social and community infrastructure, looting and destruction of private property. According to UNOCHA updates, humanitarian partners have started assisting the displaced population with food and other relief supplies, albeit very limited compared to the needs. The Government distributed more than 500 MT of food to more than 50,000 people in North Shewa Zone and provided water, sanitation and hygiene as well as non-food items for South Wollo and Oromo Special Zones. The reignited conflict has left North Shewa, Oromo Special Zone and South Wollo Zones under a Command Post. 

In response to this, World Vison Ethiopia is proposing a mixed modality where it uses cash and voucher programing and in kind NFI distribution as it is deemed essential. The response is designed 5o intervene with in kind support at Ephrata Gidim and Shewa Robit. In Debrebirhan WV applies Voucher for NFI where prequalified suppliers sign agreement to avail standard kits for the beneficiaries and the beneficiaries collect their entitlement as exchange to the paper voucher they are given. The voucher program is applied for Debrebirehan due to better market functionality and goods availability than the other districts. The voucher program ensures the proper utilization of the cash for the intended purpose as the voucher is tied with those standard NFI kits. in order to ensure the proper utilization of the voucher, WV will apply key standard steps, like sensitization of the beneficiaries on how to use the voucher, they will be told the equivalent cash value of each voucher. Having done that there will be disbursement of voucher to beneficiaries and sensitization of vendors on how they should treat beneficiaries when they come to their store.

A recent assessment conducted by WVE indicated that IDPs are currently in various locations living in overcrowded settings with inadequate hygiene facilities and lack of access to core life-saving relief items and also essential services such as health. The IDPs lack adequate access to basic services such as food, water and sanitation, education, health, shelter and livelihoods. Food, household items and shelter are among the most pressing needs articulated by IDPs.</narrative>
