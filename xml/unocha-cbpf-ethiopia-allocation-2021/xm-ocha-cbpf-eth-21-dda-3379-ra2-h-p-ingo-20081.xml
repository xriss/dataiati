   <narrative xml:lang="EN">International Medical Corps (IMC) is a US-registered independent affiliate organization of International Medical Corps UK (IMC UK), with which IMC UK shares the same name and charitable objectives and mission. IMC UK and IMC work together to deliver assistance programs in an accountable and effective manner to pursue their commonly held charitable objectives. IMC UK will engage IMC to implement its programs in the field, with IMC UK oversight, according to the terms and conditions of the agreement that results from this proposal and the terms of the parties&#x2019; administrative service agreement. Together with IMC Croatia, IMC provides administrative and operational support to IMC UK and the programs on the ground, including but not limited to financial management, banking and cash management, procurement management/international procurements, and logistics . According to IMC assessment  Awsi Rasu zone has 1 hospital, 11 health center and 41 health posts, total of  174 HW and 62 HEW work in these facilities. The zone has 6 ambulances. Among these, following the conflict only 3 HC, 11 HP and 4  ambulances are providing services. The functional health facilities suffer from shortage of essential drugs, medical supplies and equipment. Apart from the 3 HFs, all health facilities are non-functional creating gaps in  immunization, maternal and child health, family planning, and other services. The common causes of morbidity and mortality are cholera, malnutrition, pneumonia, malaria, skin diseases including scabies, COVID 19, intestinal parasites and Measles. To respond to the gaps in health services created by the conflict, IMC in this proposed intervention intends to provide emergency health response in Awsi Resu zone, Chifra woreda for a total of 34,777 (27,527 IDPs settled in 3 different IDP locations , namely  Chifra town, Mesgid and Weama) and 7,257 host community members. In all visited IDP sites, people are living in highly overcrowded conditions which can aggravate the transmission of communicable disease, including  COVID 19. The overall goal of the health response project is to contribute to the reduction of morbidity and mortality through improved access to basic lifesaving PHC, referral services and management of SAM with medical complications for vulnerable conflict affected communities (IDPs and host communities) in Chifra woreda of zone one of Afar region. This will be realized through deploying 1 MHNT composed of nurse, midwife, medical officer, MHPSS counselor and community mobilizer and additional one emergency health response coordinator who will monitor, lead, report and attend coordination meetings.  The team will provide basic free of charge lifesaving primary health care service for affected IDPs and surrounding host communities, conducting awareness creation on prevention of communicable diseases via community mobilization and health promotion/distribution of IEC materials, procurement of essential drugs, medical supplies, and equipment and also infection prevention supplies. Routine surveillance activities are conducted by the Worda health office, IMC will support the ongoing surveillance efforts through orientation of community leaders on sign and symptoms as well as reporting of outbreak prone diseases.  To mitigate and respond  the risk of GBV,   activities that focus on providing psychosocial support through temporary women and girls friendly space, strengthening safe and survivor centered GBV case management and establishing strong  coordination mechanisms with BoWCYA and other GBV service providers will be prioritized  . In addition, the project aims to improve and strengthen existing GBV multi-response services at BoWCYA so as to establishes and strengthen the required service provision and referral pathways in the long term .  The comprehensive GBV response services include strengthening the psychosocial support, targeted capacity-building for local service providers, and dignity kit distributions.</narrative>
