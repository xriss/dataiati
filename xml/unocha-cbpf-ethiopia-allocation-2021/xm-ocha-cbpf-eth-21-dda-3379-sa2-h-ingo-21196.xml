   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Responding to the increased primary health care including MHPSS needs among drought-affected people in 4 woredas of Borena Zones of Oromia Region.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Plan Int`l aims to provide emergency Health lifesaving support to conflict and drought-affected vulnerable communities living in the Borena zones of the Oromia Region. The project aims to support 25,000 beneficiaries in four targeted woredas of the Borena Zone. Under this project, activities will focus on improving the existing health delivery system through staff capacity building, and provision of essential drugs, medical and IPC supplies for 12 targeted health facilities in four woredas of Borena Zone. Moreover, the project will recruit and deploy 4 MHNTs as a part of supporting the depleted basic primary health care delivery system in the targeted project woredas. Major essential PHC services provided by the MHNTs are adult and under 5 children consultations maternal and child health care such as family planning, ANC, delivery, PNC, and well-baby clinic ensuring access to quality and confidential health services for rape survivors managing NCDs, communicable diseases and trauma MHPSS clinical services for clients with MNS use disorders such as individual and group counseling services as per their need and screening services for under 5 children and PLWs, before linking them to OTP and TSFP sites through referral or by directly providing OTP services.
Further, this emergency health intervention includes Infant and Young Child Feeding (IYCF) promotion activities with will be strongly integrated with the other key activities of the MHNT. Also, as there are no focused GBV and MHPSS response services in any of the targeted woredas, Plan Int`l will build the capacity of locally recruited CDF and CSWs staff, as well as HEWs and WCAO staff, to provide in-person and remote support services for GBV survivors. The project will further train health workers, CSWs, and other key focal points who may encounter survivors, in basic supportive response and referrals. Also, survivors of Gender-Based Violence (SGBV) and a person with a disability are specifically targeted to get appropriate and adequate health and Nutrition care and support from this project. In addition, protection concerns are further considered to be addressed through a mainstream approach in each of the planned activities of the project such as incorporating topics of protection and gender during the provision of basic and in-service pieces of training for Health Workers (HWs), Health Extension Workers (HEWs) and Community Social Workers (CSWs). The CSWs will strongly work in raising awareness of the community on SGBV and protection concerns along with the other WASH and health life topics.
In addition, beneficiary feedback and compliance will be also addressed through establishing and functioning a strong feedback mechanism at each kebeles of targeted intervention woredas. Beneficiary participation will be further strengthened through ensuring participation of beneficiaries during project start-up workshop, beneficiary selection, distribution of project input, project review amp FGD.</narrative>
