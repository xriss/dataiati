   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Himaya - access to GBV services for newly displaced and returnees</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">UPP proposes to deploy two mobile teams in the areas of West Mosul and its outskirts that will support the monitoring of protection concerns, provision of GBV services, distribution of dignity kits and referrals to specialized actors, for a period of six months.The response will be integrated thanks to the support to a  women safe space in Hermat PHC located in Mosul West that will strengthen the provision of GBV and MHPSS services through a dedicated team.
To avoid stigmatization, the response will target not only newly secondarily displaced IDP and returnees, but also other IDPs and returnees present in the same geographical areas as well as vulnerable host community members.
The mobile teams will be composed by case managers, psychologists, social workers, community mobilizers, team leaders, community mobilization coordinator and coordinated by a field officer. The team in the static center is composed of a case manager, and a psychologist.
Service provision quality will be supervised by technical figures and senior officers.
The trained mobile teams staff will provide case mgmt. integrating GBV and MHPSS, outreach, awareness on GBV prevention and response. The referrals to individual psychological support and group psychosocial support will be facilitated thanks to the presence of a women safe space in the city of Mosul managed by UPP with trained professionals. 150 dignity kits will be distributed regularly throughout the intervention period to support women and girls and their families.
The mobile units will be on the field four days per week, and the fifth day will be dedicated to the reporting.

Key intervention:
Lifesaving, age-appropriate services are available to women, girls, and survivors of GBV.
GBV awareness-raising sessions
Dignity Kits
Provision of PSS services
Provision of GBV case management services
Case referrals to specialized needed services.

Addressing the needs of survivors:
Based on the needs assessment conducted by UPP in December 2020, the vast majority of the returnees and IDP are in need of lifesaving GBV and MHPSS services especially women and girls who are more vulnerable due to the sudden closure of the camps. Targeted beneficiaries and survivors from the returnees and IDP communities are facing community stigmatization, physical, and emotional abuse. Additionally, women who have separated from their children due to camp closures are suffering from psychological trauma, anxiety, and fear of losing their children.


The overall impact of the proposed intervention:
The psychological impact and sufferings on the affected population will have a long-term effect on the mental health and psychosocial well-being of the returnees and IDPs especially women and girls. The overall impact of the proposed intervention is to provide access to lifesaving services such as GBV case management and psychosocial support, promoting a positive difference in the lives of IDPs, returnees, and GBV survivors, which will have a long-term positive impact on the development of the community as a whole.</narrative>
