  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project, in line with Iraq&#x2019;s HRP for 2020, aims at providing timely, culturally-appropriate and gender-sensitive Child Protection services to approx. 1020 conflict-affected children and their families (approx. 2700 people), including identification of cases in need of immediate assistance and child protection services, in Ba&apos;aj and Hatra. Particular attention will be paid to IDP children&#x2019;s returns and secondary displacement prompted by sudden unexpected camp closures. 

TGH has extensive experience in Child Protection interventions in rural, urban and camp settings during emergency and post emergency contexts. As such, immediate response will be implemented through the proposed action in the selected districts. 

Based on the IOM DTM data and needs severity districts, as well as needs analysis provided by CPSC along with IHF Reserve Allocation strategy, TGH propose to focus on Ba&apos;aj and Hatra districts, in Ninewa governorate. More population will be targeted in Ba&apos;aj in the proposed action (60% of total population) than Hatra as the majority of arrivals from camps live in critical shelters in Ba&apos;aj where severity level is high [DMT, 2020]

A mix of mobile and static approaches will allow TGH to be flexible and to maximize its population coverage in these underserved areas. Case management of high-priority cases will be coupled with PSS activities adapted to age, gender and specific needs both will be provided by taking into account each group&#x2019;s specificities at all stages of the intervention. Family based PSS will commence within the first 6 weeks of project (allowing for recruitment). During the first  month of the project TGH will also seek suitable locations to use as safe spaces in Ba&apos;aj and Hatra by which community members can attend for support services, and PSS. Both activities will run in parallel. 

The Mobile Child Protection Teams within the vans are in charge of carrying out Child Protection Assessment to identify immediate risks faced, including GBV and UASC issues, and of identifying the most at risk children and adolescents. The intervention will tackle various risks that affect children&apos;s access to their rights, development, resilience and well-being, and provide a comprehensive response. This project directly targets children, adolescents, families and to a larger extent the community, reaching a total of.  

TGH will, as possible, expand and develop activities in schools and learning spaces (such as PSS, awareness events), and will support and linkage between existing community structures members and other stakeholders.

The final month of implementation will focus on community feedback, providing evidence-based recommendations for ongoing humanitarian needs. TGH teams will conduct satisfaction surveys, recorded on KOBO Collect, ensuring consistency and clarity in data collection. Focus Group Discussions and Key Informant Interviews will also be conducted, with summaries annexed to final report.

Note: the indicators for each activity have been identified according to the team size, capacity and the project duration of the proposed action.</narrative>
