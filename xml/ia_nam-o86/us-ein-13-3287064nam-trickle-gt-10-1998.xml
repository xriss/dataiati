   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The goals of the project are to 1) increase outreach to and inclusion of people with disabilities in microenterprise development programs, 2) reduce extreme poverty among 320 participants with disabilities, with a focus on women, and 3) promote greater inclusion of people with disabilities across Trickle Up regional programs and in other microenterprise development and microfinance programs. The project involves training a disabled persons organization (DPO) to provide microenterprise development support, to form savings groups with the participants, and to provide grants to capitalize and catalyze their productive activities. The second stage of the program involves training non-DPO local NGOs to incorporate people with disabilities into their microenterprise development programs. The project will culminate in the sharing of best practices related to inclusive microenterprise development to be shared with practitioners in both Guatemala and the United States.</narrative>
