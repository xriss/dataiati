      <narrative xml:lang="EN">Mined or destroyed roads, bridges and airfields isolate a large number of areas, some of which are highly populated.  Landmines reduce access to natural resources including viable agricultural land, firewood and water, as well as to markets and social services. Reduced access to services, markets and natural resources increases the vulnerability of rural communities, and of refugees and displaced populations returning spontaneously to their areas of origin.  A number of these isolated and highly populated areas are not covered by mine action operations.  This affects human security and also the timely delivery of emergency aid and of reconstruction and development initiatives. The need to increase access and expand mine action operations to isolated areas is highlighted by both the Government and the international aid community as a national priority.  In this regard, increased funding for mine action is essential to facilitate operations in isolated areas, to maintain the continuity of mine action operations when limited or insufficient resources run out, or to cover gaps in funding when access is required rapidly for the delivery of emergency aid to vulnerable populations. The RRF to contribute to the ongoing peace process and the improvement of the overall humanitarian situation is based on the lessons learnt and advice given by OCHA on the management of the ERF. In particular it seek to achieve: 
A - Safe access to rural areas in mine-affected provinces for resettling demobilized and their families, internally displaced and refugees and humanitarian actors;
B - Reduced risk of land mine and UXO-related accidents for all residents allowing for the resumption of agricultural and economic activities;
C - Improved institutional capacity of national mine action bodies and coordination of mine action operations on provincial and national level in order to increase operational efficiency and ensure that tasks are being performed according to established priorities</narrative>
