   <narrative xml:lang="EN">InterEnergy Holdings (the Company or IEH) is one of the largest private sector power players in the Dominican Republic (DR), commanding approximately 1,000MW generation capacity through its indirect interest in three operating companies. IFCs investment will come in parallel to a proposed equity investment on similar terms by the IFC African, Latin American and Caribbean Fund (ALAC or the ALAC Fund), managed by the IFC Asset Management Company (AMC). Together, these equity contributions will support the Companys expansion of its existing businesses and new possible power and energy sector investments. It will focus on renewable energy development and natural gas diversification, while not excluding other selective opportunities in the electricity sector in the Caribbean and Latin America, such as Haiti.   Pipeline projects include (i) a flagship LNG terminal and gas pipelines network in the DR: (ii) an expansion of the companys existing portfolio of renewable energy projects in the DR, including solar and wind power; (iii) an expansion of its generation park focused on gas-fired capacity; (iv) a transmission line interconnecting the DR with Haitis power grid; and (v) acquisition of certain power assets in the region to diversify the Companys geographic exposure.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">Development impact from the proposed IFC/ALAC equity investment is manifold. The Company is among the few domestic/regionally based IPP companies in the Caribbean region and considers &quot;high developmental impact&quot; synonymous with &quot;long-term commercial success&quot; as its core strategy. IEH through BEL invested in the sector when others were exiting, and has successfully turned around then-problematic companies (e.g. EGE Haina and CESPM) or started out distribution utilities in remote places where there was no electricity supply to support tourism development (e.g. CEPM and CEB) Thus, the Company&apos;&apos;s  success is hoped to help catalyze more generation investments and companies following a similar long-term developmental perspective in the DR and the region. The projects within the pipeline, if successful, could alter the energy map of the DR region with a profoundly positive economic impact - a significant reduction in electricity generation costs and an alleviation of balance of payment problems.</narrative>
