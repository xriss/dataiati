   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Femmes &amp; Elections is a civic and electoral education project for women in the Democratic Republic of Congo. It combines traditional mass media (radio and television), direct interaction (debates), and modern information channels (social networks). By informing and sensitizing women about the essential role they have to play as voters, candidates or observers in the electoral process; by explaining how the electoral system works; by reminding them what it means to be a responsible citizen; by showing them examples of civic engagement, we enable them to better understand the context and to be involved in building their future.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In our project, we strive to ensure the greatest possible equality between men and women. In productions, this equality is reflected in a gender balance in the choice of experts, portraits, testimonies... provided that ad hoc persons are available. During the debates, the balance is ensured both at the level of the experts present, as well as the journalists who lead the debate, until the selection of participants who ask their questions (faced with an influx of questions from men, the facilitator encourages young women to express themselves, and gives priority to their questions). Gender balance is all the more important in this project because it is essential not to fall into the prism of information &quot;by women for women&quot;. Men must also have their place in productions. Women &quot;resources&quot; serve as models on the essential role that women have to play in the electoral process (as voters, candidates, sensitizers...). They come from civil society; they will be candidates in the next elections; they testify to their positive actions in favour of citizenship... The &quot;resource&quot; men speak of the essential role of women in the democracy and construction of the DRC. They talk about their experience, and give, for example, the reasons why they will vote for a candidate.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The overall objective of the project is to strengthen women&apos;s ownership of the electoral process. As the country&apos;s first living force, Congolese women therefore have an essential role to play in building the country. Peacebuilding will necessarily require their conscious and active involvement in the electoral process, and beyond that, through their integration into responsibility missions within their society. However, it must therefore be noted that the Congolese population, and more particularly women, have not always received the civic education necessary to understand and master electoral issues - whether through the formal education system or family education. The lack of education and the &quot;domestic&quot; status accorded to the majority of Congolese women prevent them from accessing decision-making positions, or at least from playing an active role as responsible citizens. Information and education for Congolese women, whether they live in cities or in rural areas, is therefore an important step in building the future of the Democratic Republic of Congo</narrative>
