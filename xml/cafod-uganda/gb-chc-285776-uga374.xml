   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Bisheshe, in Mbarara Archdiocese which has an area of 967 sq km, an average rainfall of 43 inches pa, an estimated population of 350,000 and a population growth rate of 5% pa.
Subsistence agriculture is the main economic activity. With many children in a family and cultural inheritance of the land, each family only has a small portion of land that can hardly sustain them. The crops grown (beans, groundnuts, maize, matooke [plantain]) have decreased as a result of reduced rainfall, soil exhaustion and disease, reducing food production for both consumption and sale, resulting in low income generation. Many farmers have resorted to brewing beer with negative effects on families and communities. The average household income is UGX 6,000 a day, which is far too low to cater for family needs or make any substantial savings.
This project will help young adults and women start animal and bee keeping, along with making crafts for sale thus increasing income. This project will be run through the existing Adult literacy programme and open-door training occasions for young adults bringing them together to learn different practical skills eg basic accounting, computer, basic English, agriculture, environmental studies and various vocational skills eg sewing, crochet, dyeing and printing, cookery, baking, beadwork. Group counselling sessions will allow them to rebuild their personalities. These skills will make them self sufficient and fitting members in society. 
During COVID 19, the municipality registered over 350 teen pregnancies and reports on senior school attendance has shown it dropped very low due to teen pregnancies. The project&apos;s aims are:
1. Increase income generation and decrease poverty in families through increased crop yields
2. Decrease the number of girls with very low or no formal education.
3. Address learning problems caused by stressful family problems
5. Address drug/alcohol abuse and early marriages among the youth</narrative>
