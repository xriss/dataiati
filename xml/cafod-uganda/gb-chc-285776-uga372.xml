  <description>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Uganda started experiencing the second wave of covid-19  in April 2021,which has  disrupted the socio-economic functioning of society with vulnerable households hit hardest due to the current global and nationwide lockdown. A combined outbreak of covid-19, drought and insecurity (interclan raids) in the region have compounded the health and socio-economic challenges already posed by Covid-19 due to the high health risks involved. The presence of a disease in the population will consequently decrease the productive capacity of economically productive people, contributing to food and nutrition insecurity. The porous borders between Uganda and South Sudan and between Kenya and Uganda, coupled with the ill-equipped health system in the sub region compromises effective prevention and control of Covid-19 pandemic.
This calls for cross sectoral collaboration, early identification and management of cases and risk communication to alleviate public panic, control the spread and mitigate the health impacts of the pandemic on the people living in marginalised and vulnerable societies like Karamoja.

The proposal seeks to address issues of risk communication for the communities safety and provide an economic boost of the most vulnerable communities who are mostly hit by the pandemic  building up on the previous efforts and conduct lobby and advocacy for improved, coordinated service delivery towards the fight against the worlds&#x2019; giant pandemic  as follows;
Support to Women/widow headed families, Child headed households, Older persons and people with special needs  persons, these categories depended on the youth for survival but now cannot be provided for due to lack of work to do in the centres due to the present lock down.
The project will be implemented in the sub counties of (Kacheri and Nakapelimoru Sub counties) in Kotido districts, (Lokori and Sangar) in Karenga and (Kamion and Kalapata) in Kaabong respectively.</narrative>
