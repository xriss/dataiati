  <description type="4">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Activities will include hazard vulnerability and capacity mapping and analysis by the ISHCs - combining the best of older people&#x2019;s experience and traditional knowledge of local climate hazards and scientific DRR knowledge. Inter generational Disaster Preparedness Teams will be established, building on HelpAge&#x2019;s global experience of these. They will map the location and profile of older, disabled and other vulnerable individuals, be trained in first aid, emergency needs assessment, getting early warnings to the most vulnerable and being the first responders following disasters.

The ISHCs will make capital available in the form of revolving micro-loan funds for measures to reduce the potential impact of disasters including building flood barriers, storm-proofing of livelihoods related assets and otherwise adapting or diversifying incomes to make them more disaster resilient.  If needed, this funding will also be valuable for restoring lost economic assets to facilitate rapid recovery and to reduce the risk of communities becoming dependent for prolonged periods on emergency aid.

In the 42 target communities we will bring together key government representatives, including members of the local Disaster Unit Management team, various government bodies and other civil society actors with ISHC and Inter generational Disaster Preparedness team representatives to build their capacity to address the special needs of all vulnerable groups, including older and disabled people, in emergency situations. This is also crucial to ensure work is well coordinated.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">When disaster strikes, older people in coastal Vietnam are among the worst hit and the most likely to be killed, injured or lose their assets. Mobility, sight or hearing difficulties or other chronic health problems can make it hard for them to quickly evacuate affected areas and physical weakness can limit their ability to access relief services. In the longer term, older survivors often lack the economic resilience to rebuild their lives &#x2013; leaving them facing long-term destitution. Yet older people also have knowledge of previous disasters and the lessons from these as well as more traditional cultural knowledge, also understanding of who is most vulnerable in their communities that can make them valuable participants in community based disaster risk reduction (DRR) work.

This project will mobilize the skills of 40 existing Inter generational Self-Help Clubs (ISHCs) covering a total of 42 coastal communities across 4 poor and disaster prone districts in the North Central Vietnam (2 of the clubs cover 2 communities). Currently these ISHCs undertake and manage a number of health, livelihoods and rights related activities within their communities. However, disaster risk reduction and climate change adaption has been identified as a key gap in their activities, and providing training and support in this area would significantly build their communities&#x2019; resilience and reduce the frequency of progress being set back by the onset of devastating emergencies. 

The program goal is to increase the disaster resilience of vulnerable groups in coastal communities in Vietnam and build the capacity of government, NGOs and civil society in implementing vulnerable group centered DRR measures.</narrative>
