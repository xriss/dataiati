   <narrative xml:lang="EN">China: Mobilizing four Older People&#x2019;s Associations. HelpAge will identify and train leaders in the urban and peri-urban communities who would be best suited to organize and mobilize OPAs. The mobilization of OPAs will reduce social isolation and provide the ability to develop plans that meet local needs. Furthermore, they will build a strong channel for government health and care services to reach the most vulnerable older people. The OPAs will be self-managed and sustainable organizations with the ability to provide ongoing services to meet the needs of older people in their communities beyond the project duration.

Korea: HelpAge proposes to develop and support two Older People&#x2019;s Self-Help Groups. Responding both to the need and demand of disadvantaged older people for group formation, our long-term plan is to increase the number of OPSHGs in the country. The objective of the plan is to establish a national platform for disadvantaged older people. The purpose will not only be to strengthen active participation in the OPSHG&#x2019;s, but to make contributions to community development and form a unified voice in advocating for older people&#x2019;s rights to basic income security and health and care services. HelpAge Korea&#x2019;s management goal in supporting OPSHGs is to build their capacity to be fully sustainable and both self-financing and self-governing. It is expected that the self-governance of OPSHGs in the community can be achieved through support over a period of two years, with two distinct phases: 1) an 18 month phase focused on the establishment, capacity building, and development of activities including home visit programs and fund-raising, and 2) a 6 month phase, beyond the project period, of ongoing mentoring support from HelpAge Korea.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">HelpAge&#x2019;s goal for this project is to research, pilot and share innovative ways to improve health-seeking behavior and community-based solutions for care among poor older people in urban and peri-urban communities of Sichuan Province. The proposed program would work through mobilized Older People&#x2019;s Associations to strengthen four basic elements of health and care: social interaction, awareness of self-care, regular medical examinations, and care within the community. The project will work to build and expand four OPAs and local community health stations in Chengdu City and will reach approximately 2,100 older people. Each area of intervention will be explored through research and the results of each step will be professionally monitored, documented and then widely publicized.
HelpAge will work in partnership with Sichuan University because of the technical skills of its School of Public Health and its collaboration with HelpAge since the 1990s on a number of age-related projects. The School of Public Health will implement the project under the technical leadership, monitoring, and guidance of HelpAge International.</narrative>
