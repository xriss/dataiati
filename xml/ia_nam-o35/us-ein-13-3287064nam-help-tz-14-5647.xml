   <narrative xml:lang="EN">A key aspect of the project will be the training and deployment of community researchers of differing ages. We will identify groups of children and older people to be trained as co-researchers, using techniques that will be developed through the  support of Save the Children using their expertise in designing and conducting &#x201C;child friendly&#x2019;&#x2019; activities.  The research will also benefit from lessons and approaches adopted in similar research programs conducted by our research collaborators elsewhere in Africa.  

In Kibaha district alone there are 10 Active Age Clubs in 10 villages with a total of 206 male and 150 female members ranging in age from 60 to 85.  Evidence shows that at least 50-70% of these will be living in multigenerational households hence the potential for reaching out to a large number of children on key health issues.   Although current activities are by and large limited to traditional games and exchange of ideas that promote psycho-social support, the potential for these groups to expand the activities of the Active Aging Clubs as a forum to disseminate properly designed health messages  to reach both young and older people is enormous.  This project will enable us to develop a module/curriculum for the Active Aging Clubs that  can eventually be included in the two additional districts covered under the current Pfizer funded NCD project.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project is an extension of two pieces of current work in Tanzania. One is the Pfizer-funded project supporting the prevention and control of NCDs in three rural Districts of Tanzania, the other a UK Aid-funded research study undertaken in 2012 in one of the three districts covered by the Pfizer funding. The latter was a research study in the Kibaha District, Coast province, where academic researchers and HelpAge staff collaborated with a team of older people from a community in Kibaha to jointly investigate issues surrounding older people&#x2019;s access to transport and mobility. Our aim was to develop methods which would help assess not only the direct impact of older people&#x2019;s mobility on their own livelihoods and health seeking behavior, but also the broader impacts on younger generations in their families and communities and related issues of inter-generational poverty transmission.  

The 2012 study identified a number of key questions for further research which would inform the motivations and capacities of older people to utilize health services and to manage their own health status. It also identified the importance of life course approaches to understanding intra-household transmission of health knowledge. The current project seeks to address these issues through an inter-generational lens.</narrative>
