   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Develop a model for supporting older home-based carers in the crucial role they play in the response to HIV and AIDS.

Support older people take action to curb the impact and spread of HIV and AIDS.

Raise awareness of the role older people play in caring for those affected by HIV and AIDS

Provide care, prevention and support to older people living with HIV and AIDS through peer education and training in the community.

In Ethiopia, HelpAge supports community organizations to provide quality HIV and AIDS care and information to older people and their families.

In Tanzania, HelpAge trains older people as volunteer community carers so they can provide quality home-based care and support to people affected by HIV and AIDS.

Project in Uganda teaches parents living with HIV how to make a will and create a memory book with their children. The books provide comfort to the orphans after the parent has gone and will help protect the family&apos;s inheritance from manipulative relatives or land grabbers.

Through our HIV project in Thika, Kenya we&apos;re transforming the livelihoods of older people and the children in their care by offering alternative options to sex work and drugs. We&apos;re giving them skills and start-up grants to start their own businesses.</narrative>
