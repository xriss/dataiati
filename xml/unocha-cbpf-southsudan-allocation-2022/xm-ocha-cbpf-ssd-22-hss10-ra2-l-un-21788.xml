   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Emergency preparedness and flood response in Rubkona/Bentiu Town</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Since the onset of the crisis in Bentiu/Rubkona in October 2021 following the increase in water levels across the urban area, neighbouring payams and counties, IOM, together with UNMISS and WFP, deployed available machinery and technical experts for emergency infrastructure work needed to protect the town from further flooding. The three agencies have formed a technical working group and response plan clearly outlining the division of responsibilities and geographical coverage. According to the inter-agency agreement IOM will continue with the maintenance, construction and reinforcement of berms and dykes in Bentiu/Rubkona Town and around/inside the Bentiu IDP Camp, whereas UNMISS is covering the airstrip in Rubkona town and WFP ensuring passability and functionality of main supply routes. In December 2021, IOM conducted a technical assessment led by a hydrologist to understand the water flow and inform contingency planning. The assessment was limited to assessing possible natural waterways that could be utilized for gravity flow and evaluation of the existing structural protection measures. Given that the entire area is completely inundated with no visible dry depression to where water could be channeled to, the only available local solution to protect the community is to manage water levels by using and maintaining the dikes. Currently, water is receding by an average of 1.5 cm in Rubkona and Bentiu, nevertheless, with the onset of rainy season forecasted for mid-April, it is unavoidable that water levels will start rising again. 

IOM had completed 2.1 km section out of the total of 4.4 km berm around Bentiu IDP Camp and completed rehabilitation of the 22.4 km, most critical sections of dykes in Bentiu town. Based on the complexity and structure of different sections, IOM is combining the usage of heavy machinery and community engagement. The importance of latter is crucial for operations and maintenance of dykes as it ensures community ownership of the infrastructure and more importantly, sustainability of the interventions. Currently, however, IOM does not have sufficient resources available to complete the critical infrastructure works it is responsible for. Moreover, there is an unprecedent urgency to commence the work as soon as possible considering that there is only a six weeks window of opportunity for construction of additional dikes and berms, and maintenance of dykes and berms that have been damaged by human activity causing erosion and increasing the likelihood of dykes breaking under additional water pressure. The work has to be completed before the onset of the rainy season to prevent major catastrophy in the area. 

Activities included in this proposal will focus on the maintenance of existing structures (dykes, berms, retention ponds) and construction of additional berms, dykes and access roads essential to prevent further suffering of people and reduce the risk for catastrophic flooding that will completely paralyze Bentiu and Rubkona town, encroaching 450,000 people with no way out (see map below). Many of the dikes were constructed as an emergency response to manage the increasing water levels, thus many parts are not following standard specifications. Hence, regular maintenance and deployment of machinery, together with engagement with communities, is equally critical for successful mitigation and preparedness for upcoming rainy season.</narrative>
