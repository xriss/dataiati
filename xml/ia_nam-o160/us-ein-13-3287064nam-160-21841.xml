   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This grant was awarded to continue MAG Lebanon&#x2019;s operations from grant 15-GR-1017 (above). The goal of this project is the protection of affected communities from the physical threat and socioeconomic impact of mines and ERW; This goal will be achieved through the following objectives: Prioritized land identified by the LMAC is cleared and/or released from the threat of mines and ERW and subsequently handed back to the authorities for return to impacted communities; RE sessions are delivered to at-risk communities in order to raise awareness of the persisting threat and promote safe behaviors; Technical capacity building and continued development of national operational staff is undertaken to increase efficiency and effectiveness of activities. These activities will be implemented by one community liaison team, two mine action teams and one mech support team, and will result in: 10 communities and 1,000 direct beneficiaries receiving RE through 20 sessions; the release of 100-200k m2 of land; 100% of rapid response tasks completed and identified ERW removed. This project will also include the implementation of Physical Security and Stockpile Management (PSSM) activities, in coordination with the LMAC.</narrative>
