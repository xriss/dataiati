  </title>
  <description>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Update 2014:
In 2014 a total of 12 agrihubs will be supported by Agriterra. The support is tailored to concrete activities. These activities have been developed in consultation with local representatives of Agriterra in the countries, with their partners organisations or are foreseen as issues of joint interest in line with Agriterra&#x2019;s wider objectives.

Focus of Agri-ProFocus and the agrihubs is on the following themes in 2014:
1. Network development and coordination
2. Business and partnership brokering
3. Facilitating Innovation communities
4. Platform for debate and learning



Update 2013
In 2013 a total of six Agrihubs will be supported by Agriterra in 2013. These are DR Congo (support Agriterra since 2013), Burundi (since 2013), Rwanda (since 2009), Benin (since 2011), Kenya (since 2011) and Uganda (since 2011). A small change in agrihub focus has occurred since 2012 as Mali and Zambia have been replaced by Burundi and DR Congo. The latter two belong, together with Rwanda, to the so-called Great Lake region. Agriterra&#x2019;s presence in this region has been strong. Hence the adjustment in Agrihub focus. Indonesia has been added in 2013 in order to support the start of an Agrihub in the first Asian country where Agri-ProFocus is active. Agriterra is active in Indonesia and would like to contribute to the development of a new Agrihub in this country.

The Agrihubs have been formed as networks of actors from farmers organisations NGOs, private sector, knowledge institutes and public sector. These networks strengthen the system for agriculture entrepreneurship in a specific country. Eventually this should lead to strong and effective agriculture entrepreneurs which are able to make better informed choices for their enterprises.
 
The focus of Agrihubs in 2013 are on the following activities:
1. coordination and network development
2. partnership and business brokering
3. Innovation communities in the field of a.o. access to land, markets, finance, inputs, policy environment and gender.
4. platform for learning and debate.

The Agrihubs are coordinated by one of the Dutch APF members. Every Agrihub has a NING, an online platform where information is shared with members and visitors of this platform on a variety of activities.

2011-2012:
AgriProFocus has initiated Agrihubs in a number of African countries. Involved parties are Producer Organisations, service providers, private sectore representatives, donor agencies and civil society organisations. Together they will achieve tangible economic results at the level of the farmers through joint forces. These Agrihubs are a joint effort from Dutch AgriProFocus members to support farmer entrepreneurship through organised farmers. 

Since 2011 AgriProFocus is working with multi annual plans which are prepared in a participatory manner and agreed upon by involved AgriProFocus members. Agriterra commits itself to support these multi annual plans within four countries in 2011 and 6 countries in 2012 more actively with financial and human resources. In other countries where Agrihubs are active and Agriterra is present, Agriterra commits itself to basic information exchange and involvement of PO clients if there is a specific demand from the PO.

2011:
In several African countries Agriterra, in alliance with other members of AgriProFocus strives to develop farmer entrepreneurship through strengthening the role of producer organisations. 

AgriProFocus formalises the collaboration within a specific country through multi annual plans which are prepared in a participatory manner by involved APF members and their partners and clients. Agriterra commits itself through these multi annual plans to support the role of the network of AgriProFocus within that country. Involved parties are Producer Organisations, service providers, donor agencies and other civil society players. Together they will achieve tangible economic results at the level of the farmers through joint forces. 

Agriterra&apos;s involvement in these Agri Hubs will be to strengthen the role of the individual Producer Organisations. 

Services of Agriterra are:
1. in kind (time investment of individual liaison officers): total 25 advisory days. 
2. financial 
- advisory services of others like AgriPoolers and consultants or events
- for pooling funds to initiate innovative joint actions. 

Agriterra commits itself to support a maximum of 4 AgriHubs in 2011.  

Other involved APF members will contribute equally both financially and in advisory days.

2012:
Continuation of agrihub programme in Africa. This year APF wants to initiate at least 2 additional agrihubs: 1 in Tanzania and 1 in Burundi. potential exists to start agrihubs in South Sudan, Bangladesh and Indonesia. However this is not yet sure.

Agriterra support consists of the following:
1. in kind support of involved Liaison Officers and team manager @ 2 desk days per LO and 8 desk days for team manager of team 3.
2. financial support to 6 agrihubs (basket funds) @ Euro 10,000/agrihub.
3. kick off workshop support to Tanzania @ Euro 5000.
4. agripool support as required. Lumpsum Euro 5000.

2013:
APF has further defined its tasks within the Agrihubs. 

The focus of Agrihubs in 2013 are on the following activities:
1. coordination and network development
2. partnership and business brokering
3. Innovation communities in the field of a.o. access to land, markets, finance, inputs, policy environment and gender.
4. platform for learning and debate.

Results to be achieved are:
ad 1. A growing vibrant network of professionals and organizations who
exchange information and practical support and coordinate their learning
and development interventions around key issues for farmers entrepreneurship &amp; food security.
ad 2. The partnership is effective, increasing the number and quality of business between stakeholders (national and international).
ad 3. Development of APF innovation approach fostering cross linkages
with other APF countries and the wider APF innovation agenda. Further: 
Easy access to land by small agricultural entrepreneurs; Easy access to farm credit by small agricultural entrepreneurs. (Product Innovation of agricultural credit); Easy access to agricultural inputs by small
entrepreneurs to improve socio-economic conditions through increased crop yields; Easy access to agricultural markets for organised farmers; Better agricultural policy and performance of existing policies; The position of women in agricultural value chains is improved.
ad 4. Be a neutral and effective platform for debate, mutual learning and information exchange.

Outreach is 4910 members (through NING). Divided over the 6 hubs: 150 in DRC, 200 in Burundi, 500 in Rwanda, 600 in Benin, 1160 in Kenya and 2200 in Uganda.

2014:
In general:
Priorities across all Agri-Hubs in 2014, as defined in the country Annual Plans,
include:
- Strengthening local embedding and sustainability of the Agri-Hubs through local steering committees and contributions, as well as by establishing relevance and potential for developing Agri-Hubs into local associations.
- Growing Agri-Hub network membership in quantity and quality and deepening the relationship with representative networks of specific stakeholder groups notably the private agri-business sector (local and international companies, producer organisations and farmers).
- Cooperating with local Dutch Embassies on their Food Security Policy Framework and promotion of Dutch business linkages. For 2014, relationships with embassies in Tanzania, Indonesia and Zambia are to be deepened (besides the already good relations in other countries) resulting in joint action.
- Strategic linking to food security and entrepreneurship initiatives of international organisations and donors.
- Strengthening regional clusters of members in country to facilitate outreach to and expand membership of (organised) farmers and agri-businesses across the country.
- Increasing resource-sharing for activities by local members, as well as continued commitment of Dutch members. For 2014, we strive to have at least 3 local organisations substantially (between 25,000 and 50,000 Euro in total) contributing to the budget per country. Kenya, Uganda, and Tanzania are already moving towards that level.
- In-depth study into results from brokering services particularly with regard to farmfirm relations, farm-bank deals and new partnerships and investments.
