   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Development of a farmer-centred, self-sustaining extension service model for dairy development - a pilot</narrative>
  </title>
  <description>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">South-West Uganda has &quot;gold in its hands&quot; for commercial dairy production: excellent climate, large scale farms (1-15 milking cows, 8 - 15 acres and more), improved breeds, etc. However,production per cow and per farm are extremely low: less than 5 liters/cow/day due to free range grazing with no or poor management. 

Uganda is experiencing a fast growth in population and a significant increase in population can be expected in the coming years. This demographic fact requires the production of sufficient and affordable food and milk of improved quality, which is efficiently produced, stored and processed. There is a growing demand for dairy, chicken and beef and a large unexploited market potential. In order to benefit from these developments progresive farmers require access to information, expertise and knowledge on dairy production. However, extension services are often considered by farmers and cooperatives as a cost instead of a investment leading to low yields and a poorly developed dairy sector with multiple difficulties to seize the opportunity of increasing demand. Consequently livelihood of dairy farmers will not improve if little or nothing is done. 

The overarching goal of this project is the development of a financially and professionally self-sustaining, practical and easily to replicate approach of farmer-centered extension services. During this pilot phase from June &#x2013; December 2014 the project will target a selected group of 50 dedicated farmers (innovators) to become model farmers for 500 neighbouring smallholders (early adopters) as well as for the primary societies they belong to. With a team of 5 dairy farmer technical advisors the initial investment is relatively high, though in a time span of 2 years average production/cow is expected to double from 5 to 10 kg/day as well as outreach. The extension service project will be imbedded in the structures of 2 primary societies, both member of NDAFCU, one of the member organisations of UCCCU. 

50 demo farmers will receive intensive extension services. For monitoring the Farm Compass tool will be used. Each demo farmer is expected to organize 7 neighbouring farmers in a study circle for biweekly on-the-farm trainings and exchange. Main focus will be on the triple F: fodder, feed and farm management. 

If strong commitment of the farmers and organisations is clearly demonstrated during pilot phase the project will be extended to 2 more primary societies. 

Expected results
-	50 committed and dedicated demo farmers (innovators) selected and trained
-	70 farmers (early adopters) organized in 10 active study circles. 
-	Baseline farm data available, proven practices in record keeping at the farms
-	Total outreach (during pilot) of 120 farmers (of which &gt;30% female) applying improved techniques on 3F: fodder, feed and farm management. 
-	Well informed decision, underpinned and supported by facts and figures, on Go-No Go for continuation and expansion of project in 2015

- Scoping of ACE&#x2019;s in southwest Uganda among member organizations of UCA and Uganda Crane Creameries Cooperative Union (UCCCU). Analyze which current organizational practices in the ACE&#x2019;s need to be strengthened and identify which obstacles in terms of current low production levels are milk are most important and which can be strengthened via Agripool and extension services. Many ACE&#x2019;s are multi-purpose cooperatives and support various production groups e.g. coffee, these production groups can also benefit from a strengthened ACE. 
- Analyze the members of the ACE&#x2019;s and see how grass-roots entrepreneurship can be promoted.   
- Scoping of SACCOS that process milk money and have the potential/ambition to grow. 
- With results of the scopings as a starting point, formulate a program for supporting ACE&#x2019;s in their effort to provide extension services to farmers groups and increase milk production, fodder production, hygiene, cowsheds, access to veterinary services, artificial insemination, etc. To start with we seek to select ACE&#x2019;s in cooperation with UCA, Agriterra (Business advisor) and other parties e.g. Uganda Crane Creameries Cooperative Union (UCCCU) and Agribusiness Initiative (aBi) Trust.
- Advisory services planning via AgriPool, within the Dutch agriculture and agricultural sector is a lot of knowledge, knowledge that is useful cooperatives in Uganda. E.g. training of agricultural extension workers in general and in specific areas. 
&#x2013; Also South-South exchange with dairy cooperatives in Kenya can be part of this. 
- Service provision and monitoring of the progress in selected ACE&#x2019;s via UCA and Uganda Crane Creameries Cooperative Union (UCCCU).
