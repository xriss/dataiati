   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Learning trajectory on effective agricultural extension services</narrative>
  </title>
  <description>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Farmers cooperatives provide various services to their members, and this is also the request and need of members. However, to what extend are services effective and sustainable? What can we learn from best practises in order to support our clients better in setting up effective extension structures that will be financially sound and sustainable? In a learning trajectory initiated by KIT, Agriterra and various other organisations engaged in the agribusiness sector will actively contribute to  share experiences, explore best practises and identify the best strategies to overcome the current challenges as mentioned below. 
In their specific business formats the companies face important challenges in designing and implementing their extension or advisory services. Four challenges are common to many:
  
The challenge of the limited effectiveness of the extension and training work as evident by the lack of farmer response and adoption of new practices promoted.  
  How to put in place cost effective systems and mechanisms for mobilizing, communicating and analyzing key information back from farmers served, to learn and adapt company strategies where needed; including information on use of products, application of knowledge given, or technical changes as a result of this, e.g. in soil fertility, pest pressure.
  The sustainability of the extension type of services by the companies linked to the levels and ways for cost recovery of services provided.  
  Strategic positioning of the extension activities of the companies vis-&#xE0;-vis others. How to best focus use of limited available resource? Issues around cooperation and coordination of services with others for complementarity and synergies.

The objectives of the learning trajectory would be threefold:
  
Identify, assess and understand key challenges faced by agri-businesses in providing effective and sustainable agricultural advisory services;
  Generate concrete areas and operational strategies for the improvement of such agricultural advisory services.
  Make main insights and general findings available for the wider agricultural development community;

Identify, assess and understand key challenges faced by agri-businesses in providing effective and sustainable agricultural advisory services;
  Generate concrete areas and operational strategies for the improvement of such agricultural advisory services.
  Make main insights and general findings available for the wider agricultural development community;

Agriterra can specifically use this learning trajectory to :
- share best practises of farmer cooperatives
- improve its advisory services to support clients in making their extension services more effective and efficient, by developing one or several models and sharing the best practises (for example by improving its current product: workshop sustainable services )
