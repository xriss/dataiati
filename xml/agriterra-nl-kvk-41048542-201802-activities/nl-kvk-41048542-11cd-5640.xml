  <description>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">CKO has been supporting female and male farmers in 4 backward districts in Andhra Pradesh making use of a vast network of innovative and progressive middle class farmers, government officials, private sector and other professionals.

Focus of CKO during the period 2011-2013 is on
1) strengthening MAC (Mutual Aided Cooperative) societies into viable commercial centres that serve their members in input supply (fertiliser, pesticides, improved seeds etc) for their agriculture land. 2) provision of  Artificial Insemination for cattle and buffalos making use of barefoot veterinary workers. 3) alternative livelihood opportunities to rural women by providing training in the field of mushroom growing, sericulture and compost making and 4) improved fodder production by promoting high yield fodder to be grown on borders of agriculture land and leading to a higher milk production of local and improved dairy cattle.

In the coming 2 years the support from Agriterra to CKO in the field of supporting MAC societies and AI (artificial insemination) centres will come to an end. CKO may be supported in future in the field of innovative actions.
