   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This Project Proposal of the NFFM for the period 2011 is elaborated on the basis of the actual and previous situation of the Federation according to the economical, political and social context of the Republic of Moldova and also in line with the Strategic Plan of NFFM 2011-2015

Behind the analysis of the Federation&#x2019;s activity since the establishment of NFFM (1995) till now (2011) we can assign the followings:

NFFM has been distinguished for farmers and in the society as a non-governmental, apolitical and non profit organization, which is able to represent and to defend the rights and interests of his members.
NFFM had implemented a lot of projects in domain of technical assistance, which had enabled the Federation to develop an organising and institutional structure, which assures the transfer of information, acquaintances to farmers through technical assistance, trainings, schooling and  experience exchanges. On this way, the Federation has contributed to the realisation of the main goal: raising of the welfare of the people from rural zone through increasing of the incomes realised by farmer&#x2019;s households.

This Project Proposal of the NFFM for the period 2011 is elaborated on the basis of the actual and previous situation of the Federation according to economical, political and social context of the Republic of Moldova and also in the line with Strategic Plan of NFFM 2011-2015

The proposal is complementary to project 5632 (approved and financed by Agriterra for the year 2011). This project focusses on three groups of framers namely
-	fruit growers;
-	vegetables growers;
-	grapes growers.

One of the most important problems that farmers face is poor capacities to sell their production. NFFM will pay a lot of attention in order to create at least minimal conditions to facilitate access of farmers to local market and maybe to create some opportunities to export their production. At the moment the producers are mostly individuals so, they produce small quantities of production. From the moment when they cooperate and join their forces they will produce more, they will be more competitive on national market. Another reason is the fact that they will have good access to purchase agricultural inputs, in the same time the quality of production will increase because for them will be easier to use modern technologies and equipment in agriculture.  

This project proposal submitted to IFAD is complementary with the project submitted to Agriterra for 2011 &#x201C;Raising the competitiveness of farmer&apos;s agri-businesses through sustaining its cooperation and diversification of its businesses&#x201D; and the general objective of the project is a continuation of the Agriterra&#x2019;s project in this year. However this project proposal to IFAD is more specifical and focused on value chains development, creation  for the future producers groups in vegetables, fruits and grapes production. 

Main objectives are: 
1. Development of private sector through sustaining and promoting farmers in the initiation and development of their agri-businesses in rural area, commercialization and marketing capacities;
2. Lobby and advocacy initiatives to Central and Local Public Authorities and other interested actors in order to sustain and develop the project&#x2019;s activities;
3. Institutional and organizational development of NFFM in order to provide better services to its members 
	
The objectives and related activities of Agriterra&#x2019;s project and also the proposed activities from IFAD project are complementary and are designed to make easier the achievement of expected results.

1.Increasing the potential of provided advisory and technical services to farmers and applying contract farming;
2. Promotion and marketing of agricultural products of small and medium farmers (selected 3 groups of producers at national level);
3. Improving the capacity of small and medium farmers to have access to local or international markets through cooperation and adaptation to European quality standards;
4.  Facilitating of access to finance the farmers agribusinesses (groups of producers &#x2013; for us will be priority to work with groups of producers)


We propose to increase the access of small and medium farmers to local and international markets by following measures:



a. making the linkages between farmers &#x2013; processors &#x2013; traders and creating of contract farming system where will be involved all the mentioned actors of mentioned above value chains. In this way producers will have direct access to markets and will have the posibility to sell better their production as a result of making the contracts with traders or processors. This is an innovative activity for NFFM we will play the role of mediator and facilitate the contacts and signing the agreements between them and also will monitor the further cooperation;

b. Increasing the quality of their production through providing assistance and trainings in allignment to EU standards of quality which will make them more competitive on markets;

c. Promotion of their production to diverse exhibitions, fares and fests where they will have possibility to present their production in best way and to make contracts or partnerships with the interested factors;

d.To create for the future some of kind of easier way to access the financial resources (low interests credits, grants or loans) also to explore the possibility to create a financial institution oriented only for farmers in order to extend or develop their businesses, firstly for this year we propose to obtain subsidies from Government for the mentioned producers &#x2013; part of value chains, according our legislation in every year all farmers who have made some investments are enable to receive subsidies from Government, so during two years we submitted a lot of applications for our members.

e. Exploring the possibilities to design one feasibility study in finance market in Moldova. The meaning of this activity is to explore and find the ways how farmers can apply for reasonable access to financial resources &#x2013; bank credits, loans, grants or other.

working towards a more professional organisation that can advocate on behalf of its members and improve its service provision to its members.</narrative>
