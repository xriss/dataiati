  </title>
  <description>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The organisational strengthening of the Savings and Credit Unions Development in Laos (ACCU-SACUDIL) is a follow up of project 5052. The focus is on establishing a sustainable member led savings and credit union in Laos with the expertise of ACCU. A technical adviser, subsidised with funds from PSO-The Netherlands, will support SACUDIL in the field of organisational development.
The Core objective of this position is capacity building of involved agencies and participating associations in establishing necessary organizational structures and management and governance mechanisms.
It is expected that from mid 2012 onwards ACCU-SACUDIL is able to continue functioning without an external technical advisor.

Since its birth on 28 April 1971 to date, ACCU serves more than 16,000 credit unions with 20.5 million individual members in 26 countries in the region along with 17 affiliates promoting credit unionism in Asia. Membership to ACCU is open to national credit union leagues/federations or other national cooperative financial or similar organizations that follow international credit union operating principles and with membership of at least 20,000 individuals or one percent of the population of the country where the organization operates.

ACCU would like to to contribute to the development of a sustainable market-oriented rural financial system in Lao PDR to contribute to poverty reduction.
