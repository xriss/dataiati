   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Strengthening of membership development and  advocacy capacity of the South Sudanese Agricultural Producers Union</narrative>
  </title>
  <description>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The South Sudan Agricultural Producers Union (SSAPU) has been created in 2011 and operates at national level. At state, county and district (payam) level there is no presence of any umbrella organisations worth mentioning. At village (boma) level, a great variety of local groups exists, often with support from NGO&#x2019;s.  Although the farmers&#x2019; movement is progressing, there are a certain number of serious constraints that hamper their development. There is a low educational level of farmers and farming as a business is a totally new concept for them. As it can be expected internal governance practices within farmers&#x2019; organisations are still very weak. Services to (informal members) are not well defined yet. There is a clear need for support on the different levels.
The proposed Agriterra strategy consists of the following two main elements: 
a.	Supporting the national farmers&#x2019; organisation in its role (policy development, lobby and advocacy) and in the structuring and membership development of the farmers&#x2019; movement towards local level.  
b.	Supporting the grassroots&#x2019; level in an upwards dynamic towards the top. The support will focus on the payam level, as the first level after the boma level, on which farmers need to be organised. For a start this will be implemented through SSAPU, as there are no local farmers organisations with which Agriterra can have direct collaboration for the moment. It is important to start with existing dynamic groups of semi-commercial farmers.

Vision: The vision of SSAPU is to have prosperous and self-reliant South Sudan communities 

Mission:
-	To be a voice, lobby, dialogue, and advocate for SSAPU farmers and built their capacities. 
-	To be a well organised, coordinated and motivated union, efficiently managed serving SSAPU and farmers. 
-	To produce enough food crops for the eradication of poverty.
-	To promote of self-reliance and contribute to the economic development of the Republic of South Sudan. 
-	To increase organizational capacity of SSAPU and membership at all levels.

General objective: To increase farmers&#x2019; income through good organisation, effective lobby and improved agricultural production, processing and marketing of SSAPU members

Specific objectives of the present Action Plan 2013 &#x2013; 2014 are to:
1.	Create an conducive and enabling environment for economic activities by  the members;
2.	Increase farmers&#x2019; income from agriculture through capacity building in collective entrepreneurship and bottom-up organisation of members
3.	Construct the organisation at different levels, establish the national secretariat office and the grassroots&#x2019; entrepreneurship team, promote good leadership and governance

Membership development and communication
o	Setting up membership registry: design of membership registry using excel or access format&#xAC;; inputting information in registry 
o	Clear definition of membership by the leadership: who are the members, how to segment the members, and (for the companies) what is the clear linkage with farmers, how to e.g. ensure that farmers own the companies; how to ensure ownership by the members. Borrow examples from UNFFE; Agriterra support to SSAPU members.
o	Review of membership fees for the different segments of the membership. this will be done by the board as soon as possible 
o	Convening board meetings to validate the action plan for 2013. 
o	Developing a top-down, bottom-up and horizontal communication strategy: what are the information needs of the SSAPU members (different categories and levels); what content is needed by the SSAPU members; who are the target beneficiaries; 
o	Developing radio programs at different administrative levels: mobilization through the radio stations;
o	Local membership development through capacity building on rights and obligations, democratic principles, good governance practices of members and groups.
