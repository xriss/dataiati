   <narrative xml:lang="EN">MVIWAMBO is a dairy farmers group net-work formed of 17 Dairy farmer groups to enhance quantity and quality milk production and processing. Location of the organization is in Mbozi District south west of Tanzania.
The organization was registered on 12 the February 2004 with the ministry of Home affairs as an NGO or CBO (None Government organization/community Based Organization ) with Reg.No so.12344,and is the only Dairy farmer organization in the District. The members (Dairy farmers) Count 1.135 in number -in year 2010.
The main objective of the organization is to carry out all activities conductive to the promotion of development for increased milk production, processing, marketing and consumption ,and thus the economic well being of Dairy farmers and the community as a whole. 
The proposed project is to conduct training on dairy business activities. 
The implementations of the activities will be done partially by its members and or by hired experts under the organization supervision.

2012: RATIONALE/JUSTIFICATION OF THIS PROJECT
Mviwambo&#x2019;s main ambition is to realize a dairy plant owned by its members through shares. This factory will but all milk locally produced, processes it to high quality dairy products that will be sold at the local/regional markets, hence resulting in a better income for dairy farmers.
A group of Dutch farmers, all member of ZLTO, the Farmers Association of Southern Netherlands, have established Foundation Kuungana in 2009 by the members of a group of farmers from ZLTO. Mviwambo and the Dutch farmers from Kuungana established relationships since 2006.The farmers from Kuungana and Mviwambo have agreed to participate ( financially) in a new dairy processing plant in Vwawa. Both parties prepared a business plan for the farmers owned processing plant.

The project 11mvi-5704 (started in 2011) focuses on training and extension programmes to dairy farmers with the aim to improve the milk production in quality and quantity and includes institutional support to the management of Mviwambo and to be establishing factory. During the year 2011 the project was implemented by the staff and board members of Mviwambo.Although it is too early to assess the impact of this project, there is sufficient evidence of concrete positive results at the farmer&#x2019;s level and at the group level. Farmers are applying (part of the) newly acquired knowledge to cultivate fodder crops with as better milk, production per animal, farmers improve the stables of the animals, farmers prove additional nutrients to the animals. Record keeping and cooperative management issues are seriously addressed by Mviwambo since two years. 
Due to training and awareness, many groups have changed the leaders recently and groups seem to become more active. Systematic record keeping by groups/individuals is done but needs further improvement/follow up, especially with the eye on the future establishing a dairy processing plant owned by Mviwambo. This project proposal for 2012 is in fact a continuation of the 2011 project which was designed for 2 years.

PROJECT OBJECTIVES AND ACTIVITIES
In order to realize the dairy processing plant it is important to increase milk production, both in quality and quantity. At the same time, DFG management skills needs to be strengthened as farmers have to cooperate in for example milk collection. The following objectives need to be addresses in 2012.&amp;#8195;
Objective 1: Increase the milk production and milk quality
In collaboration with ULRC (UYOLE Livestock Research Center) and for sustainability, proposed the following activities will be carried out in three (3) years
&amp;#61656;	Establishment of improved pastures and forages (Rhodes grass, Desmodium, Napier grass and Multipurpose trees)
&amp;#61656;	Proper collection of crop residues for dry season feeding
&amp;#61656;	Harvesting and preventing/treatment of fodder for dry season feeding

Objective 2: Strengthen financial management in DFGs
Mviwambo will conduct leadership and financial management trainings at two selected centers which will accommodate a class of 32 participants at one time. This will result in total of 24 sessions with expected 64 participants representing all DFGs.

Objective 3: Facilitation in cross-learning and exchange
Mviwambo and Uyole LRC will conduct a cross-learning training of 60 dairy farmers to Mufindi and Njombe districts.

Objective 4: Enhance understanding on commitment of DFGs to the proposed dairy plant
Mviwambo will conduct open training meeting in each DFG which will accommodate a meeting of average of 64 participants at one time. This will result in total of 17 session with expected 1088 participants in all DFGs. (This meeting will include DFGs&#x2019; members and non-DFGs&#x2019; members who keep dairy cattle)
