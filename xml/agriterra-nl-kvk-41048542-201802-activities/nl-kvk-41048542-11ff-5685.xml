  <description>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">2011-2012:
2012 is the last year of financial support to FFA-AP. The partnership has continued since 2002 (10 years). FFA-AP is able to continue the programme without further support from Agriterra making use of facilities  of the government and linkages with private sector for its commodity programme. The women&apos;s wing will be managed independently from 2013 onwards. The support from Passage since 2007 has been detrimental in this. 

Activities in 2012 relate to 2 components: 
1. linking farmers to business and livelihood programme. This programme focuses on 5 commodities covering 7 districts of Andhra Pradesh. Farmers are trained in better agronomic practices and linked to the market/private sector through CIGs (commodity interest groups). 
2. A lobby component is included as well ensuring that the present food management system of the government will be overhauled. FFA-AP and CIFA (i.e. the national farmers organisation) work hand in hand on this aspect. Particular attention is given to paddy and sugarcane.

2. Strengthening the women&apos;s wing. This programme consists of two activities. 
1. The board of the women&apos;s wing will be strengthened. Existing federation structure will be strengthened from group to mandal to district to state level based on the three involved districts.
2. livelihood activities including a self managed micro finance scheme.

1.	To continue to form / convert around 4500 farmers into Commodity Interest Groups (CIGs) into the CIGs of paddy, sugarcane, vegetables, oil seeds, cotton, chillies, horticulture, pulses, livestock, and aquaculture in 7 operational districts in AP.

2.	With the CIGs of FFA ; the marketing activity will be continued not only with the existing crops but make attempts to take up some more new crops in new areas and make new partnerships with Industry.,

3.	The initiatives will include establishment of marketing intelligence network, linking FOs with processing industries through procurement and providing value addition. 

4.	The cooperation with ATMA and KVK are being continued and fresh MOUs were made in October 2010 for this financial year.  The pre and harvesting techniques will remain the focus of the dissemination. 

5. -	Paddy: Demand for the overhaul food management system and allow private trade to procure, store, distribute and introduce warehouse receipts system used by accredited warehouses to be taken as negotiable instruments and government to ensure minimum price for farmers; Sugarcane:  advocate for the release of working capital to Co-operative sugar factories in Andhra Pradesh, lobby with the state for justified State Advisory Prices.
