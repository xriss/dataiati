   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Addition 2015
In 2015, EAFF wants to pursue and make follow up on the budgetary process, the agribusiness climate index; do a leadership training;  create awareness on the new EAC co-operative societies act 2014; the Malabo declaration and make follow up on the OPPO course.
The budgetary analysis will provide policy considerations that EAFF and members can lobby for in their favor and especially on agricultural investments and on taxation. EAFF will use the FACT approach (FACT4Budget) for preparing policy papers and submission to the governments and to East African Community, the African Union Commission and the East African Legislative Assembly.

Addition 2014
The EAFF proposal 2014 shall focus mostly in tracking and reporting new investments in Agriculture for Eastern Africa that shall be caused directly or indirectly by the work of EAFF.
These investments are expected to be through processes related to CAADP- such as Grow Africa Initiative; bilateral discussions between the Easter Africa governments and development partners and private investors as well as efforts from EAFF to directly influence or access funds for Agriculture; the work shall also entail tracking budgetary process of selected EAFF members with a view of providing analysis and advice on budget implications to Agriculture. The information generated shall be packaged and circulated to EAFF members. We also expect that the budgetary analysis will provide policy considerations that EAFF and members can lobby for in their favor and especially on taxation. EAFF will use the FACT approach for preparing policy papers and submission to the governments and to East African Community, the African Union Commission and the East African Legislative Assembly.

Additional information 2013

EAFF is with the start of the new strategic plan 2012 shifting from visibility and building the credibility of EAFF towards a more service delivery oriented network. It was observed that the majority of the farmers&apos; organisations, members of EAFF, were heavily donor dependant. This ranges from 70 - 90 % dependance. This model thus meant that they were less accountable to the membership and over time this has led to less provision of services to members, low membership contributions, weak leadership and management as members didn&apos;t hold them accountable. EAFF sees the FO as a business model. This was the model which the EAFF members want to have effected; the models approach is that Farmer Organisations should be accountable to their membership by developing and delivering services that adress challenges faced by farmers. Good leadership and governance is key to succesfull and sustainable Farmer Organisations. It was agreed that the members promote lean secretariats and leadership structures / positions. The members observed that the forthcoming EAFF 3rd farmers Congress to be held in Bujumbura would provide an opportune occasion to put this message across to both membership, government and development partners.

As part of the new EAFF approach, EAFF intends to continue pursuing other early actions geared at promoting commercialisation and advocating for favorable policies. These include participating in the OPPO training (follow-up); making follow up on respective value chains at the national level as well as learning the FACT approach for advocacy. 

On Agriculture tax EAFF will proceed the work started in 2012 with a more comprehensive approach i.e. we move the national agri tax studies  into a bigger context of the agri-business climate index they will have a wider audience; more concrete and coherent proposals as well as synergies with EABC (East African Business Council) which has been working closely with EAC (East African Community) already.

EAFF had discussions with the EAC, the regional parliament and the EABC after they conducted the agri-tax studies and they advised EAFF to cap the study with one on the agribusiness climate index - then present a more comprehensive report to the EAC &amp; EALA (Regional parliament); EABC (East African Business Council) has been conducting similar studies but for manufacturing business and whenever they present their report it gets a lot of visibility both by media; regional and national governments as well as development partners supporting the EAC. EAFF has an MoU with EABC and they have shared the ToRs they have been using for their study and EAFF will adapt them for agriculture and then launch a joint process.

The study focusses on members, they are the key informants. The components the study will look at is at agricultural market failures. The idea is to look at whether the policies developed for agriculture are supportive of development of small holder agriculture enterprises for the region.

In 2013 EAFF will concentrate on:

- common understanding by the membership and relevant stakeholders of the new EAFF strategic framework orientation for sustainability through entrepreneurship by access to increased and focused funding enhanced.
- Capacities for Agribusiness; policy advocacy (FACT approach) and financial management along value chains enhanced;
- Policies for a favourable environment for increased investments in Agriculture advocated (f.e CAADP).
- Brokerage platforms for value chain actors dialogue promoted and strengthened
- Services demanded to empower membership delivered (SSAPU, South Sudan)
 

Additional information 2012

Following the end of the 2008 &#x2013; 2011 strategic plan, EAFF with support from Agriterra and other partners undertook a successful evaluation of the old plan and held a planning session for the new plan (February 2012).
The new strategic plan comprise four pillars:
-	Policy advocacy
-	Institutional development and sustainability (effective and efficient management)
-	Knowledge management
-	Agribusiness and Trade (value chains)

There will be a shift from the previous strategic plan which focused a lot on visibility and building the credibility of EAFF. Members requested that we build in mechanisms to ensure the financial sustainability of EAFF, that EAFF get involved in agribusiness initiatives due to the perceived failure of engaging traditional private sector, there be in-build networks around selected themes, developing a coaching and mentor ship program to support leadership development, embrace ICT and other relevant technologies , having a strategy to handle emerging issues e.g. climate change, biofuels etc. and continue to develop capacity to advocate through generation of evidence based policy research and proposals.

This change of thinking needs to be well managed, EAFF needs sensitize its staff and members to better understand the new strategic plan and this may necessitate the need to develop a theory of change in mindset of its members so that EAFF is seen to play a facilitator and catalytic role while the members have to understand their better role and especially how to evolve their respective commodities focus into viable enterprises. 

The members of EAFF need to vision their role in the various agriculture chains as key and major actors in them and they need to realize this potential and opportunity that presents itself to them, however they will need some interventions to make them realize and take advantage of this opportunity.

Agriterra supports EAFF with the implementation of the policy and advocacy agenda focused on programs of national governments and international organizations in order to bring the activities and economic benefits the benefits of such programs to the EAFF members.

Concerning the knowledge management component Agriterra support EAFF to roll out for representatives of their member organizations the course: Optimizing Performances of Producers&#x2019; Organizations. 


2011
The Eastern Africa farmers&#x2019; federation is a non-profit, non-political and a democratic farmers &#x2018;organization of farmers of Eastern Africa region. The formation of the organization was out of conviction and foresighted by founding leaders to address issues of interest to farmers at all levels i.e. national, regional, continental and at global level.
EAFF was launched in 2001 but registered in 2005. EAFF has a strategic plan (2008 - 2011) with eight pillars i.e. lobby and advocacy, capacity building, information and communication, partnerships and alliances, sustainability, membership, relations between EAFF and membership, crosscutting issues on Environment, gender, HIV and Aids.
The role of EAFF is to promote the interests of farmers on issues touching markets, productivity, capacity, information and regional integration as well as voice the legitimate farmers &#x2018;concerns and interest in socio-economic development through strengthening of individual country platforms, developing positions on regional issues, advocating on behalf of member organizations and enhancing regional cohesiveness. To this end EAFF has signed MoUs with a) Regional Economic Communities i.e. East Africa Community (EAC) (where they also have an observer status) and COMESA, b) regional private sector organizations/ East Africa Business Council (EABC), c) seat in boards of Regional Research Organizations i.e. FARA and ASARECA, d) seat in the FAO Committee on Food Security (CFS), e) have been admitted into the ILC membership, f) seat in the AGRA and AfDB partnership committee and board of Governors respectively

Addition 2014

Problem statement

a)  African Agriculture is drawing considerable attention globally but stakeholders especially farmers lack information on potential and actual investments being made in Agriculture through processes that they may directly or indirectly influence;
b) Farmers organizations lack the capacity to analyse annual national budgets with respect to Agriculture and especially the 10% agriculture budgetary allocations as guided by the CAADP process. They lack capacity to generate evidence-based policy proposals based on comparative analysis between budgets of more than one country and hence have a weak bargaining power.

Additional information 2013

The role of EAFF is to voice the legitimate farmers&#x2019; concerns and interests in socio-economic development through strengthening of individual country platforms, developing positions on regional issues, advocating for member organizations and enhancing regional cohesiveness. To this end we have signed MoUs with EAC  (we also have an observer status); COMESA  and IGAD . EAFF has signed MoUs with private sector organizations i.e. East Africa Business Council (EABC) and the East African Grain Council (EAGC) to assist us to engage better with the private sector. 
EAFF has also developed a new strategic framework (2012-2020) which has the following strategic goals :

- A dynamic Regional Platform for Advocacy for Policy Development, Implementation and Accountability
- Functional and Effective Knowledge Hub for Farmer Development
- Strengthening Farmers as Key actors in the Value Chains
- EAFF that is Vibrant, Self-Sustained, Effective and Efficient as an Organisation

Problem statement

- EAFF Members and EAFF development partners have not yet fully internalized the new EAFF strategic framework (2012-2020). The need to seek concerted efforts towards creating farmer entreprises through (lobby) increase funds from public and other international organisations that is geared towards this direction is important.
- In order to encourage enterprise development within EAFF members it is important that the capacity of relevant staff and leaders in the membership around commercialisation, value chain development and lobby and advocacy, is continuously built and follow up on action plans from the training are made. The two trainings OPPO and FACT are in line with EAFF strategic plan.
- According to studies conducted by EAFF on agricultural tax in 2012, it was evident that the biggest Non Tarif Barrier is taxation; in EAC no specific study has been conducted to evaluate the agricultural business climate index. This lack of a specific study may have contributed to the slow integration especially with respect to harmonization of Agriculture policies (e.g. agricultural tax: value added tax on inputs, land tax) and agricultural investments (via CAADP Comesa);
- Owing to the nature and status of Agriculture development in EAFF member countries; it is worth noting that some of the EAFF members are more advanced in terms of organisational and enterprise development than others. EAFF recognizes the need to promote sharing and learning through exchanges among its members as they do not have such a platform; it is also recognized there is need for specific technical support to enhance financial and management systems within the members secretariats as there have been considerable weakness in this area specially for the younger organisation e.g. South Sudan Agricultural Producers Union (SSAPU).

Goals/ results

Expected result area 1 (ER1): Common understanding by the membership and relevant stakeholders of the new EAFF strategic framework orientation for sustainability through entrepreneurship by acces to increased and focused funding enhanced.
Expected result area 2 (ER2): Knowledge management: Capacities for Agribusiness, policy advocacy and financial management along value chains enhanced;

Introduction

The role of EAFF is to voice the legitimate farmers&#x2019; concerns and interests in socio-economic development through strengthening of individual country platforms, developing positions on regional issues, advocating for member organizations and enhancing regional cohesiveness. To this end we have signed MoUs with EAC (we also have an observer status) and COMESA; we seat in the FAO Committee on Food Security (CFS) and the farmers through PAFO  seat in the GAFSP  committee that reviews post-CAADP  country proposals on agriculture investments. EAFF is currently involved in consultations on developing a regional CAADP compact that will lay out proposals for agriculture investment priorities at the regional level. This positions EAFF strategically to influence both government and private sector in the region and globally to support farmers; however it poses a challenge in building credible cases and arguments on food security.
Following the end of our 2008-2011 strategic plan, EAFF with support from Agriterra and others partners undertook a successful evaluation of the old plan and held a planning session for the new plan. The new plan &#x2013; 2012-2020  comprise of four (4) pillars i.e.
i)	Institutional development and sustainability (effective and efficient management)
ii)	Knowledge Management (hub)
iii)	Agribusiness and Trade (value chains)
iv)	Policy advocacy

Problem statement
The new plan will change the landscape of how EAFF operates as there shall be more emphasis on economic service delivery and entrepreneurship as a major axis while the other three pillars will work at supporting this axis; this means that all members need to be sensitized on the plan to properly understand it as well as their roles and responsibilities. 
Of the already organized commodities, intra and inter regional trade is still a major nightmare as a result of numerous Non tariff barriers (NTBs), this effect of NTBs is actually already being addressed by other organizations and is part of the discussion by trade committees at national and regional trade, there is however lack of information especially on agriculture tax and the regimes applied. In a pilot study done on the Kenya-Uganda trade corridor by EAFF it was evident that there was varied application of taxation on agriculture commodities in both countries by the respective governments. This variation in application creates uncertainty in the market and any costs borne in this process are passed on to the consumer, it was however not possible to properly identify the legal provisions provided for in agriculture tax, this study also needed to be scaled out to other countries to understand the agriculture tax structure and its application. Agriculture tax can be used as a trade barrier especially if the farmers are unaware of their rights as well as the law. The advocacy on agriculture tax will greatly synergize other work that EAFF is pursuing on agriculture budgets in this region. Any change in the administration of agriculture tax emanating from influence by EAFF shall lead to improved agri-trade flows at national and by extension the regional level.
In the new strategic plan, it was mentioned that there is need to strategize on emerging issues as well plan for follow up on current issues in Agriculture. There have been many initiatives at the regional level that are geared towards supporting agriculture and EAFF is in a position to influence them. Almost all initiatives are responding to emerging challenges in Agriculture e.g. rural finance, climate change, food security etc. So far EAFF has opened up dialogue with regional institutions and would want to continue pursuing these engagements with time as follows.

Eastern Africa Farmers Federation (E.A.F.F.)
STRENGTHENING ORGANIZATIONAL CAPACITY FARMERS&#x2019; ORGANIZATIONS IN EASTERN AFRICA IN THEIR NEW PHASE
Project abstract - 2011

1.	Introduction
The Eastern Africa Farmers Federation is a non-profit, non-political and a democratic farmers&#x2019; organization of farmers of Eastern Africa region. The formation of the organization was out of the conviction and foresighted by the founding leaders to address issues of interest to farmers at all levels i.e. National, regional, continental and at global level. Currently the membership is in nine (9) countries i.e. Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, Rwanda, Burundi, Ethiopia, Eritrea, DRCongo (Kivu region) and Djibouti. EAFF has already profiled the Sudan and is awaiting results of their referendum to chart its next course of action. 
Following good working relations with Agrittera, EAFF has managed to receive secretariat, governance and technical support over the years. Today, the Eastern African Farmers Federation (EAFF) network of farmers&#x2019; organizations has a membership of over 20 million active farmers and its role is to voice legitimate concerns and interests of farmers of the region with the aim of enhancing regional cohesiveness and improving the socio-economic status of farmers has been entrenched.  
In its next phase (2012+) of a new strategic plan dispensation; EAFF endeavors to promote the regional integration of farmers notably through trade as well as representation of farmers at the regional and international level. This will be in line with the new focus for Agriterra which is -
a)	Supporting farmer led enterprises
b)	Economic initiatives at local level
c)	Advocacy and Innovation 

2.	Problem statement
For EAFF to move to its next phase (2012+), it needs to develop a new strategic plan that is
&#x2022;	In line with its EAFF members aspirations and building on their national strategic plans 
&#x2022;	Based on performance of the current strategic plan
&#x2022;	Positions EAFF more strategically with the on-going developments at regional level especially to do with regional integration and commodity development
&#x2022;	Geared towards sustainability of the organization.
&#x2022;	That benefits from input by our partners
The current strategic plan (2008-2011) was very ambitious and broad, the intention of which was to popularize and make visible the organization to members, partners and governments and broadly capture issues of importance to the farming community, all of which has been achieved; the next plan should focus on fewer pillars that will strengthen the organization in its endeavour to achieve its vision and mission. Core governance functions shall be partly supported as EAFF transits into a new plan. This is important especially for the current and subsequent leadership to own the process and contribute to the direction and future of the organization. EAFF has developed some financial reporting formats for use in project activities that ease inputting into the overal financial management tool that we are using &#x2013; TOMPRO- this has been a good experience however despite numerous challenges that we have now streamlined. To ensure that this capacity is sustained and improved, we shall be seeking to improve on these manuals on financial, procurement and audits to be in line with the new strategic focus. The value chains approach has attracted several financial institutions that want to support different aspects and levels of value chains e.g. ware housing, value addition; already EAFF has had initial entry discussions with the East African Development Bank (EADB) and other financiers on value chain financing. EAFF members have also recently been trained with support from FAO on value chain management. We however lack the capacity to pursue such opportunities at national and regional level due to low understanding of value chain financing models including developing appropriate models - and this could have a bearing on how our memberships go-about their agri-business undertakings. 
On membership, The Sudan has just finalized their referendum and results indicate a possibility of cessation and even membership to EAC. This is the last country that EAFF will enlist membership from. The country has a huge potential economically as its rich with natural resources such as land and water. They have also finalized their agriculture policy paper in 2010 (EAFF participated) that shall become law in the new republic. To this end, there is an on-going seed policy harmonization process at EAC supported by ASARECA/USAiD that includes the Sudan. Some of EAFFs major partners also have projects and programs in Sudan as its part of their coverage e.g. COMESA (we have an MoU with, and we chair ACTESA- an agency of COMESA) and ASARECA (we seat in their board); which is a sub-regional research organization covering East and Central Africa. Thus any programs we develop in Southern Sudan shall benefit from synergies by our other partners. We have done profiling of the country and have identified organizations and institutions we can work with. In 2011, EAFF plans to undertake a mission for membership in the southern Sudan by holding sensitization workshops there as well as pursue trade and partnership opportunities for its members.
Finally, for the secretariat to function the role of the CEO shall be supported; however due to budget restrictions Agriterra shall only contribute a portion of this support in salary and related emoluments. Agrittera shall also contribute to administration costs including equipment to support his work; his facilitation to undertake related functions (such as lobby or consultative meetings) and space to work from.

Expected result area 2 (ER2): Implement governance obligations including new membership recruitment (Sudan)
Expected result area 3 (ER3): Develop a new strategic plan (2012+) that is participatory and inclusive taking into account commodity value chain development.

5.	Purpose 
To entrench the position EAFF as the voice of farmers of Eastern Africa and as a credible, focused, professionally managed and sustainable organization; all leading to a cohesive and prosperous farming community 

6. 	Activities
&#x2022;	Activities related to ER1
-	A1: Develop an appropriate (and improve on our) financial management; audit and procurement procedures and manuals
&#x2022;	Activities related to ER2

Activities related to ER 3
-	A4: contribute to an evaluation of the performance of EAFF for the period 2008- ending 2010
-	A6: contribute to a strategic planning process for the period 2012-

Description of Activities related to ER1 -ER 4
&#x2022;	A1: EAFF has existing manuals on financial management and procurement; however the evaluation on the strategic planning processes recommended a review of these documents. We believe this is an appropriate time owing to visibility of EAFF, increased interest of different partners and that we are getting into a new strategic plan dispensation process
&#x2022;	A2: The board and the annual general meetings shall be held on rotational basis in member countries as provided for in the constitution of EAFF. These meetings basically evaluate the performance of EAFF, we plan to hold three board meetings with support of one board meeting by Agrittera. The audits shall also be supported and will be presented during the first meeting of the council (AGM)
&#x2022;	A3: Southern Sudan is an important new country for EAFF. Already EAFF has been involved in various consultations with government officials and private sector of Sudan. We shall hold 2 workshops in two major provinces and then a courtesy call to the Ministry of Agriculture and foreign affairs (incharge of regional matters) to include some NGOs identified in the profiling report of Sudan. 
&#x2022;	A4: It is important to measure the success of implementing the current strategic plan; it shall also collate the views of members of EAFF, partners and governments especially on what EAFF should focus on in the future
&#x2022;	A5: this will be the ultimate step where we shall put together the plan with support from our members and partners 

7	Sustainability
&#x2022;	The new focus of Agriterra will compliment the thoughts EAFF already had on the subject.
