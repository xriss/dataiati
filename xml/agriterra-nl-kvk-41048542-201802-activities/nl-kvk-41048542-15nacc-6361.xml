   <narrative xml:lang="EN">provide immediate/emergency  response  for the earthquake affected members of NACCFL</narrative>
  </title>
  <description>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">On April 25, 2015 at 11: 56 AM, Nepal was shocked by powerful earthquake with magnitude of 7.9 Richter scale, affecting the central part of the country mostly. The impact is huge in 14 districts of te country as well as in the capital city. Agriterra and its constituency decided that such a natural disaster can not be neglected as it is has a major impact upon the people&apos;s  lifes. Among the NACCFL members, about 700 persons died; 87% of all rural families lost their house, or have serious damaged houses; several lost their livestock, animal sheds, seeds etc. After receiving the first relief support, the first priority for people is to rebuild their houses. After that it is important that people pick up/continue their agricultural business as this is their main income and food source.
 
NACCFL is receiving huge demand on for the emergency response from its member&#x2019;s cooperative for earthquake victims. The need is shelter, primary health services and income generating activities. 

Agriterra knows that the farmers organisation are in a very good position to provide relief/reconstruction support, having an extensive network reaching out to the most remote areas of the country. 

The Nepal Agriculture Co-operative Central Federation Ltd. (NACCF) is the umbrella organization of Small Farmer Agro Cooperative Limited (SFACL) . SFACL are agricultural micro-finance cooperatives, which are fully owned and managed by the local community. They have their origin in the Small Farmers Development Program (SFDP), which has been implemented by the Agricultural Development Bank Ltd. (ADBL) since 1975. It is specifically designed for small and marginal farmers. AT present 611 SFACL in 68 districts are member of NACCFL, representing 615.000 individual members. 

SFACLs face different  problems, such as gaining access to markets, acquiring new technical and management skills, obtaining loan and credit services, etc. Subsequently, they decided to fight poverty by federating their cooperatives into a strong network. 

NACCFL mission is to provide appropriate non-financial services to the member organization for their institutional development and for the socio-economic development of the small farmers.

NACCFL was requested by Agriterra to submit a proposal focusing on reconstruction of agricultural activities in few of the most affected areas where they trust the capacity of the District Agricultural Federation. 

Strongly affected districts Dhading and Makwanpur will receive relief and reconstruction support directly from Agriterra for those SFACL that Agriterra has been working with the last 2-3 years (see also projects 6362 and 6363) . The other SFACL in these two districts will receive relief and reconstruction support through NACCFL, as the capacity of the District Agricultural Federation is not enough to support all SFACL.

In addition, NACCFl proposes to support 3 SFACL in Rasuwa district and two SFACL in Nuwakot district,  not far from each other (cluster) at about two hours drive from Kathmandu.

In total 21 SFACL (primary cooperatives) will benefit from the support.

95 percent member SFACLs in the highly affected districts lost their house and now they are residing in either tent or temporary shelter. In addition to that, domestic animal also died as the communities were fully depended to livestock and its product for their livelihood. The program will be implemented through members SFACL of NACCFL. 95 % of member is earthquake affected members among them 82 % are female members.  In this program, 8186 members that is 52% of the affected members of proposed district will be benefited.

In one hand they lost their house, in another hand they do not have alternatives for income generating activities. To carry out the agricultural activities as per agro calendar in some of the farmers nether they have Ox for plough the land as Ox were also died nor they have seeds.

In the five proposed VDCs of Nuwakot and Rasuwa districts, the earthquake has destroyed/hampered all the sources of livelihood and other economic activities. Members were engaged in agriculture, poultry and livestock activities. These were primary sources of income for them to contribute to family expenses.  

The SFACL is selected on the basis of following criteria:
a.	Highly affected SFACL
b.	VDCs mentioned in Dhading and Makwanpur districts are not included in the relief program of   District Agricultural Cooperative Federation (DAF ) of Dhading and Makwanpur.
c.	Remote SFACL
d.	Majority of people are disadvantage group
e.	Highly depended on agriculture sector
f.	Lost both cattle and  house
g.	Majority of the members are female.


Proposed activities are:
-Distribution of rice and wheat seeds
-Distribution of plants and seedlings for horticulture
-Distribution of goats and piglets
-Construction of livestock sheds

The support will be equaly distributed among teh 21 coopertiaves. 

NACCFL is the final responisible organisation for the administration and monitoring of the support program. As much responsibility as possible will be delegated to the district Federation and the primary coops. 

Total budget requested to Agriterra is 40,000 Euro. 
Own contribution of NACCFL is: 14.587 Euro

Total budget: 54.587 Euro

Total number of beneficiaries: 780 members of NACCFL benefitting an estimated 11.580 people.

to provide immediate/emergency response for the earthquake effected members of 21 Small Farmer Agriculture Cooperative Limited (SFACL) of 4 districts within  NACCFL network.&quot;.</narrative>
