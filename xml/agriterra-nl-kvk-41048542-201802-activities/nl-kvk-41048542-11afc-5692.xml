   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Action plan 2011: Towards a farmer owned oilseed semi - refinery plant</narrative>
  </title>
  <description>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Agriterra supported ADMAS (Wolkite) Farmers Cooperative Union in 2010 together with SNV and FORMIN Finland on training 600 farmers with the objective of increasing oilseed production quantities and quality (project 09afc-5527). AFCU presented that project to Agriterra in the framework of its business aspirations to establish an oilseed refinery plant. A draft of the business plan for this plant was shared with Agriterra and the contents and potential of the plan provided Agriterra with sufficient reasons to organise a company assessment to AFCU in March 2011. 

During this mission both the management capacity and the potential business plan were analysed and gaps were identified. Overcoming these gaps requires technical expertise and finance and therefore an action plan has been developed for 2011 which will serve as a roadmap for AFCU to develop a bankable and realistic business plan for the oilseed refinery plant. 

Targets 2011
The targets of this plan are as follows:
- AFCU will improve its financial management according to the recommendations that were made as part of the company assessment mission.
- AFCU will increase its support base which becomes visible in an increase in share capital by 15%.
- AFCU will contract and train its production coordinator. 
- 50 trainers will be trained to improve production and supply of oilseeds.
- 1.200 farmers will be trained. 
- 225 best performing farmers will produce selected seeds of Niger, lin and sesame. This production will be sold back to AFCU for distribution for further distribution. 
- 1.800 farmers will produce at least 540 tons of oilseeds that will be bought by AFCU against a premium price (partly financed by own capital and partly by a loan from a commercial bank).
- The primary societies will ensure quality standards.
- AFCU will either store this produce for processing by the refinery plant, or in case the construction of the plant delays AFCU will find market for the seeds and sell for a better price than was paid to the farmers.
- AFCU will contract a marketing officer and with the help of external experts they will develop marketing plans for domestic and export markets for seeds and refined oil.
- AFCU will contract mechanical, electrical, hydraulic and civil engineers for the actual drawings and design of the plant and the sourcing of the machinery and equipments required.
- AFCU will acquire the land for the plant from the local government.

Targets 2012
- 7 Union board members trained on business management.
- 210 Board members (PCS) are trained about the business idea: new semi-refinery, market strategy and their role/responsibility.

- Membership increase from 62 to 70 primary cooperatives.
- Increase in share capital by 15%.

- 4 Quintals produced by 53 farmers using 1/4 hectare each.
- 100 quintals bought by the union  as credit return.
- 10 farmers 5 locations each farmer 1/4 of a hector with four plots.
- 3187 farmers of 62 PCS produce 0,5 hectare each resulting in 1594. hectares times 6 quintals is 11,158 quintals of production (1115.8 tons).
- 11,158 quintals purchased for 11,158,000 birr (1000 birr per quintal), 11,158,000 advance payment of which 2.750.000 financed by AFCU,8,408,000 on credit.
