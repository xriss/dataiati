Project Background  
Ghana is pursuing efforts to modernize the agricultural sector as agriculture is a vital contributor to economic growth, food security and poverty reduction. The role of Farmer Based Organizations such as Farmers Organization Network in Ghana (FONG) to contribute to the realization of the above cannot be over emphasized. It is worth mentioning that, FONG can achieve its mission if the following challenges are addressed through financial support: inadequate logistics, transportation and office supplies, capacity building for members, absence of strategic plan for (2012 onwards) among others. 

Project Rationale
Farmers organization Network has a national secretariat coordinating the activities of the network. However, in order for FONG to be effective at the grassroots, there should be improved communication between the national secretariat and zonal offices. For an effective running of the zonal offices, utilities, equipment need to be procured in addition to the payment of allowances of the zonal Co-ordinators and administrative assistant. 
Capacity building for farmers in relevant areas of their businesses is critical for their business growth of which it is usually achieved through trainings, foras, conferences, seminars and study tours. 
Farmers Organization Network in Ghana developed a three year strategic plan (2009-2011) which expires this year hence, the need for the development of another 5year strategic plan of action. 
For effective implementation and timely achievement of planned activities, monitoring and evaluation of the activities of FONG is very essential as it provides the information base to track the progress during project implementation for timely removal of constraints and delays. Executive council and committee meeting also needs to be organized quarterly to provide opportunity to assess status of planned activities and to discuss pertinent issues regarding the development of the organization.
Within FONG, women constitute about 70% of the total membership. In promoting gender parity within the organization where women have a voice in decisions affecting them, the Women&#x2019;s College was established to ensure a fair representation on all decision making bodies especially at the highest level. The Women&#x2019;s College would fulfill its mandate only when it is strengthened and members empowered.
Finally, Ghana has established a platform of which Farmers Organization Network in Ghana is playing a leading role, hence the need for regular platform executive meetings to deliberate on issues to strengthen the infant organization.
