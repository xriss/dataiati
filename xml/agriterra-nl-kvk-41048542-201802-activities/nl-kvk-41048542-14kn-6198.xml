  <description>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In addition to the 2011-2014 Enhancement of Farmer Entrepreunership for Development (EFED)-project, Agriterra and KENAFF took the initiative mid-2014 to collaborate in a separate project to strengthen and improve the KENAFF PMEL system. This trajectory starts with an advisory service of a local consultant in order to have a clear picture and analysis of the current situation and the necessary steps to reach the desired situation. The subsequent paragraphs first describe the overall trajectory briefly where after the advisory service is specified. 

Background PMEL strengthening trajectory
The main vision of KENAFF PMEL is to have an effective PMEL System that efficiently informs on decisions concerning strategic program and project intervention progress of the federation. According to KENAFF the purposes of PMEL are the following: 

&#x2022; To guide the collection, analysis and use of evidence-based monitoring information to inform management in an effort to improve project planning, implementation and learning.
&#x2022; To guide capacity building initiatives in PMEL, and foster a culture of governance and decision making which embraces the value of effective and efficient organisation based PMEL.
&#x2022; To support institutional reporting and knowledge management processes.

Objectives PMEL strengthening trajectory 
KENAFF is aware of the fact that the organisation faces challenges to meet the above mentioned purposes of PMEL . The main overall objectives of this capacity building trajectory therefore are to  strengthen KENAFF&#x2019;s PMEL capacity and system through, (i) Enhancing the federation&#x2019;s capacity to effectively plan and implement its program and projects and (ii) Enhancing the capacity of the federation&#x2019;s staff and members (farmer groups) to monitor, report and learn from its programs and projects.

The overall objectives are translated into the specific objectives as follows:

a. To improve the process of Program/Project Planning at KENAFF by ensuring that  necessary PMEL considerations are incorporated at all levels (make it as participatory as possible to ensure ownership). 
b. To revise  all program/project level objectives and  indicators to ensure that they fit/contribute to the organizational level objectives.
c. To revise (and develop new) data collection plans and tools that will provide necessary data/information for effective program/project monitoring and reporting (For enhanced reporting and learning mechanisms).
d. To undertake overall PMEL capacity building of KENAFF Implementing Partners, Program Officers, PMEL staff (At all levels) and of course farmer members/producer groups.
e. To establish feedback mechanisms to enhance learning and sharing among all stakeholders.

Activities 
To be able to meet the specific objectives mentioned a detailed and clear insight is needed into the Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Treats of the PMEL-system of KENAFF. First activity in the trajectory is therefore an advisory mission on PMEL to have a profound problem analysis. Based upon the outcomes of the problem and SWOT-analyses an action plan on improvement can be designed. After mutual agreement on the action plan, a budget will be allocated accordingly for the remaining period of the year 2014.

KENAFF and Agriterra collabore to implement a project aimed at strenghtening the Planning, Monitoring, Evaluation and Learning system, process and capacity of KENAFF.

After mutual agreement on the action plan, a budget will be allocated accordingly for the remaining period of the year 2014.  

One of the outcomes of this mission is a realistic and detailed action plan for the remaining activities to strenghten KENAFF at PMEL. Based on this action plan a budget will be specified and allocated.

Budget (in EUR) available from Support &amp; Quality department from July 2014-December 2014: 
&#x2022; Local costs: 15,000 
&#x2022; Mission/support (local) expert: 6,000
&#x2022; Mission liaison officer / M&amp;E officer: 6,000
&#x2022; Desk liaison officer / M&amp;E officer: 2,000

Total budget available in EUR 29,000.

 d. To undertake overall PMEL capacity building of KENAFF Implementing Partners, Program Officers, PMEL staff (At all levels) and of course farmer members/producer groups.
 e. To establish feedback mechanisms to enhance learning and sharing among all stakeholders.

Objectives advisory services
(1)	A profound problem analysis of current PMEL system and process; 
(2)	Including a clear picture of cause-effect of the challenges faced;
(3)	A clear analysis of the required data, i.e. revision/definition of indicators linked to strategic plan ;
(4)	Advisory services on a required system to aggregate and analyse collected data;
(5)	Advisory services on the required activities to strengthen the PMEL system of KENAFF which are translated into a concrete and realistic action plan for the remaining period of the year 2014. 

Notes: 
A. Advices and action plan are based upon and guided by the principles of efficiency, effectiveness, sustainability and ownership. 
B. Advices and action plan are based upon a bottom up and participatory approach where all levels are represented including the farmer members/producer groups. 

After delivery of the report, Agriterra and Kenaff will further discuss the advisory services and action plan. Based on the outcomes of the mission and the discussion afterwards, the possibilities to allocate budget are decided upon.</narrative>
