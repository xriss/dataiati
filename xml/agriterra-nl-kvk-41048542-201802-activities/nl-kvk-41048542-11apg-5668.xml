   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Project Description

The Apex Farmers Organization of Ghana was formed as a national farmer based organization to cluster the farmer front and bring all farmer organizations under one umbrella. Our activities have focused on lobby and advocacy on behalf our member organizations and capacity building in the form of institutional strengthening to enable them provide better services to their members. Since APFOG&#x2019;s formation, we have engaged mostly farmer leaders of the member organizations and empowered them to provide direct service to the grassroots farmers in their respective associations. Because farmers generally get support directly from the local association, APFOG is not seen as performing its mandate even though APFOG works through the local associations. Hence, there seems to be an apathy emerging from the farmers at the grassroots.

APFOG has therefore integrated into its activities, an Agribusiness Program, starting from the year 2011 onwards, to reach the grassroots farmer directly. This will be done in collaboration with the local associations to avoid duplication of efforts.  One of such initiatives is to set up a mechanization centre in the Northern region of Ghana where agriculture remains the predominant sector with over 90% of the productive age group being smallholder farmers. Mechanized agriculture is highly a prerequisite to cultivation in the northern sector of Ghana. The mechanization centre will provide tractor services to its members at subsidized fee while other farmers will bear full cost. Often smallholder farmers are unable to make full payment for these services hence APFOG will take a specified number of bags of produce agreed by both parties under a signed contract. APFOG will also provide harvesting services for farmers using simple harvesting equipment purchased under the project. Farmers will be linked to markets and processing groups to enable them sell produce on time. APFOG has already conducted a needs assessment of our farmers in the northern region and has access to land to site the mechanization centre. 

Access to markets has also been a major challenge especially farmers in remote areas. Often, farmers sell produce at low prices under distress and therefore lose substantial amounts of profits to traders. Poor road network to enhance carting of produce to market centres; lack of market information; weak marketing skills of farmers are some of the reasons why farmers are unable to access market on time and at required prices. Mfarms is an ICT platform newly established by IFDC to aggregate produce and market information to update actors in the value chain using the mobile phone. APFOG therefore will train its members in the use of platform to access input and market information from other actors. Through the MFarms platform, members can access information on the prices of agri-inputs and the quantities they need. The output market will be improved through information dissemination to traders and storage operators about expected yield (tonnage). Other aggregators will get informed about the production intentions of farmers and prepare adequately to meet supply. Staff will also be included in training to enhance their professional capacities.

Our activities will be sensitive to the peculiar needs of women members of the APFOG. Many women are involved in the production of farming and processing in the northern regions of Ghana. In fact most processing groups have women as the majority. These women however may not have equal access to the same resources and support as their male colleagues. Coupled with their regular role as farmers, women perform many of the household tasks for their families. This disparity in access to resources and support usually result in marked differences in the yields and profit margins of male and female members of the same group. This gender sensitive approach has the potential to promote and enhance women&#x2019;s role in agriculture by increasing their decision making capacities and ability to participate in agricultural activities and programmes through leadership.

APFOG is therefore seeking support from Agriterra to enable us start operating the mechanization centre and other activities mentioned. While contributing to improving food security, APFOG will be providing grassroots economic services to its members and individual farmers.  

Objectives
i.	Set up mechanization centre in the Northern region of Ghana to provide tractor services to members and other farmers including harvesting services
ii.	Improve members&#x2019; access to markets through ICT platforms
iii.	Strengthen membership base particularly at the grassroots
iv.	Empower women groups to enhance participation of women in the decision making process

Sustainability of Project
APFOG is well endowed with qualified human resources to man the project. The project activities will be coordinated by the National secretariat in Accra. APFOG will recruit a northern project officer who will assist the president who is currently stationed in the northern region, to manage the entire mechanization centre.  Revenue generated from the mechanization centre will be ploughed back to expand the operations of the centre. Increased membership is expected to improve the revenue of the association to continue providing services to members. 
Expected results
1.	Improved farmer access to mechanization services
2.	Increased area under cultivation for major crops  
3.	Increased revenue base of APFOG
4.	A strengthened and visible APFOG at the grassroots
5.	Professional competence of staff enhanced
6.	Enlightened and well informed membership
7.	Improved market access by members


Activities
1.	Embark on membership drive in target areas and introduce the mechanization services program
2.	Purchase two tractors and implements and promote the mechanization centre among members
3.	Organize women in leadership training for women members
4.	Organize an Annual General Meeting and association meetings targeting the grassroots
5.	Equip members with ICT Training for Market Access

Measurable Indicators
1.	Increase revenue base of APFOG by 30%
2.	Increase current membership in the Northern sector by 40%
3.	Nearly 500 members able to access market in the Northern region 
4.	Women participation in all APFOG activities improve by 50%
5.	Approximately 1,000 farmers have access to tractor services in the north.
6.	Increase in area under cultivation of members in the north by 5Ha
