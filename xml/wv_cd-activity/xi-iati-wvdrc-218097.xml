 PROJECT OBJECTIVES 
 This project is planned to meet immediate food and nutrition needs of 150,000 vulnerable people (34,934 men, 38549 women, 36,058 boys and 40,459 girls), who are new IDPs, new returnees and host communities in the territories of Beni, Lubero, Walikale, Masisi, Rutshuru and Nyiragongo in North Kivu Province. The project will be for a 5-month period from 26 July 2021 to 31 December 2021). Emergency unconditional food assistance will be provided to eligible new IDPs, new returnees and other vulnerable groups including victims of volcanic eruption for a maximum of 3 months for each selected beneficiary. This will be a response to alerts on new IDPs, new returnees and host families to support them in critical times of food insecurity while they establish their livelihoods. It is anticipated that WV will distribute to a batch of 40,040 beneficiaries for 3 months. After that period lapses a new group of beneficiaries will be targeted (as guided by the alerts from UNOCHA and GTRR) for another 3 months until the caseload of 160,160 is absorbed. Due to the nature of gradual movement of the population, it is envisaged that assistance to the entire 160,160 beneficiaries will take place in batches. Monthly distributions of dry rations (cereal, pulses, oil and salt) will be provided to the targeted beneficiaries.
