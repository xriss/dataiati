Although operating at margional levels during the war, the Company has been and continues to work with the international donor community and private sector multinationals to ensure that all regions of the Federation Entity of Bosnia and Herzegovina are supplied with the necessary pharmaceutical products.  The project includes reconstruction of a plant destroyed druing the war and modernization of facilities and equipment to re-start manufacturing of solid oral drugs.  Domestic manufacturing of solid oral drugs will not only provide the country with a capability that existed before the war, but it will also save much-needed hard currency reserves through import substitution.  In addition, the project will enable redeployment of a part of Bosnalijeks work force that is currently unemployed.

The project will be implemented at existing facilities, where there are no rivers or streams in the immediate vicinity, and implementation will not result in resettlement or alteration of natural or cultural resources.  Air emissoins will be controlled through installation of filters, while industrial solid wastes will be stored in containers that are properly disposed on an annual basis; and liquid wastes after treatment will be discharged into the municipal collection system.  Bosnalijek has formed an Environmental Department that will be responsible for fire prevention system and emergency response program, and worker health and safety programs.
