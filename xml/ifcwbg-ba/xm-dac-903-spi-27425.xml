   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In this project, IFC will be supporting a successful commercially oriented microfinance company in its mission to provide access to finance for the Bosnian micro entrepreneurs in the rural areas. Specifically, through this investment there will be a significant direct contribution to poverty reduction  as the loan is expected to reach an estimated 5,000 new micro entrepreneurs during the life of the loan. In addition, the current facility offered would enable EKI to tap into long-term maturities not currently available in the local market to a microfinance company and therefore lengthen the maturities offered to its clients. Therefore, the projects development impact is expected to be high and far reaching in terms of its economic support for productive micro enterprises, of its stimulus for employment generation and for confidence building for the Bosnian microfinance sector.</narrative>

EKIs loans and services are targeted at small businesses, crafts, services and agricultural activities. EKIs clients are low income households, women, invalids, returnees and persons whose businesses create new jobs or sustain existing ones. As of June 2008, EKI had a loan portfolio of $155.6 million equivalent which has grown 2.5x in the last 3 years, and an equity base of $27.4 million equivalent composed of donated capital and retained earnings. As of that same date, ROAA and ROAE stood at 3% and 16.7% respectively.
