The proposed IFC investment is a loan representing 90% of the project cost. The local agent bank will participate with the remaining 10% of the funds. Privatization of the company within two years of loan-signing is a requirement under the pre-approved IFC loan.       Location of project and Description of site    	The company is located in the village of Gradiska, about 50 km north of Banja Luka, on the main road to the village. The project does not call for any changes to or expansion of the location, but only improvements to the existing facilities and machinery.      Description of Company and Purpose of Project    	The Company produces PU foam, upholstered furniture, veneered and case goods furniture and steel spring mattresses. The project will involve the refurbishment and upgrading of the furniture production line of veneer furniture components and the upgrading of the foam manufacturing facility. The purpose of the project is to provide the funds for critical process improvements, working capital, and equipment upgrading in order to proceed with the refurbishment and continued revitalization of the recipients activities. The investment will promote recovery of the wood processing sector in which Bosnia has traditionally had a comparative advantage. It is expected that the project will result in stabilized income and employment and will enable the company to respond to market requirements. Provision of technical assistance and support in the privatization process, as important parts of this project, will help the company pursue a path of sustainable long-term growth.
