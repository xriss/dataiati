    <narrative xml:lang="EN">Over the course of the last 15 years, Colombia has steadily advanced along the path of sustained economic growth while firmly stepping into the role of regional leader. The country is also on the verge of ending a half-century of conflict as the Government of Colombia negotiates a peace agreement with the region&apos;s largest and oldest insurgent group, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC). On September 23, 2015, the two opposing sides announced they expect to sign an agreement by March 23, 2016. The United States supports Colombia&apos;s efforts to end the 52-year conflict and implement a just and lasting peace. The U.S. government has been an influential partner in Colombia&apos;s progress by advancing security, stability, law enforcement, counternarcotics, rule of law, human rights, and development. U.S. bilateral foreign assistance of $391 million - a part of the Administrations&apos;s $450 million whole of government request to support Colombia - includes capacity building and technical assistance in areas of mutual interest to Colombia and the United States: coca eradication and interdiction; institutional presence and licit economic opportunities in conflictive regions; land restitution; demobilization and reintegration of ex-combatants and rehabilitation of soldiers; respect for human rights; access to justice; protection of and services to internally displaced people, Afro-Colombians, indigenous populations, and other vulnerable citizens; global climate change and environmental conservation through the President&apos;s Global Climate Change Initiative; and humanitarian assistance and reparations for conflict victims and vulnerable populations. The United States&apos; national interests are served by assisting Colombia with the most critical aspects of peace accord implementation once the two sides sign an agreement.</narrative>
