    <narrative xml:lang="EN">The primary goal of U.S. assistance in Laos is to demonstrate that the United States is a trusted and reliable partner in the economic and social development of the country. To accomplish this, U.S. assistance programs are designed to address legacy issues arising from the war in Vietnam, support public health efforts to combat child malnutrition and improve maternal and newborn health, increase primary school graduation rates, promote legal and regulatory systems reform, combat drug flows from Laos to other countries, increase regional and global economic integration and adherence to international standards and trade agreements, and strengthen people-to-people ties between Laos and the United States. U.S. assistance promotes good governance and respect for human rights; more sustainable country-based health and education systems; a legal framework that provides greater access to U.S. businesses and facilitates inclusive growth; the removal of unexploded ordnance; and a positive, constructive relationship between Laos and the United States.</narrative>
