   <narrative xml:lang="EN">UNRWA requires additional capacity to reinforce the planning, management, monitoring and evaluation of emergency interventions, ensure the safety and security of staff and refugees and safeguard the neutrality of its facilities. This is vital for the efficient and effective delivery of services and to maintain and further develop capacity to respond to rapid-onset emergencies, including the health and non-health consequences of COVID-19. At the headquarters (HQ) level, the Department of Planning is responsible for the planning and coordination of UNRWA&#x2019;s emergency response activities. Under the 2021 EA, a senior emergency officer  will oversee planning, monitoring and reporting activities. Reporting will be managed through an online results-based monitoring (RBM) system that allows the Agency to track actual results against planned priorities on a quarterly basis, facilitating regular consolidated reporting. UNRWA will also maintain other HQ functions in support of emergency operations, such as data analysis for emergency programmes implemented by the Agency&#x2019;s Department of Relief and Social Services, and engagement with international human rights mechanisms and other legal support led by the Department of Legal Affairs.</narrative>
