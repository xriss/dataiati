   <narrative xml:lang="EN">UNRWA has made significant investments in the safety and security of its staff, assets and facilities and security procedures despite financial challenges. In 2021, the Agency will continue to focus on security personnel staffing costs, the procurement of communication devices such as VHF radios, as well as the procurement of PPE for security staff in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. These investments will enable UNRWA to facilitate and provide security support for over 600 field missions in 2021 in a medium to high risk security environment, and to conduct security risk assessments of its installations. In order to ensure that UNRWA facilities are compliant with minimum operating security standards, the Agency will conduct security risk assessments on targeted facilities and will carry out necessary physical enhancement works to ensure a safe and secure environment for its staff and beneficiaries accessing assistance and services. In addition, UNRWA plans to install a closed circuit television (CCTV) room and Internet Protocol (IP) surveillance cameras at its offices in Damascus and Central areas.</narrative>
