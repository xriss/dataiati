  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Agency will continue to provide this assistance based on a targeted approach introduced in 2019, prioritizing refugees assessed as most vulnerable with a higher cash transfer. In 2021, it is expected that around 140,000 Palestine refugees will be assessed as most vulnerable based on the four vulnerability categories used by UNRWA (female headed households, families with persons with disabilities, families headed by an older person and unaccompanied minors/orphans). 

In order to adjust to the challenges of rising inflation and the additional economic hardship caused by COVID-19, the Agency, in coordination with relevant humanitarian sectors in Syria, has reviewed the value of its cash transfers based on the adjusted poverty line and will look to increase this in 2021.  UNRWA aims to provide most vulnerable Palestine refugees with US$ 27 per person per month, while the remaining caseload will receive US$ 16 per person per month. Through its partners, comprising a network of banks and private companies present in all regions of Syria, the Agency will continue to provide cash assistance in a flexible and timely manner with minimal financial risk. COVID-19 prevention measures will remain in place at cash and food distribution points. In 2021, UNRWA also plans to extend the use of ATMs in its cash programmes. Some 50,000 ATM cards will be issued, distributed and credited to selected beneficiaries, on top of the 10,000 cards already issued in 2019.</narrative>
