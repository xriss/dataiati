   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In 2020, UNRWA will continue to ensure that PRS children receive equitable and inclusive access to education from grade 1 to grade ten in UNRWA schools across throughout the country. 

At the beginning of the 2019 / 2020 school year, 1,167 PRS and Syrian students (865 PRS and 302 Syrian students) were enrolled in 133 UNRWA schools. In line with the Agency-wide EiE approach, UNRWA will continue to support and respond to the specific educational and psychosocial needs of PRS students. Education in emergencies activities in 2020 will continue to be conducted in line with EiE programmatic strands that include: i) ensuring the provision of a safe and secure learning environment; ii) sustaining the quality of teaching and learning during emergencies; iii) enhancing community and student engagement and participation and; iv) improving data management. In this regard, funding will be used to deploy additional school counsellors to respond to the psychosocial needs of the children. Recreational and learning materials will also be made available to all PRS. 

UNRWA will also ensure free admission to its Vocational Training Centres (VTCs) and the Faculty of Educational Sciences and Arts (FESA) to support PRS&#x2019;s access to the labour market and strengthen their livelihood opportunities. In 2020, based on availability of funds, UNRWA will undertake the repair and maintenance of these educational facilities through the rehabilitation of workshops and the provision of new tools and equipment in support of the educational process, to ensure a safe, secure and conducive learning environment.</narrative>
