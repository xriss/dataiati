  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Contrary to the principle of the inviolability of United Nations premises, UNRWA facilities in Syria have suffered extensive damage throughout the conflict. Many Palestine refugee camps have seen major hostilities, particularly Ein el Tal (Aleppo), Dera&#x2019;a (South) and Yarmouk (Damascus) official and nonofficial camps, which have sustained large-scale destruction. 

In 2020, UNRWA will continue to focus on resuming its core services in areas where access has resumed and civilians are spontaneously returning, as observed in 2019 in Sbeineh, Khan Eshieh, and Hama camps and Muzeirib in Dera&#x2019;a. The main Agency priority is to ensure access to its education and health facilities and to support the restoration of basic WASH services, such as water and sewage connections. Under this Emergency Appeal, UNRWA will prioritize the rehabilitation of its installations in Dera&#x2019;a camp to meet the demands of the increasing number of Palestine refugees spontaneously returning to this area. 

Provided access is granted, assessment missions will be conducted in areas where UNRWA emergency repair and reconstruction of UNRWA facilities is expected to be required, including in Yarmouk, Ein el Tal and Dera&#x2019;a camps , as UNRWA initial assessments indicate that most of the Agency&#x2019;s facilities in these areas have been either partially or fully destroyed. UNRWA will develop area-specific implementation plans based on the findings of the assessment missions, to ensure a comprehensive, needs-based response involving all needed programmes and support departments. While the Agency  stands ready to respond to these situations on a case-by-case basis, additional funding will be needed to cover all emergency repair and reconstruction needs throughout the country.
