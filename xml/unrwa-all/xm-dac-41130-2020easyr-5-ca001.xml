   <narrative xml:lang="EN">According to the findings of an Accelerated Vulnerability Exercise  conducted in 2016 by the UNRWA Jordan field office (JFO) emergency coordination unit, the majority of PRS in Jordan are below the national poverty line.  Despite the high levels of vulnerability faced by all PRS, families not holding Jordanian documents are particularly vulnerable to socio-economic and protection risks, given their exclusion from the formal labour market and lack of access to public services. 

In 2018, in order to make more efficient use of scarce resources, and to ensure that the most vulnerable PRS continued to be served, the Agency introduced a targeted approach to cash based transfers.  PRS households where the head of family does not hold a Jordanian ID number, were prioritized to continue to receive the full amount of US$ 40 per person per month, while PRS belonging to families where the head of household holds Jordanian documents, and who are hence more likely to have access to public services and other entitlements for Jordanian citizens (health, higher education, employment, National Aid Fund-NAF, etc.), continued to receive a reduced cash transfer value, set at US$ 10.42 per person per month in line with the assistance provided to PRJ cases benefiting from UNRWA SSN programme. 

However, in the second half of 2019, given the challenging socio-economic conditions faced by all PRS in Jordan, such as the high cost of living, a constrained job market, the lack of sustainable livelihoods and widespread poverty, UNRWA decided to increase the cash transfer value provided to PRS with Jordanian documents (about 10,000 PRS) from US$ 10.42 to US$ 25, starting from quarter one 2020, in order to provide a more meaningful contribution to respond to their basic needs.  The most vulnerable households will continue to receive US$ 40 per person per month.

Under the 2020 Emergency Appeal, in order to further support the resilience of PRS families, the UNRWA cash assistance programme will also continue to include a one-off emergency cash grant component with an average value of US$ 200. This assistance will be provided to an estimated 450 PRS families who experience a major shock or a crisis with devastating consequences on their economic situation. 

During the last quarter of 2020, winterization assistance will also be provided to all PRS to support them to cover a number of costs related to the winter season. Winterization assistance is provided based on family size, with families receiving between US$ 277 and US$ 453 depending on the number of members. This methodology is in line with the winterization assistance provided by the international community to other refugees from Syria in Jordan.</narrative>
