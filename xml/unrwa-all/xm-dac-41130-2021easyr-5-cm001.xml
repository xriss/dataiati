  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Staff capacity and management support are required to ensure a timely and effective response to the needs of PRS. The Emergency Coordination Unit (ECU) will continue to provide coordination, capacity and management support to the JFO emergency response. ECU will work closely with the national and international humanitarian community in Jordan to work on harmonizing, as appropriate, the Agency&#x2019;s emergency response for PRS with the response provided by other actors to non-PRS. ECU will oversee the implementation of response plans at the field level and incorporate minimum Sphere standards (education, health, protection and cash-for-food) into programme delivery at the field level. At the Agency level, ECU will support UNRWA through the development and rollout of tools such as refugee registration and cash distribution SOPs and systems, especially information management and monitoring, to improve the overall efficiency of the region-wide response. During 2021, additional support staff will be recruited to ensure adequate delivery of services and the overall management of the appeal. Four mobile security officers will be hired to ensure timely and professional liaison with the Jordanian authorities inside and outside the ten Palestine refugee camps and in the three unofficial gatherings in Jordan.</narrative>
