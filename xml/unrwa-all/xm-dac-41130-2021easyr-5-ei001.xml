   <narrative xml:lang="EN">UNRWA strives to ensure access to continuous, quality, inclusive and safe education for more than 115,000 children in 169 schools and for more than 3,500 youth in two TVET Centres and one teacher training facility.
UNRWA foresees that blended learning or remote learning modalities will be implemented throughout the 2020/2021 school year. As such, investments are deemed essential in IT infrastructure (including further development of the online education platform), training of UNRWA teachers and the production of printed Self Learning Materials (SLM) to ensure that all Palestine refugee students, including PRS, enrolled in UNRWA schools in Jordan are able to access quality education.  In May 2020, UNRWA conducted an Agency-wide phone-based Parent Survey. Results revealed that 97% of students had used at least one of the types of SLM available at least once during the period of school closures between March-May 2020. The same survey showed that three percent of students (approximately 3,555 students in Jordan) were not able to sustain their participation due to the limited- or, in some cases, complete lack of- access to technology and IT tools. Therefore, to ensure that Palestine refugees, including PRS, benefit from universal access to UNRWA education services, Jordan Field Office (JFO) plans to procure and distribute tablets to 3,570 students attending the Agency&#x2019;s schools. Internet bundles for 27,255 students will also be provided. In addition, up to 240 daily paid teachers will be hired, if needed, to mitigate any disruption in the educational process due to the increased number of teachers infected with COVID-19. UNRWA will also ensure that schools in Jordan are hygienic and safe. Regular disinfection of school premises will be carried out throughout the year. The need for psychosocial support has increased among students due to the COVID-19 pandemic. PSS activities are currently implemented by 52 school counsellors benefitting approximately 119,000 students. An additional 43 school counsellors are needed to ensure adequate services are provided in the current circumstances. UNRWA will support the continuation of learning for Palestine refugee students, including PRS, who are enrolled with the Agency VTCs. A total of 3,000 students will receive internet bundles. Up to 600 Palestine refugee students who are registered with the Agency SSNP will receive laptops in addition to internet access. Laptops will also be made available to VTC instructors to facilitate the distance-learning modality and the uploading of the curriculum onto the platform.</narrative>
