   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The protracted crisis in Syria continues to have a dramatic impact on the Syrian economy. In 2019, no funding was received under the EA to support livelihood interventions; however, in 2020, UNRWA will continue to fundraise for these activities, which are critical to increase the resilience of Palestine refugees in Syria and to support their access to employment opportunities. 

Depending on the availability of funds, the UNRWA Technical and Vocational Education and Training Programme (TVET) will provide short-term courses in Damascus, Dera&#x2019;a, Homs, Aleppo and Latakia. As demand for TVET services grows, the Agency will continue its efforts to better link students with the job market in an effort to increase employability rates of graduates. Reconstruction/rehabilitation-focused courses, such as electricity, plumbing or masonry, will remain an area of focus.  

Despite significant challenges, the microfinance programme continues to provide a growing number of loans to Syrians and Palestine refugees in Syria. In 2020, the microfinance team will continue to provide inclusive financial services to Palestine refugees and Syrians requiring additional capital through the direct disbursement of loans to meet rising demand. The majority of the loans requested are consumer loans, which enable a household to cover unforeseen expenditures, such as the purchase of assets. Entrepreneur loans continue to be less in demand, reflecting the ongoing constraints of the Syrian economy. In 2020, UNRWA will continue to work to resume microfinance activities in areas of spontaneous return such as Sbeineh and Qabr Essit camps through the provision of consumer loans, business loans or youth and women focused loans. Special microfinance products focusing on women and youth will continue to be developed by UNRWA and will be further promoted in order to stimulate livelihood activities in recovering areas. 

Finally, and in response to the evolving needs of the Palestine refugees in Syria, UNRWA will explore the feasibility of conducting small scale cash-for-work initiatives in 2020. Work opportunities will be provided to support the provision of current UNRWA services (health, and education), or to support the restoration of Agency services in newly accessible areas.</narrative>
