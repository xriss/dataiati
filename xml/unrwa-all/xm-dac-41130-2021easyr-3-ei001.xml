  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">From late 2019 onwards, Lebanon&#x2019;s population has experienced multiple socioeconomic shocks due to the unstable political context, compounded by the COVID-19 global health pandemic and an economy on the brink of collapse. These events have increased educational constraints and barriers, and continue to negatively impact the educational experiences of children, particularly the most vulnerable. In order to ensure continuity of learning, UNRWA applied its Education in Emergencies (EiE) approach, which highlights five key areas: Continuity of Learning, Psychosocial Support (PSS), Safety and Security &#x2013; Health and Hygiene issues, Technical Vocational Education and Training (TVET), and Monitoring and Evaluation (M&amp;E). 

In 2021, UNRWA will continue to provide educational services to Palestine refugee students, including around 5,000 PRS children,  as well as 860 students in vocational training courses. UNRWA&#x2019;s educational response, linked particularly to the COVID-19 crisis, will include interventions to strengthen students&#x2019; academic achievement and holistic well-being. Interventions are planned for several learning modalities including: (1) remote learning, (2) the reopening of schools, and/or (3) blended learning, which will entail combining in-person and remote learning. Learning modalities will be determined based on the status of the COVID-19 pandemic and the consequent decisions of the MEHE. UNRWA will ensure that health and hygiene practices are strictly implemented in all education installations. This includes the procurement of hygiene and disinfectant materials for premises and school buses, and the distribution of PPE for staff and students. 

The socioeconomic and health conditions in Lebanon have caused immense psychological distress for children. The continued availability of psychosocial support services (PSS) remains crucial to improve children&#x2019;s social and emotional learning, and to build their psychosocial resilience by providing them with the tools needed to cope with shocks and stress. In 2021, school counsellors will continue to provide individual and group counselling, awareness sessions for both children and caregivers, as well as parenting skills sessions. 

UNRWA also aims to continue tackling youth challenges through enhancing the quality of vocational education. UNRWA will continue to support the enrolment of PRS and PRL students in various trade and semi-professional vocational courses at STC. Courses will be provided through in-person classes, a blended approach (combining e-learning with in-person attendance), or through a fully remote modality depending on the situation.</narrative>
