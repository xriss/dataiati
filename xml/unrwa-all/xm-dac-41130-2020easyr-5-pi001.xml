   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In 2020, UNRWA will continue its efforts to ensure that PRS in Jordan enjoy full and equal respect for their rights without discrimination. In addition to general protection concerns, many PRS in Jordan continue to face a number of additional protection risks due to their irregular legal status. PRS living below the poverty line, women and children (47 per cent of PRS caseload in Jordan), and persons with disabilities are also particularly vulnerable to protection risks and are exposed to different forms of violence including GBV and social exclusion. 

During 2020, UNRWA will continue to prioritize the provision of protection services to vulnerable PRS families and individuals who face protection concerns; the Agency will further strengthen its protection interventions by increasing coordination of protection-related activities, ensuring quality assurance, timely planning and monitoring and reporting.  Legal assistance services will be reinforced through the retention of a dedicated legal officer providing legal advice and counselling, as well as follow up and liaison with external service providers and authorities. A protection coordinator will oversee the implementation of activities and initiatives targeting PRS in Jordan, in addition to providing PRS facing major protection risks with adequate assistance. 

In 2020, in coordination with the UNRWA Syria field office (SFO), the Protection Unit in Jordan will continue to monitor PRS returns to Syria and possible new displacement to Jordan due to the absence of conditions necessary for a stable resettlement in the country. The Agency will continue to engage with the international human rights system based on the IHRS framework and with support from UNRWA HQ.</narrative>
