   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Since the onset of the conflict, UNRWA has made significant investments in the safety and security of its staff, assets and facilities and security procedures. UNRWA requires funding to maintain and strengthen existing security infrastructure. In 2020, the main investments will continue to focus on security personnel staffing costs, the procurement of communication devices such as VHF radios, as well as the procurement of personal protection equipment and uniforms for security staff. These investments will enable UNRWA to facilitate and provide security support for over 600 field missions conducted yearly in a medium to high risk security environment, and to conduct security risk assessments of its installations. In order to ensure that UNRWA facilities are compliant with minimum operating security standards, the Agency will conduct security risk assessments on targeted facilities and will carry out necessary physical enhancement works to ensure a safe and secure environment for its staff and beneficiaries accessing assistance and services. 

In addition, UNRWA plans to ensure the installation of a closed circuit television (CCTV) room and Internet Protocol (IP) surveillance cameras at its offices in Damascus and Central areas. UNRWA will continue to train its staff in Safe and Security Approaches to Field Environment (SSAFE) and will also provide fire safety trainings. Finally, through its commitment to ensuring gender considerations in security management, and recognizing that women are more exposed to risks of GBV, UNRWA in Syria will maintain a Women&#x2019;s Security Awareness Training (WSAT) programme for UNRWA female staff members.</narrative>
