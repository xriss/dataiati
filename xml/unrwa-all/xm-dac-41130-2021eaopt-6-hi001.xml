   <narrative xml:lang="EN">UNRWA will continue operating its 43 primary health centres and health points in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, as well as its hospital in Qalqilya. In all health centres, the Agency will extend the triage system introduced in early 2020 in response to COVID-19, to safely screen patients with respiratory symptoms. A rotation system for health staff will remain in place, to ensure the continuity of services in case some health staff are infected with COVID-19, or have to quarantine. UNRWA will also continue to operate hotlines to provide remote health advice, reducing foot traffic at health centres. All health staff, including daily paid staff, will be provided with PPE and health centres will be regularly disinfected.

To respond to the needs of vulnerable communities unable to reach health services due to COVID-19 related movement restrictions and pre-existing protection concerns, UNRWA health teams will be deployed to provide urgent health support for up to 24,630 individuals in remote communities, requiring also enhanced co-ordination with authorities to ensure there are no barriers to the delivery of assistance. Home deliveries of Non-Communicable Disease (NCD) medications will also be expanded in order to reduce the need for patients to visit health centres. Finally, UNRWA, together with other humanitarian actors, will support the MoH-approved isolation centres for mild and moderate COVID-19 cases. Many families in the 19 refugee camps in the West Bank live with extended family in small homes, and are unable to properly self-isolate at home. In response to requests from the community and after an assessment conducted by the Inter Cluster Coordination Group (ICCG), UNRWA is planning to support community led isolation centres in Amari, Kalandia, Deir Ammar, Balata, Old Askar, New Askar, Tulkarem, Jenin, Fawwar and Arroub refugee camps through the provision of non-food items and hygiene materials.</narrative>
