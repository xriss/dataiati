   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Services related to water supply and water quality control, maintenance and cleaning of wastewater and storm water networks and pavements, in addition to solid waste collection and timely disposal and insect and rodent control, are among the most important that UNRWA provides in Palestine refugee camps. Due to the additional pressure put on UNRWA services and infrastructure by the increased populations in the camps, including PRS and Syrian refugees, the provision of these services is at its capacity limit.  

The increased demand and water scarcity conditions (drop in groundwater tables) in recent years have caused water shortages in many camps.  Seawater intrusion has affected the functioning of some of the existing wells, requiring frequent repairs. To ensure a safe and healthy environment, UNRWA also continues to provide disinfection materials (sodium hypochlorite and chlorine tablets), and water quality control services, however funding constraints put the availability of these services at risk. The increased population in camps has also placed additional strain on solid waste management services, resulting in a need for additional sanitation labourers, solid waste vehicles, machinery and equipment.  The persistence of the solid waste crisis, in particular with the closure of a solid waste treatment plant in Tyre area, has forced the Agency to identify costly alternatives using private dumping sites. 

To overcome these challenges and sustain the delivery of environmental health services for all residents in camps, in 2020 the Agency will continue to maintain and repair vital infrastructure, such as water boreholes, network systems, and solid waste equipment and vehicles. In line with the current UNRWA environmental health strategy for Palestine refugee camps in Lebanon, the Agency will continue to work on ways to reduce waste and increase recycling to improve environmental health for PRS and PRL in Lebanon.</narrative>
