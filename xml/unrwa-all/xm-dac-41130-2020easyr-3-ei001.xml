   <narrative xml:lang="EN">PRS children continue to face multiple and complex enrolment and retention barriers. PRS children of school age are less likely than PRL to be enrolled in schools at all education levels, with on average only 64.6 per cent of PRS children15  enrolled in education. Moreover, enrolment significantly drops from elementary to secondary levels. The UNRWA EiE Programme in Lebanon aims to provide equitable access to quality education for all Palestine refugee children and youth. Through its EiE interventions, UNRWA supports a holistic approach to learning through the provision of teaching and learning, psychosocial support and community engagement. During the school year 2018 / 2019, 5,254 PRS children were enrolled in 64 UNRWA schools across Lebanon and 150 graduated from basic education in June 2019, exceeding the planned target of 147 students. 

In 2020, UNRWA will continue to support PRS children&#x2019;s academic achievement and their overall well-being through its EiE activities and by enhancing the capacities of its teaching workforce through its development and support structures. UNRWA will also explore opportunities for strengthening partnerships with local and international NGOs and Community Based Organizations (CBOs) working in the camps, to provide complementary learning support and education services to Palestine refugee children and youth. 

Children&#x2019;s psychosocial wellbeing remains a key priority for the Agency. Across UNRWA schools, counsellors attend to children&#x2019;s psychosocial needs through delivering individual and group counselling sessions and other targeted psychosocial activities. Through awareness-raising activities, UNRWA aims to equip parents to better identify and address their children&#x2019;s PSS needs. To complement essential PSS services, the Agency will also organize recreational activities for students at all grade levels, focusing primarily on students at risk of dropping out, with a view to fostering cohesion between PRS and PRL students and improving retention. 

In addition, in alignment with the  Ministry of  Education and Higher Education in Lebanon, UNRWA aims to support the enrolment of PRS and PRL students in various trade and semiprofessional vocational courses at its Siblin Training Centre (STC). Through its vocational training services, the Agency supports PRS and PRL youth in Lebanon to realize their full potential and become self-reliant by providing the necessary market-oriented skills and abilities that contribute to sustained livelihoods.</narrative>
