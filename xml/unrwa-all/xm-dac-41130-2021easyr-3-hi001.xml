   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Providing health services to PRS will remain one of the Agency&#x2019;s core humanitarian activities in 2020. With 15 per cent  of PRS  having at least one non-communicable disease,12 around 80 per cent of PRS households having at least one member with a chronic disease, and one in 10 households having at least one person with a disability,13 the continued provision of UNRWA health services remains crucial to mitigate the vulnerability of PRS in Lebanon. Moreover, at least 20 per cent of PRS present mental health difficulties.  

In 2020, free-of-charge primary health care services will be provided to PRS through the 27 UNRWA primary health-care centres, of which 13 are located inside Palestine refugee camps and 14 are located in Palestinian gatherings. Services in HCs will continue to be enhanced through the use of the Agency&#x2019;s electronic patient record system (e-Health), which allows for easy tracking of patients&#x2019; medical history. UNRWA will also continue to cover 90 per cent of secondary health care and 60 per cent of tertiary health care for PRS. Access to hospitalization will remain crucial to ensure the well-being of PRS, with a planned target of 4,000 hospital referrals in 2020.</narrative>
