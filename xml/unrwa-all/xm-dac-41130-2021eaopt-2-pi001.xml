   <narrative xml:lang="EN">To mitigate and respond to mounting protection concerns, risk factors, including negative coping mechanisms, and diminishing resources, UNRWA will seek to maintain its protection capacity and processes through mainstreaming protection across existing programmes and services. Inter-programme coordination and cooperation as well as inter-agency coordination will also be strengthened. Efforts will continue to raise awareness and increase advocacy with the international community on the rights of Palestine refugees and the impact of the protracted humanitarian crisis in Gaza, in addition to the impact of COVID-19. Through case management and referral systems mainstreamed across all programme and service delivery, special attention will be given to high and critical protection cases including cases of gender-based violence (GBV) and child protection. In 2021, UNRWA will strive to mitigate the risks of sexual exploitation and abuse (SEA) by engaging in a multifaceted campaign targeting staff on prevention, detection, response and monitoring mechanisms. Trained UNRWA staff will provide awareness raising sessions to the refugee community, including on prevention strategies and reporting mechanisms.  Furthermore, in order to assist vulnerable women in need of legal aid services, including survivors of GBV, UNRWA will support the provision of legal counselling and legal representation, as well as other social interventions, for approximately 1,000 Palestine refugee women in partnership with community based organizations (CBOs) such as the Women&#x2019;s Programme Centres (WPCs) located across the Gaza Strip, enhancing community-based protection models. 

Finally, safeguarding neutrality will remain critical for the continued operational effectiveness and safety of staff, beneficiaries and UNRWA facilities in Gaza. Given the political context and challenges, this can involve sensitive issues and provoke strong community reactions requiring continual monitoring and engagement. UNRWA installations will be monitored, and neutrality issues that are incompatible with the Agency&#x2019;s neutrality framework will be documented and followed up.</narrative>
