   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In 2020, the already deteriorating economic situation has been further compounded by measures taken to limit the spread of COVID-19, which had a negative impact on the availability of employment opportunities. Therefore, UNRWA will continue to fundraise for livelihood activities, which are critical to increase the resilience of Palestine refugees in Syria and to support their access to employment.  To support youth employment and livelihood capacity, the UNRWA Technical and Vocational Education and Training Programme (TVET) will continue to provide short-term courses in Damascus, Dera&#x2019;a, Homs, Aleppo and Latakia. As demand for TVET services grows, the Agency will continue its efforts to better link students with the job market in an effort to increase employability rates of graduates through developing their employability and soft skills. 
Building on 2020 learning and good practices in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the courses will be delivered through a mixed-modality (in-class or online) or remotely (online) to avoid overcrowding in classrooms. Self-learning resources will be made available to students. Hygiene measures and physical distancing will be ensured across all TVET premises.  Finally, depending on the availability of funds, UNRWA will explore the feasibility of conducting small scale cash-for-work initiatives in 2021. Through this intervention, UNRWA aims to provide short-term employment opportunities mainly focusing on job placements supporting works in camps and Palestine refugee gatherings.</narrative>
