  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic, the ongoing economic crisis, and an uncertain political situation have made Lebanon&#x2019;s context increasingly fragile and social tensions are rising.  Palestine refugees, and PRS in particular, were already vulnerable before the current crisis due to their precarious legal status in the country and subsequent precarious living conditions. 

The multiple crises faced in 2020 have further increased psychosocial distress and exacerbated protection risks especially for children and women, with the latter in particular reporting higher levels of violence inside the home as pressure has increased on them and other members of the family.

Under this appeal, UNRWA will support the protection of Palestine refugees with a special focus on vulnerable groups and individuals. Activities will be adapted to the COVID-19 context with many taking place online or where possible in small groups. 

Lebanon Field Office (LFO) protection team will work with all UNRWA programmes to mainstream protection principles and to ensure that child protection, GBV and MHPSS approaches are taken into consideration. Training on protection will be provided to UNRWA staff, including on the safe identification and referral of protection cases. The Agency will also support Palestine refugees in accessing appropriate individual support, including through the referral of victims of protection violations to appropriate services. Legal counselling will continue to be provided, as well as emergency cash support to individuals and families facing urgent protection concerns. 
Regular protection monitoring in camps will be provided and advocacy for the protection of Palestine refugees undertaken.</narrative>
