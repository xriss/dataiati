  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">UNRWA in Gaza continues to support the education of Palestine Refugee students despite the multiple and protracted crises they continue to face. Responding to the additional challenges of the COVID-19 crisis, the Agency continued to focus on the delivery of its Education in Emergencies (EiE) approach, reconceptualised in five key areas: Continuity of Learning, Psychosocial Support (PSS), Safety and Security &#x2013; Health and Hygiene issues, Technical Vocational Education Training (TVET), and Monitoring and Evaluation (M&amp;E). The adaptation of the Programme has facilitated the roll-out of an emergency response that considered both pre-existing challenges and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. 

During the 2020/2021 school year, UNRWA in Gaza continues to provide basic education to 287,000 elementary and preparatory school students. In order to adjust to the challenges created by the COVID-19 pandemic, UNRWA will deliver education through a blended learning approach combining in-classroom learning with learning at home. The Education programme will maintain a flexible approach, applying different learning methodologies based on developments and circumstances on the ground, including through the adoption of full remote learning when needed. 

In order to provide quality education amidst increased local transmission of COVID-19 in Gaza, remote learning will be provided using printed self-learning educational materials in addition to textbooks, to ensure that support is provided to all students regardless of their ability to access online material.  During the 2020/2021 school year, UNRWA will also aim at providing support classes to students who return to in-person learning in class from quarantine and/or isolation periods. While UNRWA will continue to provide education through remote learning to students in quarantine/isolation, additional support through catch-up classes will be offered upon their return to blended learning. 

For as long as the situation allows students to receive in-person education in schools, UNRWA will ensure that enhanced COVID-19 hygiene and health measures are implemented in all premises. These include the continued availability of cleaning materials and the improvement of hand washing facilities</narrative>
