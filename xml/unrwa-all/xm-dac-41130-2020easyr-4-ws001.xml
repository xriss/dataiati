   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In 2020, UNRWA will continue to provide essential WASH services to Palestine refugees, with specific attention to areas and camps affected by the conflict. The crisis in Syria has resulted in extensive damage to water networks and sewerage infrastructure, resulting in restricted access to potable water and affecting domestic and personal hygiene, which in turn has increased the risk of disease outbreaks. 

UNRWA will continue its efforts to repair, rehabilitate and maintain water supply systems and to ensure that Palestine refugees, particularly in newly accessible camps, have access to potable water. The Agency will also repair, rehabilitate and maintain infrastructure systems including sewerage and surface drainage systems, in addition to collecting and managing solid waste and controlling rodents and insects in accessible camps. In 2020, UNRWA will prioritize the rehabilitation of water networks and sewer infrastructure in Dera&#x2019;a camp, in order to respond to the needs of Palestine refugees spontaneously returning to this area. During the course of the year, WASH items will be distributed to Palestine refugees affected by emergencies, as well as Palestine refugees spontaneously returning to newly accessible areas and those facing access constraints, to help safeguard their personal and domestic hygiene.</narrative>
