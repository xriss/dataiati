  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Staff capacity and management support is required to ensure a timely and effective response to the needs of PRS. The Emergency Coordination Unit (ECU) will continue to provide coordination, capacity and management support to the JFO emergency response. The ECU will work closely with the national and international humanitarian community in Jordan to work on harmonizing, as appropriate, the Agency&#x2019;s emergency response for PRS with the response provided by other actors to non-PRS. ECU will oversee the implementation of response plans at the field level and incorporate minimum Sphere standards (education, health, protection and cash-for food) into programme delivery at the field level. At the Agency level, ECU will support UNRWA through the development and rollout of tools, such as refugee registration and cash distribution SOPs and systems, especially information management and monitoring, to improve the overall efficiency of the region-wide response. 

In 2020, UNRWA in Jordan will also reinforce its monitoring, reporting and quality assurance capacities by strengthening its data collection and analysis methods and tools to provide for a more comprehensive profile of the PRS population in country. In line with Agency requirements, JFO will align its emergency operations approach with the RSS programme. The main goal of this arrangement is to strengthen the field&#x2019;s capacity to respond to emergency situations and ensure better distribution of roles and responsibilities. This will increase not only cost efficiency, but also cost effectiveness while ensuring the quality of the achieved results. UNRWA will ensure that proper mentoring, oversight and systems buildings are in place to ensure that the transition process is successful.</narrative>
