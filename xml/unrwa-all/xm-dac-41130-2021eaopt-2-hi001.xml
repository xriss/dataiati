   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Under the 2021 EA, UNRWA will continue to support the health needs of Palestine refugees through its 22 Health Centres (HCs) in Gaza. Essential medicine will be provided to 4,700 poor refugees, while hospitalization support, through referrals to a network of partnered private hospitals, will be offered to more than 3,000 vulnerable refugees who do not have the means to cover the cost of secondary and/or tertiary healthcare. In 2021, UNRWA will continue to implement the measures introduced in 2020 to mitigate the risk of COVID-19 transmission, including the provision and use of PPE for all health staff, the implementation of a triage system at HCs for patients with respiratory symptoms, and the use of telemedicine to reduce foot traffic at HCs. The Agency will also ensure that additional staff are available to implement COVID-19 specific measures and to replace staff who may contract COVID-19 and/or need to isolate. Home delivery of medicine to patients with chronic diseases may be provided if required to patients who need to quarantine or if further lockdowns are imposed.

As part of school health activities, UNRWA will continue medical screenings in schools for children with special needs including those with disabilities, and will provide the necessary assistive devices that vulnerable families are not able to afford otherwise.</narrative>
