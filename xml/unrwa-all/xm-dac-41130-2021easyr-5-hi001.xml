   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In 2021, UNRWA will ensure that all PRS in Jordan continue to have unrestricted access to the Agency&#x2019;s primary health care services, including preventive and curative care, through the Agency&#x2019;s 25 HCs and four mobile units across Jordan. Such services will be made available to all PRS, including those who face protection issues, as well as those whose freedom of movement is limited, including PRS in KAP who will continue to be assisted through a partnership with the Jordan Health Aid Society (JHAS).  Secondary and tertiary health care to PRS, with UNRWA covering verified hospitalization costs, will also be facilitated through the Agency&#x2019;s referral system to external service providers. 
The Agency will continue to implement all the necessary COVID-19 prevention measures at its health centres and facilities. This will include the provision of PPE to UNRWA health staff, cleaning and disinfection of UNRWA installations and continued availability of hygiene supplies. Non-health frontline staff, including teachers, social and relief workers, and staff members working at UNRWA Area Offices across Jordan, will also be provided with PPE and hygiene supplies, to protect their health and wellbeing as well as that of the Palestine refugees visiting UNRWA installations. Furthermore, disinfectants and hygiene supplies will be provided to all UNRWA installations in Jordan. In the case of prolonged lockdowns, UNRWA will continue distributing NCD medicines to Palestine refugees who are registered with UNRWA HCs through a home delivery service.</narrative>
