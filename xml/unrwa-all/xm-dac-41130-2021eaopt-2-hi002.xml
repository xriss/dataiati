  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The COVID-19 pandemic and the measures enforced to mitigate its spread have further heightened the existing social, economic and financial challenges, causing additional stress. In order to ensure that mental health and psychosocial support (MHPSS) support is not disrupted during such difficult times, UNRWA will continue to provide MHPSS services remotely through its Education and Health programmes, by using dedicated helplines and hotlines to ensure that people have access to psychosocial support.  The Agency will also ensure that school psychosocial counsellors are deployed to all 278 schools across the Gaza Strip to provide both preventive and responsive psychosocial support to all students. Individual and group counselling will be offered either in UNRWA schools if the situation permits, or through remote counselling in case of a full remote learning scenario and in support of students in home quarantine or isolation. The Agency will also ensure that school psychosocial counsellors are deployed to all 278 schools across the Gaza Strip to provide both preventive and responsive psychosocial support to all students. Mental health and psychosocial support counsellors in the 22 UNRWA health centres will provide in-person support to critical cases identified through qualified UNRWA medical staff.</narrative>
