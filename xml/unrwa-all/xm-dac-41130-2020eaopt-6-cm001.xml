   <narrative xml:lang="EN">UNRWA requires additional capacity to reinforce the planning, management, monitoring and evaluation of emergency interventions, ensure the safety and security of staff and refugees and safeguard the neutrality of its facilities. This is vital for the efficient and effective delivery of services and to maintain and further develop capacity to respond to rapid-onset emergencies. To improve the safety of UNRWA personnel, the Agency requires continued and strengthened capacity to: (i) support the management and training efforts of the Department of Security and Risk Management and the respective Field Security and Risk Management Offices and (ii) deploy an appropriate guard force to address security and other risks. Resources are also needed to ensure effective coordination with other humanitarian organisations, bilaterally and through established multi-agency structures, including the Humanitarian Country Team (HCT), the clusters, UN Agencies and NGOs.

In the West Bank, UNRWA will continue to strengthen its emergency preparedness and response (EPR) capacity, building on achievements over the last few years around emergency preparedness and contingency plans and in close coordination with other UN agencies and government authorities. UNRWA in the West Bank will make sure that effective plans are in place to guarantee business continuity and to respond to increased humanitarian needs in the event an emergency, due to a natural disasters or a political event.

In 2020, based on lessons learned from a simulation exercise conducted in 2019 involving WBFO and UNRWA HQ, the Agency will aim to further strengthen its emergency structure and coordination mechanisms, as well as to conduct simulation exercises at area level to strengthen the preparedness of the area offices. In response to small scale natural disasters (mostly winter storms), the West Bank will provide NFIs as required to affected vulnerable households. Finally, the field will also focus on risk mitigation, through maintenance and small upgrades of camp infrastructure, especially in relation to sewerage networks and storm water channels.


UNRWA will strengthen its emergency preparedness and risk management capabilities in Gaza and the West Bank through a continued focus on warehouse stockpiling, staff training, engagement in inter-agency preparedness and planning activities, and the refinement and testing of internal mechanisms and protocols.  This will include the development and maintenance of functional rosters to ensure effective and timely responses; strengthening preparedness in the areas of emergency WASH, food and non-food items (NFIs); and continuous coordination with the Israeli authorities for the importation of necessary materials, including those considered &#x2018;dual-use&#x2019; that support the operation of the emergency programme.

Safeguarding neutrality remains critical for the continued operational effectiveness and safety of staff, beneficiaries and UNRWA facilities. In accordance with the Agency&#x2019;s regulatory framework and standard operating procedures, neutrality in Agency installations will be monitored twice a year by senior field staff, who will also follow up on breaches documented. Issues that are incompatible with the Agency&#x2019;s neutrality framework that represent a specific concern will be tracked and followed up by senior management. Staff understanding of neutrality, particularly Senior Area Staff and Installation Managers, will also be strengthened by providing technical advice (including in response to issues and breaches) and training of new staff on neutrality and the appropriate use of social media.</narrative>
