  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Through its cash-for-work (CfW) intervention, UNRWA will support Palestine refugees in coping with the protracted economic crisis and the shocks caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, contributing to mitigate food insecurity by offering short-term employment opportunities to approximately 21,000 poor Palestine refugees. This translates into more than 2,150,000 workdays generating almost 7,500 full time job equivalents and injecting US$ 26 million into the local economy. The short-term work opportunities will include 15,000 unskilled positions, more than 5,700 skilled positions and around 300 professional positions. UNRWA aims to provide 40 per cent of skilled and professional job opportunities to women, and about 40 per cent of all CfW opportunities will target youth (19 to 29 years of age) to expose them to a workplace experience amidst high levels of unemployment for recent graduates. In 2021, UNRWA will continue to implement enhanced occupational health measures to reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission. CfW beneficiaries involved in front line work will receive the necessary PPE. UNRWA will also provide all CfW beneficiaries with training on safety measures in the workplace, and will screen candidates for pre-existing medical conditions to ensure they are not placed in positions that could expose them to COVID-19.</narrative>
