   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The deteriorating socio-economic situation, electricity shortages, recurrent hostilities and the blockade continue to have a deleterious impact on the learning environment for Palestine refugee children in Gaza. In these challenging circumstances, UNRWA will continue to ensure that Palestine refugee children and youth have access to inclusive, equitable, quality and safe education in line with its Agency-wide EiE approach. 

During the 2019/20 school year, 282,360 students (145,867 boys and 136,493 girls) enrolled in 276 UNRWA schools in Gaza, of which 70 per cent operate on a double-shift basis. As part of its EiE interventions, in 2020, UNRWA will recruit and train 600 support teachers to provide learning support to 70,000 students in grades 3 and 4 who are struggling to meet minimum academic standards in Arabic and mathematics. Support teachers will check students&#x2019; work, monitor students with additional learning support, communicate with parents and school management, encourage and motivate students, follow up students&#x2019; homework and assignments and liaise with regular teachers on catch-up plans. 

In light of deepening poverty, many parents struggle to contribute what is needed to support the learning and wellbeing of their children in school. In response, and to safeguard children&#x2019;s right to education, UNRWA will provide 282,000 students with the necessary basic stationery and other back-to school materials.</narrative>
