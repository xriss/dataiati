   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In 2021, many PRS in Jordan will continue to face a range of protection risks due to their irregular legal status. PRS living below the poverty line, women and children (47 per cent of PRS in Jordan), and persons with disabilities are particularly vulnerable and are exposed to different forms of violence including GBV and social exclusion. During the COVID-19 pandemic, vulnerable Palestine refugees, in particular women and children, are further exposed to heightened protection-related risks, including but not limited to gender-based violence (GBV), abuse and isolation.  UNRWA will ensure that the most vulnerable refugee groups, including PRS, have access to protection services. In particular, the delivery of GBV services will be adapted to the current operational context. Hotlines will remain available to enable persons of concern, including PRS, to request and receive timely support. Protection specific messages will continue to be disseminated on a regular basis via UNRWA&#x2019;s communication channels, including Facebook and WhatsApp, and online care services will be provided to specific groups such as children with disabilities and their parents. In 2021, UNRWA will continue to adjust the delivery of its protection services to a remote modality, integrating protection principles within programmes and ensuring that protection services are inclusive and accessible. The Agency will further strengthen its protection intervention by increasing coordination with the Protection cluster, duty bearers and other partners, ensuring quality assurance, timely planning and monitoring and reporting. Legal assistance services will be reinforced through a dedicated legal firm, which will provide legal advice and counselling and representation to PRS on protection issues such as lack of documentation and registration with authorities, possible deportation and the potential for refoulement, personal status and other urgent issues, as well as follow-up and liaison with external service providers and authorities. UNRWA will continue to prioritize the provision of protection services to vulnerable PRS families and children who face protection concerns, such as child labour, children in conflict with the law, child abuse and neglect, and childbirth registration and documentation in relation to identification/legal status, amongst others. A protection coordinator will oversee the implementation of activities and initiatives targeting PRS in Jordan, as well as support for PRS facing major protection risks.</narrative>
