Q2: &quot;1 revised law No. 050 on Determination of Employment Contract to Clarification on Fix Duration Contract (FDC) and Probation employment contract for all sectors by Ministry of Labour. 

This revised law was initiated by government and employer to extent the period of the Fix Duration Contract (FDC) from 2 to 4 years (revised) under FDC contract.

This result is not contributed directly by CLC/CAWF/FAPD. However, CLC role was to debate for the revised law to prevent and protect the worker rights. This revised law is seek to be lost benefit to trade union, especially to the Fix Duration Contract (FDC) contract could dismissal trade union member everytime and then employer could be able to control union movement in the company level.
