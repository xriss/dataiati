  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The proposed &#x2018;Final Lifeline for Atewa Forest&#x2019; intervention is the last opportunity to save Atewa Forest from bauxite mining interest. The Atewa Range Forest Reserve is a crucial source of water to more than five (5) million Ghanaians. It is also recognized as a Globally Significant Biodiversity Area and provides important climate services. However, the Atewa Forest is at risk of being lost forever as the Government of Ghana has signed a MoU with the Chinese government to mine bauxite deposits in the Atewa Forest Reserve. Bauxite mining will cause irreversible biodiversity loss and environmental degradation, undermining crucial ecosystem services notably a reliable provision of clean water.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">Although over 20 statements on Atewa have been made by the President and other members of his cabinet, notably the Vice President, the Senior Minister, and Minister of Lands and Natural resources and Environment they did NOT change their agenda and policies on Atewa. They did however indicate that only a part of Atewa (the Northern half) would be mined for bauxite and that non-destructive technologies that would not harm wildlife and other biodiversity would be employed in the mining. This might be an indication that they recognize the great value of the area and will assure mining will be done &#x2018;sustainable&#x2019;. In parliament discussion has been intense. Over 5 interventions took place with reference to Atewa in which arguments on the forest&#x2019; values were mentioned. The Legislator, especially Minority caucus in Parliament ceased several occasions to ask questions regarding the transparency and value for money in Ghana&#x2019;s Sino-hydro agreement. The minority causus also formally requested government to exclude Atewa from the mining deal. The parliamentary select committee on mines solicited input from Civil society for a the elabaration of an Act concerning Bauxite mining and held meetings to seek inputs of CSOs in the integrated Aluminum bauxite development.. The Council of Ghanaian chiefs in Netherlands released a statement urging the president to secure Atewa Range forest for water and not bauxite mining. Other important statements have been made by relevant traditional authorities including the Chief of Suhum, Apampatia, Kwabeng and Larbikrom. A great many press statements, petitions, press releases and interviews have been made by various groups in society. These included media (as an active actor!) colleague CSO organizations, professional bodies (including Ghana Institute of Foresters), Universities and Research Institutions, student groups etc. all expressingconcern on the environmental and social effects and implications of the bauxite mining.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">A great many interactions have taken place with state actors from local, district, national and international level. On the highest government level these included a meeting with (1) the Minister for Environment (MESTI), (2) the Director of Forestry Commission, (3) the Ghana Integrated Aluminum Development Corporation (GIADEC) under the Mineral Commission and with (4) the Parliamentary Select committee on Mines and Energy. There has been very frequent contact with civil servants working for the relevant government ministries (MLNR, MESTI, FC,EPA, WRC, MC, local government etc.). Other stakeholders group we engaged with were Traditional Authorities, Bilateral and Multilateral Donors such as World Bank, UN development agencies, Dutch Embassy, American Embassy and French Embassy. With a number of letters we have reached out to Chinese actors including the Chinese Development Bank and Chinese Embassy. Media played an active role as actor in the campaign while all of the activities have been organized with or by a mix of civil society organizations, youth groups and women&#x2019;s groups among others.</narrative>
