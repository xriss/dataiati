  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Fair, Green and Global Alliance (FGG) aims to increase the power and decision-making influence of organised, mobilised and informed civil society, to advance fair and green trade and value chains. FGG believes that poverty, inequality and exclusion are caused by power asymmetries. We see the unprecedented power of capital over people and planet as the primary obstacle impeding realisation of fair and green trade and value chains. The FGG programme focuses on recalibrating power within the global architecture of trade and value chains by amplifying the voices of rights-holders &#x2013;  small producers and traders, workers, fishers, rural and indigenous peoples &#x2013; who are practising, claiming or defending fair and green economic practices, and/or whose rights are being ignored, threatened or violated by corporations and/or governments. We aim to transform social relations so that these rights-holders&#x2019; voices are heard and heeded. FGG&#x2019;s eight members (ActionAid, Both ENDS, Clean Clothes Campaign, IT for Change, Milieudefensie (Friends of the Earth Netherlands, in collaboration with FoE International and FoE Europe), The Samdhana Institute, SOMO and the Transnational Institute) cooperate with some 1000+ partners and allies in our many worldwide networks to strengthen collective capacities to advance a common vision of fair and green trade and value chains.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">[4.FoEE1(2,2x)]: In November 2021 FoE Europe, in the framework of the Fossil Free Politics campaign, in the run-up to the UNFCCC COP26 in Glasgow, informed EU and LLUMIC CSOs about the corporate capture of climate negotiations. This a.o. resulted in 138 CSOs signing on to a statement to the UNFCCC, the EU and the UK government, &apos;A Fossil Free Politics COP26 open letter to decision-makers&apos;, calling on to address the elephant in the room which is holding back global climate ambition: the fossil fuel industry and its lobbying, and demanding the adoption of a strong conflict of interest policy at the UNFCCC. Furthermore, FoE Europe in the Fossil Free Politics campaign approached EU decision-makers (from the European Commission and the European Parliament) when they were listed as speakers at various media events sponsored by the fossil fuel industry and asked them to withdraw their participation as these events present an inadequate picture of the role of fossil fuel companies in (combatting) climate change. Three MEPs and one European Commissioner have taken on the recommendation and committed that they will not take part in such events anymore. [Counted under subindicator x as well, as this activity aims at increasing the influence of civil society on governmental decision making by decreasing the corporate influence on governmental decision making against the public interest]. [4.FoEE/MD2(1)]: In the report of the COP26 held in November 2021 in Glasgow, for the first time at a UNFCCC COP, fossil fuels have been explicitly mentioned as a cause of the climate problem. The Conference of the Parties in its &apos;Report of the Conference of the Parties on its twenty-sixth session, held in Glasgow from 31 October to 13 November 2021&apos; calls upon parties to &quot;phase-out of inefficient fossil fuel subsidies&quot;. While the formulation is still weak, the fact that the elephant in the room has warily been indicated, is a significant step forward to politically acknowledging that the fossil fuel era must end in order to prevent dangerous climate change. [4.FoEE3(1)]: In October 2021, the online public launch of a report published by FoE Europe, &apos;Green mining is a myth: the case for cutting EU resource consumption&apos;, moved the topic of mining and systemic EU overconsumption of metals and minerals into the political spotlight. During the event, the European Commission&apos;s Head of Unit for Energy-Intensive Industries - Raw Materials (DG GROW) supported part of FoE Europe&apos;s demands and stated that the EU needs to &#x201C;ramp up measures&#x201D; to reduce consumption. [4.FoEE4(1,1x)]: Together with a.o. ECCJ and the European Trade Union Confederation (ETUC), FoE Europe successfully mobilised the EU public (300.000 EU citizens, plus 200.000 from elsewhere) to participate in the European Commission&apos;s public consultation for an EU Sustainable Corporate Governance legislation (that closed in February 2021). They gave a strong signal to EU decision-makers that the intended law shall hold companies civilly, administratively, and criminally liable for human rights violations and environmental harms resulting from the activities of their subsidiaries and other companies in their value chains; that victims of corporate human rights violations and environmental harms in third countries have better access to justice in the EU; and that companies&#x2019; obligation to respect the climate and the environment is integrated alongside respect for human rights. Furthermore, in September 2021, in a YouGov opinion poll coordinated by FoE Europe among 20.000 people in eight European countries, over 80% of those interviewed stated that they want a strong Sustainable Corporate Governance law. With its advocacy FoE Europe responds to the requests from LLUMIC CSOs participating in FoE International&apos;s global Economic Justice Programme. The CSO advocacy is necessary also to counteract business lobbies against the proposed EU law that seeks to hold companies accountable for human rights abuses and environmental destruction, as explained in the report published in June 2021 by ECCJ, CEO and FoE Europe: &apos;Off the hook? How business lobbies against liability for human rights and environmental abuses&apos;. [Counted under subindicator x as well, as this activity aims at increasing the power of civil society vis-&#xE0;-vis corporations by developing mandatory environmental and human rights due diligence (mEHRDD) law]. [4.MD5(5)]: In five Latin American countries (Honduras, Colombia, Brazil, Bolivia and Argentina) CSOs supported by Milieudefensie [see 3.MD2] with organising meetings and through communication and media work achieved that dozens of local communities, CBOs of peasants and fishermen/women, also in parts of these countries where the CSOs had not been active before, municipalities, universities, human rights organisations as well as the media discussed the existing and upcoming environmental and economic threats of (planned) offshore and onshore fossil fuel exploitation in these countries and in the region as a whole. [Counted is civil society in the five countries]. [4.MD6(4,4x)]: Milieudefensie through media work, via publications, by organising and participating in seminars and lobby and advocacy meetings, achieved awareness amongst CSOs [1], experts [1], politicians [1] and the media [1] (all at the Dutch, EU and global levels), about the outcome of its civil court case filed in the Netherlands together with three Nigerian communities and in collaboration with a Nigerian CSO, over environmental pollution in Nigeria resulting from operations of a Nigerian subsidiary of a Dutch oil company. These actors discussed the relevance of this outcome for the development of mandatory environmental and human rights due diligence (mEHRDD) legislation in the Netherlands and Europe, while CSOs and politicians used it in the development of policy proposals. The findings, also in earlier stages of the judicial process that started in 2008, have been used in inputs from CSOs (including Milieudefensie, FoE Europe and other FGG members), scientists, civil servants and politicians to mEHRDD law-making processes at the Dutch national, EU and UN levels, such as for instance during the seminar &apos;Suing Goliath, the struggle for justice in cases of corporate abuse abroad&apos; organised 3 June 2021 by ECCJ and FoE Europe and the Responsible Business Conduct Working Group of the European Parliament, the findings of which were published in September 2021 by ECCJ in the report &apos;Suing Goliath: An analysis of civil proceedings brought against EU companies for human rights abuses and environmental harm in their global operations and value chains, and key recommendations to improve access to judicial remedy&apos; that aims to serve as a partial follow-up to the European Parliament&#x2019;s study on &#x2018;Access to legal remedies for victims of corporate human rights abuses in third countries&#x2019; from February 2019. In January 2021 in its verdict the Dutch court established a duty of care, mandatory due diligence, and corporate responsibility in a broader sense, for parent companies, and with that parent company liability for the operations of their subsidiaries abroad. It was the first time a Dutch court decided such. The impact of the verdict in Nigeria is that the parent oil company will have to see that its subsidiary will install state-of-the-art leak detection systems, which will limit the damage to the environment and to the livelihood resources of Niger Delta citizens (fields, fishing waters, drinking water) in the frequently occurring event of an oil spill, whether its cause is equipment failure such as corrosion, or sabotage. [The court case itself is not part of the FGG programme, while capacity development of the Nigerian communities and CSO, as well as connecting the findings in the judicial process to research and advocacy for mEHRDD legislation development processes, are part of this programme]. [Counted under subindicator x as well, as the use of the findings in the court case aims at increasing civic space via Dutch and European mEHRDD that strengthen the judicial position of victims of corporate abuse vis-&#xE0;-vis the relevant corporations, a.o. by removing the barriers to justice victims currently face]. [4.MD7(5,5x)]: In May 2021 and subsequent months Milieudefensie achieved world-wide media attention [1] for, and debate amongst CSOs [1]; judicial, economic and climate experts [1]; politicians [1]; and corporate decision-makers [1] about the relevance of the outcome of a climate court case filed by Milieudefensie in the Netherlands in 2019 against a Dutch oil company. With the May 2021 verdict a climate responsibility for corporate actors was established, which had been lacking until then, and which significantly increases the scope of the Paris Climate Accord, that itself is not arranging obligations for the corporate sector. In an analysis of FGG member SOMO: &quot;The [...] ruling is the first ever worldwide to impose a clear and measurable emissions reduction target on a company and its value chain. It also contains a number of ground-breaking decisions for the future of corporate accountability. The judgment affirms that companies of all sizes, at all times, have an individual responsibility to prevent human rights violations and environmental damage in their operations and entire value chain, and failure to do so can be considered an unlawful act. The verdict shows the UNGPs are up to defining the standard of care to which companies must adhere. It also underlines the need for mandatory due diligence legislation that further defines the obligations of companies to prevent human rights violations and environmental damage, and enables public regulators and judges to enforce such legislation. The ruling also makes it very clear that preventing climate change harm is an essential element of responsible business conduct as defined by the UNGPs [United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights] and the OECD Guidelines [for Multinational Enterprises]. Finally, the verdict shows that companies&#x2019; financial objectives cannot prevail over their obligation to respect human rights, the climate and the environment.&quot; The relevance of this verdict for the FGG programme is that it upgrades soft law standards on corporate conduct, the UNGPs and OECD Guidelines, to judicially relevant standards for corporations. The findings are used in CSO advocacy for responsible business conduct at the Dutch, EU and UN levels, such as for instance via the publication &apos;How to make corporations effectively respect the environment and climate: key elements for EU binding legislations&apos; that contains recommendations to the ongoing process for a sustainable corporate governance directive in the EU. Furthermore, CSOs shared the findings of the verdict with other companies, also in other economic sectors, to advocate for improved climate policies, such as was done by several Dutch and international development and environmental CSOs in July 2021, in a letter to the Dutch financial sector &apos;Oproep tot daadkrachtige klimaatactie in aanloop naar Klimaattop Glasgow&apos;, and in September 2021 via a seminar organised by Milieudefensie for the financial sector on the implications of the verdict. [The court case itself is not part of this programme, but media and advocacy work around it are, as these support FGG advocacy for mEHRDD law]. [Counted under subindicator x as well, as knowledge amongst CSOs and politicians globally of the duties of corporations, and of the judicial possibilities to hold corporations to account for their climate, environmental and human rights impacts, enhances civic space when CSOs successfully apply the judicial strategies shared]. [See also indicator 2.MD2].</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">[5C.FoEE/MD1(2,2x)]: Advocacy (a.o. publication of research, media work, meetings with representatives of the European Commission, MEPs, and Dutch parliamentarians and Ministries, as well as a petition with more than 1 million signatures from EU citizens to stop the Energy Charter Treaty) from FoE Europe, Milieudefensie, FGG members TNI, SOMO and Both ENDS, and LLUMIC CSOs from a.o. Ivory Coast, Ghana, Togo, Nigeria, Congo-Kinshasa, DRC, Uganda, Kenya, Burundi, Mozambique, South Africa, West Bank and Gaza Strip, Bosnia &amp; Herzegovina, Philippines, Mexico, El Salvador, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Brazil and Uruguay [see also 3.FoEE1], further contributed to sustainability and human rights issues getting a prominent place in trade and investment negotiations at the EU and Dutch government levels. It has become very hard in the EU to get an FTA or BIT ratified if there are strong environmental and social concerns. The Energy Charter Treaty (ECT) has become a contested multilateral investment treaty as it undermines the necessary energy transition away from fossil fuels. The EU-Mercosur process has become characterized by concerns about deforestation and human rights violations, and in its current form is not acceptable to the Dutch parliament, the European Parliament, several EU member states and the European Commission. As regards the ECT renewal process, the European Commission&apos;s DG for Climate Action after advocacy work from FoE Europe (considering that the ECT is undermining the Paris Climate Agreement and the European Green Deal) brokered a deal within the European Commission and with EU member states. The European Commission subsequently in January 2021 launched a &apos;European Union text proposal for the modernisation of the Energy Charter Treaty&apos; aiming to arrange a gradual phase-out the protection of fossil fuels under the ECT. While there are still significant loopholes in the EC proposal, it does acknowledge FoE Europe&apos;s and LLUMIC CSOs&apos; demand that fossil fuel protection under investment treaties needs to be ended. In Dutch parliament in June and September motions were filed demanding the Dutch government to leave the ECT. As regards EU-Mercosur, in 2021 the European Commission&apos;s DG for Trade started negotiations with the Mercosur countries to agree on additional measures to address the environmental, social and economic problems raised by the CSOs. The Dutch government in October 2021 in its &apos;Response from The Netherlands to the European Commission&#x2019;s request for input on strengthening the Trade and Sustainable Development dimension of the EU - Mercosur trade relationship&apos; stressed that &quot;it is necessary that additional actions and long term cooperation focuses on halting deforestation and climate change&quot;. Furthermore, the Dutch Minister for Foreign Trade and Development Cooperation Mr. De Bruijn, in December 2021 informed Dutch Parliament on the Dutch government&apos;s input to the EU&apos;s &apos;Review of the 15-point Action Plan on Trade and Sustainable Development&apos;, which included the proposal to strengthen the enforcement of the sustainability chapters in trade agreements. In its input to the EU the Netherlands states that it &quot;remains committed to including the Paris Agreement as an essential element in trade agreements&quot;. The Minister also wrote to Dutch parliament that the input from CSOs participating in the Breed Handelsberaad (which includes FGG members Both ENDS, SOMO and Milieudefensie) had been taken into consideration in de development of the governement&apos;s position. [Counted are the European Commission and the Dutch government]. [Counted under subindicator x as well, as the work aims to prevent the negative impacts of FTAs and investment treaties on democratic decision-making, and on the position of civil society vis-&#xE0;-vis the corporate sector]. [5C.FoEE2(1)]: The European Parliament, in two separate opinion reports, stressed for the need for the EU to bring in measures that will reduce systemic EU overconsumption of resources. In its &apos;Report on the New Circular Economy Action Plan&apos; (CEAP, January 2021), the EP calls on the European Commission to set &quot;binding EU targets for 2030 to significantly reduce the EU material and consumption footprints&quot;. In its &apos;Report on a European strategy for critical raw materials&apos; (October 2021), the EP stresses the role of the &quot;minimisation of resource consumption&quot;. In the monitoring framework of the CEAP proposal the EP included a material footprint as an indicator, aiming at the Commission to set binding targets on reducing EU resource consumption, one of FoE Europe&#x2019;s key recommendations in line with the demands from LLUMIC CSOs participating in FoE International&apos;s global programmes and the global Yes to Life No to Mining network [see 3.FoEE2]. [5C.MD3(1)]: In November 2021, during the UNFCCC COP26 in Glasgow, Dutch Minister for Foreign Trade and Development Cooperation Mr. De Bruijn announced that the Netherlands would endorse the &apos;Statement on International Public Support for the Clean Energy Transition&apos;. The undersigning countries &quot;commit to align their international public support towards the clean energy transition and out of unabated fossil fuels&quot;, and a.o. to end new direct public support for the international fossil fuel energy sector by the end of 2022. In a letter to Dutch Parliament from 12 November 2021 Minister De Bruijn confirmed that in 2022 the cabinet will present a new policy to end public financing of fossil fuel projects abroad, especially export credit insurance. For many years, Both ENDS, OCI, Milieudefensie and FoE Europe together with CSOs from a.o. Ghana, Togo, Nigeria, Uganda, Mozambique, South Africa, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh, have been advocating at the Dutch, UK and EU governments and via the media for an end to state support for fossil fuel operations in developing countries via export credit agencies such as the Dutch ADSB. The relevance of ending Northern support for fossil fuel development in the Global South is that fossil fuel development locks developing countries into a fossil economy, hampering the development of clean and renewable energy. The ECA-supported investments in fossil fuel development make these countries economically dependent on energy sources that many countries in the world are committed to phase out, which poses serious economic debt risks, undermining the countries&apos; long-term resilience. Milieudefensie, Both ENDS and LLUMIC CSOs showed this in the report published November 2020, &apos;A Just Energy Transition for Africa? Mapping the impacts of ECAs active in the energy sector in Ghana, Nigeria, Togo and Uganda&apos;. The report provided a Southern perspective on the effect of ECA support, which had previously been lacking (it was assumed amongst governments that investment in the fossil fuel sector would be beneficial to development, access to energy, employment a.t.l., which the research showed was not the case). Furthermore, the organisations have been arguing that the Dutch ECA policy is incompatible with the Paris Climate Agreement. Their findings were supported by independent scientists in the study &apos;Paris Alignment of Export Credit Agencies. Case study #2: the Netherlands (Atradius Dutch State Business)&apos; (Perspectives Climate Research, October 2021). A.o. based on the outcome of the Export Finance for Future (E3F, a ministerial initiative for climate action chaired by the Netherlands) Second Summit, held 24 November 2021, the CSOs are not yet convinced of the dedication of the governments involved (Denmark, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom) to swiftly live up their commitment to stop export finance for fossil fuel projects and shift this money to clean energy projects.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">[6D.MD1(1)]: In June 2021 the Dutch Ministry of Infrastructure and Water Management (Inspectie Leefomgeving en Transport, ILT) stated that the practice of oil companies in the Netherlands to export low quality fuels to Africa, contributing to severe air pollution in West African cities, is in violation with the duty of care of the Dutch Environmental Management Act (Wet milieubeheer). ILT announced it will address the companies operating in the Netherlands about this, so that in the future fuels will be exported that are comparable to European quality requirements, with the aim of preventing further environmental and health damage in Africa. This happened after in 2016 and 2017 Milieudefensie had supported the Swiss NGO Public Eye and six CSOs in four West African countries by addressing in the Netherlands the export of poor quality fuels that cause severe air pollution in West African cities (these refined fuels, which have a high sulphur content, mainly originate from Amsterdam, Rotterdam and Antwerp). Milieudefensie&apos;s press and advocacy work resulted in massive media attention in the Netherlands in September 2016, and support for the Swiss and West African CSOs&apos; pleas from Dutch MPs, the Dutch Minister of Foreign Trade and Development Cooperation, Ms. Ploumen (who called the practice &#x2018;a crying shame&#x2019; on Dutch public television), and the Municipality of Amsterdam (the owner of the city&apos;s large port). On 5 December 2016, Minister Ploumen, together with the Nigerian Minister for the Environment, organised the conference &#x2018;Clean Fuels for West Africa&#x2019; with the participation of EU member states, West African states, UNEP, OECD, the Dutch ports, fuel companies, West African CSOs and Milieudefensie. Dutch parliament remained attentive on the topic in subsequent years (in some cases informed by Milieudefensie). [Counted also under 6SCS2].</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">[5D.FoEE1(1,1x)]: On 10 March 2021 the European Parliament passed a resolution with recommendations to the European Commission for legislation on corporate due diligence and corporate accountability. The resolution calls for a law to hold EU transnational corporations accountable for their impact on human rights and the environment overseas. The resolution proposes legislation for parent company liability (civil and administrative) for the impacts on the environment and people of operations of their subsidiaries, a human rights and environmental due diligence obligation for the full value chain of all companies, better access to European courts for victims of corporate operations around the world, and strong sanctions and fines for companies that break the rules. The resolution also calls for including climate change impacts in the law. The European Commission subsequently drafted a proposal for a Directive on Sustainable Corporate Governance. The proposal was expected to be launched Autumn 2021 but has been delayed untill February 2022 [Not counted]. FoE Europe together with a.o. ECCJ has been actively campaigning on this topic with numerous meetings with MEPs, European Commissioners, cabinet members of most DGs, publising research that highlights the need for an EU law on corporate accountability, media work, bringing cases of affected LLUMIC communities to decision-makers and the media, and involving the public. Milieudefensie contributed a.o. by participating in the European Commission&apos;s public consultation, and by informing FoE Europe and ECCJ about options for climate due diligence. [Counted under subindicator x as well, as this activity aims at increasing the power of civil society vis-&#xE0;-vis corporations by developing mandatory environmental and human rights due diligence (mEHRDD) law]. [5D.MD2(2,2x)]: 11 March 2021 four political parties presented to Dutch Parliament a Dutch Bill for Responsible and Sustainable International Business Conduct (Wet verantwoord en duurzaam internationaal ondernemen). The law imposes a duty of care to prevent negative impacts on people and the environment of all companies in all economic sectors that are registered in the Netherlands or sell products or services on the Dutch market. This duty of care also applies to negative impacts in companies&#x2019; global value chains. The bill furthermore imposes a due diligence obligation on all companies over a certain size, and also applies to letterbox companies. The bill arranges that companies are obliged to provide remedy to affected rights-holders and explicitly states that failure to do so is considered violation of the law. The bill includes administrative, civil and criminal liability and enforcement. Milieudefensie contributed to the development of this bill via the Dutch CSOs&apos; MVO Platform (as a member of the platform&apos;s Steering Group and Working Group on Legislation), and successfully proposed that the bill explicitly states that the arrangements for environmental harm also hold for greenhouse gas emissions and the climate. Climate was also included in the &apos;Bouwstenen voor IMVO-wetgeving&apos; letter to Dutch Parliament from Dutch Minister of Foreign Trade and Development Cooperation De Bruijn from 5 November 2021. 2 December 2021, in a debate in Parliament Minister De Bruijn announced that due to the &#x201C;very disappointing&#x201D; and &#x201C;indefinite&#x201D; delays at the European Commission, the Dutch government will immediately start work on ambitious national binding due diligence legislation based on the OECD Guidelines and UNGPs. 15 December 2021 in its coalition agreement the new Dutch government confirmed that &#x201C;In the EU, the Netherlands promotes international corporate social responsibility legislation and implements national ICSR legislation that takes into account a level playing field with neighboring countries and implementation of possible EU regulations.&#x201D; Milieudefensie based its inputs in the policy process on the positions and findings of Southern CSOs represented in FoE International&apos;s Economic Justice Programme, Climate Justice &amp; Energy Programme, and Forests &amp; Biodiversity Programme. Milieudefensie contributed to the development of judicial thinking required for this law, and to public and political support in the Netherlands for mandatory environmental and human rights due diligence (mEHRDD) legislation a.o. with research, conducted in collaboration with a Nigerian CSO, on the responsibility of a Dutch oil company for environmental damage in Nigeria, and with research on the judicial responsibility of the same Dutch oil company for its climate impact, and furthermore with a public campaign and a petition that gathered more than 40.000 signatures. [Counted are Dutch Parliament and the Dutch government]. [Counted under subindicator x as well, as this activity aims at increasing the power of civil society vis-&#xE0;-vis corporations by developing mandatory environmental and human rights due diligence (mEHRDD) law].</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">[6E.MD1(3)]: Three Dutch investors (pension funds) announced in 2021 that they quit investments in fossil fuel producers. In the framework of the Eerlijke Geldwijzer (EGW), in September and October 2021 Milieudefensie coordinated the publication of two studies on the energy portfolios of investors, &apos;Climate change commitments of financial institutions active in the Netherlands&apos; and &apos;Fossil fuel versus renewable financing by financial institutions active in the Netherlands&apos; revealing that per ultimo 2020 still 88% or 34 billion euros of Dutch banks&apos;, insurance companies&apos; and pension funds&apos; investments in the energy sector are in fossil fuels. The studies concern an update of EGW&apos;s energy investment studies from 2010, 2015 and 2018. Milieudefensie is involved in the EGW to improve the investment policies of the financial sector in line with the demands from LLUMIC CSOs in FoE International&apos;s global Programmes on Economic Justice; Climate Justice &amp; Energy; Forests &amp; Biodiversity; and Food Sovereignty. Milieudefensie advocates at the Dutch and EU government levels for a legal obligation for financial institutions to report on their climate impact, and to align their portfolios with the 1.5 degree goal of the Paris Climate Agreement.

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">[G.FoEE/MD1]: In the FGG programme FoE Europe&apos;s and Milieudefensie&apos;s work aims at system change. With this change the organisations aim to solve systemic environmental and climate problems that impact nature and people in the Global South. This impact, that concerns people&apos;s and communities&apos; livelihood resources, human rights, community rights, land rights and other rights situation, and social and economic circumstances, has been documented by many research reports (UN, academics, CSOs) to cause or aggravate gender injustice. This happens while a fault of the system is that women are underrepresented in decision-making. Also FoE International in the past decades has issued many studies on gender that inform our goals, strategies and interventions, e.g. &apos;Women and food sovereignty&apos;, &apos;For the land that feeds us&apos;, &apos;Why Gender Justice and Dismantling Patriarchy?&apos;, &apos;If it&#x2019;s not feminist, it&#x2019;s not just&apos;.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">[O.FoEE/MD1]: All FGG work of FoE Europe and Milieudefensie is part of and aims to contribute to the implementation of the strategies and achieving the goals of one or more of FoE International&apos;s global programmes Economic Justice; Climate Justice &amp; Energy; Forests &amp; Biodiversity; and Food Sovereignty. The goals and strategies of these programmes are jointly developed by the FoE member groups who participate in them, from the Global South and North. Furthermore, the work consists of specific collaborations between FoE Europe and/or Milieudefensie on the one hand, and specific CSOs from LLUMICs on the other hand (from within and from outside the FoE network). Such collaboration is developed by all partners involved. It can be initiated by LLUMIC groups as as well as by FoE Europe or Milieudefensie. The latter occurs for instance if these organisations find a new development in the Global North that poses a (potential) threat to the environment and people in LLUMICs. In 2021 Milieudefensie and its Latin American partners have been working on developing their concept of &apos;case work&apos;. There is a joint need for all partners in the North/South collaboration to rise above the level of individual, local cases (one location and community affected by one operation of a company). This is because the problem of fossil fuel expansion in the Global South is larger than problems at the local level. Across the region, the same problems are at play at the local and national levels, and therefore at the regional level, as the oil/gas industry is employing the same tactics everywhere. The industry is acting in violation of the Paris Climate Agreement by still expanding the fossil frontier in the Global South. The &apos;case&apos; thus has become: The continued expansion of oil and gas extraction by the fossil fuel industry in the Global South.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">[3.FoEE1(3,3x)]: FoE Europe has supported one CSO from an African LLUMIC and three CSOs from Latin America (of which two from an LLUMIC) with strategy development and communications, in order to increase their capacity to advocate on the environmental, climate and human rights impacts of the Energy Charter Treaty (ECT) and the EU-Mercosur Trade Agreement respectively. The African CSO advocated at its national government on the proposed expansion of the ECT to African countries. The Latin American CSOs a.o. launched the reports &apos;Brazilian meat and the EU-Mercosur Agreement&apos; and &apos;Ethanol expansion and the EU-Mercosur trade deal&apos;. Furthermore, FoE Europe together with S2B (Seattle to Brussels Network) continued advocacy at the European Commission on the environmental, social and other problems of EU-Mercosur. The CSOs&apos; advocacy further contributed to sustainability and human rights issues getting a more prominent place in trade and investments negotiations. [See also 5C.FoEE/MD1]. [Counted under subindicator x as well, as the work aims to prevent the negative impacts of FTAs and investment treaties on democratic decision-making, and on the position of civil society vis-&#xE0;-vis the corporate sector]. [3.FoEE2(1)]: FoE Europe, in a working group of Yes to Life No to Mining (YLNM, a global solidarity network of and for communities, organisations and networks who are standing up for their right to say no to mining and advancing life-sustaining, post-extractive alternatives), strengthened the capacity of CSOs from Europe and the Global South by co-leading on regular calls where EU policies relevant to raw materials mining and consumption are discussed, and joint strategies and actions are developed. FoE Europe led in drafting of a joint YLNM paper &apos;Driving destructive mining: EU Civil Society denounces EU raw material plans in European Green Deal&apos; published May 2021. In it, the global YLNM coalition of 180+ community platforms, human rights and environmental CSOs, and academics from 36 nations is calling on the EU to address the systemic issues underpinning endless extractivism and turn the tide toward a more just and sustainable future to put urgent measures in place to achieve absolute reductions in demand for - and consumption of - raw materials in Europe. [Counted is the global YLNM network]. [3.MD3(1)]: Milieudefensie together with Both ENDS, OCI and FoE Europe provided a CSO from Mozambique with access to Dutch, UK and European media, to Dutch, UK and European politicians, and, via a freedom of information act procedure, to Dutch government information, and with that contributed to an increased advocacy capacity of the CSO. The CSOs jointly used it to address at the Dutch government its ECA support for a gas development project in Mozambique, the impact of the project on the environment, communities and the security situation in the country, and the incompatibility of the ECA support with the Paris Climate Agreement. The CSOs were successful in raising public and political awareness. State Secretary for Finance Mr. Vijlbrief on 9 December 2021 in a parliamentary debate promised an independent review of the decision-making process leading to the ECA support for the Mozambique gas project and the security situation around it. [See also 5C.MD3]. [3.MD4(8)]: Milieudefensie continued its support (financial, networking, communication) to a network of CSOs in Latin America, from Honduras [3 CSOs], Colombia, Brazil, Bolivia and Argentina, and a regional CSO, all dealing with the expansion of the fossil fuel industry in Latin America. In 2021 with financial support from Milieudefensie, the groups continued mapping of the fossil fuel industry attempts to extend the extraction frontier to new areas inland and especially in deep sea waters, conducted participatory research on the (potential) impacts on and resistance of local communities (such as against oil spills affecting marine and terrestrial ecosystems, employment, local income, food security and the livelihoods of fisher and peasants communities, and the disappearance and murder of EHRDs from these communities), and conducted research on corporate capture of governmental decision-making processes around this expansion (including the building-up of infrastructure required for fossil fuel transport, such as harbours), and corporate lobby aiming at a.o. obtaining concessions, deregulation and tax advantages. The CSOs published research reports on the oil and gas expansion in the region: &apos;Situacio&#x301;n de pescadores/as del Golfo de Fonseca: Proyecto centroamericano de accio&#x301;n cri&#x301;tica frente a la explotacio&#x301;n de hidrocarburos en la regio&#x301;n&apos;; &apos;Situacio&#x301;n del Petro&#x301;leo y Gas en los Pai&#x301;ses de Centroame&#x301;rica&apos;; &apos;Informe de Actualizacio&#x301;n sobre Exploracio&#x301;n y Subsecuente Explotacio&#x301;n de Petro&#x301;leo y Gas en el Caribe de Honduras&apos;; &apos;Frontera hidrocarburi&#x301;fera: Expansio&#x301;n y violaciones de los derechos en Sudame&#x301;rica&apos;; &apos;El plan de reactivaci&#xF3;n del Upstream 2021 o la b&#xFA;squeda de hidrocarburos que contin&#xFA;a siendo una amenaza e incertidumbre&apos;. The CSOs used the research and publications for strategizing and increasing collaboration within the existing network of CSOs and communities and beyond (with trade unions and local authorities), in advocacy, organising public events, communication and media work on the fossil fuel developments and to create public debate and political awareness of the governmental and corporate conduct as regards oil and gas expansion in the countries, also of projected oil and gas exploitation operations that were (or the scope of which was) not known yet to local municipalities and communities before the CSOs informed them, and to develop positions, statements and alternative plans. The CSOs and their networks of communities enhanced their knowledge, analytical and strategizing capacities through the exchange of experiences (organising themselves in their struggle against the oil industry and in defending and developing their livelihoods) in tens of regional, national and local gatherings and trainings (physical or via webinars) of CSOs and communities, peasants and fishermen/women and peasants and fishermen federations and movements, in some cases also with municipalities, universities, human rights organisations and others.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">[2.FoEE1(6,6x)]: In October 2021 FoE Europe co-published a briefing &apos;Global solutions to global problems: Why EU legislation and a UN instrument on corporate acccountability must be complementary&apos;, presented to members of the Global Campaign to Reclaim Peoples Sovereignty, Dismantle Corporate Power and Stop Impunity (a network of over 250 social movements, CSOs, trade unions and communities affected by the activities of transnational corporations). The briefing presents the upcoming EU law on sustainable corporate governance, and highlights expected good elements, loopholes and weaknesses, the time-line for the law making process, and how it relates to the UN Treaty on Business and Human Rights. The briefing aims at increasing the capacity of Southern CSOs for lobby of EU and UN institutions. [Counted are the 5 CSOs from the Global Campaign with whom FoE Europe cooperates most closely, 2 from African and 3 from Latin American LLUMICs]. [Counted under subindicator x as well, as this activity aims at increasing the power of civil society vis-&#xE0;-vis corporations by developing mandatory environmental and human rights due diligence (mEHRDD) law]. [2.MD2(+17)]: Milieudefensie together with Banktrack and OCI contributed to the development of research capacities of 18 CSOs from Africa (regional), Ghana, Togo, Nigeria, DRC, Uganda, Mozambique, Senegal, Namibia, Botswana and Zimbabwe, in a collaboration aiming at showing the environmental, social and economic impact of ECA-supported fossil fuel development in Africa, and advocating a shift from ECA support for fossil fuel development to ECA support for sustainable energy development. A research report was eventually published in 2022 and will be reported upon in the next year&apos;s report under indicator 3. [One CSO already counted above]. [2.MD3(+10,+10x)]: Milieudefensie contributed to the development of thinking amongst CSOs and experts about the subjects of (i) a duty of care for fossil fuel companies as regards their climate impact, a topic considered relevant for combating climate change, a.o. by LLUMIC CSOs participating in FoE International&apos;s Climate Justice and Energy Programme, and (ii) a duty of care for transnational corporations for the environmental and human rights impacts of their subsidiaries, a topic considered relevant for combating climate change, a.o. by LLUMIC CSOs participating in FoE International&apos;s Economic Justice Programme. Milieudefensie contributed to the knowledge of the global environmental CSO community via publications, seminars (a.o. &apos;The future of climate change litigation&apos; in the official programme of the UNFCCC COP26, hosted by Milieudefensie) and webinars about the judicial developments on the matters, a.o. resulting from a court case against a Dutch oil company on its climate impact [initiated by Milieudefensie in 2018, outside the framework of this programme] and a court case against a Dutch oil company on oil pollution in Nigeria [initiated by Nigerian farmers and fishermen together with Milieudefensie in 2008, outside the framework of this programme]. Both court cases came to a verdict in 2021 [Counted are the CSOs with whom Milieudefensie cooperates most closely on the topics and that have not already been counted above: 3 from Asian and 7 from Latin American LLUMICs. Counted under subindicator x as well, as this activity aims at increasing the power of civil society over corporations by developing knowledge of the judicial possibilities amongst CSOs to defend their interests]. [2.MD/FoEE4(4,3x,0g)]: Milieudefensie and FoE Europe contributed to capacity development of 4 additional CSOs. Description included under indicator 3. [3 CSOs also counted under subindicator x].</narrative>
