   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Key strategies that we will use towards these outcomes are collaborative lobby and advocacy with IPLCs towards international (e.g. UNFCCC, CBD, OECD, UN Human Rights Commission (UNHRC), UN special mechanisms) and regional policy making bodies (e.g European Union, ASEAN, African Union (AU), ACHPR, IACHR, PARLASUR) as well as the Dutch government, finance, agro-commodity, extractives and energy sectors and international private sector oriented forums (e.g. GIIN, UNPRI); strengthening social movements and networks of solidarity; public awareness campaigns; and joint capacity strengthening, knowledge exchange and cross-learning, monitoring and research.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Our work at the regional and international level seeks to contribute to the long-term objectives of all three pathways in the Theory of Change:

A.	IPLCs sustainably govern increased areas of forest;
B.	Governments and agro-commodity, extractives, energy and infrastructure sectors no longer drive deforestation and address citizens&#x2019; concerns to protect forests and human rights; 
C.	Citizens enjoy human and women&#x2019;s rights and safely participate in social movements.</narrative>
