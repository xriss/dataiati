   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project is addressing the critical emergency needs of the most vulnerable populations living in the territory of Luhansk, NGCA, with a particular focus on people with disabilities, their families and women-headed households. The intervention focuses on complex multi-sectoral assistance in Protection, WASH and Food Security amp Livelihoods (FSL) sectors and is in line with First Standard Allocation in response to the protracted humanitarian crises in eastern Ukraine. 
In the proposed project, PIN will utilise its well-established operational capacity in Luhansk NGCA to support 1130 beneficiaries with Protection, WASH and FSL assistance over a period of 12 months.
Under Protection sector PIN will provide quality needs-based non-discriminatory protection assistance, in particular individual target protection assistance  for 50 children with disabilities and access to community spaces to at least 80 vulnerable people and communities residing in Luhansk NGCA. By continuing individual target assistance (ITA) and introducing a more community-oriented approach, including involvement of the local supporters into all activities within current project, PIN aims at ensuring sustainability and effectiveness of humanitarian assistance.
Besides that, PIN will provide a complex voucher support for 500 beneficiaries (children), to improve food security and hygiene and sanitation situation for children with disability and their families with provision of additional special-care hygiene kits to the most vulnerable households in need (200 out of 500 beneficiaries).
In addition, PIN will contribute to FSL sector by assisting 100 women-headed households with agriculture support. Thus, PIN aims at providing means of livelihood to women-headed households, which is in line with the Allocation strategy as well as at contributing to optimised use of water resources in the region with low water security.
Within WASH intervention, PIN will implement rehabilitation of water systems in educational and/or health facilities, situated along the LoC, so that people, users of those facilities (300 in total) could enjoy access to sufficient amount of safe water and improve overall hygiene and sanitation conditions, especially in the light of COVID-19 pandemic.
Overall, PIN will ensure protection mainstreaming throughout the project by strict compliance with Humanitarian Principles, PIN Code of Conduct, Safeguarding Policy and COVID-19 Standard Operation Procedures. For transparency, accountability purposes and timely improvements, PIN will conduct regular monitoring of the activities, due reporting and provide beneficiaries and other stakeholders with clear information on Complaints, Feedback and Response Mechanism (CFRM).
For better coordination within the humanitarian sector in terms of better coverage of needs of the affected population and complementarity of the services, PIN will continue cooperating with present humanitarian actors, relevant clusters and other stakeholders, including the local authorities.</narrative>
