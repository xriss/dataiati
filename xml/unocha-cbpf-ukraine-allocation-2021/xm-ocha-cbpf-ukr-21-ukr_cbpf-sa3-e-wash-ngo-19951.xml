   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The objective of the proposed project is to address the acute humanitarian needs of the conflict-affected population of Donetska oblast, GCA while promoting solutions to the affected communities to strengthen their resilience.
The project is aimed at the most vulnerable groups of the population, such as elderly, people with disabilities, incl. those with chronic diseases and female-headed households (HH) as well as conflict-affected boys and girls residing in Toretska ATC of Donetska oblast. Within the framework of the project it is planned to implement the following activities: 
- distributing hygiene kits to people with special needs to prevent deterioration of their physical and psychological conditions
- distributing small hygiene family kits (HKs) to HHs with people with special needs
- distributing portable toilets to elderly and impaired to improve the sanitary conditions at HH level
- distributing IT equipment, namely laptops for teachers of secondary education facilities along with the capacity building of teachers on digital literacy to ensure a continuous learning process in case of a lockdown caused by the COVID-19 outbreak
- distributing institutional cleaning kits to ensure a safe learning environment in terms of the COVID-19 outbreak. 
During the project implementation, the special needs of men and women will be taken into account, considering the aspect of age. Particular attention will be paid to the matters of personal hygiene and sanitation, which is generally of a sensitive nature and should be treated with privacy and observing dignity. For instance, the gender of a beneficiary will be taken into account during the planning and conducting of home visits. Moreover, while composing the hygiene kits, individual characteristics of the beneficiaries, e.g. size of diapers, will be taken into account. Also, the specification of the IT equipment is in line with the requirements of the Ministry of Education and Science, and in a quantity according to the gaps, considering the Government program.
During the project implementation, there might be some challenges related to security, bureaucratic and legal obstacles, including restrictions due to the COVID-19 epidemic. In this regard, special attention will be paid to risks management. For that purpose, a detailed analysis of potential risks, indicating proposed mitigation measures have been elaborated (see the attached Risk Analysis amp Mitigation Matrix). 
NEW WAY (NW) is planning to implement the project on its own. NW is a local NGO that continues activities started in 2016 by German NGO arche noVa. Over the years, NW has become a noticeable actor in the WASH sector, supporting the conflict-affected population through the implementation of relief projects in eastern Ukraine. Furthermore, NW has expertise in the implementation of social infrastructure rehabilitation projects, including the education sector. In particular, similar projects have been implemented with about 5000 individual and institutional hygiene kits distributed and over 200 PC&#x2019;s provided to education institutions. There is a well-established structure as well as necessary technical and support staff in place to oversee the implementation of the project activities. There is a clear awareness of the local context as well as principles of the humanitarian response.</narrative>
