  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The objective of the proposed project is to address the acute humanitarian needs of the conflict-affected population of Donetska oblast, NGCA. The project is aimed at the most vulnerable groups of the population, such as the elderly, people with disabilities, incl. those with chronic diseases and female-headed households (HH). In the framework of the project, it is planned to implement the following activities: 
- distributing PSN hygiene kits (HKs) to people with special needs to prevent deterioration of their physical and psychological conditions
- distributing Family HKs to HHs with people with special needs to maintain an adequate level of sanitation at a HH level
- distributing portable toilets to the elderly and impaired persons to improve sanitary conditions at a HH level. 
During the project implementation, the specific needs of men and women will be taken into account, considering the age aspect. Particular attention will be paid to the matter of personal hygiene and sanitation, which is generally of a sensitive nature and should be treated with privacy and observing dignity. For instance, the gender of a beneficiary will be taken into account during the planning and conducting of home visits. Moreover, while composing the HKs, beneficiaries&#x2019; individual characteristics, e.g., size of diapers, will be taken into account. During the project implementation, there might be some challenges related to security, bureaucratic and legal obstacles, as well as concerning access to NGCA, including COVID-19 restrictions. In this regard, particular attention will be paid to risks management. For that purpose, a detailed analysis of potential risks indicating proposed mitigation measures has been elaborated (see the attached Risk Analysis amp Mitigation Matrix). 
NEW WAY (NW) is planning to implement the project in partnership with a local NGO, namely ICF Mira (Mira), to maximize available resources, e.g. in terms of access and organizational capacity. NW is a local NGO that continues activities started in 2016 by German NGO arche noVa. Over the years, NW has become a noticeable humanitarian actor in the WASH sector, supporting the conflict-affected population in eastern Ukraine. There is a well-established organizational structure as well as necessary technical and support staff in place to oversee the implementation of the project activities.
With this regard, NW will take the role of a leading agency with the following duties:
- compiling program documents, incl. Logframe, Workplan, etc.
- overall coordination and management of the project implementation
- carrying out procurement of goods and services
- arranging delivery of goods to NGCA within the humanitarian convoy
- reporting to UHF
- monitoring the progress of the project implementation and evaluating its results.
In turn, Mira, as a local NGO represented and registered in the NGCA, will perform as a sub-implementing partner. The organization has satisfactory experience in implementing humanitarian projects, including those in partnership with INGOs, due to which the partner has established working relationships with local authorities. There is a clear understanding of the local context, as well as principles of the humanitarian response. 
Within the framework of the project implementation, Mira will perform the following duties: 
- conducting needs assessment
- accreditation of the project and cargo in the NGCA
- coordination of the activities with de-facto authorities
- distributing goods.
Although NW has limited access to the NGCA, it is planned to locally employ a Field MampE Officer to monitor the activities for the entire project implementation period. See a detailed description of the tasks and responsibilities in the Budget tab.</narrative>
