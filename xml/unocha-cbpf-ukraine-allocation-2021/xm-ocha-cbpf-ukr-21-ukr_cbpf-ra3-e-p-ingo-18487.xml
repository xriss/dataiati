  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Save the Children International (SCI) operates in all conflict-affected areas in a neutral and impartial manner and identifies critical needs in education and child protection, especially for those living in proximity to the contact line. Save the Children&#x2019;s Global Response Strategy has the overall goal to protect the most vulnerable children and communities from infection, slow down the transmission and address secondary impacts of COVID-19 related to health, education and protection specifically in the areas already impacted by emergency.

The project will be implemented in Donetska NGCA. SCI will support schools and kindergartens with learning materials (to cover existing gap caused by 7 years of ongoing conflict) and hygiene materials as protective measures against COVID-19 and Safe School reopening following expected waves of localized school lockdowns. The economic and humanitarian situation in NGCA is anticipated to deteriorate further as a result of the additional COVID-19 restrictions. The distribution of individual learning kits will help conflict affected boys and girls to have all necessary materials to continue their education as well as to minimize economic hardship and financial burden of their families in Donetska NGCA. The project will increase resilience and reduce vulnerability of the conflict-affected boys and girls and their caregivers through provision of individual psychosocial support .

Pre-existing and now further aggravated restrictions on humanitarian access to Donetska NGCA mean that only a few partners (including SCI) have been able to respond to growing humanitarian needs in these areas in recent years. This situation has led to the fact that large numbers of men, women, boys and girls are still in need of humanitarian aid in NGCA (HNO) and specifically children and children with disabilities as one of the most vulnerable categories of people. Existing humanitarian crisis will now be worsen as Entry-Exist Check Points (EECPs) have been closed for a year and for many HH it limits the access to many essential services and sources of income. 

This project will be implemented by SCI and locally accredited partner DDC. SCI has an office in Donetsk NGCA and is regularly communicating with de facto authorities to negotiate access, which has proven successful. SCI has been implementing similar projects for the past five years in Donetska NGCA with great success and high rates of beneficiary satisfaction. Partner will obtain project accreditation from de-facto authorities and request list of schools and kindergartens that require support. This project will be supported by SCI&#x2019;s Education and Child Protection technical advisors and implemented by a team of experienced humanitarian staff. Protection, conflict sensitivity, disability inclusion and gender issues will be mainstreamed throughout the Action.

To mainstream COVID-19 prevention during the implementation of all activities, SCI will print and distribute education and communications (IEC) materials on COVID-19.


As a result of project implementation, in total 7,070 individuals will benefit from provided assistance. The total budget of the project is 350,000 USD</narrative>
