   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Strengthening of child protection system by implementing Case Management approach and capacity building of service providers in Donetsk and Luhansk GCA</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Responding to the protection needs of vulnerable children affected by the conflict SCI will create Case Management Unit (CMU), that sits with a local partner, with the coverage of Schastynska, Nyzhneteplivska, Ocheretynska, Toretska and Svitlodarska  ATCs. The capacity of the new CMU will be strengthened by attracting highly experienced staff hired and trained within previous projects. This CMU will manage cases referred in targeted geographic area in particular from schools, health facilities, civil society organizations etc. SCI will arrange joint trainings for service providers and SCI CM staff on the topics, including but not limited, of CPiE, inclusion, gender equality, SGBV, referrals etc. This activity will contribute to the implementation of humanitarian-development nexus as SCI builds the capacity of social services to address the increasing needs of children. SCI also adds an important child-focused and child participation approach to the CM, which is different from the social services that have a more generic focus on families in vulnerable situations. Where feasible adolescence will be encouraged to take part in a dialogue with local authorities to draw attention to any existing gaps in service provision for children.  SCI will continue implementing its common approach &quot;Steps to Protect&quot; (S2P), ensuring that a structured approach is taken to identify, assess, plan, implement, review and close the case when the child&apos;s protection rights are met. The training of the CMU staff will be focused on identifying and helping the most at-risk children. Cases will be selected on the basis of vulnerability and risk criteria. Cases at high risk of violence, neglect and abuse will be prioritized. Parents of children will go through the series of sessions on Positive Parenting course. Fathers and male caregivers will be encouraged to participate in these activities, to ensure meaningful participation for the benefit of children and caregivers. The COVID-19 pandemic increased violence against children, hence protection and education services are highly needed. SCI will deliver training for teachers on distance learning to build their capacity in organizing online education during COVID-19 pandemic.

It is recognized that children with disabilities are at higher risk of violence in the home, so case workers will be trained on inclusion and working with children with disabilities. The CMU staff will be provided with the updated service mapping for specific locations (Protection Cluster and GBV Sub-Cluster) to inform the internal mappings and to disseminate this information among service provides and beneficiaries. 
One-time support from an emergency assistance fund will be made available, based on vulnerability criteria to support immediate needs for referral or other essential services, including related to disability, in line with the CM plan and the IASC CM Guidelines. The procedure for emergency cash support is described in the CM Fund guidance (attached as Annex). Moreover, 530 households facing poverty who are in need of livelihood support will be supported through distribution of MPCGs covering 3 months. SCI is ensuring strong cooperation with local partners and local communities throughout project cycle in order to ensure smooth exit strategy, and make sure that the beneficiaries receive certain follow-up support or are referred to relevant state social bodies in order to receive range of services mitigating their vulnerability and building their resilience further after project ends. 

As a result of project implementation, in total 6,395 individuals (213 men, 867 women, 2445 boys, 2870 girls) will benefit from provided assistance</narrative>
