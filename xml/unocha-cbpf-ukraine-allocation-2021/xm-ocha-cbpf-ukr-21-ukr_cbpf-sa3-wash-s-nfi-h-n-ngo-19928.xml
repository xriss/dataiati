   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The proposed intervention will be carried out during 2021-2022 in the Donetsk NGCA to cover the most vulnerable groups of the population of preferential categories most susceptible to the negative consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic: - sedentary and bedridden patients, - elderly people with chronic diseases, - disabled people, - children from large families, - large families with low incomes, - children from orphanages and orphanages
The COVID-19 pandemic has hit Ukraine, causing massive restrictions and blockages, including on the Line of Contact (LoC) between the GCA and NGCA. The target population groups previously had limited access (physically and economically) to medical equipment to improve patient mobility, hygiene items before isolation, and now the situation has become more risky for them, increasing their vulnerability, affecting safety. The YO Maximal humanitarian project is aimed at supporting people living in areas that are a priority for humanitarian intervention. In order to ease the burden during the difficult economic situation aggravated by the COVID-19 pandemic, and as part of countering the negative consequences of Covid-19, the YO Maximal plans to distribute hygiene kits among sedentary and bedridden patients, large families with a low standard of living. Orphanages and boarding schools where children of different ages live will also receive hygiene items to create a safer environment in the conditions of COVID-19. in orphanages and boarding schools. Special attention is paid to providing support to women (the kits are equipped with feminine hygiene accessories). Hygiene kits will cover the needs for 3 months, increasing the resilience of vulnerable groups of the population. In preparation for the winter period of vulnerable groups of the population of preferential categories, strengthening their resistance to the negative consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Maximal Youth Organization plans to distribute NFI sets with children&apos;s clothing among children from large families with a low standard of living. NFI sets with children&apos;s clothing will be issued with mandatory consideration of the gender and age of children, compliance with the size range and will cover their needs in the winter period of 2021-2022. To strengthen the stability of sedentary patients, people with disabilities during the COVID &#x2013; 19 pandemic, the Maximal Youth Organization plans to distribute medical equipment, rehabilitation items for sedentary people, disabled people, people with chronic diseases. Medical equipment, funds for increasing mobility will be distributed among the specified preferential categories of the population and will cover the recipient&apos;s needs for personal mobility means for the next 3 years. As part of an integrated approach, Maximal also plans to support the dissemination of IEC materials so that target beneficiaries and their family members, members from close epidemiological environments are more aware of COVID-19 protection and hygiene measures. The project will be implemented by YO Maximal with the partner support of the local accredited partner charity organization &quot;DDC Charitable Foundation&quot;. DDC is officially accredited in the Donetsk NGCA with an open office. They regularly communicate with the de facto authorities on a number of issues of program accreditation, granting access, reporting to the de facto authorities, etc. Together with DDC, Maximal successfully implemented: 1) Wintering project in 2019 (funded by SCI). 2) Project to increase the resilience of IDP families, bedridden patients and receive protection as part of the COVID-19 response in 2020 (funded by UHF). As for staffing, YO Maximal has trained people who have experience in implementing a humanitarian project in the Donetsk NGCA in 2014-2020. We guarantee that the proposed assistance will be provided to the most vulnerable beneficiaries in a timely manner, in accordance with the requirements and quality.</narrative>
