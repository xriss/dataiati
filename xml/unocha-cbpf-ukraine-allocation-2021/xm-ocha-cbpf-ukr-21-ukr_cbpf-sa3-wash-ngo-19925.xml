   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project continues Caritas Ukraine&apos;s strategy to improve the access of local people to safe water through repairs or restoration of existing water supply systems or construction of new sources of drinking water in local communities. The results achieved through the implementation of such a strategy have a factor of stability and opportunities for further development of water supply infrastructure of local communities.
Caritas Ukraine is seeing $ 390,000 for replace and modernize 10,000 m of the central water supply system in the Maryinsky district.
The project provides implementation HRP2021
Strategic goal 3: Ensure implementation of a humanitarian exit strategy in Government-controlled areas from 2021-2023
The project is being carried out in cooperation with local administrations and utilities, involved in the project from the planning stage,  implementation to the intervention impact assessment.
The technical part of the project is aimed at replacing a part of the centralized water supply network, which is 98% worn out and has losses of up to 75% of water.
The new water supply system is designed to improve the quality of water in the locations to the level of &quot;safe water&quot;.
The new system will enable the population to gain access to water in areas that were not supplied with water due to the high level of losses in the system and will reduce the need for water trucking. It is expected to be able to reduce losses of the water supply system by 30%, saving up to 22,500 m3 of water monthly.
Caritas Ukraine has been operating in the WASH sector since 2014, organizing the distribution of drinking water in the combat zone of Donetsk and Luhansk regions. In 2017 the CU humanitarian response strategy in the WASH sector was revised and the organization focused on finding solutions that could deliver sustainable results and be complementary to community-based projects. Since 2018, Caritas Ukraine has been successfully implementing this strategy in cooperation with local Caritas organizations.
The intervention is based on HNO 2021 and HRP 2021, inquiries received by Caritas Ukraine from representatives of local administrations, a needs assessment organized by both the CU and other NGOs.
In 2021, we see an increase in the number of people in need of support in the WASH sector to 3.1 million people. Among them 54% are women, 14% are children, 41% are elderly and 13% are people with disabilities. In addition to the fact that the population continues to need bottled drinking water, the centralized water supply system needs urgent repairs and modernization. According to the WASH cluster, of the 5.4 million people living in the Luhansk and Donetsk oblasts, 1.73 million need water. 451,000 children in kindergartens, homes and schools also need help.
When preparing the project proposal, a risks analysis was carried out.
Caritas Ukraine strongly supervises the feedback collection mechanism to ensure accountability, safeguarding and protection principles, advocacy appeals using specially trained local person and proper communication methods. Monitoring as part of Caritas MEAL system will be consistent of baseline (needs assessment, already conducted) and endline survey (to be conducted by MampE staff before the end of the project). Further learning process will allow improving both operational and programming approach of Caritas. The key indicators that Caritas used for evaluation of humanitarian intervention are based on criteria: effectiveness, sufficiency, relevance and accessibility.
The project implementation is in coordination with WASH cluster relatively to methodologies of approaches, target settlements and groups and contingency measures. Caritas Ukraine participates in Cluster Coordination Meeting and use Coordination Matrix tools.
Duplication will be avoided due to national and field coordination with cluster and humanitarian actors, communication with local municipalities, authorities and OCHA in geography of interventio</narrative>
