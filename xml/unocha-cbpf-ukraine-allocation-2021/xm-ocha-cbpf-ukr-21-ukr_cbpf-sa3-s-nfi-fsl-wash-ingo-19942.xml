   <narrative xml:lang="EN">As the armed conflict in eastern Ukraine entered its eighth year, civilians remain the most deeply impacted. On top of dealing with years of violent clashes, a constant fear of shelling, and the threat of landmines/unexploded ordinances, people living close to the line of contact have had to reckon with the onset of a global pandemic in 2020. Facing an epidemiological crisis coupled with an ongoing conflict has proved challenging. The intersection of COVID-19 with the conflict in eastern Ukraine stifled economic growth, strained the health system, and tested the socio-economic circumstances of many. The 2021 HRP states that 3.4 million people remain in need of humanitarian assistance between the GCA and NGCA, a non-improvement from 2020 figures. 
COVID-19 is predicted to continue negatively impacting Ukraine, and the ECA, significantly through 2021. Predicted GDP growth in 2021 is half as much as predicted pre-COVID (1.5% versus the predicted 3% for 2020) and in terms of the progression of the epidemiological situation, it will be incredibly difficult to get an accurate grasp of the number of cases contended with this coming year.

In this context it is crucial to continue supporting the most vulnerable conflict-affected people to ensure they can meet their basic needs in the short term and improve their resilience. SCI thus proposes a 6-month intervention which will help to minimize economic hardship and financial burden of the most vulnerable population in Donetska NGCA. SCI will thus provide food/hygiene vouchers and in-kind assistance (fuel) to the most vulnerable in Donetska NGCA to meet basic and winterization needs through the winter months when needs are demonstrably higher. People residing in urban settlements in the 5-20 km zone usually have better access to markets and centralized energy grid and will be supported by SCI with provision of food/hygiene vouchers. While in rural areas, people depend on solid fuel for individual heaters and will be supported by SCI with coal distribution, as the Shelter Cluster continues to recommend delivery of the fuel in kind, as markets do not function sufficiently in such areas to allow use of a cash/vouchers modality.

This project will be implemented by SCI and locally accredited partner DDC. SCI has an office in Donetsk (Donetska NGCA) and is regularly communicating with de facto authorities to negotiate access, which has proven successful. SCI has been implementing similar projects for the past few years in Donetska NGCA with great success and high rates of beneficiary satisfaction. This project will be implemented by a team of experienced humanitarian staff and supported by SCI&#x2019;s support staff.

SCI will ensure no overlap between beneficiaries by splitting activities between different locations, cross-checking and verifying of all beneficiary lists provided by de-facto authorities, at the same time coordinating area coverage with other actors and stakeholders in the area. 

As a result of project implementation, in total 4,900 individuals (693 men, 1618 women, 869 boys, 1020 girls) will benefit from provided assistance to meet their basic and winter needs.</narrative>
