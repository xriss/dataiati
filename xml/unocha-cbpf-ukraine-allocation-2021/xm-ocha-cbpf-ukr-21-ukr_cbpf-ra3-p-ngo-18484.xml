  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project is aimed to improve access to critical services for people living in targeted isolated communities/settlements with protracted disruption of services through transportation of people to services and services to people 

As a result of the recent protection monitoring conducted by Proliska, 88 settlements along the contact line with a total population of 19,755 have no regular public transportation and due to it, people living in these settlements have a barrier to use essential services. Among them, 15 settlements have dirt roads that create an additional barrier to provide transportation. The low mobility of social and medical workers influences their ability to provide services even in those settlements where their services are available.

In strong coordination with Adra, it is planned to cover identified settlements with regular routes of needed frequency. 

For regular social transportation, services of a local carrier for paved roads will be used, and Proliska all-wheel-drive off-road minibus will be used for dirt roads. In addition to regular routs to connect people living in isolated communities or in settlements with protracted disruption of services with economic and administrative hubs, it is planned needs based transportation of people with specific needs to specific services, for example, children with disabilities to a rehabilitation center. 
To transport services to people, 32  electric bicycles will be distributed to medical and social workers, as well as services will be transported by vehicles on a needs base.
All activities will be conducted taking into account ongoing decentralization reform and anti-covid measures.
Advocacy intervention will be conducted to encourage the eventual handover of responsibility to local authorities or the private sector.

NGO &quot;Proliska&quot; has been operating in Luhanska and Donetska oblasts since July 2014. Our organization has got many years of experience in implementing projects in the conflict zone: from 2016 to the present, we are the executive partners of UNHCR in 2019-20 we implemented 2 projects with UHF, in 2016-2018we were the executive partners of UNICEF, since 2019 we are the partners of the Ministry of Temporary Occupied Territories and Internally Displaced People. Currently, the organization has more than 130 employees who are members of the communities along the contact line&#x2019;. Our employees are qualified specialists, having mainly 5 years of experience of work in the conflict zone. We have experience in transportation assistance on an individual case-to-case basis, of organization of social buses in isolated communities as community-based protection projects, of transportation of vulnerable people by electric vehicles at Stanitsa Luhanska crossing point, and of distribution of electric bicycles to community workers and volunteers to increase their mobility.</narrative>
