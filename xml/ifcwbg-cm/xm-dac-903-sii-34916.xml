   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Project will: (i)	improve the livelihoods of indirect and direct beneficiaries including smallholder producers involved in the cassava, maize, sorghum and rice value chains; (ii) create further employment at both producer organization and agro-industry levels thereby supporting one of the largest and poorest employment brackets in the country; (iii) addresses issues of food security through the substitution of imports by locally-produced raw materials. (iv) create jobs for women: The project is likely to reach at least 25% women given that for some of the value chains such as cassava and even maize, women are the majority of farmers. Increasing their economic power improves many livelihoods. They are more likely than men to contribute income to (1) poverty reduction; (2) improved nutrition; (3) school tuition</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project, a joint World Bank/IFC initiative, aims to promote competitiveness of Producer Organizations in the value chains of cassava, maize and sorghum by providing them with financing (pre- and post-harvest) to increase and modernize their production and vertically integrate their business to agribusiness end customers.   The proposed project with Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale Cameroon (SGCAM or the Bank) is a Risk Sharing Facility of up to XOF2.5 billion to support lending to Producer Organizations in Cameroon. SGCAM is the largest bank in the country in terms of loans and second bank in terms of deposits, with a network of 32 branches. The Bank has a universal bank business model servicing the retail, SME and corporate business segments.</narrative>
