   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The development impact of IFC&apos;&apos;s investment in Activa will be measured by the following metrics: (i) growth in insurance premiums, (ii) growth in sums insured, as well as (iii) the creation of new subsidiaries in other markets in a region characterized by very low levels of insurance penetration currently and (iv) the development of new products that should extend the reach of insurance cover in the markets concerned (micro-insurance, weather risk insurance for farmers, etc).  There will also be a strong demonstration effect by supporting a local entrepreneur who is building a regional group and has had some success already in creating a panafrican insurance alliance (Globus Network) as well a regional reinsurance platform (Globus Re).</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project consists of an equity investment in Activa Finances (Activa or the Company), a holding company domiciled in Mauritius which controls the groups operating subsidiaries, directly or through a majority stake in the groups largest asset, its non-life subsidiary in Cameroon, Activa Assurances. Activa is registered as a Category 1 Global Business Company in the Offshore Financial center of Mauritius.   Activa Assurances was formed in 1998 and in turn owns majority stakes in Activa Vie (life insurance, Cameroon), Activa International Ghana Limited (non life insurance, Ghana), a minority stake in Globus Re a captive reinsurance company which reinsures a portion of the risks underwritten by Globus members and a 5% stake in La Loyale Assurances from C&#xF4;te dIvoire.   Activa has built a strong domestic base in Cameroon and Ghana and will continue to focus on becoming a leading insurer in the CIMA zone (Conf&#xE9;rence Interafricaine des March&#xE9;s dAssurance) covering 15 insurance markets with harmonized regulation. The Company intends to establish a foothold in other markets in Western and Central Africa through acquisitions or new licenses, as was done in Liberia and Sierra Leone with the acquisition of a composite insurance license in the former and a new license in the latter country. This regional expansion should be facilitated by the Globus network of independent insurance companies founded by the Chairman of Activa.  The Globus network leverages its reach which spans across more than 30 countries on the African Continent to further the growth of its members.   The project aims to support the above expansion strategy by providing capital, an institutional stamp of approval and contributing IFCs knowledge of global trends and best practices in the insurance industry.</narrative>
