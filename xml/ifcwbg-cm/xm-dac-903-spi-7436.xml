IFC has been asked to provide equity of CFA 250 million (US$500,000 equivalent).  This would be a repeat investment, as IFC had earlier partially funded the establishment of PROLEGs commercial farm and processing facility with a loan of US$1 million equivalent.    Location of project and Description of site    	The expansion will be at the companys current site in Bandjoun, western province of Cameroon, where a total of 200 ha  of land has been developed for the growing of green beans.

The beans are produced in part by PROLEGs own large-scale farm and in part by more than 10,000 small outgrowers to whom the company provides extension services.  The Company now proposes to increase green bean production from 1,700 to 2,500 tons with financial assistance from IFC.  IFCs new investment will be a sign of continued support to the Company and will facilitate the mobilization of additional loans from local banks.  Management will also be strengthened.
