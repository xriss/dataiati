IFCs role is the provision of term financing, which will comfort the participation of a local financing partner, thereby meeting one of IFCs objectives in local resource mobilization channeled to investment. The developmental impact resulting from the project include: (a) increased added value and quality to locally grown coffee; (b) creation of  30 additional permanent jobs; (c) generation of foreign currency earnings for the country; and (d) increasing competition in the local coffee processing industry.
