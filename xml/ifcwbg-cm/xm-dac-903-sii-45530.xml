   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Bocom Clean Cooking Facility</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Bocom Petroleum (Bocom) is a downstream distributor of petroleum products in Cameroon (i.e. LPG, lubricants, gasoline, diesel and kerosene). It operates its own network of 80 fuel stations throughout the country, as well as an LPG storage and cylinder filling plant, and a lubricant blending facility. Bocom owns the only private LPG coastal storage facility in Cameroon, which is essential for cooking gas distribution in the country, and necessary to promote clean cooking practices across the country. Bocom is also the only manufacturer of lubricants  through a blending process- in Cameroon (and Central Africa), which is essential to ensure the reliable supply of well-priced quality lubricants to various consumer segments in the country. Availability of quality lubricants ensures automobiles and machinery are efficiently run in Cameroon, with lower maintenance costs, prolongs useful lives of auto\machinery, and reduces unnecessary replacement costs.&#xA0;&#xA0;   The Project entails the further diversification of Bocom from white products, and growth of its cleaner and higher value downstream product (LPG and Lubricants). It entails the expansion of Bocoms LPG business through added storage and filling capacity in Douala, and establishing LPG centers across multiple provinces in the country, (which supports clean cooking across the country); and the expansion of its lubricants blending facility capacity in Douala.  The project is expected to be supported by the IDA19 Private Sector Window Blended Finance Facility (IDA PSW BFF) as described in the Blended Finance Section.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The most significant expected project-level outcome is increased access to LPG products to support clean cooking in underserved areas of the country. LPG use improves households air quality especially for women and children compared the widespread use of firewood or charcoal for cooking. The project will also increase access to high quality lubricants in a market where access to lubricants is quite poor in most of the country, and thereby, efficiency of automotives&apos; engine combustion is low with the consequent detrimental effects on GHG emissions. Beyond these, the Project will also contribute to mitigate one of the deforestation drivers by displacing the use of unsustainable firewood and charcoal, support job creation in Cameroon and contribute to the countrys GDP through forward linkages with LPG retailers, and contribute significantly to improve the competitiveness of the LPG and Lubricants market in Cameroon through a sizable expansion in capacity, enhanced operational and distribution efficiency, and adoption of improved safety standards.</narrative>
