   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This award strives to support the science and practice of food, feed, and fiber production (including forestry, wildlife, fisheries, aquaculture and floriculture) and its relationships to natural resources, processing, marketing, distribution, utilization (including nutrition), and trade. In addition, this award On August 6-8, 2015, The International Congress on Pathogens at the Human-Animal Interface (ICOPHAI) assembled to focus knowledge-sharing among developing regions and actively work to foster collaborative engagement with the developed world. This year, the 3rd ICOPHAI congress was held at Holiday Inn in Chiang Mai, Thailand. It was preceded by a Molecular Epidemiology workshop and other satellite meetings. Special emphasis was placed on emerging infectious diseases (e.g. Ebola, MERS, etc.) in addition to other One Health for Sustainable Development themes. The gathering provided collaboration, communication and knowledge sharing among scientific leaders from areas where diseases are most likely to emerge. Focus was placed on importance of achieving an interdependent, globally coherent response and prediction strategy for pathogens at the Human Animal Interface. It is critical that such networks and partnerships are created before a new disease emerges rather than after the fact. ICOPHAI Thailand uniquely aimed to coalesce in one venue the latest critical information on Emerging Diseases and One Health from prominent scholars from both developing and developed countries in order to promote strong South-South and South-North working groups, networks and collaborations..</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">The United States is engaging Thailand primarily as a development partner to leverage its significant resources as an upper middle income country to encourage it to take a greater leadership role in addressing global and regional challenges of mutual concern. Throughout its modern history as a constitutional monarchy, Thailand has experienced years of political uncertainty, including, most recently, a military coup in May 2014 following six months of protests, the dissolution of parliament, and failed national elections. Such dramatic shifts in the political system are disruptive for a key U.S. ally and make clear that there is a continued need for engagement in priority areas with U.S. support for good governance and transnational rule of law. Many political, legal, and criminal justice institutions are still developing and will benefit from continued U.S. engagement. Achieving U.S. strategic goals in Thailand and in the region is predicated on the country&apos;s stability. U.S. assistance will promote peace and security, foster reforms and modernization of the criminal justice system, and strengthen good governance.</narrative>
