   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The adoption of an ambitious Sustainable Development Goal on education (SDG4) in 2015 is imperative for securing the right to inclusive, quality education for all by 2030. The basis for the successful adoption was partly a well-coordinated global advocacy process led by the Global Campaign for Education (GCE) and its regional and national chapters, supported by Oxfam IBIS. Despite considerable progress made in terms of increasing access to education in the MDGs era, there are still gaps and challenges to be addressed, including the low quality of education; lack of innovative education models that reach the most vulnerable; financing gaps; and lack of recognition of the role transformative education can have in democratic processes and as a societal leveller in general and specifically in relation to gender and generational inequality. It is the responsibility of the State (as duty bearer) to deliver quality education to all its citizens (rights holders). The private sector plays a role in supporting the development of strong public education systems. CSOs play a key role in advocating, monitoring and ensuring that governments are accountable and live up to their responsibility. Oxfam IBIS became in 2016 the education lead in the Oxfam Confederation, which entails supporting affiliates, country programs and partners capacity in quality education programming, policy and campaigning. Oxfam IBIS adds value to Oxfam with our technical, programmatic and policy education expertise. The Oxfam confederation also adds immense value to Oxfam IBIS&#x2019; education work, as it expands the possibilities of future national, multi-national and regional education programmes, expands the sphere and weight of policy influence, adds Oxfam expertise and knowledge to our work through Knowledge Hubs and Learning Communities e.g. around youth, gender equality and resilience. Oxfam IBIS holds seats in some of the most important international education bodies, such as being board member of the Global Campaign of Education (GCE), the Global Partnership of Education (GPE) and the UNESCO Collective Consultation of NGOs. This represents a unique opportunity for partnering with the Danish Government and like-minded donor representatives in GPE to influence the direction and priorities. With the exception of Chad and Eritrea GCE covers all priority countries in Danish Development Corporation. The overall objective of the proposed global programme is to contribute to ensuring that the quality aspects of the right to education are reinforced towards a transformative education where children, youth and adults, with special focus on girls and women, develop attitudes, skills and knowledge to participate as active citizens in their society. Specific objective: Facilitate civil society participation and influencing work at the local, national and global levels, ensuring that relevant policies for the fulfilment of the right to free public inclusive quality education is adopted, financed and delivered in practice, including in fragility and emergencies.</narrative>
