   <narrative xml:lang="EN">About READ-It - Over the past 20 years there has been a concerted effort to use reliable evidence in making decisions about health care. READ-It aims to improve the evidence base and ensure its dissemination. READ-It helps ensure healthcare problems relevant to low- and middle-income countries are addressed, and that people living in these countries are part of the process. It is a major contributor to Cochrane, a global organization committed to preparing and updating systematic reviews, and coordinates the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group (CIDG) and assists Cochrane in developing methods and editorial processes. It also works closely with policy makers.

READ-It focuses on two main areas:
- Reliable, up-to-date, scientifically defensible and relevant evidence in malaria and tuberculosis, child health, maternal health and health systems.
- Effective dialogue and influence between research, policy and practice communities in public and private sector.

READ-It&apos;s activities include:
- Preparing and updating Cochrane Reviews about the effects of health care relevant to low- and middle-income countries.
- Identifying approaches to ensure dissemination and use of the results of systematic reviews in decision making.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">READ-It is currently in Implementation Year 3 of the programme and continues to work on the &#x201C;core&#x201D; READ-It projects as detailed below and the continued contribution to the COVID-19 pandemic.

During Implementation Years 1-2, READ-It have worked on the &#x201C;core&#x201D; READ-It projects and the completion of high impact (and high priority) Cochrane reviews, other systematic reviews, and peer research papers in the &#x201C;core&#x201D; topic areas. 

READ-It&#x2019;s &#x201C;core&#x201D; topics are in neglected tropical diseases, vector control, malaria and tuberculosis, nutrition in public health and health systems development, mental health in primary care, qualitative evidences synthesis in NTDs and tuberculosis; and from the beginning of Implementation Year 2 also rapidly pivoted to include COVID-19.

READ-It&#x2019;s response mode to the COVID-19 pandemic included collaborative efforts with the Central Cochrane Editorial Production Team and the Birmingham-led COVID-19 diagnostic review group, with outputs being published in the CIDG portfolio; South Africa and India READ-It supported partners leading COVID-19 Guidance development.  

READ-It continue to contribute to various global and national published guidelines on priority topics including specific COVID-19 guidelines in Year 2 which is continuing into Year 3.
READ-It are also contributing to leadership with a programme of work designed to influence national decision-making process with the start of Eleanor Ochodo&#x2019;s MRC/DFID African Research Leader scheme.

In Year 2, CIDG a partner within READ-It at LSTM gained new official WHO Collaborating Centre status to carry out systematic reviews in malaria and tuberculosis to assist with guideline production for WHO (February 2020 to March 2024); and a Qualitative Evidence Synthesis Hub was established between South Africa and UK, conducting a suite of QES reviews and methodological development.

During the Inception phase from 15 May 2018 to 31 March 2019, READ-It covered various activities which included conducting consultations, literature scanning and consensus building to identify review topics that are important questions to our stakeholders and potentially high impact; built consensus with partners on new protocols for years one and two; developed outlines for methods projects to advance the science of synthesis; conducted a planning and consultation meeting with all potential partners and DFID (now FCDO). READ-It set up work plans and contracts with all new partners; liaised with the World Health Organization and PAHO, taking on several topics in our response mode; and drafted a code of conduct and safeguarding procedures.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The main lead of READ-It is based at the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine (LSTM) which co-ordinates with the planning, management, monitoring the strategy, work plans, outputs and expenditure of READ-It; management of the budgeting and financial disbursements of READ-It funds; assuring value for money and risk management across all global Partners; and the communication with all global Partners. 

Also, one of the READ-It Partners, the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group (CIDG) is based at LSTM. 

CIDG&#x2019;s main areas of work are on determination of the effects of interventions on the prevention or treatment of infectious diseases of relevance to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, particularly malaria, TB, HIV/AIDS, neglected tropical diseases, and diarrhoeal diseases in LMIC&apos;s. Also, from March 2020 CIDG have worked on urgent and relevant reviews related to the COVID-19 pandemic.

The aims of the CIDG are to impact on policy and research in tropical diseases through the production of relevant high impact and high priority systematic reviews and to lead developments in review quality improvement and effective dissemination of findings.

The READ-It Liverpool office also managed a Gold Open Access dashboard (with value for money)  which is used to cover Gold Open Access costs (as required by FCDO) for all READ-It partners (Liverpool and global).

Also covered some potential global partners costs before official subcontracts are in place (Inception phase).</narrative>
