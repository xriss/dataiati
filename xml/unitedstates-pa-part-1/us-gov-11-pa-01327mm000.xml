    <narrative xml:lang="EN">Panama&apos;s location, the Panama Canal, its transportation infrastructure, and its financial sector make it an important hub for global trade and a key U.S. strategic partner. However, these factors also make Panama a central target for drug trafficking, money laundering, and organized criminal activity. The goal of U.S. assistance is to ensure Panama remains a secure, prosperous, and democratic country, and to build and strengthen Panamanian institutions as a preeminent partner for the United States in the region, able to serve as a model for other Central American countries, particularly those in the Northern Triangle. The U.S. Strategy for Engagement in Central America (Strategy) focuses on three overarching lines of action: 1) promoting prosperity and regional economic integration; 2) enhancing security through continued and expanded Central America Regional Security Initiative (CARSI) activities; and 3) promoting improved governance. The FY 2017 request of $750.0 million in bilateral and regional assistance for Central America - a part of the Administration&apos;s $1.0 billion whole-of-government request for appropriations and financing assistance to support the Strategy - includes and aligns the resources necessary to comprehensively increase economic opportunity, reduce extreme violence, strengthen the effectiveness of state institutions, address climate change and food insecurity, and address challenges resulting in an influx of migration.</narrative>
