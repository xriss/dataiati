   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This award strives to support the science and practice of food, feed, and fiber production (including forestry, wildlife, fisheries, aquaculture and floriculture) and its relationships to natural resources, processing, marketing, distribution, utilization (including nutrition), and trade. In addition, this award On July 27-31, 2015, in a joint effort with Subject Matter Experts from Chile, Colombia, Mexico, and Puerto Rico, APHIS developed a discussion-oriented exercise based on hypothetical scenarios where outbreaks of High Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI), Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea (PED), and Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) take place in a simulated country. The event was sponsored by the Inter-American Institute for Cooperation on Agriculture (IICA), World Organization for Animal Health (OIE), the International Regional Organization for Plant and Animal Health in Central America (OIRSA), the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), and USDA APHIS. The group consisted of 60 participants from Central and South America and the Caribbean. Among the participants were veterinary medical officers from the various Ministries of Agriculture and representatives of the private industry. APHIS SMEs and guest experts presented lectures on the basic concepts of ICS and general emergency response strategies. Then the 60 participants were divided in 3 groups of 20 according to their interest in HPAI, PED, and FMD. APHIS ran the exercise among the small groups. Participants worked together to develop an action plan on how they will respond (using ICS) to an emergency involving the diseases they chose. Each group presented a 1-hour power point presentation reporting their results and final outcome to all SMEs and attendees. All 3 groups presented great reports on how they used ICS concepts to respond to an emergency on animal disease origin..</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">Panama&apos;s location, the Panama Canal, its transportation infrastructure, and its financial sector make it an important hub for global trade and a key U.S. strategic partner. However, these factors also make Panama a central target for drug trafficking, money laundering, and organized criminal activity. The goal of U.S. assistance is to ensure Panama remains a secure, prosperous, and democratic country, and to build and strengthen Panamanian institutions as a preeminent partner for the United States in the region, able to serve as a model for other Central American countries, particularly those in the Northern Triangle. The U.S. Strategy for Engagement in Central America (Strategy) focuses on three overarching lines of action: 1) promoting prosperity and regional economic integration; 2) enhancing security through continued and expanded Central America Regional Security Initiative (CARSI) activities; and 3) promoting improved governance. The FY 2017 request of $750.0 million in bilateral and regional assistance for Central America - a part of the Administration&apos;s $1.0 billion whole-of-government request for appropriations and financing assistance to support the Strategy - includes and aligns the resources necessary to comprehensively increase economic opportunity, reduce extreme violence, strengthen the effectiveness of state institutions, address climate change and food insecurity, and address challenges resulting in an influx of migration.</narrative>
