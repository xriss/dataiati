       <narrative xml:lang="EN">In coordination with the Ministry of Health and other UN agencies three locations have been identified as most optimal and three sexual assault centres have been developed and properly equiped in Skopje, Kumanovo and Tetovo. The SACs were designed as one-stop location where female and male victims of rape and serious sexual assault can receive medical care and advice, and have the opportunity to assist the police investigation, including undergoing a forensic examination. The SOP&apos;s will consolidate the professional practice of police, judicial, forensic and sexual assault services in responding effectively and appropriately to the needs of victim/survivors.

In order to strenghten the capacities in data collection of the national authorities a data collection framework has been developed that sets out a minimum common data categories required for collecting comprehensive public data on violence against women and domestic violence in the country. and defines the required data systems that need to be set-up by public authorities such as the judiciary, the police and social welfare services.

During the project course,  two expert workshops have been organised to raise the importance of the due diligence principle in the context of violence against women and domestic violence in combination with other human rights principles. During the workshops a total of 43 judges and public prosecutors from all four appelatte areas -  Bitola, Skopje, Gostivar and Stip. They have been trained to more effectively deal with victims or perpetrators of all acts of violence covered by the scope of this Convention, on the prevention and detection of such violence, equality between women and men, the needs and rights of victims, as well as on how to prevent secondary victimisation.

Also, to provide support to development of leadership skills of women in politics to drive and expand the VAW agenda to the local level of government, three conferences have been organised that have been attended by an average of 90 women from all political parties in the country active on a local level. These meetings will help enable development of these women skills as active politicians to consolidate political will and commitment of all parties to create an inclusive society that recognize the need to promote gender equality.</narrative>
