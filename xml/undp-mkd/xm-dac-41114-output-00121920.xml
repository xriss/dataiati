2.2 - At least 50% of our learning challenges have the public sector or other partner as counterpart.
Our support for the development of the National Development Strategy has the government [the Deputy Prime Ministers of North Macedonia] has the government as a partner in the process as well as other UN agencies, and the donor community. The support for the development of the NDS, is a part of our first frontier challenge #Governance #GoodGovernance, and our learning question on how we can redesign our public policy process.
In City Experiment Fund we have created partnerships with the academia, private sector and civil society organization. We have been working on close partnership with other UN agencies in few activities ( SDG tool piloting for the stateless in partnership with UNHCR, Green Shark Challenge in partnership with UNICEF). 
Together with private sector partners we implemented Accelerate 2030 program in North Macedonia, where two startups made it to global program showcasing their work on the SDGs. 
2.3 - At least one government entity or partner has adopted an accelerator lab method.
The Accelerator Lab team had the opportunity to support the Democratic Governance unit within our Country office in a process aimed at supporting the development of a National Development Strategy in our country. Within the National Development Strategy process, UNDPs key partners [national institutions] have adopted [through a session of a Steering Board Committee] the methodological approach that we have proposed to be followed for the development of the NDS. Namely, the methodological approach, co-created in a process including national institutions, CSOs, experts the UNDP country office and other entities has used the Doughnut model of economics as a method of mapping risks and identifying areas where we need to build capabilities in our society. The methodology also adopts a more flexible, learning oriented, humble approach to policymaking that relies on iterations and experimentation. This is something that we believe is closely aligned with the #AccLab method of work. 
2.4 - At least 50% of our learning challenges are providing actionable knowledge to ongoing CO projects.
#GoodGovernance, giving actionable knowledge to our Democratic Governance Unit 
#SluggishEconomy, giving actionable knowledge to our Environment Unit on circularity, and our Inclusive Prosperity Unit on new jobs and skills.

The publication/blogpost Fridays at the Lab has been shared by a key startup entity on their social media. The startup Challenger has been a part of the Fridays at the Lab sessions and has thus shared this content, because it showcased their participation in our UNDP country office. 
Our accelerator Lab team was invited to take part in the E-society.mk international conference, to talk about our approach of learning and working, and our participation to that event, as well as our talking points has been reshared on the social media pages of the Metamorphosis foundation [one of the key CSOs in our country when talking about digitalization and open data]. 
The publication/blogpost Ground Control to Major Tom has been shared by the UNHCR social media platforms in our country right after being published on the UNDP mk website and social media. The UNHCR social media platform has a different ecosystem and target groups, so it is a noteworthy example of expanding our ecosystem in reach.
