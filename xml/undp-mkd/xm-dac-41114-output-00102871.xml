       <narrative xml:lang="EN">Deriving Data to Design Better Services for Persons with Disabilities
This programme immanently contributes to promotion and implementation of the recommendations set with the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. Two field surveys done in 2016 have been promoted in 2017 enabling people with disabilities and their families to express their concerns regarding lack of services on a local level. Collection of data focused on people with disabilities has been organized in several modules  in three regions in the country, involving 600 persons with disabilities and respondents from almost all foster families. 
Through the project, UNDP has provided work-oriented rehabilitation services for 23 people with disabilities currently based in the Banja Bansko Protection Institute (located in the South-East Region). These services included a capacity assessment and provision of tailored psycho-social and training support to improve skills and promote labour market inclusion, and are based on EU good practices. For this purpose, three workshops have been organized with 15 professionals from different institutions and NGOs, on the process and the structure of work-oriented rehabilitation process.
The programme fosters partnership with the civil society organizations, in particular related to the anticipated intensive field work with the beneficiaries. End-beneficiaries are actively involved in designing the approach to better reach this vulnerable group and to share best practices from this intervention. Organizations and associations of people with disabilities shall be also involved in designing workable models for economic inclusion of people with disabilities. 


Data on roots and manifestations of the specific attitudes of men towards paid and non-paid social care services
UNDP social inclusion programme initiated interventions that aim at mapping the social care services through gender-sensitive lens and explore men&#x2019;s attitudes and practices in the areas of paid and unpaid social care services. By unique focus on the factors that may lead to improved men&#x2019;s role in the social care services, the survey data will also aim to promote increased women&#x2019;s role in paid work and more meaningful and targeted use of women&#x2019;s free time. Future interventions will build on the findings of this research by cross-examining the attitude of men in relation to social care services.</narrative>
