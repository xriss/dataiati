   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The expected impact of this intervention is the reduction of suffering by improving the living conditions of the beneficiaries as they will be able to access basic necessities such as food, NFI, shelter, education, and health. The multipurpose cash that beneficiaries will receive will allow them to buy essential household items, food, pay for health services, and education for their children. This will allow them to be sheltered from the weather and reduce the likelihood of their physical condition deteriorating as a consequence of poor conditions. Households will also be able to access at least two meals per day and respond to other needs.  The project will empower the community as CAFOD and Caritas Kasongo will do a survey prior to the cash distribution to assess the power dynamic within Households and carry out sensitisation where needed, especially as it will be largely women who will be receiving the cash on behalf of the Households. Priority will be given to the most vulnerable households affected by the storms and wind, including widowed women, children heads of households, elderly people, people with disabilities, chronically ill, and / or other people who are unable to buy food and goods of their choice that meet the need of their households. 
We will organize the mobile money transfer through which each affected household and the host families will receive &#xA3;113.41 , the head of the household will receive the cash for the HH. This amount has been advised by the Cash working group as Minimum Expenditure Basket standard.  CAFOD has established that markets are functioning in the project locations, in view of a report on market assessment survey undertaken by CAFOD in partnership with other agencies (Caritas Kasongo, Caritas Bukavu, Caritas Belgium) on 17th June for an ECHO-funded project currently on-going in the project area.</narrative>
