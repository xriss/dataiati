   <narrative xml:lang="EN">On the night of the 5th March a torrential rainstorm accompanied by devastatingly strong winds in Kalima, Maniema destroyed the houses of 851 families (more than was initially anticipated at the alert stage). Houses in the area are typically made from mud and straw and they were no match for the weather. These people are now homeless, some are lucky enough to have found refuge with host families, but others are sleeping in schools and other public buildings, while the worse off are sleeping outside with no shelter. Most of those affected have also lost their livelihoods as 250 hectares of farmland was destroyed at a critical time in the agricultural calendar as many crops have just been planted and others are ready to harvest. The Central Health Zone has predicted a rise in malnutrition as food insecurity dramatically worsens. They have also predicted the spread of water-borne diseases and the local health centres are ill-equipped to deal with any outbreak, lacking drugs and equipment. 
CAFOD and Caritas Kasongo will target 1275 household or 7650 people. The cash will be done through mobile money which means people will not have to wait in long queues to receive their cash.</narrative>
