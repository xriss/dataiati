  </title>
  <description>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project will build on the microcredit project working with SILC groups (Savings and Internal Lending Community) implemented by Caritas Goma and that have served over 1050 beneficiaries (among the 990 women) with small credits that have improved their businesses. Latest project evaluation demonstrated that the ongoing project focused and women victims of sexual violence, those who came from army groups, and those who are extremely vulnerable. Young women were somehow left behind in the project while they are the future of region and they are also vulnerable and key actor of change in the community. As a matter of fact, young women stand different risk and can easily be manipulated which can potentially aggravate their situation. 
Preliminary market analysis conducted by Caritas Goma in May 2021 revealed that aquaculture has great potential to spur socio-economic development and  increase employment opportunity and boosting incomes.

Targeted beneficiaries: This project will target 2 SILC groups (TUINUKE and CHAMACHA) each having 25 young women that will be trained and empowered to invest in aquaculture. 

The project will therefore invest in:
- Develop young women&#x2019;s capacity to realise their potential and power within to harness critical resources in their lives through entrepreneurship training, financing, mentorship, and market linkages in the fish farming ponds constructed and refurbished in Buhimba district, within the commune of Goma, North-Kivu province, DRC;
- Financial and mentoring support to 50 young women entrepreneurs to manage organic fish farming.
- Young women collectively organising through running a fish farming project and advocate for equal access to economic opportunities in their communities;
- women&apos;s groups will be trained on smoking and salting produced fishes for added value
- 50 young women linked up with to the market for selling fish and consequently improve their annual income by 30%</narrative>
