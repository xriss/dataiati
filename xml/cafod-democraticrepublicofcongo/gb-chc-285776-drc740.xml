  </title>
  <description>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Mululi water project aims to support socio-economic growth of the local community by improving and ensuring the distribution of the water tanks accross the community. This aims to improve on the the health and livelihoods of the rural population by improving their access to clean water (more than 500 families) through a gravity-fed system. Local population have contributed through labour supply in digging canals and local materials. 
CAFOD and its partner technicians from Bukavu diocese sampled the water and confirmed the spring source to be potable and with sufficient flow capacity. So far, the engineer did put more water in the tank. Currently the water tank is always full and it may create land slide which is potentially harmful to the environment. The project plans to  add pipes and provide water to more community members. Because this will be by gravitation, the engineer has estimated that we can build 7 more water points. This will require some pipes and few plumbing materials in order to be able to distribute the water system as required.
Additionally this project will also compliment the bees keeping project with the same partner in Bukavu diocese. However, the groups implementing this project equally expressed some needs to be supported with some seeds and some agriculture materials for better livelihood mechanism around their bee keeping project. This project was discussed with Caritas Australia, and we were hoping that they will cover this part of the project unfortunately, their response for this year was negative as they were already limited in budget capacity. We would like to cover this as well to ensure that the project is complete.</narrative>
