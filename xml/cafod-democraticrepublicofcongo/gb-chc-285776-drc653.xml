  <description>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In response to the ongoing contextual challenge in the country, CENCO has renewed its efforts and has initiated a series of advocacy activities in Rome, Brussels, EU etc . The next steps of this mission (if the means and agenda of the President of CENCO allow them) will be in Berlin, London, Washington and New York. There is need to lobby now so that the DRC already starts to prepare for the next elections by demanding: the reform of the electoral law, the organic law governing the CENI, the reform of the Constitutional Court, the creation of a genuine civil registry file by the census of the population; it will also be a way to put a definitive end to the dangerous debate of national registration.
As part of its mission and at the request of the President of CENCO, the CEJP is preparing an important advocacy mission to the European Parliament to meet Ms ARENA, Chairperson of the Parliamentary Committee on Human Rights. This advocacy will target the security situation in Ituri, North and South Kivu.The mission will include 3 steps:One. National advocacy with members of the government and accredited diplomatic missions in Kinshasa Two. Preparation of the advocacy file with the CDJP: Goma, Bukavu, Beni-Butembo and Uvira in Bukavu, a CEJP team will travel to Bukavu to also participate in the relaunch of the Peace to the Great Lakes campaign&quot;
