  <description>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Heavy rain often accompanied by strong winds frequently hit the town of Kindu and its surroundings. All morning of Friday, January 21st 2022, between 8:45 a.m. and 12:18 p.m., was disrupted by the storm.  Torrential rain fell on Kindu, this overflowed the banks of various rivers (Mikelenge, Kapondjo, Kano, Kabondo and Mangobo) which flow through the city. The flooding, which in places one and a half meters, caused enormous damage: houses, essential household items, food stocks from households located along rivers have been submerged in flood waters. In addition, hundreds of water points have been contaminated by runoff. 
A total of 3799 households (18,995 people) have been affected by this crisis, among them: 2665 households directly affected by the flood and 1134 host families. In total 2270 houses were negatively impacted: including 1,867 partially destroyed and 403 completely collapsed. 6 people are missing and 4 people are dead. These communities are currently living in severe vulnerability; affected households are no longer able to observe the barrier measures as the city of Kindu faces the COVID-19 pandemic. There&apos;s a high risk of the outbreak of positive cases of COVID-19 as a con sequence. The most affected sectors remain those of NFIs, shelter, food security and protection during this time of the coronavirus pandemic.
Displaced households are in host families, public places, in undamaged parts of certain dwellings, etc. with risk of malnutrition, the spread of water-borne diseases or even the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic following promiscuity within host families.  All these risk are likely to materialise in the following weeks if no assistance is provided.</narrative>
