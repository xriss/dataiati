   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Quality program delivery is primarily a responsibility of implementing Partners as they are the first responsible for the implementing and monitoring  projects on ground to the benefit of community participant. In the current context, it is important to re-visit partners&apos; some of our partners ways of working in consideration of the current humanitarian context. A recent online meeting with partners such as socoac, caritas kindu and kasongo just to name these have revealed a pressing need to have some refresher localized trainings on Safeguarding and strengthen their capacity on safeguarding. This includes partners such as Caritas Kasongo, Caritas Kindu and SOCOAC just to name a few. Previous training targeted the directors that unfortunately have either changed or evolved into other lines. Additionally, there is need to ensure internal ownership so that there can be quality in program delivery
This project aims to support the operationalization of this activity that is among the key requirements for CAFOD especially when implementing initiatives that are funded by institutional donors. 
CAFOD will lead on this to support partners and will eventually ensure that local staff are trained and refreshed on running local assessment that are followed with clear and feasible action plan that respond to identified 
Partners needs. Attention is to improving on program quality and making sure that our program do not leave community in a more vulnerable situation after any intervention.  When running this,  team will remain keen about important aspects that are related IEPM and will remain sensitive while implementing various interventions in the COVID context as well.
This will also help to train partner on quality targeting and the use new methodology as we adjust into the current ways of working that are more online.</narrative>
