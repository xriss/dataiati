   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The expected impact of this intervention is the reduction of suffering by improving the living conditions of the beneficiaries as they will access food, NFI, shelter, etc. The cash that beneficiaries will receive will allow them to buy essential household items and/or rent houses.  HHs will as likely be able to access at least two meals per day and repsond to other needs.  The project will empower the community as we will do a survey prior to the cash distribution to assess the power dynamic within HHs and carry out sensitisation where needed, especially as it will be largely women who will be receiving the cash on behalf of the HHs. Priority will be given to the most vulnerable households  affected by the current conflict, and who would continue to be highly vunlerable after returning home, including widowed women, children heads of households, elderly people, people with disabilities, chronically ill, and / or other people who are unable to buy food and goods of their choice that meet the need of their households. 
We will organize the mobile banking  through which each household will receive &#xA3;90, the head of the household will receive the cash for the HH.  The cash will be done through mobile money which means people will not have to wait in long queues to receive their cash.
 CAFOD and Caritas D&#xE9;veloppement Kasongo will target 10,824 people - 66% of of those affected (within the alert note) by the current crises specialy in Wamaza &#x2013; Kayembe axe and ActionAid will cover other 44% in Kayembe and Salamabila axe. Beneficiaries will be selected and targeted by the Caritas D&#xE9;veloppement Kasongo  team in collaboration with the IDP Committee, the representative of humanitarian Affairs Division, local authorities and local civil society on the basis of the vulnerability criteria mentioned above that will be put in place and validated by all stakeholders during the evaluation. In term of coordination, We have coorindated with ChristianAid, ActionAid and HelpAge .</narrative>
