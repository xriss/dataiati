  <description>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project is to implement in Cibanda II groupings within the Chiefdom of Luhwindja, Territory of Mwenga, in South Kivu Province of DRC, with a focus on the Beekeeping sector and rehabilitation of Mululi water source.
The goal of this Project is to spur socio-economic growth by improving the health and livelihoods of the marginalised rural population through the provision of water and the improvement of beekeeping sectors for the benefice of more than 1441 families (8626 people)

The beekeeping represents an important pillar of the agricultural economy sector in South-Kivu Province and will constitute a source of income for a good part of the local population.
This sector has been the subject of some interventions in the province. However, the efforts undertaken have not led to sustainable development in the beekeeping sector because it was not very well organized in South Kivu Province. 
This sector was the subject of particular attention in the province leading to project proposals aimed at improving the productivity of the hives (case of the Kenyan hives which were introduced by certain NGOs in the province.
So, to promote the beekeeping sector with a view to making it one of the levers of sustainable development in Luhwinja chiefdom, CAFOD plans to support the promotion of beekeeping hives for the beekeepers to improve their production and increase honey yield. 

Regarding water sector, in Mululi, people especially women and girls used to walk 3 km to reach the non-capped spring for drinking water. In 2020, CAFOD carried out a water supply project in Mululi to serve the population in potable drinking water. Currently,  this water supply damaged and needs to be rehabilitated. 
The intervention will consist to rehabilitate the water catchment construct in April 2020 and organise refresh training for local technicians on how to continue maintaining the system. Necessary materials and tools to help community to properly maintain the water system are also needed.</narrative>
