   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The social economic situation of the people in the eastern DRC has been seriously affected by the instability and poor governance that has settled in a country since some years back. Our experience on the just ended ex combatant project has shown that even though army&#x2019;s groups could stop activisms, the impact of these is still felt in the broader community. Past project experience demonstrated the willingness of communities to deploy themselves in livelihood activities that can significantly contribute to the community recovery in case a conducive environment is set.  To survive the crisis, majority of population has been left with limited choices; some people have decided to join the agricultural sector, small business in which they are not gaining much profit and others have joined informal sector. Youths are facing problems as they are not landowners, thus cannot practice agriculture economically, while others do not have capital to start their own business. This has resulted in majority idling at home this making them vulnerable to joining militia groups or engaging in petty and/or organised crimes. Following the global financial crisis, many humanitarian organizations closed and left behind a number of uncovered needs. The current project aims by June 2024 to contribute to an integrated community development effort by improving the socio-economic conditions of 2010 people of rural communities in the territories of Kabare-Kalehe and Beni Butembo. This will be achievable through improving food security and incomes of 2010 local communities though sustainable agriculture practices, cooperative and small enterprise development. The project will also reinforce the capacities of 120 youths through vocational training and support activities that reduce domestic and gender-based violence against women and young girls. The project will also raise awareness against COVID19 in 14 villages across Kalehe, Kabare and Beni-Butembo territories.  Cafod is  part of  aid localization agenda, this project will be implemented by Cafod in partnership with   its long term local partners namely Caritas Bukavu and CAJED that are well grounded in the community with strong community based network which is key for project sustainability.</narrative>
