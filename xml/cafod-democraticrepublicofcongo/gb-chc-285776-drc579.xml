   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Since March 2006, that the Archbishop of Bukavu is supporting the socio-therapeutic approach to help communities to open up, especially women to be able to create spaces of discussion to raise the living conditions of the woman and the girl in the households. In the previous project, counselling homes were therefore supported in some places, and was limited in the area of sexual violence, while the lack of opportunity for economic recovery increased the vulnerability and poverty of victims of sexual violence.
In a continuation perspective, the project aim to contribute to emotional and economic rehabilitation of women and their families surviving of all kinds conflicts and help them develop a system of resilience through the approach of sociotherapy in counselling homes in 30 parishes covering the 5 territories plus the city of Bukavu, especially (Kabare, Walungu, Kalehe, Idjwi and Mwenga). This 1-year project run from August 2018 to July 2019.

At the end of this project, the women and young women who have been abused and who have had psycho-social therapy in 30 councils house, participate again in daily activities in the household and in the community. 900 conscientious men will become trainers of other men to combat the negative effects of abuse against women, in order to advocate for the rights of women / girls and the importance of ensuring their protection.
