   <narrative xml:lang="EN">For several decades Maniema and South Kivu provinces have undergone the presence of armed groups of all persuasions, in a context of acute socio-economic crisis. Populations face multiple challenges in accessing basic goods and services. The security situation in these provinces continues to deteriorate, causing multiple population movements. The situation is marked by serious violations of fundamental rights. In the revision of the operational plan for the humanitarian response strategy covering the period from July to December 2019 of the Province of Maniema and South Kivu, the territory of Kalehe caught the attention and mainly the health zone of Bunyakiri which was Priority 1 and Kalonge priority 2. For Maniema, the health zones of Salamabila and Kabambare are targeted in priority 1 and the one of  Lusangi in priority 2. These territories of Kabambare and Kalehe, are affected by regular and frequent population movements, where villages are empty fearing abuses of groups in arms or during clashes. These villages emptied of their population are often the seat of plunder and fire. The orchestrated violence against the population has become a dissuasive weapon of war. on physical and gender-based violence (SGBV) are numerous in these regions, although many are not listed due to lack of accessibility, means of communication or actors present in the area. The humanitarian needs in these areas, due to these difficulties of physical and security access with the activism of national and international armed groups, are only exacerbated. It is to be envisaged for the year 2020 a deterioration of this already serious humanitarian situation.</narrative>
