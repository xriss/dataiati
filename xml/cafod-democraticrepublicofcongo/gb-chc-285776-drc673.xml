   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Having left China in 2019, the Corona virus, because of interactions with the whole world, is now widespread everywhere and in all countries of the World. Developed and powerful countries with a more efficient health system are today facing severe tests with overwhelmed hospitals, medical materials and equipment taken care of often limited, obviously their efforts tend towards a relative control of the disease. However, this shows that for poor countries, there is a fear of a rather dramatic situation inasmuch as the means available to these countries remain very limited and the health system there remains almost weak, extremely dependent on external aid.
The DRC, in its current context, is one of those countries that need help to overcome this challenge. Confronted since10  March with a first confirmed case, the situation of CORONA VIRUS is only going up on a cruise with now more than a hundred cases and more than a dozen deaths already recorded in less than a month. 
Despite the alarm cries launched by the WHO and the Western media, on social networks, we continue to read a lot of bad information that the new Virus is not a reality or that blacks would not be affected by COVID 19 or by other allegations of all kinds from charlatansi in various remote areas of the country, this false information. 
Through this project, Centre Olame wants to sensitize the population of Bukavu city and around to be aware of the existence of this pandemic.  At the end, they will take preventive measures seriously to protect themselves and others.</narrative>
