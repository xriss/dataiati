   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Since November 2017, the ISPR/ACEAC Programme of ACEAC as part of the African Great Lakes Sub-region, covering Burundi, the Democratic Republic of Congo (DR Congo) and Rwanda, has been underway. 
This is a programme running as a pastoral service of ACEAC and as an academic institution promoting the culture of peace towards a recovered social cohesion. 
As a pastoral service, the ISPR/ACEAC is a permanent training institution for justice, reconciliation and peace as a direct service of ACEAC. It offers to learners a human and cultural framework where they can live a personal experience of rapprochement between peoples through its leaders, of post-conflict reconciliation through an immersion in the diversity and cultural beauty of the sub-region. In this way, ISPR/ACEAC intends to systematically promote and disseminate a sub-regional culture of peace, harmonious development and integration. 
As an academic institution, ISPR/ACEAC provides two types of training activities: DEA-level teaching and research. The second part is a short training course (from a few weeks to a few months), mainly for professionals working in the field of peace and conflict resolution.
By the end of December 2020, ISPR/ACEAC will complete its first graduate training cycle and award its first Peace and Reconciliation graduates on the theme: Natural Resources, Environment, Peace and Sustainable Development.
The current project is submitted in order to provide CAFOD&#x2019;s institutional support to improve ISPR/ACEAC capacities by covering some of its administrative and operational costs from November 2020 to February 2021.</narrative>
