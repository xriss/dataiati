   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Promotion of insects farming for human food, animal feeds and environmental protection/conservation</narrative>
  </title>
  <description>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">A fast-growing population in the North and South Kivu provinces (major beef producing provinces in the DRC) is increasingly leading to shrinking sizes of agricultural land, (for traditional animal husbandry) and this is putting undue pressures on forest lands and water systems. Traditional livestock production is a leading cause of anthropogenic-induced climate change. Land clearing for agriculture is a major contributor to global warming and efficient use of land is therefore important. 
Protein additives in animal feed increase feed costs substantially, undermining development efforts to boost animal production and meet the food needs of a growing population, while ensuring environmental sustainability. Feed cost is already prohibitive, representing 60-70% of production costs and increased demand for ingredients that has doubled their prices in the last decade. 
To mediate this, more sustainable alternative sources of diets (for protein) are needed, to reduce unsustainable meat demand. Promotion of insects production as human food and animal feed is a viable alternative as insects have a high feed conversion rate, which in a rearing system limits the demand for land/land-use for feed production. Moreover, insect production appears to result in lower greenhouse gas emissions than conventional livestock production. It has also been suggested that the volume of water required to produce edible insects is low compared with that needed in conventional livestock production. Most edible insects are herbivorous, and the plants consumed by the insects can be easily planted and fed to the insects. 
Insects are a good source of nutrients and are comparable to conventional animal sources with high protein content. In general, insects can supply protein (20-70 percent of raw protein), amino acids (30-60 percent), fats (10- 50 percent), minerals and vitamins important for human health. Insects are especially rich in phosphorus, potassium, iron, copper, zinc, manganese, sodium, vitamin B1 and B2 and niacin. Nutritional values vary according to the species and how they are prepared for consumption. 
This project seeks to promote production of insects for human food and for use in the manufacture of animal feeds.
This project is based on the Theory of Change that IF insects (African caterpillars, migratory locust and black soldier fly) production is promoted as an alternative source of human food (source of proteins) AND an ingredient in the production of animal feeds, THEN</narrative>
