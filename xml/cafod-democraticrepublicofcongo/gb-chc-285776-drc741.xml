  <description>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This innovative and integrated project is among the first steps in attempting to champion the ecological conversion even in our soft results programs. This project will be championed by the youth with aim to strengthen governance, peace and the environmental protection in Goma, North Kivu. The project aims to empower young people to address tensions, manipulation, and political and ethnic exploitation in a non-violent way by promoting peace and responsible citizenship through sport, arts performance, music and civic education. This project also aims to enable young people to take an active role in organising and mobilising their peers in the city of Goma to fight against all forms of violence and thus consolidate peace. 
Also building on the contextual reality of Goma with the recent volcanic eruption of Nyiragongo in May 2021, this eruption led to a major disruption of its ecosystem. Consequently, there is a need to strengthen the residents&apos; capacity to cope with different socio-ecological conditions, to anticipate and resist uncertainties and crises, and to combine and use different sources and forms of knowledge in re-building a more resilient environmentally friendly culture within its inhabitants (primarily the youth). Consequently, the project also aims to contribute to community-based environmental education, disaster preparedness (more related to environment), risk and climate change activities in a multi-stakeholder approach. The project will directly engage with local university, the authorities, and the local population in the framework of inclusive environmental governance. 
CAFOD see young people as an essential target group for any initiative related to any response related to both the cry of the earth and the cry of the poor. With our existing and operational work, we have so far been very bold on the cry of the poor as compared to the cry of the earth even in Goma town. This initiative is one of the first attempt to bring forth a link between the two components as per CAFOD strategic direction.
This project will also attempt support small initiatives from the youth related to peace building, environmental protection, and civic engagement using new information and communication technologies. These could champion other attempts that could inform future initiatives with possibility to be replicated somewhere else.
As part of this project, this initiative aims to model up and ensure that our partners respond to programming that respond to the ecological conversion and at the same time remain cautious on safeguarding outcomes at all levels as per the required standards.</narrative>
