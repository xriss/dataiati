   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Emergency Response for volcano-affected population in Goma</narrative>
  </title>
  <description>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Nyiragongo volcano erupted on the night of May 22 to 23 2021. This was followed by strong seismic activities in the city of Goma and surroundings, with a high risk of a new eruption. This pushed the provincial authorities to issue an evacuation order on May 27, 2021. To be precise, the evacuation particularly concerned 10 quarters out of 18 in the city of Goma. This evacuation order sparked a movement of large numbers of people who had to leave taking the directions as per the government evacuation plan in order to ensure their safety and therefore leave the main red corridors of the lava flow that runway down to the lake, coming from the Nyiragongo. So far, it has been reported that 405,907 people were displaced since the volcanic eruption to different locations such as: Sake, Bukavu, Rutshuru, and Rwanda.
As part of the Displacement Tracking Matrix (DTM) program, teams from the International Organization for Migration (IOM) have identified 4,000 affected households who live in 13 collective centers, including 11 schools and 2 churches, in the city of Goma and the territory of Nyiragongo. As classes resumed on 14th June, households living in these schools are forced to vacate classrooms during the day.
Through this project, Caritas Goma and Anglican Church are proposing to undertake a 3-months emergency live-saving support focusing on Cash Based Intervention through paper vouchers (for food and basic NFIs), and WASH support.
The project will seek to reach at least 6,875 affected people (approximately 1375 households) in the Nyiragongo territory in Goma, North Kivu province. 
Project implementation strategies will focus on provision of life saving support to affected population, at individual/household and community levels.</narrative>
