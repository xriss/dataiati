   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Supporting survivors of sexual violence and their families in South Kivu, DRC</narrative>
  </title>
  <description>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) has long been devastated by war and violence. Dozens of illegal armed groups have been responsible for endless human rights abuses and widespread insecurity.  Sexual and gender-based violence have become defining characteristics of the conflict, a tactic of war. Fuelled and motivated by Congo&#x2019;s minerals, rebel and army forces are inclined to maintain an insecure environment that ensures the continuation of the status quo. Despite intervention by the international community, the eastern zone of the DRC, including South Kivu, where this project is based, remains extremely fragile. Several armed groups continue to create fear amongst communities. Responsible women who walk many miles to collect water and food, are at risk of being attacked several times. The effects of rape and other forms of violence against women go beyond physical suffering and disabilities; they also compromise the psychological health and social life of the women for the rest of their lives. Many of those who have experienced sexual violence remain silent, for fear of being rejected by their families and communities. This project has been identified with the involvement of parish priests, PSA&#x2019;s, community leaders, project participants, staffs of CDJP partner and local authorities. The desire of the project participants which is to expand their enterprises has been taken into consideration during the development of this next phase. There is huge potential for certain enterprises in the area, including bee keeping because most of the honey consumed locally is brought in from Rwanda. CAFOD has funded an initial study into the potential for beekeeping that the project will build upon.
The overall goal of this project is to contribute to the community recovery and recovery of human dignity of people from six parishes in South Kivu, DRC. It will be done by working to achieve the following outcomes: (1)Strengthening the managerial and technical capacity of 300 people; (2) Supporting the victims of rape and their families; (3) Raising awareness of key issues by training 300 participants on environmental protection (tree planting, management of rubbish, efficient use of natural pesticides etc), as championed by Pope Francis in Laudato Si, as well as on protection measures against Coronavirus.</narrative>
