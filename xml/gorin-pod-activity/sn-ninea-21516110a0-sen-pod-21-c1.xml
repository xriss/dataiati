      <narrative xml:lang="EN">Majority of participants of recent activities implemented by GORIN under the POD intervention recommended for the creation of regional networks to be able to effectively engage around concrete joint activities. Although knowledge sharing is one of the most important functions of GORIN, participants feel that the effort should not be limited to a knowledge sharing network. However, to engage in collaborative activities ranging from joint high-level advocacy campaigns and lobby respective regional institutions and governments to influence change at national and regional levels.  
While forming network in these countries, it is apparent that these networks at national levels in Sahel require additional and continuous support to become fully sustainable. This requires constant engagement with networks already formed during the implementation trajectory of the POD for effective information sharing with respect emerging challenges in their respective countries or communities in Sahel.</narrative>

      <narrative xml:lang="EN">It emerged from the PEAs that the target countries in Sahel are experiencing plethora of democratic deficits such as political intolerance, which often fuel intermittent politically motivated violence.  It also emerged that most political actors in the target countries do not recognize the need for a partnership approach and are reluctant to work with civic actors to foster political stability. Furthermore, it emerged that the relationship between states, civil society, and citizens is distrustful, largely because of governments&#x2019; repressive measure imposed particularly during the fight against COVID 19. Protesters are often killed or injured in clashes with security forces, as seen recently in Senegal.

These findings thus justified the need to engage in multi-stakeholder dialogue to address political intolerance festering the social, political, and economic fabric of the respective countries. Such endeavors require trust that must be anchored on respect for good governance principles, whose prerequisite include respect for the rule of law and compliance with international human rights standards and obligations. Therefore, fostering multi-stakeholder-led political dialogue is also a mutually reinforcing effort towards attaining the fundamental principles of democratic good governance whose positive outcome is strengthen civic space and political stability. It is an act of political broadmindedness that drivers of change from the top political pyramid should exercise by encouraging the target civic groups and other actors to actively involved in political processes, not as spectators but key players towards the attainment of political stability. 

It is in this context that this outcome will be achieved by providing an opportunity to encourage partnership and collaborative engagement among political and civic actors to build trust for positive change. Furthermore, weakened interpersonal trust continues to divide citizens along ethnic and political lines, which continues to create obstacles to democratic progress in the target countries.  Similarly, weak social cohesion and mutual distrust among political and civic actors also have a negative impact on civic action. As a result, as seen in Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger, people are reluctant to engage with political actors.</narrative>

It particularly emerged that indoctrinated patriarchal culture and inbuilt patrimonial political system provided little formal platform adaptable to the needs, interests and expectations of women and young people. As result, as one respondent put it, it has become more of privilege rather than a right to nominate or give women and young people the platform to speak out loud. In other words, women and young people want to speak out loud against democratic deficit or being a pioneer of change, but they are not listened to because they are perceived as lack of knowledge and the requisite intellectual competences and inexperience to deal with critical governance issues. 

The result also shows that the civic culture of the countries remained significantly weak, characterized by deliberate neglect by political actors to uphold their constitutional and human rights obligations to include women and youth in political decision-making process. The study also revealed that though specific legal framework and institutions exist with the mandate to promote inclusive participation of women and young people in political process, and with institutions mandated to monitor state compliance to international human rights standards and obligations, their participation and representation have not been fully translated into significant policy influence responsive to democratic good governance, and peacebuilding and conflict prevention challenges of the countries.</narrative>

      <narrative xml:lang="EN">Despite the enormous strides by ECOWAS and sub-regional partners to contain the flames in Sahel, several studies by the Goree Institute have affirmed the lack of the harmonization and coordination of peacebuilding intervention amongst multiple Civil Society actors engaged in peacebuilding and conflict prevention activities. As a result, they have not helped to achieve the wider anticipated outcomes at the regional level. It further emerged that peacebuilding activities at the national and sub-regional levels hardly coherently complement each other owing to the lack of strong alliance among regional and national actors to address challenges. Meanwhile, security issues that are sensitive at a national level in Sahel, tends to be even more sensitive at regional owing to many factors including spillover effective and international organized crimes across porous borders. 

One of the problems revealed by the PEA is the lack of synergy and trust between the different actors. This is implicit of the reality that stakeholders work independently without consultation or collaboration.  Likewise, the lack of proper coordination and complementarity of efforts or coherent approach have led to the increased competition for funding and duplication of efforts. More so, the lack of proper method of transfer of ownership of peacebuilding programme by external actors often results to inadequate capacity of local actors to own the peacebuilding and conflict prevention processes. 

While CSOs play a role in early warning in some countries, the enduring challenge for CSOs is to influence strategies for response and security policy and practice more broadly. Cooperation is challenging, and tension inevitably emerges between organizations with different mandates and expectations. The need to improve cooperation and clarify responsibilities was underscored in the PEAs and activities implemented by GORIN under the POD including capacity building and multi-stakeholders dialogue involving civic actors and political actors in Sahel. While the Sahel from a strong Civil Society perspective lacked institutionalized mechanisms for conflict prevention, there are signs that this is shifting towards more alliance building as indicated by some recent network of Civic Groups created by GORIN as part of the critical outcome of PEAs and engagements with these actors. As also recommended by the regional PEA, the construction of multi-stakeholder networks and alliance building is crucial to the success of the POD programme.</narrative>

      <narrative xml:lang="EN">There are several international and sub-regional, and Cross-National Organizations that are interested in the promotion of civic space as prime defining factors towards political stability in the Sahel region. Some of these includes interdependent institutions such as NIMD and ECOWAS, G 5 Sahel and many others that continue to monitor the political landscape, and also provide constant update on status and threats to civic space in these countries. Therefore, forming strong alliance with these regional actors is critical success factors to the attainment of the intended deliverables and outcomes of the POD Progrmme.

The findings of the PEAs show that while sub-regional organizations work on issues such as promoting civic space, conflict prevention, security, human rights, development, and good democratic governance for political stability in the Sahel region, African Union and ECOWAS has often been blamed for  playing conspiracy of silence on critical pollical issues, and also for allowing governments to get away with many bad policies and exclusion of civic groups from pollical decision making; and for also a lack of commitment to international human rights standards thereby resulting to shrinking civic space.</narrative>

      <narrative xml:lang="EN">According to the interviews, although the sub-regional organizations (ECOWAS, G5 Sahel) often work with CSOs, the collaboration is often insufficient or even vertical. While CSOs participate in activities organized by ECOWAS and others, the recommendations made are not implemented to promote civic space. To promote civic space for conflict prevention in the sub-region, it is essential that sub-regional institutions work closely with CSOs. The Goree Institute intends to engage ECOWAS in a sustained collaboration to promote civic space and more inclusive political systems and to lead the way for other organizations and partners to engage with these institutions.

Being mindful of the willingness of ECOWAS to encourage CSOs as partners in peacebuilding, conflict prevention and good governance, Goree Institute will capitalize on such willingness to formalize partnership with ECOWAS and other regional actors to enhance its productivity in the implementation of PoD Programme in the targeted West African countries. likewise, the functional linkages between GORIN, ECOWAS, and policy makers and CSOs is enhanced, whilst partnership, collaborative engagement and alliances strengthen leading to greater knowledge sharing and information exchange, and capacity building on peacebuilding and conflict prevention.</narrative>

      <narrative xml:lang="EN">There was an overwhelming consensus among respondents regarding an evidential lack of commitment by their respective governments to fully implement their international gender equality standards ratified to strengthen the civic voices of aspiring women and young people. This included the International Convention on the Political Rights of Women (ICPRW); International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR); the Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW); and the Security Council Resolution 1325 on Women, Peace and Security (UNSCR1325). It was also further affirmed that though specific legal provisions are embedded in their respective national Constitutions, and institutions also exist to promote the participation of women and young people in political processes, the laws are not adequately interpreted or effectively implemented. Rather, they are sometime used by political leaders to satisfy their cosmetic political conveniences during election campaign trail or to secure donor confidence. 

The above stated findings affirmed the lack of enabling opportunities or political will at the state level to promote policies gearing towards active inclusion of youth and women in political decision making. As a result, few women and youth have a voice in the policy-making processes representing the largest segment of the voting population. GORIN has noted that only the selected women and youth are now in positions to play leadership roles to influence peacebuilding policies and practice. They already do so having organized themselves into resilient networks and forming alliances to speak with one voice. Some of these efforts have been inspired by the GORIN as part of the outcome of training on women and youth leadership in peacebuilding and conflict prevention and multi-stakeholders&#x2019; dialogue.</narrative>
