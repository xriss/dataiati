    <narrative xml:lang="EN">The goal of U.S. assistance in Djibouti is to support the development of an economically prosperous, stable democracy, capable of partnering with the United States against regional threats. Djibouti is a critical partner in advancing U.S. security interests in a region with entrenched Al Qaeda affiliates, piracy, and countries poised to become economic powerhouses. Djibouti hosts Camp Lemonnier, the only permanent U.S. military installation in Africa. Djibouti&apos;s stability is threatened by uneven economic growth, poor socio-economic indicators, and an economy that is unprepared to meet the needs of and provide opportunities for Djibouti&apos;s large youth population. U.S. assistance, in partnership with the Government of Djibouti, seeks to remove barriers to economic growth and opportunity by promoting improvements in the quality of education; strengthen the legal and regulatory environment in order to encourage private sector investment in Djibouti&apos;s energy sector; and support the growth of a capable and dynamic workforce. U.S. government programming also strengthens the health care system and reduces vulnerability to public health threats. Finally, U.S. assistance builds the capacity of Djiboutian security forces to better secure land and maritime borders and participate in regional peacekeeping operations, thereby contributing to international security.</narrative>
