   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The development impact of the project is expected to be high in terms of its support for productive small businesses and its stimulus for growth and employment generation. Niche players like Factorline fill an important role in the Chilean market. Thus, by having a stronger capital base, Factorline will be able to grow and diversify its asset base increasing the funding available to its target market, MSMEs. As a result, the project will:  - support the growth of productive or service small and micro businesses which increases their income and profitability as well as employment generation; and  - will expand the SME funding beyond simply factoring services by offering a wider range of financial products to SMEs such as auto loans and consumer loans.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The proposed project consists of an equity investment of up to $15 million in Factorline S.A. (Factorline or the  company). This project is aimed at both supporting the promotion of MSME lending in Chile with a particular focus on factoring and other financial products targeted at small and micro enterprises; as well as enhancing the liquidity and the scope of the private equity market in the country.  Factorline stands as the largest independent factoring company in Chile with a total portfolio of $183 million equivalent and about 2,500 clients as of December 31, 2006.  The company is distinguished for targeting primarily small businesses that are currently underserved by the traditional banking sector, fostering the growth of domestic and international trade undertaken by MSMEs in the country.  Factoring plays a significant role in supporting the growth of MSMEs in Chile, providing an alternative to traditional bank financing and thus enabling MSMEs to finance their working capital, increase sales and expand their operations. Although the companys growth in the last years has been solid with a portfolio increase as of year-end 2006 of nearly 60% versus 2004, a larger equity base would enable the company to further develop and expand its operations.  Through this investment, IFC could play a significant role by supporting the growth of a financial intermediary serving niche MSME segments.</narrative>
