   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In light of the recent gas disruptions from Argentina to Chile (gas curtailments from Argentina were about 6.2 million m3/day on average in 2006 out of a total average daily demand of 22 million m3/day), the Chilean Government is emphasizing the diversification of the energy matrix and the successful implementation of hydropower projects such as La Confluencia, in order to mitigate the impact of similar gas disruptions in the future. Following the gas disruption crisis from Argentina, a number of investment decisions to build new thermal plants in Chile have been postponed due to uncertainty in gas availability and pricing.  Further, the gas crisis has lead to an increase in the cost of electricity supply in Chile as it was necessary at times for thermal units to burn diesel oil instead of gas.  The project is a low cost producer of renewable energy and will contribute to the expansion of hydroelectric generation capacity in the Central Interconnected System of Chile (SIC) which supplies the central zone of the country. The primary objective of the project is to help meet electricity demand growth in the SIC, which averaged about 6% per year from 2003 to 2006. As the projects water inflows are primarily determined by snow and glacier melting, the projects hydrology is not closely correlated with that of the system. Hence, it is expected that the project will be available to dispatch at full load from November through March during the dry season, when the hydrology in the system is below average and the SIC has a higher dependency on more expensive thermal generation. The project will therefore provide important climate change mitigation through displacement of thermal generation.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project (La Confluencia or the project) consists of the development, construction, and operation of a 158&#xA0;MW run-of-the-river hydro power plant to be located in the Tinguiririca and Portillo Valleys east of the city of San Fernando in Region VI of Chile. The project area is located in the foot hills of the Andes Mountains, approximately 75km south east of the city of San Fernando. Being a run-of-the-river hydropower plant, the project will generate power at a very low cost and will be among the first power plants in the system to be dispatched. The project is located in a remote and mountainous area and is expected to have a very small environmental footprint. The project supports the World Bank Groups emphasis on promoting low-cost renewable energy.</narrative>
