  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Fundacion Duoc (Duoc) is a higher education institution in Chile providing technical degrees and vocational training to a student body of approximately 40,000.  Duoc sees a strong need to expand the financing options it offers to students, especially to those from lower income brackets who are not eligible for government sponsored programs.  IFC has been in discussions with Duoc and a Chilean bank (or the Bank), to jointly develop a new student loan program for Duoc (the Facility).  Under the new program, loans would be made by the Bank to qualified Duoc students.  The Bank would then administer and collect the loans in cooperation with Duoc.  Duoc would provide a first loss reserve (First loss) for such a program in order to:  -  reduce the risk of loss to the Bank and IFC, and  - help lower the interest rate being charged to its students.  IFC would share the remaining risk of the Facility with the Bank.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project is expected to increase access to higher education, especially among students from lower- and middle-income households. Unlike the profile of students in higher education generally, 60% of which come from families in the two highest income quintiles, 64% of Duocs students come from families classified as middle- and lower-income.  The return to receiving higher education in Chile is high, including for those trained in vocational schools and technical centers, yet the World Bank has found that the relative cost of higher education in Chile is among the highest in the world.  Only about 20% of the population can afford to pay for higher education without outside financing.  Further, existing sources of financing through government and bank programs are mostly unavailable to the lower segment of middle income families, which the proposed Facility is meant to serve.   In addition to increasing access to higher education, the proposed facility will introduce to the financial markets in Chile an affordable student loan scheme that will demonstrate the creditworthiness of lower- and middle-income students graduating with technical and vocational degrees.</narrative>
