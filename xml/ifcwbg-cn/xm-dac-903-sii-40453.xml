   <narrative xml:lang="EN">1. Increase competitiveness and quality in private higher education and vocational training: The Project will contribute to the consolidation trend of the fragmented private higher education and vocational training in China, around the platforms with the highest-quality educational services. This consolidation is expected to catalyze a rise in standards across the sector.

2. Increase access to quality private higher education and vocational training and increase supply of work-ready graduates: The Project will increase access to affordable quality private higher education in China, increasing the supply of work-ready graduates to industries with shortages of qualified entry level staff. 

3. Improve instruction standard through enhanced professional development. The Project will establish a professional development center to deliver training and certification to teachers through professional development activities, including training sessions, webinars, workshops, and events, to help the teachers stay abreast of the changes in student demands, new teaching theories and methodologies and other trends.

4. Employment creation and enhanced local linkages: The Company is expected to directly employ a certain number of additional education professionals after the Project is completed including teachers and administrative staff, as necessary to operate schools. In addition, the Project will create numerous indirect employment opportunities for local communities, and will create demand for locally sourced inputs such as construction materials, and services such as transportation. A large proportion of those materials will be supplied by local MSMEs.</narrative>
