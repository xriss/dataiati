   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Shanghai Fosun Pharmaceuticals Company Limited (Fosun Pharma or the Company) is a leading Chinese pharmaceutical company focused on research, development, production and distribution of pharmaceutical products in China. The Company currently develops, manufactures and sells over 190 formulations and 20 different types of Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients.  Its products have leading market positions in the treatment of gynecological and hepatic diseases, diabetes, and malaria.  All of the Companys production facilities are Chinese GMP (Good Manufacturing Practice) compliant.  Fosun Pharma also possesses one of the largest wholesale and retail distribution networks for pharmaceutical products in China.  The Company holds a 49% stake in Sinopharm Medicine Holding (Sinopharm), one of the largest distributors/retailers in China.  China National Pharmaceutical Group (CNPG), a state owned enterprise, owns the remaining 51% in Sinopharm.  Together Fosun Pharma and Sinopharm maintain a network of more than 1,500 pharmacies in major cities in China, including Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen, and rank as one of top three players in each city.  The purpose of the project is to support the operating activities of Fosun Pharma over the next 12-18 months.  Fosun Pharmas total financial requirements in this period are currently estimated at about $100 million.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The projects major development impacts are as follows:  - Support Chinas medical sector reforms:   Though some privately owned, specialty drug stores have now emerged in several cities with the ability to sell medicines at a comparatively cheap price, they constitute a small portion of the overall market. Fosun Pharmas expansion in pharmaceutical wholesale and retail business through the association with Sinopharm is likely to increase efficiency in the distribution of pharmaceutical products, help cut medical expenditures in China, and support the Chinese governments decision to further reform the pharmaceutical industry.   - Support development of anti-malaria drugs:  In 2004, Guilin Pharma (a subsidiary of Fosun Pharma) was the first pharmaceutical company to introduce artesunate to treat malaria on a worldwide basis and owns a patent on its synthesis.  Guilin Pharma has the exclusive right to manufacture artesunate in China and export artesunate-related products to 37 countries. The project will support the manufacturing on a larger scale of anti-malaria medicines.  - Support of Stock Reform Plan:    IFCs support of the ongoing stock reform plan in the Company supports the overall Chinese stock market reform initiative intended to remove differences between traded and non-traded shares.  - Support improvement of Fosun Pharmas environment and social systems:  IFC will provide assistance to Fosun Pharma for its ongoing initiatives to build capacity and standardize environmental, health and safety management systems throughout its group companies.</narrative>
