  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project is expected to generate significant impact in Chinas EE market development, environmental improvements and financial market development.   - Improved energy usage:  China is facing growing challenges of energy resource shortage. This is largely caused by the fast growing economy and lower efficiency in production and consumption of energy.  Promotion of EE projects and expanded use of renewable energy has been proven the most effective approach to address these issues and therefore has become a high priority for Chinese government.   This project will have very positive impacts on the development of Chinas EE sector. With the increased investment amount, this scaling-up project will help IFC to support a significantly larger number of EE projects which are otherwise illegible for banks traditional financing.  The energy and cost savings achieved from these projects will have significant impacts on the improvement of energy usage in China.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The proposed project (CHUEE II or the project) is part of IFCs strategy for China which entails scaling up its energy efficiency (EE) program in China.  The project, CHUEE II, comprises two components:  - Investment:   An IFC investment in RMB of up to $170 million equivalent in Risk Sharing Facilities (RSF) for 2-3 participating commercial banks in China.  The project would provide risk sharing for the creation of an additional new portfolio of approximately RMB 2.6 billion ($347 million equivalent) dedicated to industrial corporates for energy efficiency upgrades.    - Advisory Services:    A scaling up of the existing advisory services program to complement the new investment program.  The Advisory Services Program will be implemented in partnership with the dedicated CHUEE team of PEP-China based out of IFCs Beijing office.    CHUEE II is a follow-on IFC investment following the successful implementation of CHUEE I (project 24631) with Industrial Bank (IB) and Bank of Beijing (BoB).  The CHUEE I risk sharing facility is proven to be an effective way to mobilize, stimulate and leverage financing from commercial bank partners to energy efficiency (EE) improvement projects.  Since the start of the CHUEE I with IB, the RSF has been utilized faster than expected due to the strong demand in the market for EE project financings.  The objective of this project is to scale up IFCs investment in this sector by committing additional IFC risk-capital and increasing the leverage on the Global Environment Facility (GEF) first loss allocation relative to CHUEE I. The project will be offered to a number of commercial banks in China including.</narrative>
