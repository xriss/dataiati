   <narrative xml:lang="EN">1. Climate Change mitigation/ Clean energy generation: This investment will help address China&apos;&apos;s air pollution and climate change related challenges. Envision&apos;&apos;s turbines are expected to reduce CO2 emissions between 1.3 million ton CO2 eq / year and 2,1 million ton CO2 eq / year. The proposed IFC investment will help Envision strengthen its market position which will increase its ability to provide wind solutions in China and other emerging markets. 2. Job creation: The proposed Project is expected to support 2,300 direct jobs by 2020. Envision currently has 900 employees working on its manufacturing operations and expects its growth to result in the hiring of at least 1,400 employees in the next 5 years. The Project will also create significant indirect jobs along Envision&apos;&apos;s supply chain.   3. South-South investments: IFC financing will support the Company to continue to invest in the growth of wind energy in China and other emerging markets such as LAC, MENA and Asia. By investing in leading players across the wind turbine manufacturing supply chain, IFC can help facilitate the accelerated adoption of renewable energy in markets across these regions.</narrative>
