   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The proposed project is expected to have many positive impacts on Chinas financial market and economic development.  The SME sector, mostly privately owned, account for a significant proportion of employment of the country.  A growing and robust SME sector is critical to help accelerate Chinas transition to a market economy.  However due to the small scale of the SMEs, this sector has always been under served by banks which provide over 90% of funding to the economy.  Among all the difficulties, lack of access to banks financing is always cited as the top challenge faced by SMEs.  The project is expected to have the following developmental benefits:  - Increase access to credit for the underserved SME sector; - With term financing available, SMEs will be able finance investments in long term assets which is important to improve its operations and competitiveness, therefore, stimulating business growth, income and employment generation; - Strengthen BDB to expand its lending activities to SME and improve its sustainability.  This would have a strong demonstration effect to illustrate that SME financing is commercially viable and encourage other banks in China to engage in the sector.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The proposed project is to provide a three to five year term loan to Business Development Bank (BDB or the Bank), a provider of small and medium sized enterprise (SME) financing in the eastern part of China fully owned by foreign institutional institutions.  The IFC loan will be used to broaden the credit products of the BDB to provide loans at longer tenors which are not easily available to SMEs, and help fund the growth strategy of the Bank.  The project provides IFC with a unique opportunity to assist in the development of the growing SME market in China where banks penetration rates have been low as the involvement of state banks are not strong.</narrative>
