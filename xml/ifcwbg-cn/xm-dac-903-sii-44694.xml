   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Assessment of Project Outcomes:
IFC anticipates that the project will have positive stakeholder and environment effects through increased access to WWT. The project&apos;s focus on frontier regions will increase access in areas where treatment rates are lower than in China&apos;s large urban areas. Moreover, water pollution control remains a pressing issue in China where WWT plays a pivotal role by reducing the release of pollutants and the contamination of local water sources caused by the discharge of untreated water. The project will support expansion of WWT capacity to satisfy the growing demand of quality water and WWT service. This is expected to have strong positive impact in a province such as Shaanxi that suffers from extreme water stress levels.

Assessment of Contribution to Market Creation:    
The project is expected to contribute to competitiveness in the WWT sector by supporting the expansion of an experienced actor operating in the frontier provinces. The sector remains dominated by SOEs and local SOEs centered on the larger cities, and the project&apos;s focus on frontier regions, high operational standards, and subsector initiatives is likely to have a positive demonstration effects for other players to replicate.&#xC2;</narrative>
