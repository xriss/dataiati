   <narrative xml:lang="EN">- Increase access to high quality medical care:   The need for high quality opthalmological care is acute in China, as existing medical resources cannot meet the demand for services. China has less than one-third the number of opthalmologists per capita than the U.S.; and many simple problems, such as myopia, which can be corrected with eyeglasses, go untreated, having implications for education and employment.  Further, most opthalmological hospitals are located in major urban centers, whereas Aier Eye is expanding its operations into second-tier cities, thus serving populations that may not otherwise have access to quality care.    - Demonstrate best practices throughout the medical community:   Aier Eye stresses quality, transparent patient care, and has put in place a system to ensure that it is achieved. For instance, Aier has nearly eliminated the practice of making informal payments to doctorsubiquitous in Chinaby greatly rewarding those doctors who declare such payments and fining those who accept them. The Group has also de-linked doctors remuneration from sales of medications in attempt to combat the common practice of over-prescribing drugs. Aiers focus on staff training and customer service also make it a leader in the country. In April 2006, Aier Eye was cited as the most distinguished and distinctive eye hospital by Health Times, a subsidy of Peoples Daily, the most influential newspaper in China. Further, companies such as Bausch &amp; Lomb, Alcon, and VISX have established Aier Eye as their base for training medical staff on new equipment.  - Establish links with local communities and public entities:  In addition to providing high quality care, Aier establishes links with the local community by carrying out education campaigns, free eye testing in schools, free eye exams in rural areas, and free or discounted surgeries for disadvantaged people. Aier Eye, which began operating within public hospitals, continues to work in conjunction with the public sector, ensuring that they operate in complement to pubic facilities. Aier has training and research relationships with several public universities, including Zhongshan University in South China, Donghua University in East China, and Zhongnan University in Central China, as well as with the Ministry of Health.</narrative>
