   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Farmers Reached: Currently, about 1,000 rural households are working with the Company as contract farmers for commercial ducks and broilers farming. The Project will increase the number by another 500 rural households.    Food Safety: The Chinese poultry sector is still characterized by poor hygiene standards, inadequate bio-security, and over-use of antibiotics. By investing in Hekangyuan, IFC is supporting a company with a focus on efficiency and food safety and then enhancing its image in the market and setting an example for other similar companies in the industry.   Supply Chain Efficiency- the Company is dedicated to the improvement of poultry breeding operation. Its development means the increased supply of high-quality day old ducks and chicks to commercial duck/broiler operations, which enhances the whole supply chain efficiency (better FCR/lower mortality, etc).</narrative>
