   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Expanding Access to Finance for Healthcare, Education and Agriculture Sectors: Healthcare, education and agriculture sectors are of high importance to people&apos;&apos;s life and the welfare of the whole society, but these sectors have been under-served by commercial banks in China.  IFC&apos;&apos;s additional funding support for JFLC can help increase the access to finance for healthcare, education and agriculture sectors across China;  Supporting Economic Growth in Frontier Regions: penetration rate of financial services in China&apos;&apos;s frontier region has been much lower than that in the coastal areas. Though JFLC is located in Nanjing City, nearly half of its leasing portfolio is in frontier region, and the Company is expanding its footprint in frontier region by expanding into the agriculture in western China and northeastern China etc.  IFC&apos;&apos;s funding support will help the Company to address the financing needs in frontier region, support the economy growth there and thus narrow the gap between frontier regions and coastal regions;  Promoting the Development of China&apos;&apos;s Leasing Sector: leasing penetration is only 4.8% in China by 2013, much lower than that of 15% to 30% in developed countries. IFC&apos;&apos;s further investment and continuous support for JFLC will help the Company to address the challenge in asset liability management, encourage it to further strengthen risk management, corporate governance and etc, and help build a model institution in China&apos;&apos;s leasing sector, therefore have a strong impact on promoting the sector&apos;&apos;s sustainable development.</narrative>
