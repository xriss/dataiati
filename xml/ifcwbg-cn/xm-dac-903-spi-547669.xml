   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project involves the construction and operation of three landfill gas to energy (LFGTE) projects in China at Dalian in Liaoning Province and Huizhou and Huiyang in Guangdong Province.  For each LFGTE project, there will be a network of vertical landfill gas (LFG) extraction wells, a LFG conveyance system, a blower station, an enclosed flare, and a LFG fueled internal combustion engine(s) for the generation of electricity that will be sold to the local power grid.   PhasCon is implementing a Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) project at each LFGTE project based on the capture of fugitive methane from the landfills at each site.  Jointly or independently with the landfill operator at each site, PhasCon will undertake the following:  - Designing, constructing, and maintaining a one meter thick landfill cover system to divert storm water, prevent storm water infiltration, and enhance the anaerobic degradation of the in-place waste;  - Designing, installing and operating the LFG collection system to limit fugitive emissions of methane; - Designing, installing and operating a leachate recirculation system for leachate pretreatment while enhancing the degradation of the in-place waste;   - Designing, constructing and operating a power generation system that uses the captured methane to generate electricity;  - Establishing an Internet-based communication, monitoring and control system for operating LFG recovery, power generation systems and leachate recycling on a regional basis; and, - Assist the landfill operator with respect to waste placement and management, and the construction of leachate and LFG management systems during waste placement.   Each project will be developed in two stages. During the first stage, the final cover system for the landfill, the leachate recirculation system (where applicable) and the LFG collection and conveyance systems will be constructed.  The collected LFG will be thermally treated in the enclosed landfill gas flare. In the second stage, the LFG fueled power generation equipment will be installed at the site and a grid connection established by the electric company, as required by the Chinese Renewable Energy Law.  The law also requires the electric companies to purchase the power from LFG projects. During the second stage, LFG will be consumed by the power generation equipment, while the enclosed flare will serve as a backup LFG treatment system.  Each LFGTE project will reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions through the capture and treatment of fugitive methane and the displacement of grid-based power, which is primarily supplied by coal-fired power stations, with power generated from the projects.  PhasCon intends to register each LFGTE project as a CDM project, as provided for under the Kyoto Protocol, generate Certified Emission Reductions (CERs), and sell these CERs to the IFC-Netherlands Carbon Facility (INCaF).</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Dalian site is located in the Ganjingzi District of Dalian City in Liaoning Province in northeastern China and comprises three Phases.  The landfill is located between Bohai Bay, on which the city of Dalian is located, and the Shenda Highway, which is the north-south road between Dalian and Shenyang.  An overpass for exit from the highway was recently built over Phase 1 of the landfill, which will not be capped or used for LFG collection.  The LFGTE project is under construction and only contemplates the collection of gas from Phase 2 and Phase 3 of the existing landfill.  Active landfilling is only taking place in Phase 3.  Both Phase 2 and 3 of the landfill were constructed with lined cells and have been provided with a leachate collection system.  Collected leachate from the landfill phases is conveyed to an on-site treatment plant, prior to either discharge to the Bohai Bay or recirculation into the landfill to increase LFG production.  Phase 2 has been capped and LFG extraction wells and conveyance lines have been installed.  In Phase 3, LFG extraction wells are being constructed concurrently with the waste placement activities.   The Huiyang site is located in the Qiaobei Village, Huiyang District of Huizhou City in Guangdong Province in southern China. The Huiyang District lies approximately 20 kilometers south from the center of Huizhou City.  The LFGTE project will be located on the currently active Phase 1 of the landfill.  The landfill was constructed with a bottom liner and has a leachate collection system.  Collected leachate from the landfill is conveyed to an on-site pond, from which it is pumped to an on-site treatment plant, prior to discharge to the adjacent Danshui River.  As part of the Huiyang LFGTE project, leachate may be re-circulated through the landfill.  Gas collection wells are being constructed concurrent with the waste placement activities.  The Huizhou site is located four kilometers west of downtown Huizhou City in Guangdong Province in southern China.  The landfill comprises four general areas, the inactive Phase 1 waste landfill, the active Phase 2 waste landfill, the new ash landfill cell, and the future ash landfill cell. The LFGTE project only contemplates LFG collection from the inactive Phase 1 waste landfill.  Leachate from the project area drains to a leachate collection pond, from where it is pumped via pipe to an offsite waste water treatment facility.  The project area at Huizhou has been partially capped and no LFG wells have been constructed yet.</narrative>
