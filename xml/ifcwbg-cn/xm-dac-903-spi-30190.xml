   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Project will support a waste tire rubber modified asphalt (RMA) producer, Tianjin Hi-tech Environment Development Co., Ltd (Haitai or the Company), which also designs and operates equipment for RMA production. Through its proprietary know-how in material and equipment design, Haitai offers a product with higher rubber-to-asphalt ratio by using up more waste tires and less asphalt (less petroleum). This leads to more carbon efficient and durable roads that are also more cost effective than those paved on existing roads. This Project will support Haitais expansion into Chinas frontier regions.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">There is growing need for better management of natural resources and pollution in the continued economic and population growth of China and the rest of the world. Natural resource management and reduced utilization of fossil-fuel based resources are important for both climate change and sustainable growth.  

While much emphasis has been put into supporting China&apos;s domestic industries, with construction the 4th largest in energy consumption, the efforts to reduce the energy intensity of China&apos;s growth (especially with growing environmental pressures and the global financial crisis) are a continuing and significant effort that is increasingly being stressed by the national government and international community.

Companies like Haitai are emerging as critical drivers of innovation in natural resource management and energy efficiency, particularly in China.  Haitai is contributing to the development of the clean technology sector in China and assisting the government of China to adopt higher quality and more environmentally friendly roads. 

An investment in this industry will greatly support the Company&apos;s ability to develop and grow in the domestic clean technology sector, by expanding to the frontier regions where China&apos;s planned expressway network will reach.  The investment may also help Haitai transfer knowledge and products to other developing regions outside of China.

The Project will have significant developmental impact by:

i.	Contributing to the development of the clean technology sector in China;
ii.	Assisting the government of China in achieving its transport construction goals while at the same time reducing cost and impact to the environment; 
iii.	Using 300,000 tons of RMA asphalt can save 60,000 tons of petroleum (105,000 tons CO2 equivalent compared to paving with conventional SBS modified asphalt), use up nearly 10 million pieces of waste tires, and reduce RMB200 mm in construction cost.</narrative>
