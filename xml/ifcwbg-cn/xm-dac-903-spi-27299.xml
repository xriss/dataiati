   <narrative xml:lang="EN">EDC China (EDC or the Company) is a greenfield project involving the construction and operation of 12 datacenters in China.  The project will be carried out in two phases.  The first phase will consist of five datacenters in primary cities (Shanghai and Beijing) and secondary cities (Chengdu, Suzhou and Chongqing).</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Information technology is an increasingly significant component that underlies the foundation for growth for infrastructure in developing countries. This holds true particularly for China, where growth is fueled by efficient deployment of information technology. Datacenter operations are critical to ensure the security and stability of IT services for all businesses. This is becoming an increasingly necessary component of IT solutions in China as businesses (particularly in the Financial Services Industry) deal with increasingly sensitive and critical information; and firms in China finalize the centralization of their IT production systems, thus making IT services particularly vulnerable to business interruption stemming from threats of any nature, from power outages to natural disasters.  An investment in this nascent and underinvested industry will greatly support the companys ability to develop and grow in the domestic datacenter sector, specifically in secondary areas.  While much emphasis has been put into developing sophisticated IT solutions for companies in China, only recently (especially after the devastating earthquake in Sichuan) has the importance of data security, backup, and consolidation been stressed in the business community.    The project will have significant developmental impact by:    - bringing higher standards of datacenter infrastructure and service to local, national, and even international companies, thus facilitating the implementation of efficient IT solutions and best practices, - supporting a new and independent Chinese company in rolling out operations in frontier regions in China, including Sichuan, Shaanxi and Liaoning, thereby providing quality, cost effective, and secure datacenter facilities for local businesses whose operations may be vastly improved, - demonstrating to other domestic players as it is the first company to provide quality services and infrastructure that are compliant with international standards, and - providing world-class infrastructure and connectivity to specific geographic areas to enable companies that need IT services to operate, especially given that IT infrastructure penetration is not uniform in developing countries such as China.</narrative>
