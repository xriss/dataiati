   <narrative xml:lang="EN">As one of Chinas leading manufacturers in the wood flooring segment this project will have the following development impacts.  - Encouraging shift to more environmentally friendly wood flooring products:  The strategy of the company is to grow into a world class flooring company with more diversified product portfolio and to move away from solid hard wood flooring to more environmentally friendly laminated and engineered flooring products.   - Improving the sustainability of forest and plantation management and supply chain practices:  Natures commitments to IFC and the China Forest Trade Network on wood sourcing will make Nature one of the first in China to adopt such strict standards and will establish it as a leader on sustainable management practices.   - Climate change challenge:  Adoption of sustainable forest management by Nature brings several benefits, including reduced climate change impact - but also biodiversity conservation, social inclusion, watershed protection, reduced erosion etc.  The companys FSC commitment for its plantation, plus sourcing targets for wood supply all contribute toward SFM and the range of sustainability benefits that it brings.  In the plantations alone it is estimated that the project will have a positive impact of 350,000 tons/yr.   - Supporting the development of underdeveloped areas in China:  The project includes two sub-projects in frontier areas in China. One is in Heilongjiang province of North-East China, another is in ShangRao of Jiangxi Province of Central China.  These two areas are considered underdeveloped regions and the employment that will be generated by the plantations and the manufacturing units is significant and contribute the fiscal revenues.</narrative>
