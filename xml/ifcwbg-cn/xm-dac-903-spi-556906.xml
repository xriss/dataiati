   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Xinglong Hydropower Co. Ltd (Xinglong or the company) is a power generation company established in 2003 to develop, implement and operate medium and small-sized hydro power stations in the Guizhou province. In late 2003 the company was awarded the rights to develop the hydropower resources in Kaiyang county, which are estimated at over 100MW.   Since 2004, the company has been engaged in the development and implementation of two run-of-river hydro power generation facilities in the Yuliang river, namely Najiang (21MW) and Zijang (12MW), representing a total investment in the order $26-28 million. Construction of Najiang is nearly completed with expected commercial operations to begin in September 2007. As for Zijang, construction is scheduled to begin in September 2007, and its commercial operation is envisioned to start during the 2nd or 3rd Quarter of 2009.   It is anticipated that these two facilities will be registered under the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) of the Kyoto Protocol, to generate and sell up to an estimated 95,000 tons/year of Certified Emissions Reductions (CERs) to be granted on the basis of run-of-river hydro generation assets that displace fossil fuel based generation in the southern grid (mostly coal).</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">Nanjiang Hydropower Project (Nanjiang) and Zijiang Hydropower Project (Zijiang), the two facilities comprising the project, are located at the main stream of the Yuliang river near Duduzhai village in Kaiyang County in Guizhou province. The nearest large city from the both sites is Guiyang city, the provincial capital, approximately 88 kilometers northwest of the project site.  Nanjiang is located at the Yuliang River between Duduzhai village and Nangong village of Kaiyang county. Nanjiang lies in a valley with steep mountains on both sides. The river channel is narrow and consists mainly of bare rock with more rich vegetation on the mountains.  Zijiang is located near Xiaoshuashan Ziran village. The project area is mountainous and the valley has a U-shape. The area has some vegetation, but rocks are bare and the mountains have steep slopes.  Both sites are suitable for the construction and operation of hydropower projects in terms of both the average water flows and the altitude of the heads provided by the sites.</narrative>
