   <narrative xml:lang="EN">As Weigao enters the technologically more sophisticated, branded medical products sectors  where China is still heavily reliant on imports  the project will help to create a greater domestic capability in these areas (e.g., drug-eluting stents, dialysis, etc.).  Furthermore, the project will foster greater technology transfer.  Through the project, Weigao will continue to demonstrate that Chinese manufacturers with strong medical and technical manufacturing capabilities are able to continue to grow and become world-class.  As the companys production of high-value added products comes on stream, Weigao would become an important tax revenue generator.  The additional employment expected to be generated through the project is estimated at over 200 jobs.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project consists of an investment program to be implemented by Shandong Weigao Group Medical Polymer Company Ltd. (Weigao or the company) over the next 3 years.  The project will expand the existing production capacity of Weigao and its operating subsidiaries across several business lines and has the following components:   - the expansion of Weigaos production capacity for its existing product range (i.e., consumables that include syringes, sterile infusion sets, blood bags, intravenous needles); - the introduction of new blood purification products, kidney dialysis products, and the establishment of a chain of kidney dialysis treatment centers; - the expansion of orthopedic products production capacity; and  - the expansion of drug-eluting stents production capacity.    Weigao is the leading manufacturer of single-use medical supplies in China.  Since establishment in 2000, its main operation has been the manufacturing of consumable products.  The companys strategic objective for growth is to expand into more technologically advanced, branded medical products of world-class quality, while continuing to be the domestic leader in manufacturing generic disposable medical products.</narrative>
