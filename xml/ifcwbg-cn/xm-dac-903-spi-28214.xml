   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Energy efficiency improvements are important for both climate change and sustainable growth.  Both in China and other countries, better management of natural resources and decreased pollution will be necessary to alleviate the strains of continued economic and population growth.

Energy management companies are emerging as rapidly increasing critical supporters of energy efficiency technology, particularly in China.  Since 1996, when the World Bank-supported Chinas Energy Conservation Project, which helped found three pilot EMCs, over 100 EMC companies have emerged. As large industrial companies typically do not have the in-house technological, managerial or financial capacity devoted for the development of energy efficiency technologies, the services provided by EMC companies are recognized as a unique value proposition and viable standalone businesses.  However, EMCs face a host of challenges themselves, and in particular have difficulty obtaining financing due to lack of familiarity with their business model.

An investment in Shuoren will greatly support the Companys ability to develop and grow in the domestic energy efficiency sector, primarily focusing on steel but also expanding to other sectors.  Efforts to reduce the energy consumption driven by Chinas growth, especially with growing environmental pressures and the global financial crisis are continuing and increasingly being stressed by the national government and international community.

The Project will have significant developmental impact by:

Contributing to the development of the clean technology sector in China;

Enabling turnkey solutions for clients who benefit from the introduction of energy efficiency technology to decrease upfront capital costs required to implement projects that reduce energy use and mitigate environmental impacts; and

Assisting the government of China in achieving its energy reduction goals in the short and long term, which is an important part of global initiatives to mitigate climate change impacts.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Founded in 2003 in Beijing, Shuoren Energy High-Tech Co. (Shuoren, or the Company) designs and implements blast furnace dehumidification technology for major steel manufacturers in China.  Shuorens proprietary technology is designed to improve energy efficiency, both from reduced energy costs and from improved performance.  Shuoren is part of an emerging group of energy management companies (EMC, or ESCO) that finance, install, operate and maintain equipment that support energy efficiencies.</narrative>
