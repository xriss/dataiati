   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Boost economy in the frontier regions: Yangxiang is the largest private pig company in Guangxi, a frontier region, and has presence in other frontier regions, including Henan, Hebei, Liaoning, and Hunan. The proposed Project will help improve farmers&apos;&apos; income and boost the economy in the frontier regions.  Food Safety and Supply Chain Efficiency: The Chinese pig sector is still characterized by poor hygiene standards, inadequate bio-security, and over-use of antibiotics. By investing in Yangxiang, IFC is supporting a company with both the capacity and willingness to improve food safety. Besides positive impact on food safety, an upgrading supply chain management supported by the Project will also result in the improvement of pig farming operation and quality of output (better feed conversion ratio and lower mortality), which enhances the overall supply chain efficiency.  Farmers Reached: Currently, about 1,000 contract farmers are growing the commercial hogs for Yangxiang. The Project is expected to reach 4,000 additional contract farmers. Yangxiang is to enable the contract farmers to reduce piglet mortality and improve operational efficiency.</narrative>
