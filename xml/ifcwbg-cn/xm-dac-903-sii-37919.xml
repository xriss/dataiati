   <narrative xml:lang="EN">1. Promoting financial inclusion: Despite MSMEs being the primary source of growth and employment, MSMEs typically cannot get sufficient affordable financing because of subscale operation and lack of real property (e.g. land, plant), which commercial banks require as collaterals. Leasing has become the most important funding source for MSMEs as it is based on moveable assets, e.g. trucks, machines, equipment, in Lionbridge&apos;&apos;s case. In the past, MSMEs could only rely on guarantee companies to get access to short term bank loans, which exposed them to volatility of funding, risk of sustainable operation given the mismatch in the tenure of funding and the life of operation machine/ equipment, as well as a bottleneck in expansion. The proposed project will effectively help Lionbridge Leasing diversify funding sources, improve funding stability and utilization, reach out to more MSMEs and expand credit to them. It is expected that Lionbridge will reach additional 20,000 MSMEs by 2020.  2. Promoting healthy development of the financial leasing sector: the financial leasing industry in China is nascent and for a number of financial leasing companies, the transactions are related to shadow banking. On the contrary, Lionbridge was able to serve the underserved segment with a true leasing model, where the leases are repaid by the cash flow generated by the leasing asset. The success of Lionbridge will set a good example for the whole industry and help establish the right culture and mindset for the industry players, MSME clients, regulatory parties and investors, thus promote the long-run development of leasing sector in China. 3. Job creation: the integrated logistics service will enable Lionbridge to recruit truck drivers to deliver the transportation services with Lionbridge&apos;&apos;s trucks under financial lease model. Lionbridge has over 1,000 trucks now and targets to expand to 30,000 trucks in 3-5 years, which will create at least 30,000 jobs in the future. 4. Promoting healthcare services in frontier regions: traditionally, HD services is not sufficient especially in the frontier region, where basic medical service has not fully covered yet. Lionbridge&apos;&apos;s HD center model will largely make HD services available at an affordable price to the rural population, improving the patients&apos;&apos; life quality.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The proposed project is to provide a three year up to US$20 million USD loan to Lionbridge Financial Leasing (China) Co., Ltd.
