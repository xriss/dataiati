   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Deqingyuan is currently constructing an anaerobic digester to produce biogas (the Biogas Project) that will be fueled by chicken litter collected from its egg-laying operations.  This project will produce biogas for power, litter residue for use as fertilizer and Certified Emission Reductions (CERs) generated by the avoided release of methane from the anaerobic digestion of the chicken litter and by the replacement of primarily coal-fired grid electricity with biogas-fueled power.  The CERs will be sold to the IFC-Netherlands Carbon Facility (INCaF).  DQY sells high-quality green eggs and has received three different Chinese certifications for the environmental attributes of its production.

Deqingyuans chicken farm has three million chickens, which produce 220 tons of droppings and 170 tons of wastewater per day. If this waste were not treated efficiently, it would become a pollution source. However, the waste provides an opportunity to generate a significant volume of biogas-fueled power.  The chicken excrement generated in the companys chicken farm will be used as the raw material for the planned Biogas Project and would otherwise be a source of pollution.  After treatment by the anaerobic digester, the residue will be used as organic fertilizer for approximately 19,200 hectares of surrounding corn farms and orchards.  DQYs chicken raising operation consumes 60,000 tons of corn annually produced on local farms.  The estimated income to the local farmers is RMB 40 million.

The Biogas Projects use of an anaerobic digester to treat droppings and generate biogas will avoid the emission of two greenhouse gases: methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O).  Annual biogas production will be approximately 6.5 million m3.  A gas engine will convert the biogas into power, which will sell power to the local grid company.  The project will generate 10 million kWh annually, which will displace predominantly coal-fired power on the grid, thereby indirectly reducing the emissions of CO2.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The development of this project accords with Chinese Governments energy industry and technology development plan as well as its strategy for the commercialization and implementation of renewable energy power projects.  The project will demonstrate a renewable energy technology and increase local employment and tax revenue. The project can be expected to improve the air quality in the vicinity of the companys operations and be a demonstration project for environmental protection in Chinas fowl raising industry.

Such project can supply a large quantity of organic fertilizer for crop production, promote the development of organic agriculture, improve the product quality of the crop farming sector and increase the income of this sector.  The reduction in methane and carbon dioxide emissions benefits the global environment by reducing the emission of greenhouse gases which cause climate change.</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project is located in Deqingyuans chicken breeding park, which is 1.2 kilometers away to the northeast of Shuiyu Village, Zhangshanying Town, Yanqing County, Beijing City.  The project will be constructed in the southeast of the park.  National Way Highway Route 110 is 1.8 kilometers away to the south of the park, Songshan Mountain is located to the north of the park, and to the east there are several villages. There are no large-scale breeding farms or factories or other pollution sources within 20 kilometers of the park.</narrative>
