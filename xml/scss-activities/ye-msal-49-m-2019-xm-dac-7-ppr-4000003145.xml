   <narrative xml:lang="EN">A track II youth and civil society platform facilitated by the Sana&#x2019;a Center. This interactive initiative seeks to both invest in building and empowering the next generation of Yemeni youth and civil society actors and to engage them in critical national issues. Building on the Sana&#x2019;a Center&#x2019;s core goal of producing knowledge by local voices, this initiative seeks to develop and invest in young policy analysts and writers across Yemen. Through this two-year initiative, the Center will build the capacity of dozens of youth and civil society representatives from across Yemen focusing on key topics and regions. Capitalizing on its strong network, the Sana&#x2019;a Center will also create various platforms and hubs for national and marginalized local voices and initiatives in Yemen and the diaspora to influence policies and shape narratives at all levels. To influence policy- and decision-making, the Center will link these groups and their peacebuilding efforts with the UN-led peace process, political processes, local, regional, and international stakeholders, and the media.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The overall goal of the Yemen Peace Forum is to expand the participation of Yemeni youth and civil society, including women, in the peacemaking process, to build their policy analysis, writing and communication skills and reactivate their political role domestically and internationally. The project will work to achieve this goal by : &#x25CF; Building a platform for community groups to collaborate on national issues, define peace and engage in peacebuilding and the peacemaking process. &#x25CF; Equipping youth activists and civil society representatives, focusing on CSOs, with the tools to produce knowledge and conduct international advocacy about Yemeni issues from a grassroots perspective. &#x25CF; Facilitating access for youth and civil society to inform, engage, influence and build relationships with international stakeholders, policymakers and donors and the media. &#x25CF; Mobilizing the voices of youth and civil society to inform and influence the UN and international peace processes. &#x25CF; Informing and engaging the international community on Yemeni issues from a grassroots and youth perspective to facilitate a more responsive, inclusive approach to Yemen and the peace process. &#x25CF; Building local youth and civil society buy in for the UN-led peace process.</narrative>
