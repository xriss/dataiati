   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Addressing the critical WASH needs of vulnerable communities in South Kordofan State</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This proposed project aims to address the critical WASH needs in South Kordofan State (SKS) among newly displaced persons, internally displaced persons (IDPs) facing long-term displacement, South Sudanese refugees (SSRs), and vulnerable host community members, targeting an estimated 121,169 direct beneficiaries in Kadugli locality. Targeted villages include Murta, Kulba, Tillow (including Tafrey) and As-Samma in Kadugli locality. Within these extremely vulnerable communities, particular attention will be given to the following households (HH): HH headed by women as the only breadwinner for the family, HH with pregnant women and lactating mothers, HH with children under the age of five, HH with malnourished children, and HH with people with disabilities and elderly people. The most vulnerable HH in these targeted localities are already suffering from shortages of water and a weak sanitation infrastructure, leading to poor hygiene. This has been further exacerbated by the influx of newly displaced IDPs forced to flee the intermittent fighting between the Sudan People Liberation Movement-North (SPLM-N) and Government forces. The new IDP displacement is primarily due to the lack of food and services in SPLM-N controlled areas.

Based on an interagency needs assessment carried out in May 2017, and a Mercy Corps (MC) needs assessment conducted in September 2017, efforts will be made to provide beneficiaries in the targeted localities access to more than 10 l/p/d safe drinking water through community-based operation, maintenance, and management of water resources based on cost recovery system through water user fees. This will ensure sustainability, community ownership and enhance community resilience. In addition, 96 local WASH committee members (with gender balanced and equal youth representation) belonging to eight WASH committees, will be trained to support WASH service delivery 32 non-functional hand pumps will be rehabilitated two non-functional water systems will be rehabilitated and upgraded to hybrid solar power and 675 priority emergency household latrines for new arrivals will be constructed through cash for work. The extremely poor HH who cannot afford to pay water fees will be covered under a water voucher system to access water after going through rigorous vetting and identification process. All targeted beneficiaries will have access to adequate sanitation (1 latrine for 20 persons). In addition, 160 community members will have increased technical and administrative capacity to manage WASH services in an emergency, and 40 monthly community cleaning campaigns will be conducted.

The current project&apos;s activities will also work to prevent the spread of acute watery diarrhea (AWD) through water quality control, chlorination, coverage, and hygiene and sanitation promotion thus complementing the ongoing AWD response under CERF funding. This approach will be supported by strong community engagement in all stages of the process. Coordination will be carried out closely with health authorities in the locality and state, and the WASH sector.

The partnership with Alsalam Organization for Rehabilitation and Development (AORD) will provide cost-effective coverage to all the prioritized villages in Kadugli, where both MC and AORD will implement WASH prioritized activities providing coverage to their respective villages. This approach will provide wider coverage as well as reach 100% of the newly displaced IDPs and refugees in this area.</narrative>
