   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Continue providing access to quality health services to communities in Abyei North.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Global Aid Hand has been implementing a Health project in the areas in North Abyei for the last three years with support from several partners among them SHF. Abyei is cut off from the rest of Sudan and suffers a myriad of problems similar to other places in the country but has very limited response. The  recurring challenges in the areas include poor access to health and nutrition services, low capacities of health and nutrition staff, disease outbreaks, insufficient harvests, high rates of malnutrition, low access to potable water, and mixed use of water sources for both human and animal consumption. Conflict exacerbates these challenges, forces people to flee their homes, and results in the destruction of property and assets, the situation is worsened by the poor infrastructure in the area with roads inaccessible during rainy seasons. Currently all the four clinics of of Diffra (8,500) and an additional of approximately 16500 settled at Amiet and Gole entry from South Sudan.  Mekenis (7,500) ,and additional 9000 in surrounding villages  Um Khair (8,500) plus approximately 3000 nomads from surrounding areas and Radaya (5,500), plus approximately additional 1500 from surrounding villages   have been running through the just concluded support from SHF.  These people plus the population of surrounding villages an additional 30,000 persons which include the newly settled refugees from South Sudan and those in transit to other parts of Sudan will benefit from this project as there are no other health facilities nearby. The project thus aims to reach 60,000. The health situation in Abyei is further worsened by the options left to patients when they need referral, one option is going to Abyei town which is out of reach as the South is not accessible by the people in the North and Vis Versa or to make the long trip to Al Muglad which is 6 hours away on a very bad road that becomes impassible during the rainy season. This project will support the four clinics to cater for the health needs of the people in this areas increasing morbidity and reducing mortality.  Since GAH started running the clinics the facilities have had a facelift and been repaired and maintained, they have also had full time staff who are motivated to stay due to the incentives paid by the project, if this project stops the clinics will suffer a draw back and the people will have no access to good health. GAH would like funds to work on the investments made in these clinics and thus ensure they are left at a point where they are self sustaining. Already due to advocacy with the ministry of health a medical doctor is now resident in the area as from Jan 2017. GAH would like to use the funds to continue supporting the clinics so they can attract more health cadre as the area is remote and many staff opt to go elsewhere. The clinics will continue to run primary health care services, maternal and child health care services, IMCI services and vaccination. The clinics will also be points for health education and anchors to nutrition and WASH projects in the area. GAH would like to put up a maternity wing in one of the health centers Diffra with facilities for emergency Cesarean Section to reduce maternal deaths and other related problems due to obstructed labor.  The project will also conduct health campaigns and immunization campaigns in the villages around the health centers, the schools and the market.
GAH will also like to continue to address a better coordination and managing of existing referral system through capacity building of existing actors.

Currently GAH has received funds from UNICEF to support the clinics in the gap months that the last project was experiencing and additional funds to carryout Nutrition and WASH activities to complement the project.  The process of receiving additional funds to cover an extra 3 months is underway and this will complement this project especially in staffing.</narrative>
