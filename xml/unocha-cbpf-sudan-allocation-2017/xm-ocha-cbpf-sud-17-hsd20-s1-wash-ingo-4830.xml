   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The humanitarian situation in South Kordofan is seriously affected by the fighting between Sudan Armed Forces (SAF) and Sudan People&apos;s Liberation Movement-North&apos;s (SPLM-N) which continues to have dire humanitarian consequences. Large areas remain inaccessible to humanitarian agencies, in particular those under the control of the SPLM-N where verification is impossible. In the government-controlled areas there are hundreds of thousands of people displaced. Many of the displaced suffered loss of most of their household goods and food stocks and live under a desperate situation depending on host community resources. Adding to the fragile humanitarian situation, more than 20,000 South Sudanese refugees, fleeing from the war in their country, reside in South Kordofan. 

The basic services and the host communities&#x2019; resources in these areas are over-stretched and the humanitarian situation is worsening for everyone. As per the State Water and Environmental Sanitation (WES) report (Feb), 48% of existing hand pumps and water yards are non-functional mainly due to overuse, lack of spare parts and skilled personnel. In some of the targeted areas, water points are nonexistent and the average water per person per day is around five liters. Many of the community members rely on unprotected water sources. Long queues were also observed at all the working water points during CARE&#x2019;s Feb 1-9, 2017 assessment mission and it takes an average of two hours to get water. In addition, some villagers have to travel close to four hours to reach these water points. As a result, women and girls, traditionally responsible for domestic chores, are forced to collect water after dark and expose themselves to harm. 

Furthermore, almost 77% of the households have no access to proper sanitation facilities and open defecation is rampant, as per the assessment conducted by CARE, State Ministry of Health (SMOH) and WES. As latrines are non-existent, lack of adequate sanitation facilities and practicing open defecation are public health hazards, carrying the risk of transmitting infectious diseases. Particularly the most vulnerable groups such as the children under the age of five, the elderly and people suffering from different diseases whose immunity is lower are affected the most. Therefore, poor hygiene and sanitation practices are major problems directly linked to the communities&#x2019; health, wellbeing, safety and dignity. 

Therefore, to alleviate the suffering of 45,000 targeted IDPs and underserved population residing in Abukarshola (30,300) and Talodi (14,700) localities, CARE aims to provide WASH services through rehabilitation of hand pumps and motorized water yards, installation of hybrid solar systems and construction of new water points. CARE will also train equally selected community members on WASH infrastructure management and introduce a cost recovery system for ongoing (OampM) to enhance community ownership and sustainability. To improve the sanitation and hygiene aspect of the communities, CARE will implement Community Approach for Total Sanitation/Community-Led Total Sanitation (CATS/CLTS), train community members (both men and women) on hygiene promotion and environmental sanitation and carry out hygiene promotion and environmental sanitation campaigns through them. Women and girls are the core of this project and their specific needs will be prioritized and addressed throughout the project period. As part of improving the communities&#x2019; wellbeing, CARE will carry out regular water quality monitoring in close coordination with WHO and SMOH. All the rehabilitated or constructed water points will be fully disinfected before they are commissioned for public use. CARE will implement these activities in partnership with national partner &quot;Sudan Sahel&quot;..  CARE is well positioned due to its long-term presence in the State and well-established relationship with other humanitarian partners, government offices and community.</narrative>
