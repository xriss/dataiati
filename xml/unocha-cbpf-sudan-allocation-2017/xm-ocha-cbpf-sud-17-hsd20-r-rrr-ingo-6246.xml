   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project is being submitted under the OPS Project Code: SUD-17/ER/111440. High malnutrition rates have remained prevalent in Sudan for decades and particularly in Central Darfur (CD) which has been exacerbated by protracted and ongoing conflict in the area. According to the State of World UNICEF report 2016, the Sudan conflict has affected more than 3 million children, with approximately 67% of the children under the age of 5 (U5) undernourished and 50% suffering from severe acute malnutrition. The influx of returnees and IDPs over the years has put pressure on the already scarce resources. Jebel Mara region has been volatile since the outbreak of conflict in 2003. Recurrent clashes have been reported almost each year, resulting in population displacements to the main towns in Central Darfur, as well as to IDP camps in North and South Darfur. According to the IOM, DTM mission report in July, 2017 830 household were displaced in the locality and most of them almost 90% were displaced during the month of May and June, 2017. A rapid need assessment was conducted recently from 27th to 29th May, 2017 by inter agency mission and government including HAC, CRS, IMC, TGH, WES, Alfaier local NGO, SRCs. The report of the assessment revealed critical humanitarian needs in the area. The IDPs are in high need of food assistance, health, nutrition, shelter, NFIs and other relief. Most of the IDPs came from the surrounding villages of Um Dukhun. Under the multi sector rapid response plan humanitarian partners will support SMoH through different interventions for health, nutrition, WASH, FSL and other sectors. CRS will target Megan and Beltebe villages in Um Dukhun Locality in Central Darfur State. The total population of the two villages is 36,700 including 17,300 returnees and 10,000 host community in Megan village and 7,640 returnees and 1,760 IDPs for Beltebe. Through the proposed project, CRS will support 60% of the targeted population in both villages targeting 22,020 beneficiaries. In Maegan, 13,650 medical consultation will be done with targeting 328 SAM children, 568 MAM children and 1,038 women will be benefited from the service. Similarly, 4,700 medical consultation will be provided in Beltebe center with targeting 113 SAM, 195 MAM children will be treated for severe and moderate acute malnutrition respectively and 357 women will be benefited by IYCF counseling services. CRS will provide support to State Ministry of Health (SMOH) in capacity strengthening to ensure better quality health amp nutrition services through medical consultations, capacity building, identification of malnourished children and provide treatment in the targeted locality. These services will be complemented by a comprehensive Infant and Young Child Feeding (IYCF) program. The IYCF Program will provide counseling for mothers and caregivers so that they adopt the best practices for health amp nutrition. CRS will link SMOH to WHO and UNICEF in getting essentials medicines including supplementary drugs and Integrated Management of Childhood Illness (IMCI) kits. CRS will coordinate and request WHO to provide essential medicines for medical consultation to SMoH which will be provided to the patients in the health facilities through CRS health care providers to treat the common illnesses. In addition, CRS will request for IMCI kit to WHO for the treatment of childhood illnesses. CRS will also coordinate with UNICEF to sign a PCA for the RUTF and essential medicines for the treatment of SAM children without medical complications. CRS also initiated a process with WFP to sign a FLA for the communities for the treatment of MAM children and PLWs. The proposed intervention will further support SMOH in delivery of these medicines to the health facilities, training of health staffs on rational prescriptions and supportive supervision of medicines and supplies including RUTFs and an integrated social behavior change communication strategy.</narrative>
