   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Health Intervention and Support for Kadugli, Rashad and Abbasia Internal Displaced People in South Kordofan State</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The vast majority of these internally displaced persons (IDPs) are women and children, who are in dire nutritional and health conditions, and they join significant numbers of refugees in these regions. Access to resources, services and adequate food is extremely low. Health and other services are highly needed. Exposure to violence including sexual and gender-based violence (SGBV) is expected as the protection sector in the state is not active enough to pick the problems and reflect it due to the sensitivity of this sub-sector. the proposal basically aims to implement a number of primary health activities (reproductive, maternal, newborn child and adolescent health (RMNCAH) activities in South Kordofan State in Kadugli and Rashad and Abbasia Localities. The activities will encompass both clinical and public health interventions designed to reduce mortality and morbidity of women, adolescents and children amongst the IDPs and host communities in targeted areas of the state. The ultimate goal of the project is to save lives and reduce morbidity amongst these populations by addressing their health needs. 
The Sudanese Red Crescent Society will use its significant technical and operational expertise in RMNCAH and health in emergencies to provide technical and managerial support to this project.
The project will provide Primary health care services through 5 clinics as the following:
In Kadugli Locality: One clinic will be reopened in East Elsama, where there is already health centre for the ministry as building and it was functioning for the last 2 years under the supervision of SRCS in collaboration with SMOH. All the IDPS in Kadugli city will benefit the health services there. Another health clinic will be in Murta settlement which has the highest number of new arrivals (2017) and major gaps in provision of humanitarian assistance as it is a newly established settlement that has no single amenity in place. The IDPs in Tillow and Kulba village will have the services from the clinic of Murta.
Also tow clinics will be in Rashad locality in Khor Elramla and Tagmala to cover the IDPs those settled in Rashad city.  The selection of the 2 location based on HAC statistics which says there are 22,342 IDPs (3,576 families ) came from 33 villages surrounding Rashad. (9794 M, 12,530 F, 4,702 U5). They settled in 3 locations Rashad (17916 Individuals), Tagmala (2,498 individuals) and Tandic (1,910 indivdulas). during the year 2017 about (401) families reached Rashad.
Also this project will reopen one primary health clinic in the city of Abbasia in Abbasia  locality to cover part of the 26,794 individuals, who came from different villages due to the armed conflict such as (Elgabal, Teri, Elmuraib, Thibot, Flagen, Tranges, Ub Baraka, Gardoud Jama, Gebelat Abu Sam, Tasie and Elfaid Abd Allah). There areas where they settled are (Abbasia the city, Elbederia, Elgarada, Elshawaya, Tabat, Tabasa, Um Algura, Gundoraya, Elfukarin and Mahala) beside IDPs there are 603 individuals from South Sudan refugees also living in Abbasia locality  
Community sensitization and awareness campaigns complementing those clinical services to promote positive RMNCAH health practices through primary and secondary prevention activities. It will also provide Long-Lasting Insecticide-Treated Mosquito Nets (LLINs) to women and children, train additional volunteers on community sensitization towards communicable diseases among the community and SGBV, and train clinical service providers on clinical management of sexual violence. Through its community outreach activities it will aim to engage in community discussions on barriers women and girls face to accessing health care. SRCS&#x2019;s strong existing capacities and volunteer base will be harnessed to provide life-saving RMNCAH services to IDPs and host communities.</narrative>
