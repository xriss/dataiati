   <description>
    <narrative xml:lang="EN">During the webinar series, the roving specialist also informed all registered participants of a funding opportunity available through IAWG&#x2019;s COVID-19 rapid response mechanism. This funding opportunity was in response to what IAWG ASRH sub-working group members had heard from young people and local organizations supporting ASRH activities&#x2014;they need financial support for operating during COVID-19. Thus, the roving specialist worked with Save the Children/Netherlands to release a call for applications via IAWG&#x2019;s website, which was open from September 2&#x2013;23. The funding would support 16-17 small grants of $2,500&#x2013;$3,000 for operational needs (eg personal protective equipment, internet cards, laptops, furniture for working remote, etc). In total, more than 700 organizations applied for the funding&#x2014;highlighting the clear need from youth-led and community-based organizations for this type of support. Save the Children and the roving specialist will screen, review, and select 16-17 organizations and provide the small grants during the next quarter.

Revised training packages&#x2014;for SRH managers, frontline workers, and non-health staff&#x2014;to align with revised ASRH toolkit. 
&#x2022;	ASRH promotional video developed and published on the IAWG website, along with additional videos with subtitles in Arabic, French, and Spanish.
&#x2022;	Translated ASRH fact sheet into Arabic, French, and Spanish.</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">The ASRH roving specialist and Save the Children/Rwanda staff developed a call for interest from youth-led organizations in Rwanda who were providing SRH services to adolescents and youth in humanitarian settings. The call for interest received more than 70 applications, which were reviewed in three rounds by the roving specialist and Save the Children/Rwanda staff to select two youth-led organizations to receive the $20,000 award. The roving specialist and Save the Children/Rwanda team organized a kick-off call to explain the purpose of the project&#x2014;for the youth-led organizations to conduct ASRH activities in a humanitarian context&#x2014;and that the project also provided capacity-building support to the organizations throughout the two-month project period. The two youth-led organizations completed a capacity assessment with the roving specialist and Save the Children/Rwanda team, discussed their action plan and proposed activities, and submitted their activities and budget before receiving the funding allocation. The youth-led organizations also submitted a separate budget for operational needs identified during the capacity assessment. From September&#x2013;November, Save the Children/Rwanda and the roving specialist will be having calls/emails with the two youth-led organizations weekly to assess progress and provide support.</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">The crisis-management workshop series was developed in consultation with young people and the IAWG ASRH sub-working group. The roving specialist worked with ASRH sub-working group members to secure 12 speakers from nine organizations&#x2014;representing UN agencies, international and local NGOs, and one youth organization&#x2014;as well as three FP2020 youth focal points to moderate the discussions. The three-part series began on September 2 and ended on September 17. The roving specialist worked closely with FP2020 and their focal points to integrate feedback from young people on the session topics into a question-and-answer format for the webinar sessions. These session guides were shared with the speakers in a preparation call prior to the session. The roving specialist also worked with Save the Children/Netherlands to secure a translation company to provide simultaneous translation into French for all three sessions. The roving specialist worked with IAWG&#x2019;s digital media staff to promote the series via IAWG listserv and social media, and provide links to the session materials following each webinar. All of the session recordings (in English &amp; French), as well as developed key-takeaway documents and a list of resources shared are provided on IAWG&#x2019;s website here. In total, more than 300 people registered for the workshop series and nearly 300 people participated and/or had viewed the session recordings as of October 28, 2020.</narrative>
