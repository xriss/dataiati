    <narrative xml:lang="EN">General question: Results related to the intended outcome 2014Question: Summarise results related to the intended outcome (this information will be sent to Open Aid)Answer: The Yemen National Dialogue and Constitutional Reform Trust Fund (YNDCRTF) was established in October 2012 to support Yemen&#x2019;s national dialogue and constitution-making processes. It was established in accordance with the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) Initiative and the Agreement on the implementation mechanism for the tranisition process in Yemen signed by both Yemeni sides on 23 November 2011, in accordance with Security Council resolutions 2014 (2011) and 2051 (2012). The YNDCRTF was established with sponsorship of the Government of Yemen and the United Nations. The objective of the Fund was to support Yemeni efforts to organise and manage a Yemeni led National Dialogue and Constitution making process that is effective, transparent, inclusive and participatory. 

The National Dialogue Process was successful and inclusive. It convenad 565 representatives from a broad range of political, economic and social groups to tackle important issues facing Yemen through dialogue. It made recommendations (NDC outcomes) to build the future state of Yemen that bring peace and development based on principles of democracy, rule of law and equal rights for all citizens. A new constitution was to be developed. 

The support to the National Dialogue Conference (NDC) was successful and mainly implied facilitation of the dialogue process as well as technical support to the conference. It also included communication and capacity buiilding. A National Conference Secretariat was established and supported. NDC was an inclusive and participatory process and included participation of marginalised groups such as women, youth and disabled. It resulted in outcomes on most issues. Therafter the situation deteriorated and resulted in political instablility and renewed conflicts and intense fighting, severely affecting the outcome of the NDC and the political transition process. 

Results: The intervention was successful in providing effective support towards realising a Yemeni led National Dialogue that was inclusive, transparent and meaningful. The constitution making process was delayed and separate support focus on this part. With regard to the National Dialogue Conference, UN provided substantial technical and facilitating support. The dialogue was divided in plenary sessions and working groups sessions and the conference was conducted with a high level of geographic, political, demographic inclusiveness. The National Dialogue was widely published throughout the country across all media. Working sessions were informed by provision of technical advisers and UN political officers. These experts provided briefings on thematic issues, facilitated informal discussions and prepared several background papers and briefing notes. Working groups conducted 274 consultations with over 13 000 people. A comprehensive communication strategy for the national dialogue period for communications and media engagement, and public outreach, education and participation. The focus was on raising awareness about the national Dialogue Conference, keeping the public informed of the progress of the Working Group Meetings and lay ground for community participation activities.</narrative>
