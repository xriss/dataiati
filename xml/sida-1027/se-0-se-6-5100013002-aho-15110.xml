    <narrative xml:lang="EN">General question: Results related to the intended outcome 2016Question: Summarise results related to the intended outcome (this information will be sent to Open Aid)Answer: The ISAP has contributed to placing the issues of capacity development on the spotlight of IGAD&amp;apos;s operations. It has gotten increasing attention from the Secretariat and the development partners as well. Particularly, the issue of capacity development was high on the agenda of IGAD in connection with the formulation of its regional strategy. The final review of the second phase of ISAP has also been completed and according to this review ISAP has registered mixed results. Even though ISAP is on its third phase, the programme has not yet consolidated to become a programme with one plan, one budget, and one report.  It has also been recognized that so much of the focus has been on activity level and the programme&amp;apos;s implementation has not been matched with meaningful changes or impacts in the core capacities of the Secretariat and the specialized offices. 

IGAD (mainly at the urging of development partners) has initiated a plan to adopt International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS). This has been a long awaited process that has been recommended in the system audits undertaken at various times. The process has been dragged due to financial constraints but also lack of commitment from the IGAD management to driving the process. During 2016 IGAD was supposed to procure a consultant to formulate the IPSAS project document; however the consultant is still not in place. In this regard, discussions were made between the Secretariat, EU and Sweden on the modalities to providing financial support to expedite the IPSAS implementation process, but there was no any progress on this. The implementation of IPSAS complemented by the other initiatives regarding procurement, HR management, and ICT development is expected to enhance core capacities of the organization.</narrative>
