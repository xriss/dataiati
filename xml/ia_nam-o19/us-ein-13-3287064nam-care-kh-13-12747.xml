   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Girls need a foundation of knowledge, skills and experiences to gain control over their lives, better articulate their needs, protect their personal assets, participate in community development decisions and shape their futures and those of their families. The Girls Lead the Way project will focus on activities driven by the girls. Girls will engage in activities that build their leadership skills, strengthen their ability to work cooperatively together, and their capacity to contribute to their community. Sports days, leadership conferences, service as peer counselors, and participation in civic action will create opportunities for girls&#x2019; to practice and strengthen the skills they have gained, and to be seen in new roles in public spaces. Girls&#x2019; groups will provide a forum for discussing issues that matter to them, and create a peer support network. CARE believes that empowerment of girls cannot be done isolation of those around them. Our experiences over the last several years have shown the need to involve boys in substantive ways in order to foster an environment in which both girls and boys can be successful.  At the schools and in the communities, the project will engage with boys though youth groups and sport. Mixed gender youth groups will provide opportunities for boys and girls to engage in activities together, fostering equitable relationships and mutual respect. In addition, boys will be engaged in discussions that explore concepts of masculinity and gender equity.  This not only results in boys becoming champions of gender equity and girls&#x2019; rights, but it also mitigates the negative backlash that can occur as a result of jealousy of  the opportunities that girls are receiving. Through complementary activities in the Child Friendly Secondary Schools project, CARE engages teachers to better understand gender stereotyping and gender sensitive pedagogy.</narrative>
