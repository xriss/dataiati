   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Adolecent Empowerment: In accordance with CARE&#x2019;s empowerment framework, potential areas of impact that the Tipping Point will explore are: Agency, Relations and Structures.  Different stakeholders&apos; engagement - including men and boys - will be one strong sub-strategy for changing power relations between adolecent girls and stakeholders at various levels. Monitoring Evaluation and Learning: The Tipping Point project has a focus on facilitating innovation and generating learning to build the evidence base for social change and &#x201C;tipping points,&#x201D; through documentation of best practices, high quality lessons, and results. The overall monitoring, evaluation and learning (MEL) framework for the project are based on the principles of Developmental Evaluation (DE), which sees evaluation not as a static end-point but as a strategic learning approach to decision-making. Action occurs throughout the life of the project, as actors and issues emerge, shift, and take unexpected turns that affect strategies and thus the results of the project. Evidence Based Advocacy: Tipping Point&#x2019;s advocacy strategy seeks to use learning and documentation from field experience to build evidence to support the actions of local, national, and global coalitions, activists, and decision-makers against child marriage. Advocacy efforts will extend beyond a focus on formal policies - such as age of marriage laws - to include efforts to influence social and cultural institutions that drive gender discrimination and contribute to child marriage.</narrative>
