   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Use village agents structure to provide clean egergy to VSL group members and other community memebers.  Village agents are trained on how to sensitize communities to adopt and use appropriate clean energy products. Village agents work as role models by taking the lead to use these products and at the same time convice women to change their cooking and lighting equipments/practices. Because Village Agents are also women from the same villages speaking the same language, understanding their challenges and having experience in changing women&apos;s behaviors, the work becomes easy. Clean energy compaigns targeting the general public: CARE joins others including government institutions and private sector stakeholder in public awareness campaigns. The messages include valorizing women&apos;s role in domestic energy production, positive branding of clean energy products and sensitization about the link between indoor air pollution and children&apos;s health and education. Learning: CARE Rwanda deliberately learns from other countries (Tanzania, Kenya) where the same project is implememented and document lessons within and outside Rwanda. The learning questions turn around what economic and environmental benefits of integrating women into claen energy value chains through monitoring quantitative data from project sponsored commercial activities?</narrative>
