  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The city and Governorate of Aleppo have faced severe hardships over the past five years as a result of the civil crisis in Syria. Once the second largest city in Syria, and its industrial hub, Aleppo has recently experienced a heavy military campaign resulting in a settlement between conflicting sides and the first possibility for several years to provide humanitarian assistance to East Aleppo, as well as a conducive environment to support the population of Aleppo to rebuild their lives and return to a sense of normalcy. However, urgent and life-saving as well as life-enabling needs exist, especially in the areas of WASH and education. Project beneficiaries will be vulnerable households living in the targeted areas, with a special focus on Syrian girls and boys. These households have been living in besieged / targeted areas for the past 4 years and most have been displaced at least once during that time.  
 
The project has two outcomes; to improve access to water, as well as education opportunities for Syrian girls and boys affected by the crisis in Aleppo. Access to sufficient water was highlighted as a key priority need by numerous stakeholders in Aleppo with water networks damaged or destroyed and water stations outside government control. The project will address this need by providing community water tanks in areas without the presence of wells and access to the main water network. In areas that have access to the network, household level water tanks will be provided to ensure a constant supply of water and existing wells rehabilitated and equipped to increase the available water. Access to education is also a key intervention area as boys and girls have been out of school for up to four years and are significantly behind on their studies. They are also facing severe psychosocial issues. The project will undertake the rehabilitation of schools either damaged by the crisis, or previously used as IDP shelters and complement activities proposed to UNOCHA in the area of psychosocial support and self-learning.</narrative>
