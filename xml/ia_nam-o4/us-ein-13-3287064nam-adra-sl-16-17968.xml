   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project is providing Community Resiliency Model (CRM) Training to community members to address trauma associated with experiences and losses from the Ebola outbreak. 

The Community Resiliency Model, or CRM, trains community members to not only help themselves but to help others within their wider social network.  The primary focus of this skills-based, stabilization program is to re-set the natural balance of the nervous system. CRM skills help individuals understand their nervous system and learn to read sensations connected to their own well-being, which CRM calls the &#x201C;Resilient Zone&#x201D;.  CRM&#x2019;s goal is to help to create &#x201C;trauma-informed&#x201D; and &#x201C;resiliency-focused&#x201D; communities that share a common understanding of the impact of trauma and chronic stress on the nervous system and how resiliency can be restored or increased using this skills-based approach. 

To assure local capacity building a train-the-trainer program in CRM skills has been selected as the appropriate intervention to address both survivor and health and community worker needs as it is designed to support resiliency and recovery from traumatic experiences and provide sustainable self-care skills. CRM training assists providers to support community members to not only help themselves but to help others in their families, friendship networks and neighborhoods. 

CRM&#x2019;s goal is to help to create &#x201C;trauma-informed&#x201D; and &#x201C;resiliency-informed&#x201D; individuals and communities that possess a common understanding of the impact of trauma and chronic stress (regardless of the originating factors) on the nervous system and how resiliency can be restored or increased by using this skills-based approach. As such, CRM facilitates resiliency through neuroscience principles rooted in the biological basis of trauma and the automatic, defensive ways that the human body responds when faced with perceived and real threats to self and others. 

The use of CRM skills alleviates the symptoms of chronic and post-traumatic stress. Grounded by recovery, resiliency, wellness, and empowerment principles, CRM skills have been identified as culturally pliable to meet the needs of diverse populations. CRM has largely been used with individuals and communities traumatized by the effects of natural or man-made disasters, and with populations marginalized by economic and ethnic challenges impacting on-going deprivation and violence. To date, CRM skills have been taught and applied world-wide in varied locations for these purposes, and specifically in Guatemala, Haiti, China, the United States, Kenya, Darfur, Uganda, the Philippines, Somalia, and the Ivory Coast following natural or man-made disasters.</narrative>
