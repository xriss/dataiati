It started at about 22.00 on the 26th of September at the 48th arsenal of the military unit A1119. There were 188 thousand tons of ammunition stored on an area of &#x200B;&#x200B;60 hectares. Among them - rockets of the system Smerch, Uragan and Grad. More than a thousand firefighters eliminated the fire on the territory of the warehouse and around it. From Kalinovka and nearby villages (Pavlivka), 30,000 people were evacuated. It was reported that explosions could be heard each 2-3 minutes. The main version of the explosions in Kalinovka was &quot;Russian diversion&quot;. The presidential adviser and the assistant to the head of the Ministry of Defense Yury Biryukov says that a drone could cause a fire in the warehouse. This is the fourth fire in warehouses with ammunition in the last two years.As consequences of the explosion from the arsenal in Kalinovka in nearby village Pavlovka almost 80% of the apartments and the school are damaged.  

Within a short amount of time, assessment was done through ADRA representatives in the site and between the local authorities and beneficiaries to observe the damages done by the explosion. In the short assessment, it was stated that out of 1500 houses 1000 houses were damaged, of these houses most damages were windows, roofs, and the interior furnishing. Though the state assistance is provided, it is insufficient and people with private housing and vulnerable categories still need the support.
