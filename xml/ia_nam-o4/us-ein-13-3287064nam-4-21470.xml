   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Nyarugusu Refugee Influx Response</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">As at 31 July 2017, Tanzania is hosting 351,400 refugees and asylum-seekers, mainly from Burundi and the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), in 3 camps in Northwest Tanzania: Nyarugusu, Nduta, and Mtendeli, as well as some urban refugees, some self-settled refugees in the Kigoma region, and cases pending naturalization in the Old Settlements.  

All three-refugee camps have reached or surpassed their capacity; for those in Nyarugusu, the congestion of the camp has had severe negative consequences on living conditions, dignity, and protection of the inhabitants. It also exacerbated tensions between the pre-influx (mainly Congolese refugees) population, and the newly arrived refugee population. There is already a backlog of 2,800 Congolese asylum-seekers remaining in mass shelters awaiting relocation to individual plots. The space remaining for individual plots is limited, and the current capacity of existing mass shelters is 3,360.  

 According to UNHCR contingency plan DRC situation Report August 2017, indicates that the continued trickle of new arrivals (3,360) per month with an average of 112 arrivals per day, it is expected that total number of new arrivals to reach 30,240 until the end of 2017, the number is likely to increase and given the constrained response capacity in Nyarugusu camp and reduced rate of resettlement departures the new arrivals will continue to be accommodated in mass shelters. This situation in both two camps Nyarugusu and Nduta camps is calling for basic needs and essentials services to ensure that new arrivals are assisted with timely, life saving settlement solution and humanitarian assistance services as initial response. Critical areas affected being WASH, SHELTER and NFI.  Shelters provided during the peak of the emergency are dilapidated, as families could not be supported with the transitional shelter due to limited resources. 

Other areas of concern is the lack of sufficient alternative renewable energy such as energy saving cooking stoves for refugee families which  continues to pose a major protection concern, as women and girls are often tasked with looking for firewood outside camp context, exposing them to SGBV risks, solar lanterns to all families, the provision of fuel efficient stoves and possibilities to use alternative cooking fuel should be enhanced.</narrative>
