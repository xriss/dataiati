   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Building Resilience of Youth and Communities against Violent Extremism and Radicalization (BRYC)</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Background:
With the pilot project Women Against Violence and Extremism (WAVE) implemented from June 2018 to June 2019, the Iraq Foundation (IF) successfully built the capacities of 56 women leaders in their local communities in ISIS-liberated areas: the provinces of Nenawa (East Mosul and Hamdaniya), Anbar (Ramadi) and Salaheddin ( Tikrit) to prevent against violent extremism and radicalization. Through coaching, PVE education, feedback meetings, and interventions, women leaders (WL) helped their communities to develop awareness of and resilience to VE. Women professionals who had participated in the leadership training are now using their knowledge and skills in their work environment, such as classrooms, medical clinics, and in the media.
The new project, implemented over a two-year period from May 1-2020 to April 30, 2022, will take into account recommendations the WAVE project and the IME report, specifically the expansion of activities to additional locations and communities and the increase of beneficiaries. Therefore, the new project will expand to 7 locations, adding Baghdad province to the three provinces in WAVE, and considerably increase the number of beneficiaries. The past success with professionals will be carried over, with specific PVE training for women and men professionals and community leaders who have public influence. There will be additional focus on engaging men as agents of change in outreach to communities and PVE interventions. Our lessons learned from the WAVE project indicate that most interventions involved vulnerable youth; therefore, in addition to addressing communities as a whole, the new project will place additional emphasis on PVE education for school-aged children and encourage critical thinking about VE issues, and it will train older youth to act as mentors. Joint PVE-themed projects between older youth and school-aged youth will aim to foster collaboration, self-awareness, and increased confidence and belonging.

Project Goal:
The overarching goal of this project is to enable youth and community-members to build resilience against violent extremism and radicalization as a prerequisite to peaceful and stable communities. The Iraq Foundation along with its three local partners are implementing the project in four Iraqi governorates: Baghdad, Al-Anbar, Salahuddin, and Ninawa</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">IF launched the project activities in June 2020. We hired a local project manager to be based in the Baghdad office, and a DC-based project officer who together launched the project&#x2019;s preparation phase along with the partner NGOs. 

Project&#x2019;s action items:
1.	IF project staff developed a project description brief in Arabic and sent it the partner NGOs. The project staff also developed a brochure in Arabic and translated other project materials to make available for distribution during community meetings and visits with local officials and other stakeholders. 

2.	On June 25th, 2020, IF project staff conducted a plenary meeting with the executive directors of the three partner NGOs: Salam Al-Rafidain (Al-Anbar), PAO Organization (Ninawa), and Al-Noor Organization (Salahuddin). We discussed with the partners the project&#x2019;s goal and objectives, scope, activities, as well as the roles and responsibilities of each of the partner NGOs in the project.

3.	IF project staff developed specific Memoranda of Understanding (MoUs) with the three partner NGOs detailing the roles and responsibilities of the NGOs and of IF as the lead organization carrying out this project. The MoUs were signed by the NGOs&#x2019; executive directors and sent back to IF on June 28th. 

4.	IF project staff developed the necessary forms to be used in the project such as work plans and timelines, participants&#x2019; attendance lists, reporting templates, and the results framework, and shared them with the partner NGOs. 

5.	IF&#x2019;s DC-based PO developed job description for a Monitoring and Evaluation (M&amp;E) Specialist, and Terms of Reference (ToR) for an external specialist. These two specialists will work together on developing the Monitoring, Evaluation, and Learning Matrix (MEAL).  

6.	During the month of July, the partner NGOs, started reaching out to their local communities to introduce the project and get community buy-in. Key local officials and community leaders were contacted by phone and internet instead of face-to-face meetings due to the COVID-19 pandemic restrictions and consequent curfews and lockdowns. The NGOs managed to carry out the preparatory phase of socialization of the project effectively under the circumstances. The meetings were successful in gaining the community support and buy-in, and the targeted stakeholders expressed strong interest in collaborating with IF and the three local partners on this initiative. 

Activities 1&amp;2 for partner NGOs:
- Salam al-Rafidian (Anbar): held its first coordination meeting in mid-July with local officials and community leaders in Falluja and Ramadi districts through a combination of a phone conversations and face-to-face meetings. The NGO also held two large community meetings on August 17th and 20th. The meetings included the Directorate of Education, Governor&#x2019;s offices, Directorate of Police, Social Police, and the NGO Affairs Office in Anbar governorate. The total number of participants was 111, 47 in Ramadi and 64 in Fallujah. 
The NGO also identified the middle and high schools in the two districts (89 schools) that it will target for the project&#x2019;s activities and secured the participation of its teachers and principals. They also identified 5 women leaders who have been trained by the pilot WAVE project to participate in this project. 
- PAO (Ninawa): held a series of introductory meetings with key local officials and stakeholders during the month of July, and two large community meetings on August 24th and 31st in Hamdaniya and East Mosul, respectively. Each meeting was attended by 50 community members (total 100). The participants showed great enthusiasm about the project and expressed their commitment to collaborate with the team on implementing activities in their local areas. Representatives from police department and other local authorities provided some ideas and proposals to address issues of domestic violence including establishing a women&#x2019;s shelter in Mosul and other services. A Christian priest and a nun from a local church attended the community meeting in Hamdaniya and spoke about the community&#x2019;s need to reject all forms of violence and extremist views; tolerance, coexistence and peaceful means to resolve conflicts. Overall, the participants expressed great enthusiasm to participate in the project activities. The PAO project staff received 35 application forms from the participants to sign up as leaders and focal points.  PAO also identified 21 middle and high schools in Hamdaniya district and 21 schools in West Mosul (total 42) that will targeted for this project. The PAO team also identified and contacted 7 women leaders who had participated in the WAVE project from both districts.  

7.  The NGO partners developed their written procedures for COVID-19 safety and prevention and made necessary arrangements to follow safety regulations during activities. Face masks, hand sanitizers and gloves were provided at all community meetings and all participants were asked to wear face masks, to wash and sanitize their hands and wear gloves.</narrative>
