   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Activity one (the launch of events in 4 locations) was completed in July 2018. Two workshops from activity two were completed in August 2018. Activity one was launched in the presence of a group of women and community leaders and state officials who are interested in the subject. The launch event has achieved the following objectives: 1) Introduce the project to the local community in terms of the reasons, objectives, and mechanisms of the project and the results that the project aspires to. 2) Raising awareness of the local community on the role of women in reducing conflict. 3) Encourage women&apos;s participation in the project and motivate the community to support the project. 4) Conduct a field study about the questionnaire distributed in the forum. 5) Develop a database of women candidates for participation and select (56) women leaders. During the month of August 2018. two activities were successfully implemented: The FIRST WORKSHOP was held on &quot;The Concept of Violence and Extremism and the Role of Women in Peacebuilding&quot;, with the participation of (56) women leaders who were informed about the concept of violence and extremism. The workshop addressed potential indicators, identification of signs of extremism, the impact of violent extremism on the family and society, ways to combat radicalism and extremism through monitoring and engagement, and promoting dialogue, tolerance and moderation through peace-building and conflict management. The SECOND WORKSHOP was held on &quot;principles and skills of stimulating ideas and effective communication&quot; with the participation of the same group of women leaders who participated in the first workshop aimed at developing the expertise of women leaders in the skills of coaching.</narrative>
