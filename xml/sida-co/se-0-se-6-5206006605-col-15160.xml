    <narrative xml:lang="EN">The program was initially planned to be implemented from July 2014 to December 2016, but it was extended until May 2018, updating the products and activities. The aim with the extension was to consolidate the results; to strengthen the territorial peace approach within the Peace Agreement signed between the government and the FARC and to provide tools for the challenges ahead for the women, peace and security agenda and women&apos;s rights.
It is important to highlight the context in which the program was implemented, which contributed to achieve the expected results, and which also meant&#xA0;new challenges and opportunities: 1) The peace negotiation process between the government of Colombia and the FARC - between 2012 and 2016, and at the same time the implementation of the Victims&apos; Law. 2) The Final Peace Agreement signed in 2016, 3) The establishment of the institutional and juditial architecture for peace bringing opportunities and challenges to position women&apos;s role and leadership within these new entities. 4) The initial implementation of the peace agreement at a slow pace and the prevailing gaps in the implementation of the gender provisions of the peace agreement.
Approximately 18,000 persons were beneficiaries of projects funded within the program -of which 69% were women. The program enabled support to 61 municipalities in 28 departments, reaching 24 public institutions and 47 of their sub/offices; 54 civil society organizations which include women&apos;s organizations, indigenous, mixed, and platforms and alliances, academic entities, among others.
Outcome 1 - Transitional Justice Processes include measures to guarantee the exercise and protection of women&#x2019;s human rights in the framework of strengthening the Rule of Law, DDR processes and Reconciliation
The program contributed to the access of women victims&apos; rights to truth, justice and reparation as a key element for peace building, through the support to the implementation of the Victim&apos;s Law, specially on issues related with their protection, land restitution, historic memory, victims&apos; participation and collective and individual reparation.
Some key results were:
1. The participative ellaboration of the &quot;National Guarantee Program for Women Leaders and Human Rights Defenders&quot; which was constructed with inputs from women&apos;s organizations and approved by the Ministry of Interior on July 2018. This program includes protection measures for women established in the Peace Agreement.
2. Strengthened women peace agendas and women&apos;s rights in the National Peace Council (Consejo Nacional de Paz).
3. Eleven collective reparation processes were supported in coordination with the Victim&apos;s Unit which benefitted five&#xA0; women&apos;s organizations, two mixed organizations (labour union and local councils), four ethnic communities. The gender perspective was mainstreamed in individual and collective reparation processes, and women&apos;s needs, experiences and perspectives were included.&#xA0;
4. A national report on sexual violence, in line with the national law on sexual violence in conflict (Law 1719) was written and disseminated by the National Center of Historic Memory with support from the program. This report contributed to strengthen the visibility and accountability for crimes of sexual violence within the conflict. The report includes issues of social tolerance towards sexual violence and the construction of feminity and masculinity during the armed conflict.
5. Support to strengthen the strategies of four governmental entities to combat impunity on violence against women within the internal armed conflict: The General Attorney&apos;s Office, the Presidental Councellor for Human Rights, the Ministry of Justice and the Ombudsman&apos;s office. The aim was to guarantee their sustainability in the short term and to contribute to a national public policy in the medium term.
Outcome 2 -&#xA0; National and local level initiatives in place that promote women&#x2019;s active citizenship and the incorporation of women&#xB4;s human rights in early recovery, conflict resolution, and peace-building processes.
The program contributed to highlight the gender perspective and the inclusion of women&apos;s rights agenda, their voice and leadership in the peace negotiation process; in peace consolidation and planning of the post-conflict, as well as to put gender equality and the prevention of gender-based violence as a condition for a sustainable peace. The program also contributed to promote economic empowerment initiatives from rural women and women victims of the armed conflict as a key component for the reconstruction of the social networks.
Some key results were:
1) Women&apos;s empowerment and participation in the peace dialogues between the government and the FARC which contributed to the recognition of women as key actors for change during the negotiations and the implementation of the peace agreement. This contributed to the inclusion of more than 100 affirmative gender provisions in final peace agreement signed in 2016.
2) Five initiatives on women&apos;s economic empowerment were developed and implemented by women victims of the armed conflict. These initiatives contributed to strengthen women&apos;s position in the value chains of coffee and quinoa and generated positive and sustainable changes in gender relations for these women, their families and communities.
3) Strategic alliances between women&apos;s organizations and the Legal Commission for the Equality of Women in Congress contributed to the development of gender responsive laws.
4) The implementation of the communication strategy &quot;De igual a igual&quot; in thirteen&#xA0;departments contributed to increase the&#xA0;visibility for women as peacebuilders and masculinities to prevent gender based violence and promote gender equality.
5) Initiatives to promote non violent masculinities were in place and strengthened for the prevention of gender-based violence. This included initiatives of cultural transformation of gender stereotypes. This was done in alliance with a project within the UN MultiPartner Trust Fund (UNMPTF), in the departments of Natino, Putumayo, Choc&#xF3; and Norte de Santander.</narrative>
