   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The high-level objective of the Peace Corridors contribution with UNDP is to address the challenges related to sustainable Human Development and peace building in Colombia. To achieve this, the intervention has taken into consideration two complementary approaches: a national approach and a territorial approach.

At the National level the intervention will: 
&#x2022; Support UNDP&#x2019;s Human Development Index Report for Colombia as a guiding tool to cope with the main development difficulties in the country and promote inclusive and sustainable economic growth by improving the capacities of public institutions, the private sector and Colombian civil society organizations. 
&#x2022; Support one of the axes of the Peace Agreement by strengthening the capacities of the Reincorporation Instances and the delegates (FARC) that accelerate the implementation of economic and social reintegration through inter-institutional coordination.

At the territorial level -which concentrates most of the intervention- the contribution will foster Territorial Systemic Transformation through a comprehensive approach of peacebuilding in three regions. This approach will be focused on legal, socio-economic, political, and environmentally sustainable inclusion of the communities that have been affected by conflict. The objectives at the territorial level are: 
&#x2022; To increase territorial governance, transform socio-environmental conflicts and inequities, and generate social inclusion and sustainable productive alternatives;
&#x2022; Strengthen farmer capacities towards resilience, productivity and inclusion for sustainable development that allow them to overcome situations generated by the post-agreement; and, 
&#x2022; Improve the quality of life and develop collaborative relationships of Afro-Colombian, indigenous and farmer communities (especially women and young people) to transform conflicts by accessing formal and proper local justice systems, in a democratic, trustworthy environment and with institutions capable of offering social goods and services.</narrative>
