    <narrative xml:lang="EN">The main objective of this project is to promote the active role of businesses in helping to build a sustainable peace process in Colombia through four outputs or successive steps. First, &#x201C;get to know&#x201D; by identifying a baseline of initiatives and interests of the business sector at a national level and with prioritized regions (Development Programs with a Territorial Approach &#x2013; PDET regions). Secondly, by producing technical inputs and practical tools to encourage the role of the business sector in peace building (acknowledge and adapt). Thirdly, by developing the regional peace building agenda (&#x201C;from words to action&#x201D;). Finally, by including the private sector in the implementation of the public peace agenda, by documenting and replicating experiences (&#x201C;learn and replicate&#x201D;).
&#xA0;
During the third year of implementation, as part of the first output, FIP developed two new territorial analyses of Antioquia and Cordoba with a special emphasis on the PDET sub/regions. In addition to presenting the main economic activities and the security context, FIP identified public/private partnerships and corporate social responsibility initiatives that could be useful to work with.
&#xA0;
FIP also worked with another foundation called COMPAZ to analyze and visibilize positive examples of local entrepreneurs that contribute to peacebuilding, thereby helping to raise awareness among other private sector actors of key success factors and challenges. From a database of 91 initiatives, they selected the four most successful in terms of formalization, capacity to create alliances and economic performance.&#xA0; These initiatives include populations that were affected by conflict and are located in the PDET sub regions. the four documented cases are Mesa Nacional del Caf&#xE9;; Impulse Travel; Confecciones la Monta&#xF1;a; and Selva Nevada.
&#xA0;
The case studies were presented on November the 17th, 2020 in a virtual seminar, with the Embassy&#x2019;s participation and the video had already been viewed 21,000 times by February 2021. In addition, these case studies were included in a document that was published on February the 8th, 2021 and in a podcast launched on February the 10th, 2021, and include all lessons learned and good practices that could be replicated by other entrepreneurs.
&#xA0;
As part of the second step (Acknowledge and Adapt) the microsite on FIP&#x2019;s web page, has been an important platform to publish relevant inputs for the business sector.&#xA0; This site was updated in 2019 and during 2020 it had 46,085 visits, which represents a significant increase from the initial 7,000 visits in 2017.&#xA0; Due to the COVID 19 pandemic and the consequent negative economic effects, FIP published the following related documents: &#x201C;business activities during COVID 19 pandemic&#x201D;; &#x201C;MSME: how to survive and reactivation during COVID 19 pandemic&#x201D;.&#xA0; In addition, the two following infographics were also published virtually: &#x201C;how the tool Investing in Public Works as an alternative to paying taxes has progressed&#x201D; and &#x201C;how is private social investment doing in Colombia&#x201D;.&#xA0; In 2020 the microsite hosted another 49 relevant articles about the private sector and the challenges and opportunities for human rights, gender issues and how to cope with the impact of the pandemic.
The Micro, Small and Medium Sized Enterprises (MSME) face many challenges, in terms of competitiveness and access to financial services and these challenges have greatly increased after the introduction of various lockdown measures due to the pandemic. &#xA0;As a result, the business network that was created in 2018 with 120 companies in Cesar, North of Cauca and Bolivar was weakened. In Cesar, only 25 of the 38 participants are still in contact and the companies in the tourism sector were the worst affected. In Valle-North of Cauca only 17 of the 37 participants could be contacted in 2020 and there is a huge difference &#xA0;between the relatively low impact on large companies compared with the much greater impact on SMEs that have had to reduce staff, close offices or temporarily shut down their operations. Finally, in Bolivar (Montes de Mar&#xED;a), only 20 of the 45 participants could be contacted. As in the other regions, the most affected are the MSMEs. &#xA0;In order to keep in contact with these companies, FIP developed a webinar for sharing MSME experiences in coping with the impact of the pandemic and FIP also sent out information on how to gain access to public incentives. One of the documents mentioned above is also part of this strategy to support regional MSMEs. &#xA0;
As part of the third output &#x201C;from words to action&#x201D;, FIP took the opportunity to update the &#x201C;EmPaz tool&#x201D; to make it more useful for MSMEs.&#xA0; This tool evaluates the commitment by businesses to the peace building process through the following 6 criteria: human capital; socio-economic inclusion; strategic management for peace; participation and incidence in public policies; reconciliation and environmental sustainability.&#xA0; As happened in 2019, FIP hopes to use this tool as a diagnostic tool to identify improvement opportunities and to create tailor-made action plans for participating companies in 2021.
&#xA0;
The regional work, which formed part of this third output, was suspended in 2020 due to the Covid 19 pandemic.&#xA0; FIP only had contact with 7 of the 15 companies that had applied the EmPaz tool in 2019. Only one, &#x201C;HG Engineering and Building&#x201D;, is continuing to implement the improvement action plan with local stakeholders. The other six had serious problems due to the lockdown measures and therefore decided to stop the implementation of the action plan agreed with FIP. &#xA0;&#xA0;Two hotels in Valledupar-Cesar that had started reconciliation processes, stopped their activities. This was the same with Crescencia. The other three companies (Fundacion Unico, Crepes &amp;amp; Waffles and Fenalco Bolivar) continue operating but adjusted their priorities to be able to cope with the impact of the pandemic.
&#xA0;
The Embassy&#x2019;s assessment is that the commitment of new enterprises to peace building activities relies on having their business profitability guaranteed.&#xA0; Different from social entrepreneurs that are created by victims or former combatants involved in the reintegration process, such as the ones mentioned above. A new risk about &#x201C;inadequate ownership and failure to sustain results due to Covid 19 pandemic&#x201D; was included in the risk matrix. Nevertheless, the lessons learned during this process in Cesar are still relevant and useful to continuing with the regional work planned for 2021.
&#xA0;
Finally, the inclusion of the private sector in the public peace agenda (&#x201D;learn and replicate&#x201D;) was developed through technical documents rather than through direct dialogue with the Counsellor for Stabilization, Emilio Archila and the Territorial Renewal Agency (ART), as permanent staff changes have made it difficult&#xA0; to discuss issues such as recommendations and lessons learned. A new risk has now been included.&#xA0; The two technical documents that were published in 2019: &#x201C;Investing in public works as an alternative to paying taxes&#x201D; and &#x201C;how to attract private investment to PDET regions&#x201D; were updated in 2020. The new versions are: &#x201C;how the tool Investing in public works as an alternative to paying taxes has progressed&#x201D; and &#x201C;how is private social investment in Colombia&#x201D;. A new document called &#x201C;business and peace building: opportunities of the public policy peace with legality&#x201D; was published in February 2021 with analysis of the public policies and recommendations. &#xA0;An alliance between FIP, the Externado de Colombia University and the University of Essex was set up in 2020 to develop research and analysis on socio economic inclusion and trust between ex-combatants and the business sector.</narrative>
