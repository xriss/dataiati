   <narrative xml:lang="EN">UNDP has developed a new strategy for peace building in Colombia. The idea is that the various efforts for peace building should be integrated to achieve economies of scale and improve coordination. The program will be implemented at national, regional and local level in selected areas of the country where UNDP has or will establish local offices. The funding will be managed through a Basket Fund, in which various donors can channel their contributions to the whole or parts of the program. Sweden is expected to become the main donor to the Program, other donors are expected to include, among others, Norway, BCPR and the Colombian government.</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">In general terms, the Alianzas Program supported nearly 60 national and local initiatives that involved the participation of 13 agencies of the United Nations System, 254 civil society organizations and 46 local and national institutions; it involved 95,000 men and women in the construction of peace building spaces and directly benefited 10,500 people through development initiatives.In terms of territorial presence, the Program developed actions in 13 departments (Antioquia, Nari&#xF1;o, Cauca, Putumayo, C&#xF3;rdoba, Caquet&#xE1;, Huila, Norte de Santander, Arauca, Meta Guaviare, Tolima, Choc&#xF3;) and 219 municipalities.&#xA0;
As per outcomes, the program&apos;s results were:&#xA0;
Support to the Peace Process&#xA0;
Peace pedagogy:&#xA0;Approximately 82,000 people participated in local and national spaces for the discussion of the advances in&#xA0; and challenges related to the enlistment and implementation of peace agreements between the National Government and the FARC-EP.
Local peace building agendas: hand in hand with local institutions, the program supported the implementation and strengthening of four local peace agendas (Antioquia, Nari&#xF1;o, Meta and Montes de Mar&#xED;a), which includes the priorities of the territory on&#xA0; peace building, enlistment and implementation of the agreements.
Reforms to the electoral system:&#xA0;The program initiated a reflection to modernize and strengthen the public corporations, the electoral system and the political parties for the post-agreement. As a result, political actors have seven technical documents for the debate on reforms to the political-electoral system. In addition, it supported the development of five legislative initiatives for the post-conflict adopted in the work plan of the Ministry of the Interior.
Local Sustainable Development&#xA0;
Local economic development in conflict-affected areas: the program strengthened 11 local economic development agencies for addressing the social, economic and development complexities in Colombia with a view to building and consolidating a stable and lasting peace.
Life plans of peasant and ethnic groups: the program accompanied processes of indigenous and peasant movements such as the National Agenda for Peace - Regional Peace Summits promoted by the ONIC, it strengthened the life plans of the&#xA0; Bari people in North of Santander and the Departmental Indigenous Council of Caquet&#xE1; - CODIC. Also within the framework of the commitments between the National Government and the Ethnic and Popular Agrarian Summit, it benefited 950,000 families through the strengthening of indigenous, Afro and peasant organizations
Early recovery of livelihoods:&#xA0;6,795 people benefited from livelihood recovery initiatives. The initiatives applied approaches for the conservation of biodiversity and ecosystem services and models of sustainable production. Among beneficiaries were&#xA0; victims of mines and unexploded artifacts, displaced population and ex-combatants in reintegration process.
Rule of Law&#xA0;
Legislative initiatives: the program built guidelines for five&#xA0; legislative initiatives for the post-conflict that were adopted in the work plan of the Ministry of the Interior: 1) system of progressive acquisition of rights and political movements; 2) reform to electoral campaign financing; 3) opposition statute; 4) reform of the electoral system and 5) reform of electoral institutions.Youth: Support was given to the creation of the accidental commission of Youth in the House of Representatives to promote the public youth agenda. Technical support was provided to the Congress for the preparation of a bill that creates the legal youth commission in Congress.Women and politics: As an integral part of the results in the promotion of democratic governance for peace and within the framework of the agreement established with UN Women, the program advanced in the departments of Nari&#xF1;o, Meta, Cauca and Antioquia and the Municipality of San Jos&#xE9; del Guaviare, in actions aimed at strengthening institutional gender mechanisms and their capacity to respond to the challenges of peace building, the promotion and protection of women&apos;s human rights and democratic governance with a gender approach. In this regard, the departments of Cauca, Meta and Nari&#xF1;o drafted balance sheets for the implementation of their public policies on gender equality.
Human Rights: through a process of technical and political advocacy, it was possible to incorporate article 123 within the 2014-2018 National Development Plan. This article introduces the HRBA and the National Human rights Strategy as fundamental elements for the construction of local peace building and the formulation of local development plans.&#xA0;
Peace Culture
Along with the Office of the Resident Coordinator of the United Nations in Colombia, OHCHR, UNICEF, UN Women, FENALPER, Colombia&apos;s Ministry of the Interior, the Secretariat of Education of Bogot&#xE1; and the National Planning Department, the program prioritized the realization of education and communication for peace initiatives, non-violent transformation of conflicts and prevention of gender-based violence. Some of the results were:&#xA0;
Education for peace:&#xA0;the Educational Alliance for the Construction of Cultures of Peace was promoted and reactivated with the participation of nearly 16 national and international entities. In addition, an inter-agency UNDP-UNICEF-UNFPA agreement was signed to support the development of the &quot;Curriculum for Peace&quot;. The curriculum focuses on citizen competencies, which is divided into: Coexistence and Peace (interaction between students, reconciliation and forgiveness); 2. Democratic Participation (history of conflict, participatory issues) and 3. Diversity and Plurality (GBV, discrimination).
Communications:&#xA0;The program was actively linked to the &quot;Colombia Respira Paz&quot; initiative of the UN in Colombia. In just over a year of campaigning (which began in 2014) more than 200 activities took place with the support of local governments, civil society organizations, schools, universities, and the United Nations System in Colombia. The Alianzas program through its local alliances strengthened the development of the initiative in the departments of Norte de Santander, Choc&#xF3;, Nari&#xF1;o, Tolima, Antioquia, C&#xF3;rdoba, Cauca, and Meta. During 2015, the campaign the initiatives&#xA0; &quot;Nari&#xF1;o Respira paz&quot;, &quot;Cauca Respira Paz&quot; and &quot;The Caribbean Respira Paz&quot;, were launched and promoted by local actors.&#xA0;An external evaluation to this strategy determined that a key element for the success of campaigns at the regional level was the existence of an institutional architecture built and consolidated over ten years of sustained work (first with the Program REDES and Alianzas).&#xA0;
Non-violent transformation of conflicts:&#xA0;As a result of the characterization of socio-environmental conflicts in the Department of C&#xF3;rdoba, the Alianzas program focused its work on strengthening the governance of the Zen&#xFA; indigenous peoples of Alto San Jorge and supporting prior consultation processes. The work is part of the agreements for the resolution of conflicts that since 2013 have been brewing between the Zen&#xFA; indigenous community and the Cerro Matoso Minera Colombiana (due&#xA0; to the socio-environmental impacts derived from the operation of the iron-nickel mine on the community). As a result of the process, the indigenous community has achieved a more robust organizational structure, the restructuring of the Statutory Norms of the Indigenous Resguardo, as well as the reorganization of the Indigenous government structure (Cabildo Mayor) and the Local Councils. Today they have political and technical strategies to develop their indigenous government activities and there is a better dialogue between the Zen&#xFA;es and the Government.

NOTE:&#xA0;The final report does not include the third year of implementation (July 2016- June 2017), since within the context of the peace process between Colombia&apos;s National Government and the FARC-EP, substantial changes arose in the financial architecture for peace and in the Government&apos;s plans for the preparation and execution of peace agreements.The Government of Colombia and the United Nations launched on February 17, 2016 a trust fund (MPTF - Multi Partner Trust Fund) to respond to the needs of stabilization and consolidation of peace. In this context, the Alianzas Program went through a process of transition and alignment with the Government&apos;s new priorities and the international community (such as Sweden, Norway, Canada, United Kingdom) committed to channeling its financial resources for the prevention and transformation of conflicts through the MPTF, which included the resources allocated for the third year of Programme&apos;s implementation.</narrative>
