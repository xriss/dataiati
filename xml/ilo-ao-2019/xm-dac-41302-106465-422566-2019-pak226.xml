  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project proposal contributes to supporting the oversight and delivery process including strengthening capacities of national institutions in close collaboration with social partners in delivering compensation benefits to victims of work injury who have not received employment injury protection coverage in view of lack of compliance to cover them, guided by the principles of ILO Convention 121 on employment injury benefits and taking due account of existing national legislation. This includes the case of the additional benefit compensation arrangements related to the Ali Enterprises fire victims and their dependants. The project supports as its prime objective the oversight and delivery process of the additional employment injury benefits to the victims of the Ali Enterprises fire that happened in Baldia, Karachi on 11 September 2012. Through this process, the project also contributes to strengthen the capacities of provincial and national institutions in close collaboration with social partners in delivering compensation benefits to victims of work injuries, including to those without proper employment injury protection coverage due to lack of compliance to cover them, guided by the principles of the ILO Convention on Employment Injury Benefits, 1963 (No 121) and taking due account of existing national legislation and practices. The second objective, of a lesser scope in relation to the above primary objective, concerns the general reinforcement of national and provincial capacities, in particular in Sindh province, to deliver in an effective and transparent manner adequate and timely compensation to persons who have suffered work injuries. ILO having a long-established collaboration with Pakistan, namely since the establishing of the Social Security Scheme launched in 1967, under West Pakistan Employees&apos; Social Security Ordinance No. X of 1965, and intensive activities on social dialogue, guided by ILS, it is a primary actor for supporting the present project. More specifically, the project aims to: (1) organize the oversight and delivery mechanism provision of compensation cash benefits, health and allied care and rehabilitation, namely through SESSI, to work injury victims of the Ali Enterprises Fire victims, guided by ILO recommendations drawing upon Sindh legislation and the Employment Injury Benefits Convention 1963 (No. 121) [C.121]; and (2) reinforce national and provincial capacities, in particular in Sindh province, towards the longer term objective of the effective coverage, compliance, delivery and sustainability of employment injury insurance and protection to all workers in Pakistan.</narrative>
