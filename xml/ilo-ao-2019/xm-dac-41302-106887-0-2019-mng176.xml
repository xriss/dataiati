   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project aims at facilitating the transition to the formal economy in line with the Transition from the Informal to the Formal Economy Recommendation, 2015 (No. 204). It supports the Government of Mongolia in responding to the 2018 direct request of the ILO&#x2019;s Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations in respect of the Employment Policy Convention, 1952 (No. 122). The project also promotes the strengthening of the normative framework to ensure compliance with national laws and regulations by supporting progress towards the ratification of the Labour Inspection Convention, 1947 (No. 81) and the Labour Inspection (Agriculture) Convention, 1969 (No.129). The interventions include the areas of business environment, skills development, occupational safety and health, access to social services and social protection, gender equality, labour law enforcement, promotion of quality employment for young people, and democratic participation in public policy debates. ILO Mongolian constituents, with the support of the Office and in cooperation with other UN entities and development partners, establish frameworks for jointly analyzing, monitoring and learning from transformational changes to facilitate the effective and sustainable transition to the formal economy. The ILO delivers the following outputs: (i) knowledge-based strategy to promote the sustainable transition to the formal economy, (ii) increased capacity of employers&#x2019; and workers&#x2019; organizations to design and implement outreach services; (iii) increased efficiency of labour and workplace inspection; and (iv) increased visibility and participation of the social partners in policy development. This project contributes to the country&#x2019;s efforts to advance towards the attainment of SDG targets 8.3 (Promote development-oriented policies that support productive activities, decent job creation, entrepreneurship, creativity and innovation, and encourage the formalization and growth of micro-, small- and medium-sized enterprises, including through access to financial services), 8.5 (By 2030, achieve full and productive employment and decent work for all women and men, including for young people and persons with disabilities, and equal pay for work of equal value) and 16.3 (Promote the rule of law at the national and international levels and ensure equal access to justice for all).</narrative>
