   <narrative xml:lang="EN">EU-ILO collaboration in the monitoring of labour aspects in the implementation of the EU&#x2019;s rules of origin initiative for Jordan &#x2013; Phase II (COMPONENT - Syrian)</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">On July 19, 2016, Jordan and the European Union signed a trade agreement that simplified the rules of origin (RoO) requirements stated in the existing EU-Jordan Association Agreement. The 10-year simplified RoO initiative for Jordan was a component of the EU&#x2019;s broader response to the ongoing Syria crisis and support to Jordan. The trade agreement expected to facilitate Jordanian companies&#x2019; access to the EU market, thereby diversifying exports, boosting investment and generating decent work opportunities for Jordanians and Syrians. In response to the provisions set forward under the simplified RoO and in support of the objectives of the Jordan Compact, the Ministry of Labour (MoL), the EU and the ILO signed a collaboration agreement to implement the scheme and ensure decent working conditions in the appropriate production facilities. The first phase provided an overall framework for the ILO to support, monitor and provide technical assistance to Jordan in context to the simplified RoO and its response for the Syria crisis. The current project constitutes a second phase to this collaboration. During Phase I, the ILO partnered with national stakeholders and the private sector to strengthen capacity and facilitate decent job creation for Jordanians and Syrians. Actions were taken to build communication networks between job seekers and private sector companies through employment services. The action also built on the existing cooperation between the ILO and the MoL and supported Better Work Jordan&#x2019;s expansion to non-garment sectors. In Phase II, the ILO is scaling up work done in Phase I, with a view to advance opportunities under the ROO agreement. Five Employment Centres across Jordan are continuously operated and facilitate more efficient job matching through introduction of the E-Counselling platform. Opportunities for Jordanian companies qualifying for export under the ROO are facilitated. Better Work Jordan, in collaboration with the MoL, monitors the RoO authorised enterprises using the assessment tools customised during the first phase. In addition, phase II builds on other ongoing initiatives, such as the annual Buyers&#x2019; Forum, to raise awareness and enhance communication with buyers and investors.</narrative>
