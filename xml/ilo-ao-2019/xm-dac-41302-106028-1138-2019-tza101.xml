   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The majority of poor and vulnerable people in Zambia, Malawi and Mozambique as well as Tanzania and several other sub-Saharan countries produce agricultural goods for household consumption and to sell on the markets. However, making a decent living from this production of agricultural goods can be difficult, if not impossible. Off-farm employment and social protection therefore have critical roles to play in providing adequate income to the poor and vulnerable. In these countries the majority of the population in rural and peri-urban areas still have no/little access to potable water, basic sanitation and health services, schools as well as communication and transport. As a result they suffer from social and economic exclusion. Women, youth, landless, children, and people with disabilities are the most affected and comprise a large portion of the poor in the three countries. The ILO estimates that globally 73 per cent of the world&#x2019;s population is lacking adequate social protection. In Malawi, 51 per cent of the population lives below the national poverty line and 73 per cent below the international poverty line of US$1.25 per day. In Mozambique and Zambia, similarly, 50 and 60 per cent of the population lives below the poverty line respectively. Over 70 per cent of the population is excluded from adequate social protection in these countries. By providing poorer households with an income, social protection instruments and basic access for physical infrastructure, including access to markets, will enable people to obtain better prices and incomes and increase their productive investments notably in health and education. In addition, the ILO, over the last four decades, advocated for employment intensive investment approaches in job-rich sectors and has developed technical and managerial tools for effective adaption and rollout of these approaches including Employment Impact Assessment (EmpIA) tool, Integrated Rural Accessibility Planning (IRAP), Technical and Managerial guidelines (for programme managers, supervisory staff and local enterprises), Productivity norms for labour-based construction, Trainer&apos;s toolbox of training techniques, Rapid assessment of poverty impacts (RAPI) as well as the biggest depository/database for Innovative EI technology and works method. This programme will directly benefit poor and vulnerable communities in Zambia, Malawi, Mozambique, Tanzania and Viet Nam.</narrative>
