  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Despite decades of consistently high growth (around 7% per annum), the Mozambican economy continues to suffer from high levels of poverty and unemployment, particularly in rural areas and for women and youth. To combat this, the Government of Mozambique (GoMZ) is in the process of launching a new National Employment Policy (NEP), which is firmly embedded in the National Development Strategy (2015-35) and aims at creating more and better jobs. This proposal presents a prospective project that is anchored in the goals of the NEP and is designed to support and contribute to the NEP&#x2019;s implementation. The project thus is titled &#x201C;Decent Work for Sustainable and Inclusive Economic Transformation in Mozambique&#x201D;. Using a project strategy with a market systems development approach as the unifying framework, it will address the employment crisis through two immediate objectives, which target the national and local levels, respectively. The national institutional component mainly focusses on aligning the incentives and capacities of key labour market institutions to ensure they play a constructive role in decent job creation, and in doing so enabling Mozambican constituents to design and implement employment-intensive and sustainable policy and programme solutions, to improve social dialogue, and to generate better labour market information. The local implementation component is designed to create and improve employment outcomes in both urban and rural areas, by focussing on three main elements: - Implementation of employment-intensive market infrastructure investments; - Stimulating Green Jobs through SME development - Creating opportunities and reducing constraints to access productive employment for women and female-headed households. To concretely identify the market system bottlenecks and design adequate intervention mechanisms, the project will commence with an inception phase, during which a range of analytical tools (incl. participatory sector selection, market systems analysis, and gender analysis) will be used to allow an evidence-based decision making process. Combining these various elements through a market systems approach will allow the project to reach its overarching development objective: &#x201C;To contribute to the creation of decent work for Mozambican women and men, in particular youth and those living in rural areas, in line with the national employment policy&#x201D;.</narrative>
