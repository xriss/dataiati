   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This RBSA-funded intervention contributes to the second priority of the Palestinian Decent Work Programme for 2018-2022, which seeks to strengthen labour governance and realize fundamental principles and rights at work through improved social dialogue mechanisms. The initiative aims to improve workplace compliance so as to better protect labour rights and promote safe and secure working environments for all workers in line with national laws and regulations and international labour standards, through strengthened labour inspection and increased preventative OSH culture. It also contributes to enhancing the effectiveness of the relevant complaints management system. The intervention provides technical assistance to ILO tripartite constituents to enhance their institutional capacity and help them effectively engage in strategies aimed at improving compliance with national labour legislation and relevant international labour standards through effective social dialogue. It strengthens capacities of labour inspectors and reinforces the institutional mechanisms and capacities of the labour inspectorate in order to improve the effectiveness of labour inspection services. Capacities of labour inspectors on modern labour inspection procedures and good practices are being built, including through tailored courses and programmes for workers&#x2019; and employers&#x2019; representatives. These interventions seek to raise awareness of the role of labour inspection, occupational safety and health and relevant national and international labour standards, and promote management &#x2013; union cooperation and dialogue at worksite level. The project contributes to the territory&#x2019;s efforts to advance towards the attainment of SDG target 8.8 (Protect labour rights and promote safe and secure working environments for all workers, including migrant workers, in particular women migrants, and those in precarious employment) target 3.9 (By 2030, substantially reduce the number of deaths and illnesses from hazardous chemicals and air, water and soil pollution and contamination), target 16.6 (Develop effective, accountable and transparent institutions at all levels), and target 16.7 (Ensure responsive, inclusive, participatory and representative decision-making at all levels).</narrative>
