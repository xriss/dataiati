   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This RBSA-funded intervention aims at realising more and better decent employment outcomes for youth &#x2013; a priority of the ILO&#x2019;s tripartite constituents aligned to the 7th National Development Plan. The strategy focuses on strengthening skills to improve the employability of youth and to increase competencies in enterprise development, as well as to facilitate access to finance and markets. Interventions are implemented in the formal, informal and rural economies of job-rich sectors in Lusaka, Copperbelt and North-Western Provinces, with a human rights-based approach, promoting gender equality and non-discrimination and including persons with disabilities. To ensure that skills are appropriate to the relevant industries, the strategy promotes private sector participation in work-based learning, including internships, apprenticeships, industrial attachments and learnerships. The intervention also includes the review of labour laws to ensure alignment to international labour standards, the provision of advice on employment and active labour market policies, the promotion of employment intensive investment programmes and the development of the institutional capacity of the Government and the social partners in these areas. The project contributes to the attainment of several SDG targets, focusing on SDG target 4.4 (By 2030, substantially increase the number of youth and adults who have relevant skills, including technical and vocational skills, for employment, decent jobs and entrepreneurship); SDG target 8.2 (Achieve higher levels of economic productivity through diversification, technological upgrading and innovation, including through a focus on high-value added and labour-intensive sectors) and SDG target 8.5 (By 2030, achieve full and productive employment and decent work for all women and men, including for young people and persons with disabilities, and equal pay for work of equal value).</narrative>
