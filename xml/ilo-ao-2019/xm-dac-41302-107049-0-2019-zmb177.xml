   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This RBSA-funded intervention fits within the follow-up on the decision made by the ILO&#x2019;s Governing Body at its 334th session concerning an integrated strategy for 2019-22 to address decent work deficits in the tobacco sector. It has been developed based on both the outcome of country-level consultations and the comments of the ILO&#x2019;s Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations. The initiative addresses decent work deficits and challenges in the tobacco sector in Zambia with the view to developing good practices with great potential to be replicated and scaled up in other countries of East Africa and beyond. The envisaged work supports appropriate regulations and monitoring systems for decent work in the tobacco sector, with a focus on occupational safety and health and on the elimination of child labour and forced labour. It also contributes to strengthening the capacity of employers&#x2019; and workers&#x2019; organizations, small-holder farmers and workers themselves to address relevant decent work deficits through social dialogue. Furthermore, assistance to tobacco-growing communities is provided in order to identify and transition to alternative livelihoods. Synergies with key partners such as FAO and WHO help leverage the impact of the ILO&#x2019;s work. Overall, this initiative seeks to strengthen the virtuous cycle between the ILO&#x2019;s normative function and technical assistance to member States. It contributes to the country&#x2019; efforts to make progress in the implementation of the 2030 Agenda, in particular by advancing towards the attainment of SDG targets 8.7 (Take immediate and effective measures to eradicate forced labour, end modern slavery and human trafficking and secure the prohibition and elimination of the worst forms of child labour, including recruitment and use of child soldiers, and by 2025 end child labour in all its forms); and 2.3 (By 2030 double the agricultural productivity and the incomes of small-scale food producers, particularly women, indigenous peoples, family farmers, pastoralists and fishers, including through secure and equal access to land, other productive resources and inputs, knowledge, financial services, markets and opportunities for value addition and non-farm employment).</narrative>
