   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Applying the G20 Training Strategy</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In November 2012, the International Labour Organization (ILO) and the Government of the Russian Federation signed an agreement to implement a three-year programme of technical cooperation entitled Applying the G20 Training Strategy. This programme was designed to develop global tools, facilitate global knowledge-sharing and strengthen skills development systems through direct interventions in five countries: Armenia, Jordan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Viet Nam. That programme was scheduled to close by the end of November 2015 but it was extended until May 2016. The first phase of the project was a response to interest indicated by the Russian Federation to work with the ILO in supporting the application of the G20 Training Strategy to the skills development and employment needs in a range of countries, as committed in the Seoul Multi-Year Development Action Plan. The initiative was in line with Russian&apos;s Development Cooperation Strategy, focusing on the development of national vocational training programmes that meet labour market demand and on developing and implementing training programmes for managers of Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET) systems. The second and current phase of the project continues to target the countries that have benefitted from technical and financial support in the first phase, plus 5 regions in the Russian Federation, to provide more focused assistance to regional TVET institutions to better respond to core regional industries&#x2019; demand, improve employability, and increase employment and industry development. In all beneficiary countries, skills development has been identified as a priority in their Decent Work Country Programmes. Technical interventions in these countries are supported by respective ILO field offices in close collaboration with the ILO Skills and Employability Branch.</narrative>
