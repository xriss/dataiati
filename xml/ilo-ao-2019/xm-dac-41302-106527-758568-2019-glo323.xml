   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The G7 recognizes that women are key drivers of innovation, growth and jobs, and that the private sector plays a vital role in creating an environment in which women can more meaningfully participate in the economy. The group has set concrete targets, such as reducing the gender gap in labour force participation rates by 25% by 2025, and to increase spending on Technical Education and Vocational Training (TVET) by a third by 2030. The G7 countries have committed to: (1) invest in women&#x2019;s skills development and TVET; (2) facilitate women&apos;s labour force participation, career advancement, and work life balance; (3) stimulate women&#x2019;s entrepreneurship and the growth and sustainability of women-owned businesses; and (4) accelerate the adoption and implementation of the UN Women&#x2019;s Empowerment Principles (WEPs). In alignment with these priorities, the overall objective of this project is to support sustainable, inclusive and equitable economic growth by promoting women&#x2019;s economic empowerment in public and private sector in G7 countries. The specific objectives are to: (1) Facilitate dialogue and exchanges among G7 countries&#x2019; public and private sector; and (2) Further engage with the private sector in the elimination of gender inequality faced by women in the world of work. The strength of this project lays in the fact that many multinational corporations have their headquarters in G7 countries. Creating impact and results for women&#x2019;s economic empowerment in the world of work at the highest level of corporation could have important trickle down effects to their operations across the world.</narrative>
