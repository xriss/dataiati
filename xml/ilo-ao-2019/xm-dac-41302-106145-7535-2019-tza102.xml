   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Strategic direction and common threads: -This is an area-based cross-sectoral UN joint programme to improve human security in Northwestern Tanzania (Kigoma, Katavi, Tabora regions) -It is adressing the root causes of migration through targeting its root causes of poverty and human insecurity in all its dimensions. -A holistic approach is applied to include both new and old refugees and migrants in the region as well as surrounding host communities. -The humanitarian-development nexus is supported by linking together our existing response to refugees and migrants with an expanded development support to the host communities. -Expanding and increasing the support to host communities will help to decrease tensions and misunderstandings between the refugee/migrant population and the host population. -Through supporting stability and prosperity in the Northwestern Tanzania region it will also assist to support stability in the Great Lakes region context. -The Joint Programme is thematically placed in the Thematic Results Group (TRG) on Resilience for the above reasons but cuts across all four TRGs in the UNDAP II. Thematic and geographic focus: Area-based programming focuses on the challenges of specific geographical areas where the degree of vulnerability and disadvantage distinguishes those areas from the rest of the country. The reasons for selecting Kigoma, Katavi and Tabora is that they are one of the poorest and most isolated regions combined with being in a regional high risk area leading to high numbers of refugees and migrants as well. Finally, the UN already has a large presence in Kigoma to be built upon and benefit from, due to the current refugee response. Local consultations with Regional and District Government levels have taken place on needs and priorities, combined with analysis of available statistics as well as analysis on how the UN best can respond to these given comparative advantages and experience. Three existing themes of deforestation (environmental security), youth and women&#x2019;s economic empowerment (economic security) and personal security (violence against women and children) in Kigoma identified, planned for and merged into the current JP. Ongoing planning for four additional components of agriculture with a focus on developing local markets in Kigoma, education with a focus on girls and adolescent girls in Kigoma, WASH in Kigoma and finally local integration and development of the old settlements and surroundings in Katavi and Tabora regions. In Kigoma, the JP will focus mainly on the 3 districts of Kasulu, Kibondo and Kakonko surrounding the three existing refugee camps, but will not exclude potential support to other districts. For WASH for example, the needs are the greatest along Lake Tanganyika due to Cholera outbreaks, but will also include the three mentioned districts. Other ongoing or planned UN interventions outside of these themes or the selected districts will be mapped and referenced to in a special chapter of the JP but will not form part of the common budget. Ongoing and planned direct humanitarian assistance to refugees and migrants will likewise be referenced to in the same special chapter but will not form part of the common budget since it would dwarf the development budget.</narrative>
