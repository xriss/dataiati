   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project aims at strengthening the resilience of three Small Island Developing States in the Caribbean, namely Dominica, Saint Lucia and Guyana, in the face of climate change challenges. The intervention strategy is guided by the provisions of the Employment and Decent Work for Peace and Resilience Recommendation, 2017 (No. 205). The strategy focuses on improving ILO constituents&#x2019; capacity for resilience, adaptation to climate change and for greening of the economy. It includes interventions to build national capacities to prepare for recovery, before a disaster occurs, and to mainstream decent work into early recovery stages. It is implemented with the close involvement of representatives of the Governments, employers&#x2019; and workers&#x2019; organizations of the three countries. This project contributes to the country&#x2019;s efforts to advance towards the attainment of SDG target 1.5 (By 2030, build the resilience of the poor and those in vulnerable situations and reduce their exposure and vulnerability to climate-related extreme events and other economic, social and environmental shocks and disasters); target 4.3 (By 2030, ensure equal access for all women and men to affordable and quality technical, vocational and tertiary education, including university); and target 8.2 (Achieve higher levels of economic productivity through diversification, technological upgrading and innovation, including through a focus on high-value added and labour-intensive sectors).</narrative>
