   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This RBSA-funded intervention is part of the ILO&#x2019;s flagship programme on establishing sustainable social protection floors for all. It builds upon ongoing ILO support to the establishment of the Palestinian Social Security Corporation (PSSC). Once the PSSC is fully established, it will ensure proper implementation of the social security law and will serve as the backbone of a more comprehensive social protection system for the OPT. The intervention provides support for the second phase of the establishment, administrative set-up and operationalization of the PSSC through: i) assisting its Board of Directors in developing necessary secondary legislation, rules and regulations essential for implementation of the law; ii) providing technical support and oversight in the design and implementation of a national awareness raising campaign; iii) providing technical assistance for developing a comprehensive investment strategy to ensure sustainability of social security funds. A public awareness campaign addresses public concerns over the social security system, aiming to increase awareness of the scheme and its role in reducing poverty, inequality and boosting the capacity of vulnerable segments of society. It also contains information on existing rights, schemes and procedures. By supporting the implementation of the PSSC, this intervention contributes to making the right to social protection a reality for all in the OPT. In addition, the initiative contributes to gender equality and non-discrimination through the implementation of a new maternity insurance scheme; and, supporting equal opportunities for female labour market participation. The project contributes to the territory&#x2019;s efforts to advance towards the attainment of SDG target 1.3 (Implement nationally appropriate social protection systems and measures for all, including floors, and by 2030 achieve substantial coverage of the poor and the vulnerable), 8.5 (By 2013, achieve full and productive employment and decent work for all women and men, including for young people and persons with disabilities, and equal pay for work of equal value); and target 10.4 (Adopt policies, especially fiscal, wage and social protection policies, and progressively achieve greater equality).</narrative>
