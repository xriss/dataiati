   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project responds to the willingness of ILO constituents in Guatemala to participate in a process to strengthen their capacities, promote social dialogue and improve the institutional framework so as to ensure the effective application of the Indigenous and Tribal Peoples Convention, 1989 (No. 169). Since its ratification by the country in 1996, the ILO Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations (CEACR) has provided comments on its application. This has included observations on the need to effectively recognize the rights of indigenous peoples and to design and implement public policies that recognize the importance of their participation in decisions that directly affect their working conditions, use of land, social security and education, among other issues. The CEACR has invited the Government of Guatemala to adopt an effective participation and consultation mechanism that would ensure effective compliance with Convention No. 169. The project will focus on: (1) strengthening the capacities of government institutions (at national, regional and local levels), of employers&apos; and workers&apos; organizations as well as of organizations representing indigenous people; (2) strengthening institutions that promote and ensure the necessary conditions for the country to respond to the observations of the ILO supervisory bodies; and (3) promoting dialogue among the actors involved in the adoption and application of a consultation mechanism. The theory of change underpinning the strategy envisages that the country will be able to show substantial improvements in the effective application of Convention No. 169, in line with the observations of the ILO supervisory bodies, provided that the proposed sectoral tripartite social dialogue is effective and allows for the adoption and implementation of a consultation mechanism; the capacities of the actors involved ensure a better understanding, promotion and response around the principles established by the Convention; and the Government strengthens its management capacity to respond to its legal obligations with regard to the protection of indigenous peoples&#x2019; rights. This project contributes to the country&#x2019;s efforts to advance towards the attainment of SDG target 8.8 (Protect labour rights and promote secure working environments for all workers, including migrant workers, in particular women migrants, and those in precarious employment).</narrative>
