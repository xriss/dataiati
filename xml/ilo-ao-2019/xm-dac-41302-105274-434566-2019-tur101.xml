   <narrative xml:lang="EN">An Integrated Model for the Elimination of Worst Forms of Child Labour (WFCL) in Seasonal Agriculture in Hazelnut Harvesting in Turkey</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The overall objective of this project is to contribute elimination of worst forms of child labour (WFCL) in seasonal agriculture in line with the Government&#x2019;s strategy drawn by the National Employment Strategy 2014-2023. A model has been developed through the Dutch Government and CAOBISCO funded &#x201C;Elimination of Worst Forms of Child Labour in Seasonal Commercial Agriculture in Hazelnut Harvesting in Ordu&#x201D; project within the harvesting seasons of 2013 and 2014. The proposed project is based on the lessons learned from the referred project and aims contribute to the withdrawal of children from work and prevention of at-risk children to be engaged in seasonal hazelnut agriculture. It will bring added value through the replication of the strategic intervention model in different regions (D&#xFC;zce and Sakarya provinces of West Black Sea Region and Sanliurfa province of South Eastern Anatolia) and with widened implementation in Ordu and contribute a sustainable child labour monitoring mechanism in seasonal agriculture. By this means, the project will step forward to attain the goal of contributing to the policy making and efficient implementation on the elimination of WFCL in seasonal agriculture. To this regard, three outputs are expected: capacity building (towards local and national institutions), direct interventions (towards all actors of harvesting process- children, families, intermediaries and garden owners) for withdrawal/prevention and awareness-raising (towards all actors of the harvesting process and the public). Project activities are designed in accordance with the each expected outputs and detailed as follows. All three outputs and related activities will be interlinked and reinforce each other. When removing working children from the worst forms of child labour and preventing at-risk children from entering such work, and providing these children with educational and rehabilitative services the project will adopt a dual strategy: &#x201C;Upstream&#x201D; policy work in the form of encouraging national and local ownership, national leadership and capacity development as well as advocacy. The project&#x2019;s contribution to capacity-building at the national and local levels will comprise the transfer of knowledge and skills to the respective institutions in the form of support for national policies and strategies related to child labour in seasonal agriculture. Toward this end, the project would place the capacity building at the centre of the implementation and promote strong alliances of stakeholders at the local levels. &#x201C;Downstream&#x201D; work involves targeted interventions to reduce and prevent the worst forms of child labour through integrated area-based programmes in the selected provinces. The construction of a coherent framework that integrates policies and programmes of the various governmental and non-governmental as well as local, national and international partners is important to the success of the overall project strategy. This requires continued coordination, cooperation and trust among programme partners and their ongoing political will and ability to give priority to the elimination of WFCL and could be considered as an assumption.</narrative>
