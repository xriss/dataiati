   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The G7 Heads of State and Ministers for Development and Employment called for concrete action in low-income sourcing countries to prevent work place-related deaths and severe injuries and diseases in Global Supply Chains (GSCs), as well as adequate compensation mechanisms in case of such contingencies. It was decided that this was to be achieved through the establishment of the multi-donor Vision Zero Fund (VZF) that will work to reduce the number of work-related fatalities and accidents and occupational diseases in selected developing countries, in sectors that link to GSCs, as well as adequately compensating victims and their families in case of such accidents. The ILO was selected to administer the Fund and implement its sectoral projects in selected partner countries. This Action will contribute to the implementation of the VZF, with one priority focus on the textile/garment sector, in line with the EU work on responsible supply chains and the EU Garment Initiative. This Action pursues its mandate through the objectives below. Overall Objective: The number of work-related fatalities and accidents and occupational diseases is reduced, and mechanisms to adequately compensate victims and their families in GSCs in selected countries are in place. The Specific Objectives of the Action are: Public and private sector stakeholders have improved knowledge and tools to prevent and reduce workplace-related deaths, injuries and diseases in GSCs; More workers have access to improved prevention, protection and compensation from OSH risks through adequate policy frameworks, strengthened enforcement capacity and effective occupational health and compensation mechanisms; Sustainable safe and healthy working conditions and practices at industry and enterprises level are reinforced.</narrative>
