   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This RBSA-funded intervention addresses the critical gap in the capacities of employers&#x2019; and workers&#x2019; organizations in South East Asia and Pacific for a just transition to environmental sustainability. It promotes strategies that build their institutional capacities, collectively and individually, to engage in social dialogue and prepare them for their engagement in national and regional policy dialogues and for taking action on issues of common interest to support the achievement of the SDGs, climate resilience and a just transition to environmental sustainability through decent work. It implements country-level activities that promote employment and a just transition for youth, establish disaster-resilient and worker-responsible enterprises and foster the exchange of good practices and lessons learned amongst employers&#x2019; and workers&#x2019; organizations in the sub-region. This multi-country intervention builds on the ILO&#x2019;s work through the Climate Action Pacific Partnership Working Group on Decent Work and Just Transition, and contributes to the implementation of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change. The intervention delivers the following outputs: (i) institutionalized capacity building programmes for employers&#x2019; and workers&#x2019; organizations and their members engaged in social dialogue on the SDGs and related issues; (ii) an evidence-based information and knowledge repository for social partners on SDGs achievement, including on a just transition to environmental sustainability; and (iii) gender-responsive policies, innovative practices and business models supporting SDGs achievement. The intervention contributes to SDG targets 16.7 (Ensure responsive, inclusive, participatory and representative decision-making at all levels), 8.3 (Promote development-oriented policies that support productive activities, decent job creation, entrepreneurship, creativity and innovation, and encourage the formalization and growth of micro-, small and medium-sized enterprises, including through access to financial services) and 13.1 (Strengthen resilience and adaptive capacity to climate-related hazards and natural disasters in all countries).</narrative>
