    <narrative xml:lang="EN">The primary goal of U.S. assistance to Somalia is to promote security and support the development of a unified, peaceful nation. Somalia faces many challenges to consolidate its nascent government in the face of violent extremism, including elections scheduled for 2017. U.S. resources assist the Federal Government of Somalia (FGS) to defeat the al-Qaeda-affiliated al-Shabaab terrorist group that still controls rural territory, and to build a representative, sustainable Somali military, police service, and justice sector that can deter future threats and protect human rights. Additionally, U.S. resources assist the FGS build governance structures for sustainable growth and social service delivery. Resources requested for transparent and responsive governance will support the consolidation of representative governing institutions and critical state-building processes, build responsive and legitimate local governance, and expand the delivery of critical basic services. At the same time, greater stability provides an unprecedented opportunity to expand support for Somalia&apos;s economic recovery, fueled by a revival of the agro-pastoral sector; the return of a vibrant, entrepreneurial diaspora; and management of natural resources, but only through substantial international support.</narrative>
