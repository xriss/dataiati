  </title>
  <description>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Recognizing the complexity of job creation in Ethiopia, the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia recently launched the Jobs Creation Commission (JCC). The mandate of the Commission is to Coordinate, Govern and Monitor all Government and Non-Government efforts in creating jobs. To accomplish this, the Commission will take a holistic approach and a focus on the demand and the supply side of the labour market and linkages between them.  In order to establish the Commission and lay the groundwork for a national strategy, the Commission has defined two sets of critical activities. These include 1) technical assistance and advisory support, including the appointment of key personnel to help develop a national action plan and begin to scope a labour market information system and 2) additional support required to stand up the Commission itself.</narrative>
