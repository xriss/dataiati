   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Global Findex project measures peoples&#x2019; use of financial services around the world. The Global Findex is the first public demand-side database that consistently measures financial inclusion across economies and over time. The indicators are drawn from nationally representative survey data covering more than 150,000 people in over 140 countries, representing more than 98 percent of the world&#x2019;s population. The survey is carried out by Gallup, Inc. as part of the Gallup World Poll. The first Global Findex database in 2011 was a landmark, delivering unprecedented insights into how people in more than 140 economies save, borrow, make payments and manage risk. The second edition of the database (collected in 2014) and a third edition (collected in 2017) add a time-series dimension to the database. The database provides more than 100 indicators, including by gender, age group, and household income.</narrative>
