  </title>
  <description>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">BRIDGES will be implemented by First Consult PLC and DAI-Europe. The project will leverage on past experiences, learning and successes to scale labour market linkage related interventions implemented over 5 years through Enterprise Partners (EP). These interventions have eased recruitment for rural-urban migrants, enhanced the quality of employment and retention, and built institutional and organizational capacity for the PPPs across the Industrial Parks (IP) in Ethiopia. Through BRIDGES The Foundation will support a vital next step in perusing industrial transformation in Ethiopia aligned with government priorities by linking MSMEs into the IPs through supply chains and improving local value addition to global products. BRIDGES will scale innovative financial inclusion related activities in partnership with the IP investors to ensure solutions exist for a successful post-factory employment/entrepreneurship transition for employees. The project will also ease market friction by leveraging demand side actors such as Anchor Enterprises to provide market access, know-how and financing to SMEs to catalyze employment growth. As these MSMEs grow they will tap into extensive technical and business development related opportunities facilitated through BRIDGES.</narrative>
