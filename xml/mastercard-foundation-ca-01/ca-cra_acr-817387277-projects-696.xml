  <description>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The following activity areas reflect our proposed strategic shift for 2016-2018: 

1. The core of the Smart Campaign&#x2019;s role will continue to be as an expert voice on client protection, encompassing both standards development and research on issues that need attention, and expanding its scope to the broader financial inclusion sector. The Campaign will maintain a strong body of trained capacity building providers and publicly available tools and will build the evidence for client protection.
2. We will advance the certification program to become a worldwide recognizable label associated with financial client protection. 
3. We will renew attention to motivation and incentives for good practices by enhancing engagement with actors who can influence motivation and provide incentives, especially at the country level.
4. We will put in place a strong governance structure and monitoring mechanisms, operate in an increasingly collaborative and inclusive manner, and monitor our impact, in order to assert the credibility of the Campaign and increase our sphere of influence.</narrative>
