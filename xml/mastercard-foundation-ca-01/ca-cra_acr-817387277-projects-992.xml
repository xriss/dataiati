   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This Management Project is to support the Foundation&#x2019;s strategic development work by undertaking research on the MSME landscape and identifying barriers and opportunities to finance MSME growth and job creation.   

Activities include: (i) Review the MSME landscape in Ethiopia, Ghana, Nigeria and Senegal. This will include a desk analysis, meetings with the Foundation team and stakeholder interviews; (ii) Assess the state of financing for micro, small, and medium business segments in each country, with a particular focus on priority sectors, such as agriculture, that can employ youth. Identify the barriers and opportunities to scale up support to the segment. Landscape the current efforts of key stakeholders in MSME finance in each market; (iii) Identify possible pathways, approaches and instruments that support the development and financing of the MSME segment; (iv) Synthesize and consolidate findings in a final report which presents recommendations for each of the 4 countries, along with a diagnostic tool for Foundation staff to develop targeted interventions for the poor. Produce a database of stakeholders and key contacts for each country.</narrative>
