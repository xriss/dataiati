   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Moringa is at a critical juncture with 4 years of proven impact. Moringa is at a tipping point to rapidly grow and train 200,000 knowledge workers by 2030. To accomplish these ambitious goals, aligned with Mastercard Foundation&#x2019;s aim for young people across Africa to secure dignified and fulfilling employment, Moringa needs support to design its model for scale and answer critical questions to shape its scale-up strategy. Moringa and Mastercard Foundation&#x2019;s partnership in Year 1 will 
1) build a sustainability model for reaching low-income students 
2) build a model for scaling and marketing existing courses and new courses with quality, and 
3) support government programs like Ajira to equip their students with relevant skills for jobs. 
As part of this engagement with Mastercard Foundation, Moringa School will also leverage relationships with employer partners to contribute to the Foundation&#x2019;s YAW in Kenya project.</narrative>
