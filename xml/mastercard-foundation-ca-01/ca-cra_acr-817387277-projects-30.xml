   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This program expands village savings and loan associations (VSLAs) across the country of Rwanda. VSLAs are savings-led, community-managed groups in which the loan capital comes from the group&apos;s accumulated savings. Each group sets its own rules about membership, savings, and loans. The program works with microfinance providers to customize their services to groups who want more diverse products such as larger loans, micro insurance and payment services. It will also test strategies to facilitate the efficient formation of groups. The program is part of a coordinated global learning initiative with other organizations to generate new knowledge on cost-effective ways to offer financial services to remote poor.</narrative>
