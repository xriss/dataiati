   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project will prepare high school graduates from Rwanda and the neighbouring conflict-torn countries for admission and scholarships to international universities. The students will be selected based on their academic performance, financial need, leadership potential and commitment to give back to Rwanda and Africa in general. In addition to a year-long in-country preparatory program, the project will provide support to students while they are studying abroad including placement with host families, mentoring, counselling, and career services. 
The project will expand its network of employers committed to offering opportunities to young Africans, and build out a more comprehensive program to help students with career counselling, internship and job placement in Africa. 
The project will also document important data and learnings in the effort to create opportunities to replicate this model in other countries.</narrative>
