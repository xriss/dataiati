   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This program develops, test and document innovations in the integration of financial services and education for youth between the ages of 13 and 24 in Mali and Ecuador. It will build the capacity of a range of microfinance providers to offer products and services that are appropriate for youth living in poverty. These services will enable and guide youth to establish and achieve financial goals, which will increase options for their future. Youth will be involved in the design, and potentially in the delivery of financial education and have a safe place to save money. Parents and community leaders will be educated on the importance of supporting youth in building financial skills and knowledge.</narrative>
