   <narrative xml:lang="EN">BRAC is one of the leading providers of microfinance services and the BRAC&apos;s approach, which it calls &quot;microfinance multiplied,&quot; increases the ability of poor clients to productively use their loans to augment their incomes and build their assets, as well as stimulate economic and social development within their communities. This program uses the BRAC approach in Uganda to provide economically active women with loans, training and technical support to enable them to improve their livelihoods, particularly those in the agricultural poultry and livestock sectors. Additionally, the program will expand vocational and life-skills education for adolescent girls.</narrative>
