   <narrative xml:lang="EN">&#x2022;	This project will facilitate the linkage of supply and demand of skills in the Information Technology (IT) and IT enabled services (ITES) sectors in Ghana for young women who are working or being trained in these sectors by developing an employability and digital literacy skills assessment tool.
&#x2022;	This project is innovative, as this tool will help young women understand the skills in demand in the IT and ITES sectors and help them assist and signal their employability and digital skills to employers. It will also help these employers assess the level of employability and digital readiness of young women in Ghana. This will facilitate the recruitment process as they are looking to hire or engage these girls in further internship or training.</narrative>
