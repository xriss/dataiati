  <description>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Horwath&#x2019;s work will focus on the institutional support and demand dimensions of REEDI. This project will involve training to strengthen the capacity of key government, industry and regulatory institutions to improve product development and marketing, thereby increasing tourism demand and enterprise growth. This will include the Rwanda Development Board (RDB) and Tourism Chambers. Training and technical assistance will also be provided to strengthen the capacity of tourism institutions in under-served areas at the Provincial and District Level; increasing their ability to implement new products and grow the industry outside Kigali. Horwath will facilitate coordination between demand-side partners and local government, with a focus on District level support, including training to develop new tourism products for local government and selected SMEs to improve demand among consumers and increase the demand for labour in under-served districts.</narrative>
