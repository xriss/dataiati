  </title>
  <description>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Leveraging MEST Africa&#x2019;s core competencies, decade of learning, and existing Intellectual Property, MEST suggests three pilot programs to test in collaboration with other partners as part of Young Africa Works Ghana.
1.	A &#x201C;Pre-MEST&#x201D; program whereby MEST will partner with local universities, existing tech hubs, and coding programs to create an adaptation of the MEST Training Program which can be more widely distributed, in hopes of addressing the currently unmet demand for training (in the last year alone, MEST received over 4,500 applicants for 60 spots).
2.	Through MEST Express existing startups will benefit from a condensed and advanced incubator model, along with key components of our MEST&#x2019;s Training Program, to offer a leaner, more accelerated and adapted model.
3.	MEST Scale is designed for companies that are at the scale stage, to help create a pipeline of companies that are reaching growth and scale.</narrative>
