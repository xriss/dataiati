    <narrative xml:lang="EN">[Extract from Section 11 of Facility Agreement between ICF-DP and the PIDG Trust]

11.1	The Borrower undertakes:
(a)	to comply at all times with the Operational Policies and Procedures and the Partnership Agreement, to ensure that the Operational Policies and Procedures and the Partnership Agreement are not amended without the prior consent of the Lender and to promptly inform the Lender of any and all modifications of its statutes and by-laws, and of other regulations applicable to the Borrower, of any and all changes in the composition of its Board or the debt pool manager, and of any and all circumstances that preclude or seriously jeopardise the accomplishment of the purpose of this Agreement;
(b)	to contractually procure that the persons with whom it deals and contracts do not demand, accept, make, grant, promise or accept the promise of unlawful payments or other advantages in connection with such dealing;
(c)	to fully comply with anti-money laundering and terrorism financing standards in accordance with the current OECD Financial Action Task Force (FATF) 40 recommendations for financial institutions, and implement, maintain and, if necessary, improve its internal standards and guidelines to avoid being abused as a vehicle for money-laundering and/or drug trafficking and to freeze financial assets of individuals and groups (including entities to which it has extended loans) if those assets show any indication of money laundering;
(d)	as long as there are outstanding obligations hereunder or under other loan agreements with the Lender, to ensure that the Lender has the right to appoint two Board members of the Borrower unless such right of the Lender is already given as a member of the Borrower;
(e)	not to enter into any agreement or arrangement with any lender, bank or other institution for the purpose of being granted funds, loans or any other form of indebtedness without the prior written consent of the Lender;
(f)	 not to pledge, mortgage, alienate or grant any security interest over any of its assets or conclude any other agreement or arrangement the effect of which is the creation of security or any right conferring a priority of payment in respect of any obligation of any person without:
(i)	the prior written consent of the Lender; and
(ii)	at the Lender&#x2019;s request the provision of additional pari passu security interests to secure the Lender&apos;s claims against the Borrower under this Agreement;
(g)	to the extent permitted by law, to use its best efforts to ensure that its obligations under this Agreement will at all times rank at least pari passu with all its other existing or future unsecured and not subordinated payment obligations and, accordingly, to perform the obligations under this Agreement pari passu; and
(h)	not to make any payments, either directly or indirectly, to its members or trusts represented by its members without the prior consent of the Lender. Payments to members also include payments to other entities or trusts, which are affiliates or trusts of such members.
11.2	The Borrower undertakes to provide the following documents and information to the Lender:
(a)	as soon as possible and in any case within ten (10) Business Days of the end of each financial year, its unaudited financial statements;
(b)	within 120 days of the end of each financial year, its audited financial statements including its balance sheet and profit and loss accounts and relevant notes;
(c)	as soon as possible and in any case within ten (10) Business Days of the end of each quarter, its quarterly reports; and 
(d)	promptly on request, any documents, information or reports requested by the Lender to enable the Lender to appraise the Borrower&#x2019;s projects and their implementation, the utilisation of the Loan or the financial condition of the Borrower.
11.3	The Borrower undertakes to enable the Lender or its agent at any time during normal business hours to inspect any and all documents referred to at Clause 11.2(d) above as well as all auditors&#x2019; and accountants&#x2019; reports prepared on the Loan by the Borrower&apos;s own departments and external auditors and to enable the Lender or its agent, together with representatives of the Borrower, at any time to verify the proper use of the Loan amounts by visiting the sites of the Borrower&#x2019;s projects and to look into the financial situation and statements of earnings of entities to which the Borrower has extended loans.</narrative>
