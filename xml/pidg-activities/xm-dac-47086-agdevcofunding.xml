(l)	without limitation to the above, any information reasonably requested by the PIDG Trust (and it will and allow representatives of the PIDG Trust and the members of the PIDG the right to review the progress of any investment by the Recipient and allow the representatives of the PIDG Trust and the Recipient the right to audit the books and records of the Recipient provided that the Recipient shall not be obliged to disclose any information which is subject to confidentiality or non-disclosure undertakings in favour of a third party);

(m)	such reasonable support and assistance as the Recipient may require when undertaking any mid-term or progress review of the Recipient; and

(n)	a final report and consolidated financial statement on termination of this Letter of Arrangement in a form to be agreed with the PMU.

5.7	The PIDG Trust agrees that the Recipient may remunerate its staff as it considers reasonable and appropriate, unless and until it becomes a PIDG facility. This may include an incentive-based arrangement that rewards staff for delivery of certain objectives. 

5.8	Even though the Recipient is not a PIDG facility, the Recipient and the PIDG Trust agree to disclose such information relating to the Grant as is required to meet the requirements of the PIDG&#x2019;s disclosure policy and procedures as may be amended from to time.</narrative>
