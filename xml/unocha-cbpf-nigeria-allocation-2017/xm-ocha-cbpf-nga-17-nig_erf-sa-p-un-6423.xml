   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The states in Northeast Nigeria have in the past 8 years experienced attacks from Boko Haram. The insurgency and counter-insurgency have led to loss of lives, destruction of property, mass displacement, break down of socio &#x2013;economic structures and gross human rights violation including, abduction and mistreatment, sexual slavery and rape. The attacks have also led to destruction of health facilities thus access to medical care has remained in a challenge in most areas. The lack of access due to insecurity, has further made it difficult to deliver humanitarian aid in the past. Women and girls have been exposed to sexual exploitation and abuse as they are forced to exchange sex for basic needs. The lack of humanitarian assistance has been linked to the increasing cases of sexual exploitation and abuse .  In addition, 38% of rape cases reported in Borno state have been associated with possible sexual exploitation and slavery  However, the NDF has recently liberated some LGAs which provides a window of opportunity for humanitarian aid.  Due to population movement and displacement, GBV services are fragmented in Northeast while women and continue to face multiple risks of GBV.  Wood collection for firewood and sale has continued to expose women and girls to sexual violence. Women and girls who return from captivity are stigmatized and face rejection from the community as they are associated with the Boko haram. Pregnant women and children who are born out of rape incidents committed by the Boko haram also face rejection and are at risk of further violence. A recent registration conducted by UNHCR  in collaboration with NEMA, SEMA and the Nigerian immigration service indicate that 337, 806 individuals have returned. Most of the returnees are female and children. The new returnees coming from Niger, Chad and Cameroon have also reported mistreatment, physical violence, harassment, family separation and lack of food during their return. All these conditions expose women and girls to GBV.  The 2017 humanitarian needs overview (HNO) estimates that 14 million people require humanitarian assistance in 2017, 8.5 million of them in Borno, Yobe and Adamawa States. 1.8 million of these are internally displaced people, and about 1.2 million are returnee IDPs and refugees who are still assessed to be in a secondary displacement. Borno State hosts over 1.4 million IDPs followed by Adamawa, which has 146,605 IDPs while Yobe has about 116,619 IDPs. Among the IDPs, 54% are female and 56% are under the age of 18 years (IOM/NEMA: DTM-XV of March, 2017).  In order to address the current gaps in GBV prevention and response services, UNFPA proposes to scale up GBV prevention and response program in Northeast. UNFPA  will  equip the safe spaces in Northeast where CMR services will be available. The SS will provide an entry point for identifying the safety and protection concerns of women and girls as well as provide a safe space for all women and girls to attend group psycho-social activities and thus help rebuild their social network. The group psychosocial activities will be suggested by women and girls to ensure that they are culturally accepted and relevant. A private and confidential space will be available for case management and individual counseling by trained  case workers. In addition, UNFPA seeks to establish an information desk at the transit centre for the returnees. All activities will be designed to meet the specialized and age-appropriate needs of adult women, adolescent girls, men and boys. The proposed project strives to increase access to GBV case management services, provide psycho-social support (PSS), and referral to comprehensive medical care for survivors of GBV.</narrative>
