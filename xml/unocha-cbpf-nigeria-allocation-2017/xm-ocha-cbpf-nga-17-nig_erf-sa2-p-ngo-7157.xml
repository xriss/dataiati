  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Based on its past and ongoing work, an effective reintegration programme for children formerly associated with armed groups is a priority area for WINN. Under the previous UNICEF-funded three month project, WINN identified and trained 80 Monitoring and Reporting Mechanism (MRM) Volunteers from the 5 Local Governmental Areas (LGAs) to register and capture the data of Children Associated with Armed Groups and/or Armed Forces (CAFAAG), unaccompanied and separated children, in collaboration with camp management and child protection committee structures which generated lists of Unaccompanied and Separated Children (UASC) in the 5 LGAs camps and Host Community where the project worked. Out of the children identified, 876 (314 boy, 562 girls) were identified and received at least one visit within the month of identification. However, during implementation, 216 of the 876 children identified could not be registered for several reasons, including that many moved out of the location, or after further verification and follow-up visits, were discovered not to have been greatly affected by armed conflict. In the 5 LGAs where these activities were undertaken, an additional 850 children were reported to be UASC (out of which 660 were identified as UASC). 
Despite the progress made in this three month project, several gaps and needs remain. There is an urgent need to strengthen the community-based system of identification and acceptance of CAAFAG, children released from military detention and from captivity and provide them with dedicated referral to mental psychosocial and sustainable socio-economic reintegration services linked to their individual needs and services availability, aimed at reducing their vulnerability to other grave violations of their rights but also to address violations that already occurred to them. Provision of livelihood support to care givers according base on their need and availability economic activities in Dikwa and Mafa LGAs. 
WINN Community Volunteers will work in collaboration with Child Protection Committees (CPCs) of other INGO and NGO in Dikwa and Mafa LGA. 
WINN will use identification tools developed by Child Protection Information Management System (CPIMS) and currently being used by other partners. This will ensure standardized approach to data collection and information management for CAAFAG and other highly vulnerable group including care givers. 
Through this project and building on its existing structures WINN will engaged expertise of consultant in the area of capacity development in grant and finance management as this will enhance the organization scope to easily access funding directly from the donor as a strategy for localisation of humanitarian assistance.    
 
WINN will use five main strategy to implement i) building the capacities of community actors on CAAFAG and UASC programming  ii) putting in place Child protection committee and mother support group (MSG)  in to prevent the recruitment and use of children by armed groups iii) supporting initiatives for non-formal release of children from armed groups iv) providing short-term reinsertion kits (mat, slippers, soap, bucket) to CAAFAG and children released from military detention and v) providing Long term economic reintegration services based on age and gender sensitivities of the CAAFAG, caregivers and other highly vulnerable children. In order to actualize these strategies, WINN will ensure an effective coordination and partnerships arrangement are in place with all relevant State actors on Child protection Programme.</narrative>
