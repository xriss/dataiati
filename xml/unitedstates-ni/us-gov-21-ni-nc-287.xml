   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Evaluation is the systematic collection and analysis of information about the characteristics and outcomes of programs and projects as a basis for judgments, to improve effectiveness and inform decisions about current and future programming. Evaluations are distinct from (a) needs assessments, which are designed to examine country or sector context to inform project design, (b) internal informal reviews of projects and (c) audits (conducted either internally or by an external audience). This program area should include all evaluations designed and funded with foreign assistance funding, including the components of contracts with task orders for evaluations (regardless of the mechanism). It should also include all independent contractors hired solely to produce an evaluation(s).</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">The United States supports the development of a Nicaragua in which all citizens benefit from democratic governance, peace, security, and economic development. U.S. assistance focuses on preventing the erosion of national democratic governance, improving citizen security along Nicaragua&apos;s Caribbean coast and in the Northern regions, and supporting efforts to reduce the transshipment of drugs through Nicaragua. To achieve these goals, assistance will improve the effectiveness of local governance by supporting civil society actors to advocate for transparency and accountability and to participate in decision-making and oversight. U.S. assistance will also improve early grade literacy, promote social inclusion, provide at-risk youth with basic skills to compete in the job market, and build community support for these goals. The U.S. Strategy for Engagement in Central America focuses on three overarching lines of action: 1) promoting prosperity and regional economic integration; 2) enhancing security through continued and expanded Central America Regional Security Initiative (CARSI) activities; and 3) promoting improved governance. Therefore, the Department of State and USAID&apos;s FY 2017 request of $750.0 million in bilateral and regional assistance for Central America - a part of the Administration&apos;s $1.0 billion whole-of-government request for appropriations and financing assistance to support the Strategy - includes and aligns the resources necessary to begin to comprehensively increase economic opportunity, reduce extreme violence, strengthen the effectiveness of state institutions, address climate change and food insecurity, and address challenges that have resulted in an influx of migration.</narrative>
