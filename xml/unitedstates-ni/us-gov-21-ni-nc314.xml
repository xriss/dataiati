   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This award strives to help nations achieve sustainable improvements in the well-being and productivity of their populations through effective and accountable investments in education and other social services. This includes Hibiscus will work with 12 rural communities in Granada and Carazo to address severe drought and improve food security. The organization borrows part of its name from the hibiscus flower, a profitable annual crop resistant to drought - and in this case a viable alternative to the problems these communities face. It owns an industrial processing plant located in Nandaime where it processes the hibiscus flower into juice concentrate, dried leaves and tropical fruit wines and juices. IAF support will allow Hibiscus to strengthen affected communities&apos; abilities to overcome severe drought affecting their traditional crops such as beans, corn, and basic grains by cultivating the red flower, and to better market products made from the plant. Activities will also include building participants&apos; organizational and planning skills, as well as increasing knowledge on business management, governance, loan fund management and fundraising. Hibiscus will engage some 200 residents of participating communities directly, and an additional 1,800 people will benefit indirectly from these activities..</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">The United States supports the development of a Nicaragua in which all citizens benefit from democratic governance, peace, security, and economic development. U.S. assistance focuses on preventing the erosion of national democratic governance, improving citizen security along Nicaragua&apos;s Caribbean coast and in the Northern regions, and supporting efforts to reduce the transshipment of drugs through Nicaragua. To achieve these goals, assistance will improve the effectiveness of local governance by supporting civil society actors to advocate for transparency and accountability and to participate in decision-making and oversight. U.S. assistance will also improve early grade literacy, promote social inclusion, provide at-risk youth with basic skills to compete in the job market, and build community support for these goals. The U.S. Strategy for Engagement in Central America focuses on three overarching lines of action: 1) promoting prosperity and regional economic integration; 2) enhancing security through continued and expanded Central America Regional Security Initiative (CARSI) activities; and 3) promoting improved governance. Therefore, the Department of State and USAID&apos;s FY 2017 request of $750.0 million in bilateral and regional assistance for Central America - a part of the Administration&apos;s $1.0 billion whole-of-government request for appropriations and financing assistance to support the Strategy - includes and aligns the resources necessary to begin to comprehensively increase economic opportunity, reduce extreme violence, strengthen the effectiveness of state institutions, address climate change and food insecurity, and address challenges that have resulted in an influx of migration.</narrative>
