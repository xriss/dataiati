  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Since its start in April 2016, the Amsterdam Centre for World Food Studies has developed many initiatives to bring interdisciplinary Food and Nutrition Security research and education to the fore at VU Amsterdam. After one and a half year it is now the time to look back, draw lessons, and plan for the next steps. This is done in this Annual Plan by taking two perspectives. The first perspective is retrospective with a discussion of outputs delivered and the lessons learnt since the start of the Centre. The second perspective addresses the question which activities are being planned such that future performance can be improved. The retrospective part of the present document reviews the progress made in research, education, institution building and outreach, while the future part is formulated in terms of challenges that will, and need, be addressed in the coming years, starting with 2018. The last part of this Annual Plan presents the plan of activities and the projected budget. The document proceeds in three parts: I. Review and lessons learnt; II. Challenges; III. Plan of activities and the budget for 2018. Background on the composition of its research associates, Board, programme committee and programme of the Opening Symposium are given in the Annexes.</narrative>
