   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Water-Energy-Food Nexus in a farm model for the Jordan River Basin: introducing solar panels on farmland</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">With prevailing water scarcity as daily concern and rainfall becoming more erratic under climate change the sustainability of food production in the Middle East is balancing at the verge of despair. The Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan and the Palestine Territories are no exception as both neighboring countries face a raft of challenges to meet the water demand of the agricultural sector. Moreover, the strong link with energy in almost every stage of the water cycle and, vice versa, the high dependency on water in conventional energy generation are serious threats due to, respectively, the vagaries of the energy prices and the negative impact on other water users (households, municipality, agriculture, tourism). The tension is likely to mount in the near future under persistent demographic pressure, with a growing and more affluent urban population that demands its water rights but also wants food security at reasonable prices. Allocation of transboundary water resources from water rich regions like Lebanon and Turkey is currently no option as it would lead to serious tensions in a region already rife with political conflicts. Hence, solutions should arise from within the countries themselves, in particular by focusing on high intensity farming systems with increasing water and energy efficiencies. Yet, this is not an easy task since an informed choice of land allocation to food cultivation and energy sources will have to be made out of many possible options. This study aims to address this Water Energy Food Nexus by creating a farm model that explores the possible profitability of installing solar panels on farm land in the Jordan River Basin (JRB)1 . In the model the farmers make an optimal selection of the activities available to them, at given land and water resources, technical options and market prices. Linkages between cropping options, water availability and location of solar panels are a crucial element of the farm model, taking into account the region&#x2019;s crop calendars, rainfall patterns, and solar energy suitability rankings</narrative>
