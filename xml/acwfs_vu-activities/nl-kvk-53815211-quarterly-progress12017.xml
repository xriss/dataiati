   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This is the quarterly report on activities of the Amsterdam Centre for World Food Studies (ACWFS) for the period February-May, 2017. With this report, we comply with requirements of the Grant from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Economic Affairs, but we also intend to offer an interesting view on the diversity of activities undertaken. The reporting period has been one in which much attention has been devoted to bringing people together, in research, acquisition and education &#x2013; the photo on the cover illustrates this. As can be seen from the contents of the report, this has already proven fruitful in a number of cases, while we are also expecting more activities to be developed in the near future. This report also provides an overview of the ways in which the grant has been used to support the establishment of the Center. At the moment of writing, preparations for the opening symposium are in full swing. There is little doubt that this event will provide new energy and momentum to the ACWFS.</narrative>
