   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The past year has seen continued development of the Centre, as well as change in leadership. Therefore, it is good to first look back, draw lessons, and plan for the next steps. This is done in this Annual Plan by addressing two questions. The first one is retrospective. Based on a discussion of outputs delivered and the lessons learnt, the question posed is whether the organization has delivered value for money. The second question is which activities are being planned such that future performance can be improved. The retrospective part of the present document reviews the progress made in research, education, institution building and outreach, while the future part is formulated in terms of challenges that will, and need, be addressed in 2019. The last part of this Annual Plan presents the plan of activities and the projected budget. The document proceeds in three parts: I. Review and lessons learnt; II. Challenges; III. Plan of activities and the budget for 2019. Background on the composition of its research associates, Board and programme committee is given in Annex A.</narrative>
