    <narrative xml:lang="EN">General question: Results related to the intended outcome 2015Question: Summarise results related to the intended outcome (this information will be sent to Open Aid)Answer: The support was given to UN Women during 2013 and 2014 to allow the organisation to transit through their own reorganisation and to be active participants in the elections and setting of the devolved governments as per the Kenyan constitutional requirements.    During this period January 2013 to December 2014 UN Women engaged in the initiatives that contributed to enabling policy frameworks to enhance Gender Equality and Women&amp;apos;s Empowerment (GEWE), to supporting systems and strengthening the capacity of gender equality advocates and machineries in Kenya.  On the policy front, UN Women supported and facilitated gender machineries to influence the implementation of the Constitution and to develop/review 17 GEWE policies. The AA policy is still work in progress, but it already ensured increased women representation in national and county assemblies.  Over the 2 years, UN Women strategically focused on responding to the emerging challenges relating to women&#x2019;s participation in political processes through voter education, preparing women aspirants and candidates and working with key peace and security stakeholders to ensure peaceful elections. As a result, the March 2013 general elections in Kenya saw an improved participation of women as both candidates and voters, as well as reduced incidences of violence against women (VAW). Women have actively participated in all electoral processes including voter registration, voting and, as aspirants, in the various elective positions. Women now constitute 21% of the bicameral parliament, a major gain in women political leadership. There are a total of 89 elected and nominated women leaders out of the 416 parliamentarians (349 National Assembly members and 67 Senators).  The new devolved system of governance provided a better opportunity for UN Women to push for GEWE issues at the devolved level of governance. As a result, UN System in Kenya has developed a One UN Joint Strategy on devolution. This has brought together UN agencies in Kenya which will support the implementation of devolution. UN Women is leading on the key result area on gender equality and human rights.  Using the land policy (at national and county level) and the Constitution as enabling legal frameworks, UN Women partners working on the land and property rights programs are now able to channel any grievances and issues within the system. For example, the established Alternative Dispute Resolution Councils (ADRCs), community land boards and the land registration unit at the county level provide an opportunity for the engagement and advocacy for women&#x2019;s participation in these bodies as well as for addressing the discrimination of women and children, including those living with HIV, with regard to land and property rights.  UN Women supported the Government of Kenya in the implementation of UNSCR 1325 through the development of the Kenya National Action Plan on UNSCR 1325, which aims to mainstream UNSCR 1325 into national development policies, peace-processes and ensure the implementation of existing commitments by the government to promote gender equality and women&#x2019;s participation and leadership in public affairs at all levels.  UN Women supported key stakeholders to develop a working formula for the implementation of the Affirmative Action (AA) policy. The policy provides a framework for ensuring that the constitutional provisions for ending discrimination against women and institutionalisation of affirmative action for women across all public and private spheres</narrative>
