    <narrative xml:lang="EN">General question: Results related to the intended outcome 2015Question: Summarise results related to the intended outcome (this information will be sent to Open Aid)Answer: The aim of the program was to put in place a national child protection system that prevents and responds to violence, abuse, exploitation and family separation, including in emergencies.  This was to be achieved through the below specific objectives:-
1) The government has the capacity to coordinate and demonstrate the system approach to Child Protection;
2) Roles and responsibilities of Child Protection duty bearers articulated in policies, guidelines, regulations, and legal framework; and
3) A harmonized Cash Transfer programme for Orphans and Vulnerable Children (OVCs) is in place in 60 districts and linkages made to the CP system.

In the period 2013 to June 2015, with Swedish support, much progress was made by UNICEF and the Government of Kenya, in collaboration with implementing partners, which contributed to strengthening the child protection system as planned.   The following results were achieved: 
Specific objective 1:- 
a) Alternative Family Care Guidelines and the CCI standards, were officially endorsed and implementation started;
b) Under the leadership of the Ministry of Labour, Social Security and Services, the national child protection sector worked towards a strengthened child protection system that is comprehensive, sustainable, coordinated, and recognizes that children often face multiple risks that require comprehensive prevention and response services.
c)  Violence against Children (VAC) national study and its response plan was finalised and a technical working group established to develop a response plan and oversee its implementation. However, a fully costed analysis of the VAC response is pending
d) The National Child Protection Database was redesigned to allow the development and implementation of a comprehensive child protection database.  
e) UNICEF participated in the GBV Emergency Coordination Taskforce (GBV-ECT) in partnership with government and other UN organisations (UNWomen and UNFPA) towards implementation of GBV Helpline (1195) for survivors of rape and sexual violence before, during and after the elections. Support was also given to  Gender Recovery Centre of Nairobi Women Hospital to support the activities of the &#x201C;1 Million Fathers Movement- 1MFM&#x201D; - a social movement through which males in society are mobilized to reject all forms of GBV by signing up and standing in solidarity with women to end GBV.
f) With support from Sweden, UNICEF in partnership with the Department of Children Services (DCS) continued to operationalize the Child Protection Centers (CPC). Through CPC&apos;s, children are able to access a high-quality continuum of care, from prevention to provision of services, provided in a timely manner.

2. The Violence against Children Response plan was validated and implementation ongoing;
Justice for children
a) UNICEF supported the carrying out of a Situation Analysis of Children in the Justice System submitted in 2014. The study indicated that the Constitution and  Children&apos;s Act provided adequate protection of children in need of care and protection as well as child victims and child witnesses. However, children in conflict with the law are not fully covered. Diversion of children from the criminal justice system is not systematic leading to child offenders kept in remand for long periods of time. The study showed that while the informal justice systems plays a significant role in the provision of services to children despite this; there have not been any formal or deliberate attempts to integrate these systems into the formal justice system
b) A total of 16,853 child abuse cases were addressed through the services of Child Helpline, Malindi and Garissa Child Protection Centres, the Lodwar Wellness Centre and the NGO Cradle. These children received appropriate services such as legal aid services, psycho-social support, counselling and medical services for sexual abuse survivors; 

3. A harmonized Cash Transfer programme for Orphans and Vulnerable Children (OVCs) is in place in 60 districts and linkages made to the CP system
a) An additional 105,000 new beneficiary households were enrolled in the Cash Transfer for Orphans and Vulnerable Children and by January 2015 the programme reached 261,543 beneficiary households in 47 counties and 290 constituencies. According to the Cash Transfer Orphans and Vulnerable children&#x2019;s Management Information System (MIS) the programme had benefited 742,535 children across the country of which 380,540 are boys and 361,995 are girls.
b) Positive progress was made by UNICEF which advocated the Government of Kenya (GOK) to take over the full financial and managerial responsibility of direct cash transfer for all beneficiary households in the programme. In 2013, UNICEF handed over the payment of the direct cash to 25,000 beneficiary households to the government.  This is considered a positive indicator that the government has taken full ownership of the Cash Transfer for OVC programme.</narrative>
