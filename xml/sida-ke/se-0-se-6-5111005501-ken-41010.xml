    <narrative xml:lang="EN">General question: Results related to the intended outcome 2014Question: Summarise results related to the intended outcome (this information will be sent to Open Aid)Answer: NETFUND therefore conceptualized and implemented the NETFUND GIA as an award that not only recognizes and awards environmental heroes but also actively sensitizes the public on the importance of environmental conservation. An additional benefit of the NETFUND GIA is the strong business incubation component whose purpose is to develop innovative initiatives and transform them into viable green enterprises, with the ultimate aim of alleviating poverty. This objective was in tandem with both the Embassy of Sweden&#x2019;s strategic plan for Kenya in terms of poverty alleviation and NETFUND mandate of environmental management clearly recognising the link between poverty and poor husbandry of the environment. From the outset NETFUND purposed to create a high impact programme with participation from Kenyans from all over the country with a particular emphasis on projects or ideas that affected the bottom of the pyramid in various sectors nationwide. As detailed in the report the programme was developed through a consultative process involving multiple public and private environmental organisations and with support from the Embassy of Sweden. Key structures were set up to enhance quality, these included: the National Steering Committee (NSC) which comprised of professionals from diverse backgrounds; engagement of a prominent audit firm for quality assurance and the development of various policy and process documents. In addition, a number of training sessions were conducted for the secretariat, the NSC, judges to ground all participants on the tenets of the GIA. In order to inform and encourage involvement of Kenyans countrywide, NETFUND carried out a publicity campaign in the mainstream print and electronic media. NETFUND also leveraged vernacular radio platforms in order to ensure involvement of Kenyans from the countryside who do not necessarily subscribe to mainstream media. This resulted in broad dissemination of information. After the formal launch of the Award the entry forms were distributed through our partner outlets countrywide. The application form was also uploaded to the website for ease of application. These efforts resulted in receipt of 1,792 forms. Majority of the entrants were from Nairobi and its environs and going forward, NETFUND will adopt strategies to encourage more participation from relatively marginalised areas of the country. On receipt of entries, the judging process commenced with the county level judging and thereafter the selected entries were submitted to a National level judging process to determine the eventual winners. The judging process was enhanced through the use of a Management Information System (MIS) which made it possible for judging online and offsite thus reducing the risk of collusion between the judges. It is important to note that the independent quality assurance firm that had been engaged was involved at all stages of the process with the intention of making selection of entries as transparent and fair as possible. A total of 22 winners were eventually picked and awarded with cash prizes during a gala event that was graced by the First Lady of Kenya, Her Excellency, Mrs. Margaret Kenyatta. Additional projects were also selected to undergo an incubation process with the aim of refining the ideas into marketable products/services leading to the creation of viable green enterprises. Currently these projects are still undergoing incubation with our partner organisations while the NETFUND in-house incubation centre has been fully established and is in use. Another strength of the NETFUND GIA has been partnership building. The issue of innovations resonates well with the corporates and other philanthropic organisations and so far NETFUND has been able to formalise strategic partnerships with various organisations. Some of the impact reported includes I) Increased power generation from renewable energy that has resulted in reduction of both fuel wood expenses and cutting down of trees II) Improved production practices and enhanced efficiency, in part due to installation of modern equipment, which has led to increased profitability of green enterprises III) Increased access to clean water by thousands of beneficiaries which has led to reduced incidence of waterborne diseases. More specific details of impact can be obtained in section 3.5.4.1 &#x2013; scaling up of best practices. NETFUND anticipates greater project impact upon successful completion of the incubation process. Overall the programme has yielded many innovative projects with the potential for commercialization. Nonetheless the participation from women has been low. In the next phase, NETFUND has taken deliberate measures to incentivize participation by women, youths and persons with disabilities. It is our considered opinion that the programme has been successfully implemented in accordance with the terms and conditions as stipulated in the funding agreement between the Governments of Kenya and Sweden. It is expected to have a significant long term impact on the target beneficiaries and we look forward to implementing the next phase.</narrative>
