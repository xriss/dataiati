   <narrative xml:lang="EN">-	Stakeholder Effect - Increased Access to Finance to SMEs and Climate Finance: As part of the privatization, UzPSB will significantly scale up its business with privately-owned enterprises, including financing of SMEs and climate finance project. The advisory support provided to the Bank will help create strategy, product offering, operational and risk frameworks for these segments, and dedicated funding will further support refinement of these business lines.
-	Market Creation Effect - Competitiveness: Through the broad IFC engagement, UzPSB is expected to position itself as an exemplary and leading universal bank in the country. Its impending privatization will pave the way for other local banks which are expected to adopt some of the best practices promoted by UzPSB. This will ultimately lead to the increase of the private sector share in the Uzbekistan financial services market.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The proposed project with Joint-stock Commercial Bank Uzpromstroybank (UzPSB or the Bank) comprises a senior loan of up to US$75 million with a conversion option into ordinary shares of the Bank, and a trade finance line of up to US$20 million. The Bank is the oldest and second largest in Uzbekistan with a market share of approximately 15% by assets. UzPSB provides banking services and financing to core industrial corporates and their large investment projects in the petrochemical, biochemical, oil and gas, mining, energy, light industry, construction, engineering and transport sectors. It also services SMEs and provides a broad range of retail banking services.  The proposed project represents a part of the large upstream engagement between the Government of Uzbekistan and the World Bank Group. The engagement commenced in July 2019 from the extensive advisory support to UzPSB and aims at helping UzPSB in transformation of its corporate governance, risk management and operations in anticipation of the Banks eventual privatization.  UzPSB has established relations with multiple foreign export-import banks, development finance institutions, and commercial and investment banks. The Bank has international credit ratings of BB- by both S&amp;P and Fitch. In November 2019, UzPSB issued the first corporate eurobond among the Uzbekistan-based companies. The 5-year bond of US$300 million is listed on the London Stock Exchange.</narrative>
