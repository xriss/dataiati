SKS is an established local marble processing company and will manage the Project. Podemnik will contribute in-kind assets comprising land, building and associated infrastructure and will be a passive partner.    Project Cost Including proposed IFC investment    	Estimated Project Cost: US$7 million   IFC is expected to provide an SEF loan of US$ 2.5 million      Location of project and Description of site    	The project is to be located in Tashkent City. The project will be housed in a building constructed in 1996, with a covered area of 7,500 square meters and 8,500 square meters of adjoining land. The facility also includes a water filter plant with a capacity of 200 cubic meters. The facility also has access to a railroad spur to be used for delivery of raw materials.     Description of Company and Purpose of Project    	The project involves setting up a granite processing plant in an existing building in Tashkent, Uzbekistan. The project is expected to produce 45,000 square meters per year of granite tiles plus 2,000 linear meters per year of granite slabs used for flooring, cladding and staircases. 60% production from the granite plant is expected to be sold domestically, while the remaining 40% is to be exported.    The project will improve and enhance local production capacities of the construction industry and bring them to international standard. Indigenous production of granite tiles and slabs will add value to local raw materials, will substitute for imports, earn foreign exchange through exports and will provide employment to 38 people.     Environmental Category and Issues    	This is a category B project. Environmental and social key issues include: raw materials source, site location and land use; air emissions; wastewater effluents; solid waste management; fuel storage and handling; fire protection and emergency response; and general worker health and safety.  All process activities emitting dust will be performed under wet conditions to minimize the generation of air emissions.  In addition, Asia Granite will also install indoor dust filters and will perform periodic monitoring of the workplace air quality. All process waters generated will be filtered and recirculated back into the process and the domestic waters will be collected and sent to the local authorities for treatment. Industrial solid residues will be sold for reuse. Non recyclable residues will be transported and appropriately disposed. There will be a responsible in charge of implementing the environmental, health and safety measures and of establishing Fire Safety and Occupational Health and Safety programs.
