   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Across Ethiopia, 23,8 Million people are projected to be in need in 2021. Ongoing violent conflict, desert locust invasion and recurrent climatic shocks such as floods and droughts, as well as the socioeconomic impact of Covid 19 are the key drivers of humanitarian needs. Food Security and Livelihoods (including Agriculture), WASH, and Health are the sectors with the most people in need. Due to the projected increase in the number of IDPs, as a result of the ongoing conflict, unemployment, and the impact of climate change, needs are expected to increase in the coming months. The IPC Acute Food Insecurity Analysis of June 2021 concludes that in Northern Ethiopia (Tigray, Amhara and Afar), over 350,000 people were in Catastrophe (IPC 5) between May and June 2021, which is the highest number of people in IPC 5 since the 2011 Somalia Famine. 5,5 Million people (61% of the population analysed) were facing high levels of food insecurity (IPC 3 or over) and this level is predicted to be worse at the end of 2021.1
The outbreak of the Tigray conflict in Ethiopia in November 2020 had dramatic effects in the region. Telecommunications, roads, air travel, internet, electricity, banks, potable water, and other public institutions and services are not functioning, inaccessible, and/or are shut down, endangering the lives of the Tigray people. Despite the agreement between the Government of Ethiopia and the United Nations allowing humanitarian access into Tigray, humanitarian actors in practice are often denied access to the region. This severely hinders or even prevents the provision of humanitarian life-saving assistance to affected communities and IDPs, where the situation is quickly deteriorating. According to the latest UN Situation report of November 4th 2021, no humanitarian supplies have arrived in Tigray since the 18th of October. Also, the movement of humanitarian workers in and out of Tigray has been fully denied since 28th October, and movement within the surrounding regions (Amhara &amp; Afar) has been severely restricted.

Within this Joint Response, Partners will work in the following different regions/ zones; North West Zone (Tigray), North Wollo Zone (Amhara), North Shewa Zone (Amhara) and East Haraghe Zone (Oromia). However, as the situation is highly volatile, the Joint Response Partners will keep monitoring and assess the situation again in the beginning of 2022, to see if Partners have regained access, or that the prospective target locations have to change. The specific needs in the targeted locations will be presented in the following chapter, the Joint Response Design.</narrative>
