       <narrative xml:lang="EN">1.1. a) Further support is being provided to the Digital Governance Agency (DGA) to increase the number of e-services accessible through my.gov.ge as well as improve access to e-platforms to receive services and access open data, along with providing assistance in implementation of the second National e-Governance Strategy (2021-2024) of Georgia.
b) To support the improvement of services provided by the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Georgia to women victims of domestic violence, UNDP through its PAR Support project initiated a study to analyze the provision of these services to the target group (women victims of domestic violence) during the COVID-19 pandemic and as a result, develop recommendations that will improve service delivery process in future. For this aim, the Union Sapari will conduct sociological research and develop a comprehensive analysis of services in question. The research process will include: i) an analysis of attitudes of victims of domestic violence in relation to the work of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and the Emergency Service &#x2013; 112 during the pandemic; as well as ii) an identification of challenges and gaps in the process of combating domestic violence by these two institutions.

1.2. Public Service Development Agency (PSDA) of the Ministry of Justice of Georgia launched an initiative to improve the quality and security of electronic public services, by enhancing the cybersecurity systems and data management processes in response to the increased global cyber threats, recent challenges posed by COVID-19 reality and associated remote working practices. The initiative will continue until March 2021.


1.3. a) PAR project supported Georgia Red Cross Society (GRCS) to expand its home care services throughout Georgia targeting the most at-risk people affected by the COVID-19. The initiative aimed to contribute to improving the quality of life of the elderly and vulnerable people through the following results: 1/ Professional and community-based home care services are provided by GRCS in targeted locations: Tbilisi and 29 municipalities. 2/ Program for online learning platform for home care staff, volunteers and informal caregivers is developed and launched; 3/ Capacity of Georgia Red Cross home care caregivers, volunteers, and informal caregivers in the provision of both professional and community -based home care strengthened. As a result of the project implementation, GRCS delivered home care services, information and counseling to more than 5,000 elderly and vulnerable persons (5716) in 30 regional locations through a network of more than 600 caregivers and volunteers. GRCS facilitated the process of establishing 150 Self-Support Groups (SSG) with over 30 SSG members each involved in HC. Moreover 22 600 leaflets on COVID-19 with risk communication massages were developed, published, and distributed to the 30 municipalities and 1200 booklets &#x201C;Psychological Coping During Disease Outbreak - Elderly and People with Chronic Conditions&#x201D; were developed, printed, and distributed in target municipalities. The online learning platform developed as part of the project, will support the increased workload of the GRCS during the health crisis and allow ongoing learning opportunities for the HC staff and volunteers in times of pandemic and beyond.

b) The project supported the Government of Georgia and particularly the National Center for Disease Control and Public Health (NCDC) of Georgia in developing the National Risk Communication Strategy for the NCDC based on the guidelines of the World Health Organization and best international practices to serve as a guidance for public health emergencies. As part of the Risk Communication Strategy deployment activities, UNAG, jointly with NCDC, facilitated a series of online trainings on key guidelines of the Strategy for up to 200 local government and public health centre representatives across 52 municipalities and 9 regions, including Tbilisi. In addition, UNAG developed multiple videos with healthcare workers&#x2019; participation to promote the key guiding principles of the Strategy among the broader public to be disseminated via NCDC channels.</narrative>
