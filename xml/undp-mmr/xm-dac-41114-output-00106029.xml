       <narrative xml:lang="EN">Indicator 1.1.1: Out of 5 supported townships, all 5 supported townships reached level 3 across 4 functions.
Indicator 1.1.2: Out of 5 supported townships, 4 social accountability mechanisms were used in all supported townships.
Indicator 1.1.3: Out of 5 supported townships, all townships fully complied with set criteria where applicable.
Indicator 1.1.4: The ongoing Rakhine State Hluttaw Agriculture, Livestock, Fisheries, Forestry and Irrigation Committee inquiry into The Role of Seed Improvement for Sustainable Agriculture in Rakhine State, is currently benefiting from strong government participation. At its first hearing, in December 2019, the Committee heard evidence from officials of the Departments of Agriculture, Irrigation and Agricultural Statistics and Land Records. They were supported by Ponnagyun Township GAD staff. The Rakhine State Agriculture Minister is fully supportive of the inquiry and has undertaken to make officials available for future hearings. However, COVID-19 has forced the Hluttaw to suspend sittings and activities for the past three months (at least), which has prevented planned hearings with government officials taking place. While the full inquiry cycle has not yet completed &#x2013; and therefore no report has been presented for Government consideration and response &#x2013; the Government&#x2019;s collaboration on the inquiry to date is promising.
Indicator 1.1.5: Integration of gender and diversity analysis in the above ongoing inquiry is assessed according to four stages: Consideration in the definition of inquiry ToR; Consideration in stakeholder mapping stage; Consideration in preparing for and conducting hearings and field visits; A report on analysis of evidence integrating gender and diversity analysis. Supported by UNDP, Committee members and staff have integrated gender and diversity analysis in the first three stages. This has been supported in a number of ways, including: Inquiry planning workshop with MPs and staff, including design of terms of reference and inclusive stakeholder mapping and engagement; Consideration of the barriers to participation faced by women, youth and marginalized groups, and development of strategies and mitigation actions to overcome these barriers; Planning and reviewing conduct of hearings in order to assess actual inclusion, and remedial actions to address any shortcomings. As the inquiry moves towards drafting a final report, the Committee and staff will be supported to integrate gender and diversity analysis in the report. It is expected therefore that the inquiry will feature full integration of gender and diversity analysis.
Indicator 1.1.6: The Hluttaw is on the verge of reaching Level 1. 
Indicator 1.1.7: Level 1 is almost achieved, with most constituency profiles for Rakhine State completed.

Indicator 1.2.1: 250 law officers trained on the rule of law and fair trial standards 
Indicator 1.2.2: 48% of men and women increased understanding on rule of law and access to justice.
Indicator 1.2.3: 2,137 women and girl beneficiaries: 2,002 women and girls benefiting from legal information such as trainings and awareness-raising sessions and counselling through consultations and hotline, and 135 women and girls represented in court
Indicator 1.2.4: 2 forum discussions on women&#x2019;s access to justice and addressing challenges around HLP and inheritance rights conducted
Indicator 1.2.5: 5 VTAs strengthened through training on land laws 

Indicator 1.3.1: Baseline data (March 2019) indicates the following: Only 31% of community members reported collaboration with other communities on any initiatives since 2012 20% of community members do not support cooperation with other communities
Indicator 1.3.2: Reported progress, based on the targeted stakeholders&#x2019; self-evaluation, is 46% to date
Indicator 1.3.3: 99% of LRF members report that LRF meetings are helping improve relations between different communities (March 2019 data)
Indicator 1.3.4: 3 lessons-learned cases (March 2020)

Indicator 1.4.1: 11,947 persons (total no. accessing facilities built by UNHCR through QIPs)
Indicator 1.4.2: 44% (723 households (approx. 3,615 individuals)) of 1,642 beneficiary households (approx. 8,210 individuals) reported increased household income</narrative>
