   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Rehabilitation Of Dar Al Consul Into Residential And Civic Complex</narrative>
  </title>
  <description>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project aims at strengthening theresilience ofPalestinians and protecting thePalestiniancultural and local identity in East Jerusalem.Specifically, the project isaddressing the problems of housing, thedisruption of the social structure, and the deteriorated living environment inside the Old City by improving the living conditions of a group of Palestinianfamilies, most of which are senior residents of limited to middle income. They have been living for long years inside the Old City and hold the memory of the place.The project will provide to the residents of the targeted historical complex
a better living environment through rehabilitation works and eliminating the risk factors resulting from
living in deteriorated buildings.The rehabilitation works will address various
aspects and stages of decay, such as structural instability, unsafe electrical and
dysfunctional mechanical installations, humidity, inadequate lighting and
access difficulties, especially for the elderly.In addition, the resident families will enjoy a
good provision of open space that accommodates private courtyards, domestic
gardens of indigenous Palestinian local character, social and seasonal events.Meanwhile, the historical character of the
complex and the houses will be preserved.The project also addresses the problems of lack of social and community services for youth ,lack of variety in the commercial and Palestinian touristic attractions and services inside the Old City. In response to this, the project entails the rehabilitation of a vacant
decayed and deserted space on the ground floor of the targeted historical complex.The space will be
converted into a new civic center that will act as a hub for a diverse range of
visitors and youth of both genders.The action will comprise a package of activities
and commercial uses that will be unique and will fill a gap in the services
offered inside the Old City, hence create an attractive hub for its residents
and visitors alike. Hereby, the project will capitalize on the strategic
location of the premises -being adjacent to one of the centrally located market
areas inside the Old City (Khan Alzait) in the Islamic Quarter- and the
historic character of the complex to promote Palestinian identity. Hence, it
will counter act Israeli policies that aim at weakening the Palestinian
identity inside the Old City.In addition, the project addresses the problems of youth social problem, and the high rates of school dropouts.The civic center will include youth knowledge and
career guidance facilities. It will provide them with a space that is equipped
with modern tools of communication, knowledge gaining and self-expression. It
will also provide youth development programs that are focused on career
development and education guidance.

The design of the civic centre and its functional program
will cater for creating a spatial setting that allows the Palestinian youth of
both genders, who suffer from isolation and limited development choices to enjoy an attractive atmosphere of social and
cultural diverse interactions through
the center activities . The interaction will be directed to focus on learning
from Palestinian entrepreneurs, accomplished young professionals, and the
centre operation staff and global visitors. In addition, the operation plan of
the centre will accommodate regular events that focus on youth
development. 

The project will build on the experience, existing programs
and networks of Al Quds University to establish and operate the above mentioned
development programs. The program will include education and career guidance
specialized training, in addition to exposure and links to regional and
international capacity building initiatives and job opportunities. This will
help youth graduating from Palestinian universities to overcome some of the
barriers that narrow their perspective towards education and reduces their
access to rewarding jobs. Students who live in the Old City will be given preferential consideration for benefiting from the above
mentioned opportunities andactivities.Aclosely related matter to the above mentioned problems, is youth weak access to employment and jobopportunities. In this regards, the projectis anchored around engaging Palestinian
youth, in particular Palestinian students and newly graduating students from
Al-Quds University, in various stages of the development process. This will
allow for a capacity building model that enables the selected youth to gain
hands on experience. This will help bridging the existing gab resulting from
the weak economic activity and limited private investment, which minimize
employment opportunities and weaken Palestinian access to job opportunities. UN-Habitat
and Al Quds University will coordinate the selection of suitable courses and
students to participate in the project. The selected students will be provided
with the necessary training to perform the required tasks. They will also be
provided with sufficient explanation and exposure to the development cycle. Youth
engagement is perceived to be achieved by two tracks. On the one hand students
will be engaged through course work, under guidance from their teachers and UN-Habitat
specialized expertise in the preparation of the operation plan and its required
market surveys and needs assessment. On the other hand, new graduating students
will actively engage in practical training on the operation activities of the
center, in a manner that qualifies them to be hired directly by the project as
part of its operation staff as fixed staff or interns. This will expose the
selected students to the operation cycle, help them understand the business
aspect of it, and gain experience by actual practice

Furthermore , the center will act as
an incubator for career development where a job placement program will be
created to keep feeding additional students or interns to work in the center,
replacing other interns or trainees who were hired in a previous cycle of the
job placement program. Hence, the
capacity building cycle can keep repeating itself. The existing interns will be supported by
aiming at linking them with relevant job opportunities in other places.The project will utilize the significant historic value of the complex through adopting a rehabilitation approach that does not compete with the historic value, rather it enhances it with a sensitive layer of rehabilitation that suites contemporary requirements and responds to the specific needs of the residents, users and visitors. This will result in the creation of a convenient living environment, while maintaining the resident&apos;s sense of identity and pride. These factors will strengthen the residents&apos; resilience to the distressed living conditions and the social and political factors that are pushing many residents to leave the Old City.The project will provide thematic services that
combine the local and historic identity with modern functions and
interpretations. The focus will be on providing services of commercial returns
and civic services to the youth of East Jerusalem, the Old City in particular.
The provided services will be integrated in terms of their character.The provided services will be integrated in terms of their
character.

The proposed solutions adopts a new development model that introduces principles of
eco-friendly and energy efficient models of rehabilitation in a challenging
historical setting. Aspects of natural ventilation and lighting, solar energy
introduction, natural and traditional landscape design and foliage will be
among the adopted concepts. It will also
aim at integrating historic preservation and cultural identity protection with
modern life needs. Interventions will not compete with the existing fabric;
they will rather be simple introductions that reflect functional needs and
space organization. Needs of the elderly will be among the functional
interventions to be considered. In addition, the open space design will cater
to women and children needs. On the
operational side, the same principles of eco friendly and eco-urbanity themes
will be adopted and enhanced among the Palestinian youth and young
professionals targeted by the project. For the targeted youth, equal
opportunities will be offered to both genders.</narrative>
