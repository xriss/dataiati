   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The
Disaster Management Training Program envisages a strategy on capacity
development through the Disaster Management Training Centre (DMTC) while
leading to safer and resilient communities in the country.Over the
years, recognizing the need for a national center of expertise and training,
added to the Government&apos;s vision of linking risk reduction in
development, the Myanmar Action Plan for DRR 2009-2015 (MAPDRR) identifies DMTC as a priority to provide
technical support to Ministries, Departments and other institutions at State/Region
and lower administrative levels and collaborate with ASEAN and other
institutions for research and development. The Government has sanctioned
establishment of DMTC in Ayeyarwaddy Region, in 2012, following a three-year
plan. It would require substantial support in drawing a vision to establish and
implement the objectives of DMTC, as DRR is an emerging area of expertise in
the country.The
DRR WG was formed in 2008, during the early recovery phase of cyclone Nargis,
and has grown into a diverse network of 54 agencies (UN, INGOs and LNGOs), in
Myanmar. In 2013, the DMTC&#x2013;Technical Working Group (DMTC-TWG) of DRR WG,
comprised of UNDP, UN-Habitat, SEEDS Asia, JICA and APDC, supported the
Ministry of Social Welfare, Relief and Resettlement in organizing an expert
level &#x2018;Consultation Workshop on Developing Capacity Building Strategy through
the Establishment of DMTC in Myanmar&apos;. Subsequently, the DMTC-TWG has been
supporting Relief and Resettlement Department in establishment of the DMTC as
part of DRR WG strategy. In response to the USAID-APS-OFDA-14-000004-Objective 1,
DMTC-TWG members, in discussion with DRR WG, formed a consortium by selecting
agencies through an inclusive and value based criteria. Subsequently, a
consortium led by UN-Habitat with ACTED, ADPC, American Red Cross (with Myanmar
Red Cross Society), SEEDS Asia, UNDP; Technical Partners- UNICEF, IOM, Handicap
International and HelpAge International and Local Partner- ASDA, has been
established. The core competencies of consortium, technical and local partners
would be collectively used to ensure a sustainable and inclusive program.














Consortium
members would bring in-kind contribution (possible staff/technical expertise)
and cost sharing would be explored. It would explore additional sources of
funding, especially for exchange programs and international trainings. An
inclusive approach would engage various departments of Government; Relief and
Resettlement, Social Welfare, Hydrology and Meteorology, General
Administration, Public Information, Education, among others. Linkages would be
established with professional bodies such as Myanmar Engineering Society,
Medical Association, Architects and other informal groups like Youth, Women&apos;s
and Religious Groups.














It
is envisaged that through the auspices of the program, a strategic relationship
with the Government would lead to development of long term vision,
identification of needs for DMTC pertinent human resources, curriculum
development, institutional linkages, that would sustain and develop a national
center of excellence.
















The capacity
development activities would strengthen stakeholder leadership and disaster management
knowledge at all levels. Since disaggregated population groups, are affected
differently by disasters, gender, age and impairment sensitive needs will be
inclusively accounted for. Dissemination,
through various channels, of the research findings will be part of the
communication strategy. 

UN-Habitat would be providing both knowledge and high-level policy advisory services.</narrative>
