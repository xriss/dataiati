   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Improving The Well-Being Of Host &amp; Refugee Population Through Enhanced Access To Social &amp; Basic Services In Beirut</narrative>
  </title>
  <description>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">At the level of the refugee response in the country, there is a need to shift to, and adopt medium and long-term response strategies and approaches. The revised Lebanon Crisis Response Plan (LCRP) launched on February 1, 2018, committing to move to longer term interventions across many sectors. Promoted by UN-Habitat since 2015, the Area-Based Approach was finally introduced in the LCRP as a mechanism for joint programming and implementation of activities in affected urban areas. The Area-Based Approach uses the space/geography as the entry point rather than a sector or a cohort. Cross-cutting assessments is one of the key features of the approach, followed by a formulation of multi-sector and multi-stakeholder response strategies complemented by capacity development of local authorities as well as active engagement of local communities.Moreover, the 2017 Vulnerability Assessment of Syrian Refugees (VASyR-2017) figures highlighted the vulnerability of Syrian refugee families settling in urban settings facing more challenges to secure basic needs. Another study on living conditions initiated by UNDP, to be published spring 2018, also indicates that while poverty levels in rural areas are relatively stable, those are expected to increase in urban areas.The 2 neighborhoods profiles of Tamlees and Sabra funded by UNICEF, and the 3 migration profiles funded by UN-Habitat HQ have provided a full picture on the critical situation in the poor neighborhoods of the City. The findings and follow-up actions of the NPs are being shared with the concerned municipality and partners.</narrative>
