  <description>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The purpose of the CBMSP is to create &#x201C;Self-Sustained Municipalities
capable of effective, efficient and accountable delivery of public services&#x201D;.
All the National Priority Programmes (NPP) incorporate three principal
approaches: 



1. Prioritized reform initiatives

2. Selected institution building

3. Improving and increasing direct services to the population



The CBMSP will be achieved, and is pursuing a three-pronged approach
with development interventions in the following fields: 



(i) Policy Support at National
Level to Independent Directorate for Local Governance (IDLG) to
incorporate lesson learnt (revenues, budgeting, community participation, and
service delivery) into operational instructions and manuals which can
facilitate the expansion of the CBMSP to other municipalities. For the Ministry
of Urban Development Affairs (MUDA) support is proposed in the field of
Strategic Municipal Action Planning and settlement upgrading and regularization
to let the Ministry take the role of enabler in assisting the Municipalities
and Communities to plan and manage urban development. Local Level support will be given to the Municipal Advisory Boards (MAB)
and Mayor how best to interact with communities and let communities (especially
women, youth and vulnerable groups) participate in decision making and apply
principles of good governance.



(ii) Organisational Development and Capacity Building of Municipalities
so that Local Governments can undertake revenue collection, budgeting,
planning, design and supervise the implementation of infrastructure projects
(including maintenance), conduct Monitoring and Evaluation of Municipal
activities and reporting. Organisational Development is basically applying good
management practices, how to get things done, while Capacity Building is
focussing on developing human resource development, equipping staff with the
understanding and skills and the access to information and knowledge to enable
them to perform effectively.



(iii) Service Delivery by Communities and Municipalities. To enhance the
trust between the citizens and local government and make that the project will
have concrete deliverables and also facilitate on-the-job learning process
Municipal level block grants will be made available and will be allocated when
approved by the steering committee. The projects at the community level will be
managed and monitored by community representatives with guidance and
consultation of the municipality, while the city level projects will be managed
and monitored by the municipality and MAB.</narrative>
