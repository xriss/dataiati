   <narrative xml:lang="EN">UN-Habitat is mandated by the United Nations General Assembly to promote socially and environmentally sustainable towns and cities and to help the urban poor with better opportunities and where everyone can live in dignity. Historically, UN-Habitat&#x2019;s programmes and projects have been designed to provide adequate shelter and living condition for all, particularly to those who are in poor and/or in emergency condition. UN-Habitat Sudan has been working on humanitarian, peace building and development assistance for the Government of Sudan under the coordination of Sudan United Nations Country Team (UNCT) and Humanitarian Coordination Team (HCT) to assist bridging humanitarian response and development support in line with the principle of Humanitarian, Peace Building and Development Nexus.Most of the humanitarian operations in Sudan aim to provide only short-term emergency support, which need to be followed by mid-term, more sustainable solutions that UN-Habitats can provide through its expertise on supporting shelter and living condition.In addition, UN-Habitat Sudan has comparative advantage to provide technical and substantive support on comprehensive and strategic planning and managing living condition through spatial planning including basic services and public facilities particularly vulnerable population.In line with UN-Habitat Strategic Plan 2014-2019, the project has a strong linkage to urban basic services as focus area 4 and will contribute to the implementation of policies for increasing equitable access to urban basic services and improving the standard of living of the urban poor. In addition, the project will achieve sustainable development and urban safety related to focus area 1 urban legislation, land and governance and focus area 2 urban planning and design. The project will also generate job opportunities and contribute to livelihoods that indirectly apply focus area 3 urban economy.Based on its experiences and technical expertise, UN-Habitat can support mitigating risk ofconflicts and to achieve better access to livelihood and employment opportunities among IDPs and the hosting communities in cooperation with other international agencies and local NGOs.Globally, UN-Habitat is mandated to lead implementation of SDG 11 &#x201C;Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable&#x201D; that are interlinked among the other SDGs; and the project will directly contribute to the achievement of SDG 11 in Sudan. The Government of Sudan has been working toward the implementation of the 2030 Agenda and the SDGs with considering the country&#x2019;s specific context and the project will also fully in line with the proposed strategic priorities of SDG in Sudan.In the past, UN-Habitat Sudan has experience of implementation of the projects funded by the Government of Japan including the project of Japan Supplementary Budget on &#x201C;Emergency Flood Response in Khartoum for Vulnerable Communities&#x201D; under the highly emergency circumstance. Currently, UN-Habitat has also been implementing the project on &#x201C;Support to Hosting Communities Affected by South Sudanese Refugees in White Nile State&#x201D; under the Japan Supplementary Budget FY 2017 in close coordination with the Government of Japan (Japan Embassy in Sudan).Through the implementation of the past projects funded by the Government of Japan, effectiveness and efficiency of &#x201C;self-helped&#x201D; and &#x201C;self-reliance&#x201D; approaches were broadly introduced and in Sudan that brought out of efforts not only the governments, but conflict/disaster affected people. In addition, Head of UN-Habitat Sudan Country Programme, a.i. who has experience on developing and implementing Japan&#x2019;s Supplementary Fund in Iraq and Sudan will manage the project and utilize the substantive knowledge, skills and communication required for the implementation of emergency projects funded by the Government of Japan.</narrative>
