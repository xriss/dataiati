   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Three decades of conflict, natural disasters and deteriorating economic conditions have caused a huge number of challenges for the people of Afghanistan. Many problems still persist, and stability and security in both urban and rural areas of Afghanistan have been threatened due to the growing insurgency. In addition, the lack of tangible development and the apparent absence of the Government leave people, especially the youth, without hope, creating a fertile ground for anti-governmental elements (AGE).One of the key lessons learnt by UN-Habitat in Afghanistan is that the AGEs do not infiltrate where communities are organized and empowered. Given the fact that the NSP supports the community to identify, plan, manage and monitor their own development projects through the promotion of good local governance, the NSP well works to empower rural communities to make decision affecting their own lives and livelihoods. Empowered rural communities collectively contribute to increased human security, and are inclusive, supporting entire communities including the poorest and vulnerable people.</narrative>
