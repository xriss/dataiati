   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Managing Cities In Asia- Ulaanbaatar Urban Renewal And Affordable Housing</narrative>
  </title>
  <description>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The city of Ulaanbaatar supported by ADB and together with
development partners
is planning a number of policy, technical and research initiatives to design and deliver on
the objectives of the Ulaanbaatar Master Plan and developmental programmes
under the CDIA. UN-Habitat will be ready to engage with technical and policy
support towards the delivery of the four overall objectives specified above;
and most immediately engage on the urgent need on affordable housing provision.

The Affordable Housing Challenge There are two main types of
housing in Ulaanbaatar, (i) fully serviced apartment buildings and
(ii)under serviced gers and individually built detached single-family
houses in ger areas (currentlyamounting to a total of approximately
200,000 households or 680,000 people). The affordable housing shortage is
getting worse as the cost of housing has been rising faster than average
incomes and is exacerbated by the lack of affordable financing solutions and
available land for development. Most newly constructed apartments are purchased
by high and upper middle income households using either their own funds, funds
from family members living abroad, and/or high interest mortgage loans (the low
interest rate mortgage subsidized by the GoM is still at 8% APR).

There are four distinct kinds of
affordable housing demand in Ulaanbaatar: firstly, the demand from ger area
residents who are keen to upgrade their living conditions, obtain access to
heating, running hot water, regular electricity, and indoor plumbing (this also
includes very low-income households living in risk-prone or unsanitary areas).
Second, the demand from young adults within urban households who wish to move
away from crowded multigenerational living conditions in order to buy or rent
affordable housing. Third, the demand from new migrants (around 35,000 persons
per year) from the countryside with very low incomes who now settle in areas
exposed to disaster risk or in the far periphery of UB; and fourth, the
elderly and other vulnerable population which require specific equipment.

Objective 1):support the MUB to
translate and consolidate the existing affordable housing strategy and urban
redevelopment plan into concrete and implementable investments and
institutional reforms with strong community engagement and clear financing
mechanisms,
