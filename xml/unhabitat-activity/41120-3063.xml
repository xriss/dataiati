  <description>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Thanks to their collective experience on CBDRR, on-going initiatives such as township disaster management planning and strong linkages with the DRR WG and RRD, the partners of MCCR are well positioned to advocate with the Government for greater institutionalization of CBDRR through the development, rollout and implementation of a national CBDRR policy, and to lead the standardization of tools and approaches that will support the implementation of a national programme in coordination with the DRR WG, MRCS and RRD.The focus of the consortium to date has been on ensuring that CBDRR processes are inclusive of all vulnerable groups, namely children, women, old people and people with disability. In the on-going project, the partners have developed and tested tools and approaches that support inclusive DRR processes and formalized it into a toolkit. The proposed action will be used to ensure that these tools and approaches are institutionalized and replicated at both national and sub-national levels by the DRR WG and whenever possible the Government to address the policy and practice gaps.The MCCR partners have worked towards standardizing risk assessment data collected at field level and will intensify and extend such efforts as part of the DRR WG. The partners have also contributed to developing risk information on earthquake and the processes used will be standardized and ownership transferred to the Government to ensure replication. This work will be extended together with an emphasis on hazard risk communication and the development of adequate awareness-raising strategies led by the Government and supported by the media.UN-Habitat as a Technical Partner of MCCR will be providing both knowledge services through building partnerships, specific capacity enhancement support and also under take policy advocacy on key issues directly with the concerned government agencies , MCCR Partners and the DRR WG.</narrative>
