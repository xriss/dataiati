   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Addressing The Land Information Requirements Of The Urban Poor - Phase 2: Scaling Up The Capacity Development Initiatives In The Use And Application Of The Social Tenure Domain Model (Stdm)</narrative>
  </title>
  <description>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The long-term objective is to address the land information requirements
of women and men living in slum communities and to build their capacity in the
use and application of the land information systems based on free and open
source software packages and in mainstreaming the thinking behind the continuum
of land rights in their community driven approaches like participatory
enumerations. This will form a basis for dialogue between local communities and
cities in negotiations for improving tenure security, inclusive planning and
enhancing access to basic services and infrastructure. 

The First Phase

The first phase of the project
has successfully pilot tested the
Social Tenure Domain Model in two informal settlements of the Municipality of
Mbale, Uganda and was integrated in the whole mapping and enumeration exercise
led by slum communities. The first phase was dovetailed to the existing project
initiative called Transforming the Settlements of the Urban Poor in Uganda (TSUPU)
by the Ministry of Lands, Housing and Urban Development (MoLHUD) of the
Government of Uganda as co-financed by Cities Alliance and partly being
implemented by Shack/Slum Dwellers International (SDI).



The first phase has also started the documentation of the process, the
dissemination of learning and experience and capacity building requirements
around its use and application. The previous project also conducted a training
of trainers on STDM use and application not only for Ugandan stakeholders but also
for other participants from other countries. The Project has also established a
regional learning center for STDM use and application which is intended for
future training activities and technical support. The pilot project was
highlighted in a Networking event on 04 September 2012 during the World Urban
Forum in Naples, Italy.

The Second Phase

 

Building from the
lessons and experiences from the Phase 1 project, UN-Habitat and SDI with other
key implementing partners, commit to implement a second phase. The second phase
will focus on scaling up the capacity development initiatives on the use and
application of Social Tenure Domain Model (STDM) in Uganda and in other select
cities/countries particularly in countries where existing GLTN and SDI partners
are operating and where similar programs like TSUPU (in Uganda) is being
implemented through the support of Cities Alliance and government.</narrative>
