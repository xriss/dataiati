   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Pursuing Sustainable Urban Development Through National Urban Policies, Regional &amp; Metropolitan Planning (Norway)</narrative>
  </title>
  <description>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The opportunities cities offer for human and economic
development can be tapped when appropriate planning initiatives are undertaken
to manage urban growth for the benefits of all residents. The project will therefore:



(a) Spearhead the development of a Global
framework (the International Guidelines on Urban and Territorial Planning) for
improving policies, plans and designs for more compact, socially inclusive,
better integrated and connected cities and territories that foster sustainable
urban development and are resilient to climate change. These aim at (i)
developing a universally applicable reference framework for national urban
policy reforms; (ii) capturing universal principles from national experiences
that could support the development of a diversity of planning approaches
adapted to different contexts and scales; (iii) complementing and linking other
international guidelines aiming at fostering sustainable urban development;
(iv) raising the urban and territorial dimensions in the development agendas of
national, provincial and local governments.



(b) Promote
the development and implementation of a new generation of national urban
policies (including regional and metropolitan planning strategies) for
sustainable urban development. The development of a national urban policy is
the key step for reasserting urban space and territoriality and for providing
the needed direction and course of action to support urban development. The
national urban policy provides an overarching coordinating framework to address
the most pressing issues related to rapid urban development, including slum
prevention and regularization, access to land, basic services and infrastructure,
urban legislation, delegation of authority to subnational and local
governments, financial flows, urban planning regulations, urban mobility and
urban energy requirements, as well as job creation. 



Approved at
the highest level, a national urban policy should provide the general framework
to orient public interventions in urban areas and be a reference for sectoral
ministries and service providers. It should also be the key reference for
legislative institutional reform. The National Urban Planning Policy is also a
good instrument for public and political awareness of the gains to be obtained
from sustainable urban development, as well as an opportunity to promote
consultation with urban stakeholders. 



Successful
national urban policies generally yield the following results: (a) the
identification of urban development priorities towards socially and
economically equitable and environmentally friendly urban and national
development; (b) guidance on the future development of the national urban system
and its spatial configuration concretized through National and Regional Spatial
Plans for Territorial Development; (c) better coordination and guidance of
actions by national actors, as well as lower levels of government in all
sectors; (d) increased and more coordinated private and public investments in
urban development and consequent improvement of cities productivity,
inclusiveness and environmental conditions. 



(c) Build
and harness capacity at metropolitan, regional, national and global levels, supported
by dedicated strategies and programmes, including human resources development,
tool development, organizational development and institutional strengthening to
achieve sustainable development. An ultimate form of impact at the normative
level will be achieved through supporting countries in developing their
national urban policies, as many countries lack these. UN-Habitat will engage
to influence through these processes, however, it is aware that, due to
government policy processes, achieving results at this level may take a longer.</narrative>
