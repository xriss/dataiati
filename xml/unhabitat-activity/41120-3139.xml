   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The purpose of the
project is to Increase awareness,
political interest and commitment towards repositioning &quot;Housing at the
Centre&quot; of national and city development strategies as well as on the key
role of housing in the New Urban Agenda for the 21st century.

Strategic result:
City, regional and national
authorities have implemented policies for increasing access to adequate housing
and improving the standard of living in existing slums.

Expected
Outcomes: Increased
commitment of national and local governments to work with UN-Habitat to develop
and adopt housing policies and strategies that include the principles of the
Global Housing Strategy (through advisory services provided to governments on
addressing the challenges of housing more holistically linked to economic
development, employment generation and poverty reduction policies, and through
promoting rights-based policies that are sustainable and more cost-effective in
terms of building technologies and materials).

The indicators of
the expected achievement are:

Main indicator:
Number of inclusive and right-based housing and slum upgrading policies,
strategies and programmes reviewed or formulated by national and local
governments in both developing and least developed countries (LDC).

Sub-indicator 1: Number of tools developed to support the
formulation, review and implementation of inclusive and right-based housing and
slum upgrading policies, strategies and programmes.

Sub-indicator 2: Number of South-south cooperation meetings
facilitated with a view to showcase and exchange innovative and affordable
housing and slum upgrading solutions.

The project specifically addresses capacity of
gaps of city, regional and national authorities to develop and implement
policies for increasing access to adequate housing and improving the standard
of living in existing slums. Therefore,
the project specifically addresses the lack of institutional and technical
capacity of national and local governments to formulate and implement policies,
strategies and programmes; low priority of housing in development agendas. The
proposed solutions create strengthened capacity and institutional frameworks;
housing integrated to development and national urban policies; the root causes
of problems are tackled; rights-based approach promoting the progressive
realization of the rights of women and
men, girls and boys in situations of vulnerability, and strengthened capacity
of right-holders. The project partners are national and local governments and
other Habitat Agenda partners.

Most importantly, the project aligns with
UN-Habitat&apos;s work programme and will be instrumental for achieving the expected
accomplishments of Focal Area 5, Housing and Slum Upgrading:


 
  
  1. Objective of the Organization: To improve access to
  sustainable adequate housing, improve the standard of living in slums and
  curb the growth of new slums in an inclusive manner
