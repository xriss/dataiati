   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Sustainable  Urban Reintergration  Of Displaced Populations In Blue Nile State</narrative>
  </title>
  <description>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project is designed to addresses gaps in the institutional and technical capacity of the State Ministry of Planning and Urban Development related to urban and regional planning, LHP rights, and land management; hence the project will focus on a number of these gaps;
&#xA7; Define a coherent and consensual regional plan which will orient the physical development strategies to be followed in Blue Nile state.
&#xA7; Refine the existing urban plans to accommodate the current and expected displacement patterns and IDPs urban re-integration needs;
&#xA7; Face the huge pressure and consequent demand for urban/serviced land, and mitigate/mediate potential land-related conflicts;
&#xA7; Propose affordable and efficient housing delivery mechanisms/strategies, which should be accompanied with sufficient provision of basic/social services/infrastructure.
&#xA7; Introduction of an environmentally friendly construction technology, SSB, hence reducing deforestation and minimising water consumption as it occurs with fire bricks
&#xA7; Identification and implementation of sustainable livelihood options through vocational and technical training for unemployed youth and design a mechanism to support creation of new small enterprises and entrepreneurs 
The people of the Blue Nile State in both urban and rural areas will benefit from this project, especially IDPs, returnees including young unemployed youth and women through the capacity building of the staff of the Ministry of Planning and Urban development on regional and urban planning and land administration, who will be capacitated to develop proper regional and urban plans which will guide special support decision on where to invest for reconstruction of the state in an attempt to provide basic services and create new livelihood sources. 

UN-Habitat has initiated consultation process with high officials of the Federal Ministry of Environment, Forestry and Physical Development, Sate Ministry of Planning and Urban Development and HAC to design the project and focus on the capacity gaps that were identified by the government planners and stakeholders. The project will also be discussed with UN agencies (UNHCR, UNAMID, UNDP and OCHA) and national and international NGOs partners, CBOs including Women Association and IDP leaders in the state.
HAC, UNHCR, international NGOs on the ground, Women Associations and IDP leaders and IDP women will effectively participate in the community based participatory planning, and on the-job training of Planners to ensure ownership of the developed plans and demarcation of plots.
UN-Habitat has already brought onboard a number of international and experts on Regional and Urban Planning, land conflict resolution and land management and special decision support systems to support the implementation of the similar ongoing project for Darfur Regional. Similarly UN-Habitat will continue working with those experts to apply similar methodology and approach for the Blue Nile Sate project.</narrative>
