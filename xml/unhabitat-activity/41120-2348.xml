   <narrative xml:lang="EN">A Partnership For Urban Planning In Africa - Un-Habitat &amp; Booyoung</narrative>
  </title>
  <description>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Stemming from the urban
development challenges exhaustively studied by UN-Habitat and its Regional
Office for Africa, the purpose of this project is to conceive and implement innovative
and demand-driven urban planning activities in Sub-Saharan African cities.
Under the general framework of Compact, Connected, Integrated and Inclusive
Cities (CCIIC), there is a need for cities that optimize demographic and economic
densities, privilege proximity among economic activities and people within a predominantly mixed
land-use pattern; cities that are socially diverse and multi-functional.
Densification and extension plans aim to expand available urban space, while increasing
residential and economic densities through the creation of compact communities,
the e guiding of new redevelopment to areas which are better suited for
urbanization, and the creation of sufficient public space to sustain urban
development in future, thus contributing to a more efficient and sustainable
development.

Despite the onus placed on the
urban planner&apos;s role, this project will allow UN-Habitat and its partners to
fully engage with local, regional and national government competences. Capacity
building should come with missions aiming at changes in organizational
structures, development of skills, streamlining of mandates and
responsibilities, as well as improvements in resource allocation. Insofar as
delivery processes are concerned, the different projects UN-Habitat aims to
propose will attempt to move away from the dominantly technical approach, and
disinhibit local initiatives and endogenous development. The critical
requirement is to revitalize local assets, engage with local stakeholders,
harness and deploy resources and potentialities among communities and
neighborhoods. Urban planning and spatial design will be brought forward with a
particular attention to the needs of the urban poor, a population that will
predictably be rising in Africa in the coming years. Closing the socioeconomic
urban divide is the key to the sustainability of African cities, which will
also come through meaningful and specific investments in slum upgrading
programs. 

This necessity for UN-Habitat to
interact with communities, develop locally adapted tools, and include
vernacular planning traditions will directly benefit target populations. In the
context of efficient planning for slum-prevention, the priority will be to
provide target populations with effective tools for a well-planned city.

The project will also catalyse
the establishment of a Global Urban Planning Facility that could follow a
similar approach, in response to the growing demand for sound planning support,
which stems from the success of the advocacy and awareness work of UN-Habitat.
This facility will build on the normative and pilot work of other Programmes
(ASUD and Urban Planning for Sustainable Development) in terms of tools and
approaches, as well as networks of expertise, and respond to a diversity of
needs in urban planning stemming from cities and countries (through this
project) and from other development partners.</narrative>
