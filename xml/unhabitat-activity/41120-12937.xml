  </title>
  <description>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">UN-Habitat, in collaboration with Minurvi10 and the Regional Economic
 Commission (Cepal) elaborated the Regional Action Plan for the 
implementation of the New Urban Agenda in Latin America and the 
Caribbean11 - PAR.  This document states that the region&apos;s main 
challenge is to improve urban living conditions and reduce intra-urban 
inequalities. The first principle and strategic results stated in this 
document is the eradication of urban poverty, discrimination and 
socio-spatial segregation. This alignment sustains the central relevance
 of this project within the regional context.  At the national 
level, the Brazilian UNDAF12 for 2017-2021 is structured according to 
the 5 P&#x2019;s (People, Planet, Prosperity, Peace and Partnership) of the 
2030 Agenda and is aligned with the federal pluriannual plan - PPA13 of 
the Brazilian government for 2016-2019. Both UNDAF and PPA put a strong 
emphasis on the gender and the ethno-racial dimensions of the 2030 
Agenda in the promotion of social inclusion.  The UNDAF 
strategically adopts the strengthening of the institutions and the 
promotion of human rights, especially of gender and race equality. As, 
additionally, violence affects unequally vulnerable populations, public 
security and institutional racism are also a central dimension of this 
document. The persistent spatial inequalities are referred to as a 
challenge to be tackled by the UN System in Brazil. Adaptation to this 
diversity of realities is necessary. The UNDAF calls for an appropriate 
results evaluation and support to the decision-making process based on 
evidence. The overall objective is to have a learning process that lies 
on lessons learnt towards a greater sustainability.  The 
first axis of the UNDAF is People: inclusive societies, equitative and 
with full rights for all. This project is directly aligned and 
contributes to the first outcome of this axis: &#x201C;strengthened social 
development throughout the territory, with the reduction of poverty, 
oriented by the access to quality public goods and services, especially 
in the areas of education, health, social assistance, food and 
nutritional security, decent work, with equity focusing on gender, race,
 ethnicity and generational equality&#x201D; (translated from Portuguese). The
 PPA establishes seven guidelines, the two initial ones being: 
&#x201C;Sustainable development oriented by social inclusion&#x201D; and &#x201C;the 
continuous improvement of the public services quality&#x201D;. The objectives 
of this project tackles exactly those priorities. In the city of 
Maric&#xE1;, the Municipal Institute of Information and research Darcy 
Ribeiro - IDR has been created, among others, with the following 
mandate: &#x201C;Organize and provide data and indicators that are key for an 
inclusive and sustainable socioeconomic municipal development as well as
 to conduct studies and projects aimed at supporting the development of 
public policies for the Municipality&#x201D; 14. The IDR sought the support of UN-Habitat to implement the &#x201C;Sustainable Urban and Social Prosperity&#x201D; project, building on: ? UN-Habitat&#x2019;s international mandate and expertise to promote socially, economically and environmentally sustainable cities; ? the historical and fruitful partnership with the city of Rio de Janeiro (same Metropolitan Region); ?
 the previous Rio+Social Program experience in more than 200 favelas in 
Rio, which demonstrated the technical and operational capacity of the 
Regional Office.  UN-Habitat&#x2019;s global mandate gives 
special attention to slum upgrading, providing adequate basic services 
and making cities inclusive. The Agency supports municipal institutions 
in addressing the challenges of poverty and spatial segregation linking 
consistent data collection and monitoring and urban planning mechanisms.</narrative>
