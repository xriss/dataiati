  <description>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">To
understand the limits and challenges of Viet Nam&#x2019;s current social housing
policies/ systems by analysing the housing conditions of the target beneficiary
groups (low-income households and industrial workers), and by examining the
accessibility aspects of social housing. The project must fit into a context
where the urban authorities pain to structure its development in terms of social
housing. This is partly due to the catch-up effect of Vietnamese cities related
to demographic dynamism and industrialization development which took shape
especially through the creation of industrial park in suburban spaces as the
one in Bach Ninh.

Vietnam has
experienced an exponential growth in cities since the 1990s. The population of
cities has risen from 20% of the total population in 1990 to 35% in 2017 and
trends are not expected to reverse in the short to medium term. The population
of Hanoi today is estimated at 7.8 million inhabitants, when it was 2.6 million
in 1999. In 2050 the urban population will have to be about 55% of the total
Vietnamese population. At the last World Bank census in 2014, the proportion of
urban population living in slums was 27.2%. The massive influx of migrants to
the country&#x2019;s main cities has led to population congestion and a rise of the
informal settlements rate in all its forms, in a context where the housing
supply was not able to meet the growing demand. The agglomeration effect also
leads to higher house prices, aggrieving the difficulties that lower incomes,
near poor and poor encounter in housing accessibility.  

Social
housing development by the government has reached only 33% of the targets they
set for 2020, it means 81.700 apartments built. For example, in Hanoi the estimated
demand is 110.000 social housing, because of the lack of land planning by
localities, the difficulties of the state in financing the credit institutions
and offset interest rates, and the lack data concerning the beneficiary groups.
This reflects the need for the government to strengthen the policy framework concerning
social housing, and to develop criteria more adapted to social, economic and
urban realities. Thus, the project will identify the current status of social
housing in Viet Nam and the conditions of eligibility for access to social
housing with research about urban low income and industrial workers.

The project
therefore intends to integrate national strategies as well as international
development principles such as the Sustainable development goals. The mandate
of UN Habitat is based on the implementation and principles of Goal 11 &#xAB;
Sustainable Cities and Communities &#xBB; which are the following:

&#xB7;
Ensure
access for all to adequate, safe and affordable housing and basic services and
upgrade slums

&#xB7;
Enhance
inclusive and sustainable urbanization and capacity for participatory,
integrated and sustainable human settlement planning and management

UN Habitat
task and the project in which the program integrates will also have to meet the
principles developed in goal 10 &#xAB; Reduced inequalities &#xBB; as:

&#xB7;
Ensure
equal opportunity and reduce inequalities of outcome, including by eliminating
discriminatory laws, policies and practices and promoting appropriate
legislation, policies and action in this regard

&#xB7;
Adopt
policies, especially fiscal, wage and social protection policies, and
progressively achieve greater equality

In short
term, UN Habitat research will contribute to project on social housing on
particular KOICA social housing project and it also intends to develop
research, policy consultation and capacity building to build vision and goals
of social housing policies of Viet Nam but also amendments to improve social
housing policies. In long term it will support the establishment of strategy
for 2021-2030 Viet Nam Social Housing Development programme, its implementation
Policies and Regulations. Thus this project would contribute to the improvement
of the national strategy and policy for social housing.</narrative>
