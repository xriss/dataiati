   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project intends to achieve a total synchronisation of priorities of UNAMID and the UNCT. It follows the spirit of the transition concept included in the recent mandate of UNAMID that UNAMID and UNCT should work on shared priorities in order to make a successful transition reality. The proposal paves the way for a sustainable handling of inter-communal violence in East, North, South and West Darfur. The project follows a lesson learned from the previous UN joint rule of law programme that was too ambitious to raise sustainable funding, as it is now exclusively focused on preserving and sustaining peacekeeping gains achieved throughout the years through stabilization-related outputs. It is also expected that a successful implementation of the project will attract more sustainable donor funding, as especially through the inclusion of UNAMID human resources for SLFs, quick delivery can be guaranteed.The choice of UN-Habitat as implementing partner for this project needs to be understood in the framework of the SLF concept. UNAMID staff will be collocated with UN-Habitat colleagues and SLFs will be carried out under the lead of the UN-Habitat. This means the concept entails that all activities for which programmatic funding for SLFs is sought will be implemented under UNCT lead (but certainly in fully implementing UNAMID&#x2019;s mandate). UN-Habitat will be entrusted with the implementation of infrastructure projects. The agency has comparative advantages with respect to their experience and track records in handling construction/refurbishments for institutions that handle land disputes. UN-Habitat has well-established and tested procurement rules and procedures. Again, the SLF concept does not foresee any capacity of UNAMID to oversee and manage these projects as mission support functions will be focused on the Jebel Marra area. In this context, the comparative advantages of UN-Habitat un managing capacity building activities needs to be understood as well. UN-Habitat has a track record in providing logistical and financial support to capacity building. UNAMID staff in the framework of SLFs will provide technical expertise needed.</narrative>
