  <description>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The
purpose of the project is to develop the capacity of &#x2018;Wuhan Land Use and Spatial
Planning Research Center&apos; (WLSP) to apply the CPI as a tool for measurement,
monitoring, evaluation and decision-making on sustainable urbanization, in
particular in relation to applications of land use and spatial planning.



The project addresses the problem on how can
the city Wuhan maintain prosperity and quality of life, without negatively
affecting other areas of development. How can it ensure that the policies and
planning guidelines currently being applied by the planning authorities are
reaching their objectives.



For this reason, the city of Wuhan no longer has the option of making
decisions without the benefit of internationally validated data and indices
that measure results and impacts. This enables them to decide which policies to
implement, where to allocate public and private resources, how to identify
setbacks and opportunities and how to measure what has changed. The CPI is a
helpful tool in all these decision-making processes.

Through this Project, WLSP with the assistance of and in full
partnership with UN-Habitat shall develop its capacity to apply the CPI as a
tool for measurement, monitoring, evaluation and decision-making on sustainable
urbanization, in particular in relation to applications of land use and spatial
planning. The geographic focus of the current Project is Wuhan City and its
districts, with comparisons to other global cities to be added as viable within
the scope of the current Project. 





Target Population.



The target is the city of Wuhan as a whole
(with all its residents), and the WLSP in particular.





Strategy to solve
the problem



The City Prosperity Initiative is a practical
framework for the formulation, implementation, and monitoring of sustainability
policies and practices to increase prosperity levels in the city of Wuhan at
metropolitan and district level.It provides collaborative solutions to
the most fundamental challenges facing cities.Wuhan is expected to work
simultaneously in the six dimensions of prosperity: productivity,
infrastructure, quality of life, equity environmental sustainability and urban
governance.



By implementing
the CPI, WLSP and the city of Wuhan will benefit in the following ways:



a. Using a
global comparable platform that allows for local adaptation

The CPI has not been designed as a rigid
blueprint. It is a living framework that provides room for local and national
governments to integrate contextual needs according to existing challenges and
opportunities. This flexible approach enables the CPI to play a double
function. First, it serves as a platform for global comparability in which
cities can assess their situation and compare themselves with other cities in
the world (basic CPI). Comparisons can also be done by regions or specific
dimensions of prosperity. Second, the CPI works as a strategic policy tool,
where data and information is adapted to local or contextual needs and used to
measure progress, formulate specific policies and track changes (extended CPI).


b.
Working with a framework that
promotes policy integration 

The CPI has been designed to capture in an
integrated framework the different dimensions of sustainable development &#x2013;
environmental, social and economic &#x2013; adding to them other critical dimensions
related to the quality of life of citizens and the governance mechanisms.
Cities and countries that aim to improve productivity or enhance infrastructure
development can better assess some of the intended or unintended consequences
of these actions upon the other dimensions of prosperity, for example with
regards to equity or environmental sustainability. The interrelation of
policies and actions is well-captured by the CPI that provides strong
statistical information to measure impacts and results and to infer the
likelihood of possible development outcomes.


c.
Integrating spatial analysis as
part of a strategy to leave no one behind

The CPI framework provides a wealth of new
analytical tools based on spatial data.
Various indicators such as street connectivity, public space,
agglomeration economies and public transport are measured using satellite
imagery. This helps to better understand the spatial distribution of these
indicators to increase value judgment and support decision-making. The use of spatial data is based on the
premise that the form and structure of the city can conspire against shared
prosperity or act together to boost it.
Sprawl, low density development, poor economies of agglomeration,
inefficient land use and insufficient provision of public space can affect city
growth and development. CPI framework produces accurate, reliable, timely and
spatially disaggregated data that combined with socio-economic indicators
addresses the challenge of &#x2018;invisibility&apos; and &#x2018;inequality&apos; of the most
underrepresented groups and urban areas. 

d.
Combining multi-scale
decision-making from intra-urban level to metropolitan analysis

The
CPI has been designed to support multi-scale decision-making ranging from
metropolitan, to provincial authorities, to city and sub-city local
governments, when information and data allows disaggregating at this local
neighborhood level. It provides adequate information to make evidence-based
decisions from a territorial perspective with the participation of different
tiers of government. It also facilitates better institutional coordination and
the possibility to articulate policy and sectoral interventions in a metro and
city-wide perspective, while allowing for the identification of national and
regional urbanization trends. Working in this coordinated and integrated manner
reinforces the principle of active subsidiary and collaboration.</narrative>
