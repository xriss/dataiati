   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Building Climate And Disaster Resilience Capacities Of Vulnerable Small Towns In Lao Pdr</narrative>
  </title>
  <description>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The
proposed project originated as a request from the government of Lao PDR,
articulated through MoNRE, for further support based on the ongoing
implementation of the Enhancing the Climate and Disaster Resilience of Rural
and Emerging Human Settlements in Southern Lao PDR project, funded by the
Adaptation Fund and implemented by UN-Habitat. In particular, the government of
Lao PDR and UN-Habitat propose to build on the innovations of the first project
to bring additional resilience benefits to other settlements in climate-vulnerable
areas.

The
project takes a long-term view on developing climate resilient infrastructure
that will build climate and disaster resilience in two towns in
southern-central Lao PDR. To this end, soft measures including community development
support, urban planning and knowledge management are integrated with hard
measures wherein physical infrastructure will be constructed in line with the
specific needs identified in the vulnerability assessment of each town.

the
target towns have high levels of vulnerability due to their exposure to floods,
droughts, and storms and resultant water and vector borne disease. This,
combined with high levels of poverty, rapid urbanisation, almost no access to
basic services, particularly continuous, clean water supply, limited knowledge
of how climate change interplays with these issues, high numbers of indigenous
people, and gender inequality. These factors combine to give a low adaptive
capacity. The construction of infrastructure which is resilient to floods, droughts,
landslides and storms will enable the target communities to have continued
access to basic services, thereby mitigating the negative impacts from climate
change and disaster events.

Based
on the findings from previously conducted consultations and vulnerability
assessments a menu of physical infrastructure interventions was presented.
Authorities and communities were unanimous in their prioritising of water
treatment plants in the two towns, an action which aligns strongly with
government policy. It is proposed, therefore, to construct a water treatment
plant in each of the two towns to serve the surrounding communities.

At
present, people in the two towns source their water primarily from open river
sources or self-dug wells and boreholes. As a result, they are
not guaranteed water year-round, and the quality of water they use is often
poor because of turbidity and other forms of contamination. Women, who are
often responsible for collecting and managing water, can be required to travel
further to collect water during the dry season, where open water sources are
presently used. Water treatment is therefore an adaptation action because it
will increase the ability of people to access clean water year-round, and the
treatment plants will be designed to offer continued functionality despite
storms, floods and droughts. When water is supplied directly to homes, it
specifically benefits women who are often required to collect water from
distant water sources. 

In
alignment with the political structure in Lao PDR, capacity building will take
place from the national level to the community level. At the national level,
there is a need to increase capacity in planning for and implementing climate
change adaptation actions in sectors outside the Ministry of Natural Resources
and Environment (MoNRE) and integrate climate change planning into sectoral
policies and plans. This then needs to be carried to provincial, district and
community levels. It is important that all levels of government are in alignment
with goals relating to climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction so
that adaptation actions are understood and funded. Capacity building will be
carried out by national and provincial authorities at a district level and they
will also oversee workshops at a community level. The two targeted sectors will
be public works and urban planning.

Inclusivity
is a key factor in the project. 27,649 of the project&#x2019;s 57,144 beneficiaries &#x2013;
almost 50% - are indigenous people, and 53.5% of beneficiaries are women.
Amongst some ethnic groups, women are particularly marginalised and so it is
important that representation of groups is inclusive of women and other
marginalised groups such as the elderly, youth or the disabled.
Quasi-governmental institutions such as the Lao National Front for
Construction, the Lao Women&#x2019;s Union and the Lao Youth Union all have
representatives at the village level and these representatives will be actively
engaged in the project.</narrative>
