   <narrative xml:lang="EN">UN-Habitat
has worked with the issue of public space for 15 years or more. However, at the
23rd Governing Council of UN-Habitat in 2011, United Nations Member States
asked UN-Habitat to place a larger focus on public space and how it can
contribute to sustainable urban development (Resolution 23/4 on Sustainable
Urban Development through Access to Public Spaces). Specifically, UN-Habitat is
mandated:

To advance the agenda on place-making and
     public spaces in a way that will consolidate local and international
     approaches to creating inclusive cities, enhance the knowledge of
     UN-Habitat partners and local authorities of place-making, public spaces
     and the quality of urban life, and facilitate and implement exchange,
     cooperation and research between partners working in this fieldTo develop a policy approach on the role
     that public spaces can play in meeting the challenges of our rapidly urbanizing
     world, to disseminate that policy and its results widely and to develop a
     plan for ensuring its application internationally;To assist in coordinating UN-Habitat partners in
disseminating knowledge to existing sustainable urban development processes at
all government levels.Globally,
the growing attention to
public space informed the 23rd Session of the Governing Council of
The United Nations Human Settlements Programme (UN-Habitat) in 2011, where
member states mandated UN-Habitat to consolidate agency-wide work on public
space, to develop and promote public space policy, coordination, disseminate
knowledge and directly assist cities in public space initiatives.[1]


Against this
backdrop, UN-Habitat established in 2012, a Global Programme on Public Space
now working in 30 cities. The world secretariat of the United Cities and Local
Governments (UCLG) has created a Strategic Planning Committee chaired by the
cities of Porto Alegre and Durban with a strategic focus on global advocacy,
establishing regional networks of cities working on public space, supporting
learning exchanges, tool development and documenting good practices in
partnership with UN-Habitat. The Italian Institute of Urbanism (INU) has been
instrumental in developing the Charter on Public Space as well as hosting the
public space biennale.

Another great
milestone which has been achieved is the adoption of the 2016-2030 Sustainable
Development Goals which adopted a Goal 11 &#x2018;Build cities and human settlements
inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable.&#x2019; One of the proposed targets set
out is &#x201C;by 2030, provide universal access to safe, inclusive and accessible,
green and public spaces, particularly for women and children, older persons and
persons with disabilities&#x201D;.

The adoption of
the SDG 11.7 by the General Assembly in September 2015, constituted the most
significant attention ever to public space in the global policy arena. However, continued support for SDG 11,
and in particular public space Target 11.7, will be even more important to
ensure adequate means of implementation and a sound monitoring framework that
will be necessary to catalyse action on public space as a contribution to
sustainable cities and human settlements. This will require that cities invest
in public space and in the spirit of the new urban agenda cities and local
governments should take an integrated, trans-disciplinary approach by working
in partnership with a range of stakeholders and organizations, including civil
society, academia and the private sector to ensure inclusive, safe and
accessible public spaces for all.

In 2013-15, the Future of
Places (FoP) initiative significantly contributed to raising awareness around
the public space agenda on a global level. The FoP is a multi-stakeholder
initiative which was established by Ax:son Johnson Foundation, UN-Habitat and
Project for Public Spaces (PPS) bringing together a large and diverse network
of stakeholders around the issues of public space through a series of annual
conferences (2013 in Stockholm, 2014 in Buenos Aires and 2015 in Stockholm
again). The Future of Places gathered leading global thinkers, academia,
decision-makers, practitioners, other UN Agencies, media, communities and
private sector that subscribe to the transformative power that good quality
public spaces can have in a city. All together the network represents about
1,500 individuals from 700 organisations, from 275 cities, across 100 countries. The success of this initiative has shown the
commitment of a wide range of actors with a stake in public space, as well as
highlighted the global importance of this theme. In a short time it has created
a global movement for public space (10.000 followers on twitter) contributing
actively to highlighting its benefits and putting it on the global development
agenda.UN-Habitat has worked in
the area of public space for over 15 years. However, at the 23rd Governing
Council of UN-Habitat in 2011, United Nations Member States asked UN-Habitat to
place a larger focus on public space and how it can contribute to sustainable
urban development. Specifically, UN-Habitat is mandated: 



a) To advance the agenda on
place-making and public spaces in a way that will consolidate local and
international approaches to creating inclusive cities, enhance the knowledge of
UN-Habitat partners and local authorities of place-making, public spaces and
the quality of urban life, and facilitate and implement exchange, cooperation
and research between partners working in this field; 



b) To develop a policy
approach on the role that public spaces can play in meeting the challenges of
our rapidly urbanizing world, to
disseminate that policy and its results widely and to develop a plan for
ensuring its application internationally;

c) To assist in coordinating
UN-Habitat partners in disseminating knowledge to existing sustainable
urban development processes at all
government levels.

The project is
also aligned with the UN-Habitat Strategic Plan 2014-2019 and specifically to Sub-programme
2: urban planning and design and expected
accomplishment 2: integrated and
participatory urban plans and public space for compact, inclusive and
connected cities.

For example, the project links with the
following UN-Habitat interventions:

&#xB7;
Urban
Basic Services: Sustainable Urban Transport in East African Cities (SUSTRAN)
Programme

&#xB7;
Participatory
Slum Upgrading Programme (PSUP) 

&#xB7;
Municipal
Spatial Support Programme (MuSPP)

&#xB7;
The
Safer Cities Programme

UN
Habitat is also a knowledge leader in the public space arena, developing tools
and guidelines as well as contributing to global thinking through the Habitat
III issue papers, policy units, amongst others. Moreover, UN-Habitat has commenced several partnerships on the global
but also on the regional level focusing on issues related to public space. Therefore, UN-Habitat is perfectly
placed to take advantage of the opportunities presented by SDG11.7 on public
space and continue working on public space for the next four years.</narrative>
