   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Urban Income Inequalities In Latin American And Caribbean Cities</narrative>
  </title>
  <description>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Over the last few decades, the world has witnessed an increase in income inequalities. Regionally, Africa and Latin America have the highest levels of inequality, with many countries and cities experiencing widening disparities between the rich and the poor.Income inequalities have a clear influence in social and economic development and empirical evidence suggests that violence and crime in cities are directly influenced or finked to higher levels of inequality&apos;. Extreme inequalities have historically been less tolerated by societies. Often, it is not the actual degree of inequality that matters, but rather perceptions of it. When people perceive inequalities to be the result of unfair processes and unequal distribution of opportunities, they are less likely to accept them than if inequalities are perceived to be the result of differences in individual effort. These perceptions often create conditions in which social unrest or conflict can as gross inequalities are associated with unjust systems that perpetuate poverty, hamper upward mobility and exclude the majority. Quite often it is not inequalities per se that fuel conflict, but rising expectations. Individuals and groups are more likely to engage in violence or generate social unrest if they perceive a gap between what they have and what they believe they deserveInequalities have also a dampening effect on economic efficiency: they raise the cost of redistribution and affect the allocation of investments, while also creating an unfavorable environment for economic growth and development. Income inequalities impact education and health care outcomes and reduce economic opportunities. In some cases, extreme inequalities can create social and political fractures within society that have the potential to increase social unrest or develop into full-blown conflicts, which discourage investment and induce greater government spending on non-productive sectors, both of which impact economic growth.he SWCR 2012 will be the sixth publication of its kind, with the main theme: The Prosperity of Cities. A major justification for this report is based on the fact cities are crucial to how national economies in both developed and developing countries succeed. Urban areas by their unique characteristics offer significant opportunities for the creation of prosperity, which in turn can be used for national development and poverty reduction. Realizing the potential gains of urbanization will however depend on how well urban growth is managed and planned for, and the extent to which the benefits accruing from urbanization are equitably distributed.The SWCR 2012 will analyze the prosperity of cities from a multidimensional perspective, including: productivity; infrastructure and physical assets; the quality of life and social progress; equity and social inclusion; and sustainability.This project focuses on the aspect of Equity that can be defined as an inclusive city that reduces poverty and inequality by ensuring the distribution and redistribution of the benefits of development by protecting the rights of the poor, minorities and vulnerable groups, enhancing gender equality, and ensuring civic participation by all in the social, political and cultural spheres.The project builds on the work already started in 2008, when UN-Habitat for the first-time produced data on income inequalities at the city level. This new data was published in the State of the World&apos;s Cities Report 2008 with a global sample of 94 cities from 47 countries; and with 68 countries with national urban data using the GINI Coefficient. For the 2010 SWCR UN-Habitat expanded the dataset to include city level data for 1 19 cities in 61 both developed and developing countries and with national level data for 72 countries based on updated data.UN-Habitat is the only Agency that has produced this type of data and information with a global perspective and this study showed very clearly that inequalities in Latin America and the Caribbean Region are the highest in the world. After publishing the datasets, many countries and cities in the LAC region have shown interest to address this critical issue of inequalities, pointing out that lack of available and accurate data and knowledge prevent them from making informed decisions. This project proposal intends to address this historic gapTo study urban inequalities further in selected cities of the Latin American and the Caribbean region, The Latin American Development Bank (CAF) and UN-Habitat have signed a Memorandum of Understanding in December 2011. The intent of this collaborative project is to update the Gini indices, expanding the sample to a larger number of cities in Latin America and the Caribbean and if possible to include longitudinal analysis of trends development in recent years. These data and the correlation analysis will shed light on how best to address inequalities and the factors that generate and reproduce these inequalities and assist in finding appropriate solutions in terms of policies, programs and projects for the Latin American and Caribbean region. They will further be used for the State of the World&apos;s Cities Report 201 2 and for a publication of its own</narrative>
