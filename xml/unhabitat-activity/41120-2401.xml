   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The purpose of the KSP Phase 2 is to contribute to improving living conditions and well-being of Kabul citizens through strengthening local governance and settlement upgrading with community empowerment, improvement of infrastructure and services and support for the local government.By building capacity of municipal structure and its staff in engineering, community mobilization, and in increasing transparency and accountability of finance and administration, UN-Habitat enables the Kabul Municipality to be responsive in the future to have access to national development funds to be transferred from national to local governments to deliver and manage development projects in a technically effective and efficient manner applying principles of good governance. 

Throughout the KSP Phase 2, UN-Habitat will assist in strengthening the Kabul Municipality and in encouraging community members to get involved and financially and physically contribute to the implementation process of service delivery. UN-Habitat will also support the representation of community groups in the government&apos;s decision making at all levels such as Neighbourhood Development Councils (NDC), Gozar Assemblies and in the future to the Municipal Council. 

UN-Habitat will, in addition, enable the Kabul Municipality to be responsive in the future to have access to national development funds to be transferred from national to local governments to deliver and manage development projects in a technically effective and efficient manner applying principles of good governance. It aims at building capacity of municipal structure and its staff in engineering, community mobilization, and in increasing transparency and accountability of finance and administration.</narrative>
