   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The
project is designed to contribute to the achievement of the long-term goal of
the health and nutrition recovery strategy for Darfur; &#x201C;Progressively
restructure the health and nutrition arena, now a patchwork of disparate
elements that emerged in response to multiple stressors, into a coherent,
effective, efficient and equitable service delivery system.&#x201D; The identified gaps and deficiencies are significant
and addressing them constitutes a giant endeavor. Taking into account the limiting factors such as poor
implementation capacity fo the stkeholders, and hostile environment (insecurity and unpredictable
instability), a sequenced/three-pronged health nutrition recovery strategy for
Darfur has been endorsed by the MOH and DRA.



The
project is in line with many measures included into the first
prong health recovery strategy. Maximizing the outputs of existing health and
nutrition services by filling gaps, upgrading assets, expanding services,
boosting productivity, and improving quality of health services is the overall
objective of proposed project. And thus meeting the basic human rights of the community. 



The
focus will be on infrastructure rehabilitation, as well as functional upgrading
of health facilities with the heaviest workload and closer to vulnerable,
conflict affected population settlements. 

The selected site is the one where the needs are the
highest, the implementation will positively impact on the largest number of
vulnerable people, there is safe access to enable the implementation,
supervision and monitoring, and they are included into the Darfur health
recovery plan (Government commitment). The planned interventions for the
achievement of the project goal include: 1. Quality health services and facilities accessed by
approximately 25,000 people in the Northern Darfur State, specifically Kutum Locality.2.Basic maternal and child health care services
enhanced in Northern Darfur state through training midwives to reduce maternal
and infant mortality and improve postnatal care</narrative>
