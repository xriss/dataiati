   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Achieving Sustainable Reduction Of Risks Through Consolidation Of Multi-Hazards Architectural Drr Solutions And Physical Planning In Madagascar, Malawi And Mozambique. (Iom Funding)</narrative>
  </title>
  <description>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The purpose of the project is to
     consolidate multi-hazard DRR Architectural and Urban Risk Reduction
     practices in Madagascar, Malawi and Mozambique for Communities and Cities
     to learn how to live with the hazards, in order to address the following
     problems:



-
Problem 1. Community
Infrastructure remains highly vulnerable and emergency preparedness is uneven Communities and their assets (Schools, Housing, Basic
Infrastructure) remain vulnerable to Cyclones, Floods, Droughts and
potentially Earthquakes



Response to Problem 1: Technical Assistance will be provided to consolidate the
know-how acquired in one decade of Architectural/Engineering DRR to Local
Communities; implementing NGOs ; National institutions (i.e. Ministries of
Public Works, Land, Housing and all those in charge of infrastructure as
Education, to build and reconstruct better); the UN/OIs and Red Cross. In
Mozambique TA should be continued to NGOs and UN, to MOPH (Public Works) and
MINED (Education). In Madagascar, depending on the demand from NGOs and
CPGU/BNGRC. In Malawi, DoDMA has requested TA, and large donors are interested
in expanding the approach. In line with the lessons-learnt in DIPECHO III,
laboratories/fields for experiences and training on DRR construction should be
established in Mozambique and Madagascar to train Local Communities and
Constructors, Disaster Management Technicians and Engineers; and students of
Architecture and Engineering. This will serve to disseminate practices with a
long-term impact on how to build more resistant infrastructures and plan safer
settlements. This was requested by Local Authorities, Communities and Ministry
in Madagascar and the Faculty of Architecture and Physical Planning of Mondlane
University in Mozambique and the MOPH. It is in line with both National DRR/DRM
strategies of the intervention countries and sectoral policies (Education,
Infrastructure) and is key to replicate over the long-term the improved
construction measures. This can be also done in cooperation with the DIMSUR,
the Technical Centre funded by GFDRR and initiated by DIPECHO II, as a
long-term strategy for DRR. TA will include the coordination of the Shelter
Cluster (UN-Habitat Mozambique with Red Cross) and Camp Management in Malawi if
relevant (UN-Habitat) to mainstream the practices of improved construction,
adequate emergency shelter, and building back 



-
Problem 2. A strategic approach
is lacking to engage Institutions in adopting DRR policies for built
environment



Response to Problem 2: On the one hand, existing norms and improved construction
measures must be disseminated through on-the-job training of technicians,
constructors and members of communities, for a durable and large impact. This
must be done with both DRR/DRM platforms (INGC, BNGRC, DoDMA) and Sectors
(Ministry of Public Works and Housing and Ministry of Education). This should
consolidate the work done in Madagascar and Mozambique to assess and improve
Building Codes, Building Urban Regulations and Norms as requested by the
Ministry of Public Works and Housing in Mozambique and Malawi. On the other
hand, where non-existing, National and Local Authorities must be supported to
and approve DRR construction practices, to be introduced over the long-term in
the Public and Private construction sector, i.e. National Policies. In
particular, in Malawi the Minister of Land and Housing, in charge of
Infrastructure, requested UNHabitat to assist in the assessment of School
Safety, replicating the experience of UN-Habitat DIPECHO III and GFDRR in
Mozambique. In Mozambique the work delivered by UN-Habitat and National
Partners until now, will require fine-tuning. In fact, as proven through
DIPECHO III and the DIMSUR (Technical Centre for Urban Resilience and Disaster
Risk), Governments have been sensitized to the need to take into account local
practices into policy action, but still need support to transform
best-practices into policies.



-
Problem 3. Cities lack basic capacities for DRR/M,
whereas risks are increasing



Response to Problem 3. Preparedness, prevention and response capacities of
disaster-prone Cities must be enhanced through multisectorial activities
(Governance, Physical Planning, Basic Services, Finance among others). All
cities targeted should increase their awareness of risks related to spatial,
physical, infrastructure issues and adopt vulnerability maps and plans. In
selected cities (at least 2) a full-fledged action-plan for Urban Risk
Reduction, including preparedness and contingency planning, should be
developed. This must be achieved through on-the-job trainings using the
methodology developed in DIPECHO III and the new Tool being prepared by
UN-Habitat. City-to-city trainings and exchange should be also promoted, for
Cities with more experience to share practices with the others. Importantly,
trainings should also target 1) National Disaster Management Institutes, 2)
National Ministries, 3) technical and humanitarian partners on how to act in
Urban Settings for Preventing, Preparing and Responding to Natural Disasters as,
often, there is limited understanding of the role and functioning of the
Municipality or Town Administration. DoDMA has requested the support of
UN-Habitat to fill this gap, and so has CPGU and BNGRC in Madagascar. In
Mozambique, UN-Habitat will continue supporting the MOPH, MICOA and MINED to
include DRR into urban settings, along with the Municipalities</narrative>
