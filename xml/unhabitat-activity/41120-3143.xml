   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Supporting The Palestinians Right To Development In East Jerusalem</narrative>
  </title>
  <description>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The prolonged Israeli occupation
to East Jerusalem has impacted every aspect of the Palestinians peoples&apos; lives
in the city and caused a fragmentation in the urban and social structure of the
Palestinian communities. The Palestinian neighborhoods of East Jerusalem are
trapped in a perpetual state of planning without building. The planning
institutions invest great resources in drawing up master plans and outline
plans in the Palestinian neighborhoods of East Jerusalem, but these plans
contain myriad stipulations that render the plans realizable, thus
alleviating neither the housing shortage nor the miserable physical condition
of the neighborhoods.

The proposed project responds to
the needs of the Palestinian communities in East Jerusalem by supporting their
&apos;right to development&apos; under the current imposed restrictions by the Israeli
planning authorities through supporting the communities in developing pragmatic
planning solutions that address their needs and priorities. Such approach is
based on strengthening and empowering the communities through providing
planning support on the basis of which practical planning solutions are
advanced and concrete opportunities for immediate development are identified
within existing plans. The preparation and approval of new outline plans that
meet the residents&apos; needs is a long-term process with a prohibitive cost, therefore,
the proposed intervention will focus on conducting an in depth analysis to two
neighborhood in order to understand the physical and socio-economic conditions
of these neighbourhoods, be able to identify the community&apos;s needs and
aspirations for future development, and explore means for providing land for
public uses in the selected neighborhoods, without harming the interests of the
local landowners. In addition, this approach will exploit opportunities that
exist within the selected neighborhoods to negotiate with the Israeli
authorities the construction of new schools and classrooms, mother-and-baby
clinics, playgrounds and paved roads, among other. Planning principles will be
developed jointly with the community, these principles will form the general
planning framework in the selected neighborhoods, and will set the foundations
for the long statutory planning process. Initiating the planning process in the
selected neighborhoods will help in alleviating the chronic shortage of such
infrastructure and services and will lead to a more cohesive community that is
empowered to plan its neighborhood. The proposed action prepares the ground
for better planning solutions that are endorsed by the community and negotiated
with the planning authorities.

In addition, this proposal
responds to an immediate need to have a safe and inclusive public space that is
accessible for women and children. Currently in Jerusalem there are only nine
playgrounds that serve more than 370,000 inhabitants compared to an average on
one playground per 1,000 residents in the city&apos;s Jewish neighborhoods.
Implementing small tangible interventions in the Palestinian neighborhoods can
enhance the living environment of the Palestinian citizens, compliment the
lengthy and draining planning efforts, and gain community trust in the
alternative planning initiatives. 

In
East Jerusalem, planning decisions are driven by the political agenda of the
Israeli authorities, and they do not necessary address the Palestinian
communities&apos; needs. Therefore, advocacy is needed to highlight the existing urban
challenges, advocate for more planning and building rights for
Palestinians in East Jerusalem, and call
for more pragmatic work in view of inducing concrete changes on the ground that
will help to improve the life of Palestinian communities.</narrative>
