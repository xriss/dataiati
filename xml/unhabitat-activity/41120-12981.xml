  </title>
  <description>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In their 2017 Systematic Country Diagnostic, the World Bank argues
that &#x201C;The massive assistance to Iraq provided by the international community
has shown that financial and technical resources are not sufficient, on their
own, to achieve positive results in the absence of security and adequate
governance. They may even be counter-productive or may postpone the resolution
of underlying constraints by facilitating existing dysfunction. What is needed
are interventions aimed at restoring the legitimacy of the state and building
inclusive institutions.&#x201D;[1]

The proposed Action identifies the following priority areas for support: 

1.
Decentralise basic services

Given the
role that geographical inequities, structural poverty and failure to deliver
quality services played as a driver for the cycle of conflict in Iraq, access
to basic social services is among the priorities as set by the UN Recovery and
Resilience Programme (RRP). Support is needed at both central and local level
to decentralise service delivery, ensuring that institutional and management
gaps at the local level are plugged in and that services are informed by local
needs, efficiently provided and accountable to communities. This will increase
the Governorates&#x2019; capacity, as well as improve the public perceptions about
them as an interface to local communities, and it will potentially help build
trust among communities in the local authorities. Governorates have proven to
be a key entry point for change and reform due to their close interaction with
local communities.

The
devolution of powers has not been adequately coupled with the necessary legislative,
administrative and financial decentralisation measures. Attributing powers and
responsibilities to Governorates &#x2013; by transferring more than 800 processes and
functions from Ministries to Governorates &#x2013; has faced both the resentment of
central Ministries and the lack of local capacity to assume devolved functions.
So far, only 3 Ministries have fully transferred functions and budgets to the
Governorates. The Ministry of Construction, Housing, Municipalities (MoMCH) is
the most advanced in this process. The transfer of responsibilities (including
the 5 directorates of Municipalities, Water, Sewerage, Urban Planning and
Planning and Follow up) to their General Directorates at Governorate level,
completed with an order issued in Jan 2018, shows the Government&#x2019;s firm
intention to progressively continue the decentralisation process. 

In the
current economic context and political climate, it has become crucial for the
central government to enhance fiscal and decision-making capacity and
management at the local level, yet the progress
achieved in the realm of political decentralisation has not been matched with
institutional and fiscal decentralisation. To this day, local authorities
are dependent upon central government sectoral allocations. Formal mechanisms and
structures are lacking for more localised demands for services and other
concerns. Governorates are poorly motivated to collect local revenue that goes
directly to the central budget and is not retained at the Governorate level for
local needs. Most of the investment budget is allocated at sectoral level
through line ministries and their branches in the Governorates, while less
resources and capacities are devoted to those local sectoral departments in
charge of local development under the Governor. 

At the same
time, the devolution of significant functions will increase the pressures on governorate officials to improve service
delivery and eliminate the possibility of placing blame on the lack of
authority over services. This will be more directly apparent where the quality
and quantity of services may vary significantly by district.[2] 

While
legislative actions have forced the devolution of some service delivery
functions, there has been limited attention to the institutional and fiscal
decisions required to achieve successful devolution, as well as to the capacity
of the Governorates to absorb and manage staff, resources and responsibilities
many times greater than they currently possess.[3]
Also, although the Governorates have experience in developing provincial
strategies, investment plans and projects, devolution will require planning and
investment budget planning for entire service delivery functions, not just
individual projects. The experience of Governorates is still weak in
current/routine budget preparation and oversight for technical services
delivery, including operation and maintenance, tracking and reporting
requirements. 

Finally,
neither discretionary controls over expenditures nor revenues is an apparent
feature of the devolution process in Iraq. As the World Bank has pointed out in
its in-depth assessment of sub-national service delivery conducted in 2016[4]:

&#xB7;
If the discretion to make changes across and within devolved functions
is not authorised, then only the authority to administer, but not to manage
centrally-determined service delivery quality and quantity levels has been
devolved;

&#xB7;
If revenues previously associated with devolved functions transfer to
the governorate level, but are still allocated at the central level, the
Governorates will not be able to change or manage priorities more appropriately
to meet citizen demands and needs;

&#xB7;
Recurrent budgetary allocations for serving local populations are driven
by ministerial priorities and population numbers and are negotiated as a component
of the annual budget process. Transfers for investment spending are driven by
specific project approval; 

&#xB7;
There are no systematically designed vertical or horizontal equalising
transfers, and no service or project transfers intended to efficiently alter
prices or create proper economic incentives;

&#xB7;
Iraq has not yet developed a framework and process for intergovernmental
transfers that will allow for the Governorates to make discretionary choices
about the quality and quantity of services in keeping with citizens&#x2019;
preferences, as well as to develop own-source revenues without being penalised
with reductions in federal budget allocations or transfers.

The World
Bank also concurs that from a national perspective, Governorate own-source
revenue is inconsequential. However, if Governorates are provided authority
over the revenues derived from self-funding services (user charges, service
fees and so forth based on services delivered) of the devolved functions of the
ministries, this subnational revenue profile will change significantly.[5]

2.
Boost economic growth and job creation through the implementation of
strategic local actions

As
recognised in NDP 2018-2022, GoI has failed to equitably and sustainably
exploit national resources to reduce poverty and ensure shared prosperity.
Economic decision-making today is dominated by short-term needs. The government
is prioritising the rapid expansion of oil production in order to finance a
bloated public sector and current spending needs &#x2013; mainly wages &#x2013; that are
detached from any long-term diversification strategy. The complexities of an
oil-dominated budget have made the Iraqi economy extremely vulnerable to a
sudden decline in oil prices, as has been evident since 2014. The public sector
dominates the economy by being the largest formal employer in the country. This
has prevented the emergence of a vibrant private sector and the associated job
creation necessary for enhancing the welfare of all Iraqis. Neither the state
nor the weak and stagnant private sector are capable of generating significant
employment opportunities for the tens of thousands of young Iraqis who swell
the ranks of the unemployed each year. 

Seizing the
momentum generated by the Provincial Development Plans developed under
LADP II, the Action will identify and pilot local development projects that
will translate the policy documents into practice. In this way, the Action will
create an enabling environment for SMEs, generate job opportunities, as well as
build local capacity to manage and implement sustainable projects.

3.
Enhance local revenue generation

Budgeting
and revenue collection reflect the legacies of a centralist governance
tradition, revealed in the management approaches to policy, planning, budgeting
and execution; they are also affected by a range of systemic inefficiencies and
unsustainable subsidies. Current local revenues are negligible compared to
citizen needs for services and typical resources from the state budget and
investment have been seriously affected by the recent conflict and the economic
crisis. 

The diagnostics conducted to during LADP II on local
finance and revenue generation in 4 pilot towns of southern Iraq have shown
that the rent of public real estates, mostly for commercial activities, along
with the sales of land for housing construction, constitute a second major
source of revenue (ca. 1/3rd of the total). Aside from being unsustainable, these revenues
appear anyway in decline in many cases, making the preferred resource of the
municipalities (i.e. the renting of municipal premises for commercial
activities) very vulnerable to economic fluctuations. Otherwise, there
is a major issue concerning the records of property rights, including those of
municipalities; many had been lost during the war, and the recent efforts to
rebuild these records are insufficient. The various fees collected by
municipalities (licenses, publicity, etc.) are weak, totalling around 5% of
total revenues. Here and for other items, there is an issue concerning the
multiple exemptions. The remaining revenues come from waste management and
pavements. They only reach around 3% of the total, while waste management
constitutes the principal public service that the municipalities manage, with
real costs significantly exceeding revenues. There are issues concerning the legal
framework for these &#x201C;local taxes&#x201D;, their amounts, their indirect collection
through the water authorities and the absence of proper records on cities&#x2019;
residents and businesses.

The new NDP
recognises that the deterioration of the investment climate has resulted in the
expansion of informal economic activities that evade government control and
taxation. Furthermore, issues such as the legal framework for &#x201C;local taxes&#x201D; and
the absence of proper records on cities&#x2019; inhabitants require immediate
attention in order to rebuild the country&apos;s potential for self-reliance.

4.
Support urban recovery and development of Mosul and smaller cities and
towns affected by the conflict with IS

According
to GoI&#x2019;s Damage and Needs Assessment of Affected
Governorates,[6] more than 138 000 houses have been damaged or
destroyed during the recent conflict with IS. In some communities, properties
have been damaged or destroyed in retaliation, after the fighters left, for
their perceived support to IS. Low-income housing has experienced the bulk of
the damage, at 68%, indicating that the conflict has severely impacted the
low-income population of Iraq, worsening an already fragile situation. 

Damage to housing is one of the main obstacles to the return of
IDPs. Support to resolve the housing crisis in liberated areas is an urgent
need &#x2013; not only for IDPs who wish to return but also for host communities who
have been bearing the heavy burden of hosting massive numbers of IDPs for more
than three years. Government counterparts and community members have repeatedly
expressed that while support is appreciated to people whose houses have
sustained minor and major damage, the needs are critical of those whose houses
have been &#x201C;severely damaged&#x201D; (i.e. which have sustained significant structural
damage and require extensive repairs) and &#x201C;destroyed&#x201D; (i.e. which have suffered
structural damages so major that rehabilitation is not feasible). 

Satellite
assessment conducted by MoP and UN-Habitat in Jan 2018 suggests that the
distribution of housing damage between the governorates is approximately as
follows: Nineveh &#x2013; 65%, Anbar &#x2013; 20%, Salah al-Din &#x2013; 10%, and Diyala, Baghdad
and Kirkuk &#x2013; 5%. The Housing Damage and Rehabilitation Database,
operated by UN-Habitat and Shelter Cluster Iraq, helps to map completed, on-going and planned housing rehabilitation projects[7] and to identify gaps in housing
rehabilitation projects in governorates such as Salah al-Din.

The current
situation in Mosul and post-conflict governorates in general is very dynamic.
Thanks to the concerted reconstruction efforts undertaken by GoI, agencies and
donors, over 3.8 million IDPs have returned to their areas of origin; still,
over two million people remain displaced.[8]
The main deterrents of return are: lack of sufficient services, limited
livelihood opportunities, and damaged/destroyed/stolen property. The main
reasons to return are perceived improvement in security, desire to return to
own land/property and to work again.[9]

Local
authorities are in urgent need to rebuild secondary infrastructure, housing,
public facilities, amenities and livelihoods vital for the healing of
communities affected by violence and physical destruction. The recovery of
communities affected by the displacement crisis is one of the key strategic
objective of the new NDP, along with good governance. Indeed, stronger
governance systems are now crucially needed in the Governorates affected by the
conflict &#x2013; to make the most of scarce resources and to ensure that
reconstruction efforts are implemented in a transformative manner. 

In the context of competing and
urgent reconstruction needs and identified criticalities from the point of view
of national reconciliation and peacebuilding (2nd priority &#x201C;axis&#x201D; of GoI&#x2019;s General Framework of the National Plan for Reconstruction and
Development), it appears important
to ensure that reconstruction efforts do not further contribute to the
polarisation of growth, impoverishment of &#x2018;backwater&#x2019; districts and
disenfranchisement of youth and minorities living in or returning to the
destroyed rural areas.

Needs
and assistance are being closely monitored by UN-Habitat through the Reconstruction, Recovery and Resilience (RRR) Platform established at MoP,
which will provide a clear indication of the geographical gaps by the time of
the inception of the Action. Local authorities require further support not only to improve building
standards and upgrade infrastructure with disaster resilient construction
technologies, but also in order to concretely address economic revitalisation,
enhanced resilience and improved quality of life of citizens &#x2013; particularly the
most vulnerable. Repairs and rehabilitation of shelter
contributes to the process of durable return, in which highly vulnerable
families are supported to reside in minimum shelter conditions, whilst they
re-establish their lives in areas affected by conflict and avoid secondary
displacement.[10]

On
Housing Land and Property (HLP) issues, to maximise impact and
avoid community tensions, beneficiaries of emergency repairs will prove
ownership of the house and not have a second house. Verification of proof of
ownership is an essential action required before starting technical assessment.
As many families lack such official documentation, alternative forms of
verification of proof of ownership may include electricity bills, previous
house acquisition contract, combined with letter from the local
authorities/leaders/mukhtar. Specific assistance will be offered to
female-headed households to obtain proof of ownership and securing property
rights where they might be in peril. The need to address issues relating to
identity documentation, HLP rights is recognised by the EU as crucial to ensure
successful longer-term stabilisation.[11]

5. Promote sustainable development and decrease consumption of
non-renewable resources

Particular
attention needs to be devoted on promoting sustainable development and
rationalising consumption of non-renewable resources with a focus on water and
electricity. Despite the fact that Iraq is facing serious deficits of water and
electricity, consumption of both is one of the highest in the region. This is
due to inefficiencies of outdated infrastructure and technologies, high
governmental subsidies, as well as lack of a system for charging users for
actual consumption. The over reliance on large private fuel generators to make
up for the frequent power cuts affects both people&#x2019;s health and the
environment. Rationalising electricity consumption, reduction of CO2 emissions
and enhancing the private sector&#x2019;s role in managing energy production and
distribution are among the NDP 2018-2022 Sectoral Development objectives
on Energy. 

More
advanced and efficient technology is required especially in the provinces,
where consumption is rarely measured, to reduce inefficiencies, improve the
transparency of billing and enhance revenues. Seizing the momentum generated by
the SEAPs and PDPs developed under LADP II, Action will identify and pilot
local green projects. In this way, the Action will create an enabling
environment for energy saving and efficiency, renewable energy sources,
optimised used of natural and financial resources, protection of environment
and climate mitigation measures.

6.
CSO participation in local development policies

Civil society in Iraq faces numerous challenges, including persistent
security threats that severely impede its capacities and role. Consequently,
the performance and impact of CSOs tend to be limited and marginalised. CSOs
generally have poor institutional and financial capacities, lack effective networks
among them and provide inadequate reporting on their own activities.
