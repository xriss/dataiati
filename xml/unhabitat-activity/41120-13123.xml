   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Socialist Republic of Vietnam, considered among the most
vulnerable countries in the world to the impacts of climate change. Vietnam
also is one of the parties to the UNFCCC who immediately ratified the Paris
Agreement in 2016 and submitted its NDC to the Convention. In its (intended)
NDC crafted in 2015 and which is currently being reviewed, the government has targeted
for an economy-wide GHG emissions reduction of 8% by 2030 as compared to
business as usual when using domestic funds, and up to 25% if with
international support. In 2016, the government issued the Plan for
Implementation of the Paris Agreement (PIPA) that specifies 68 specific tasks
expected to ensure achievement of the country&#x2019;s NDC, which stands as its
contribution to the global climate agreement whilst fully recognizing the
national priorities and circumstances. Considering the importance of
multi-level climate governance, the PIPA strategically outlined the tasks and
responsibilities for sectors as well as the localities that include provinces
and cities.

Vietnam cities and urban centers are crucial in achieving the
national and global targets for climate change. The efforts at the sub-national
level would be pivotal to ensure resilient and low-emission development in
Vietnam noting that urban population is expected to grow from the current 35%
to 50% in 2045 and foreseeing a sustained economic growth which has averaged to
about 7% annually over the last two decades. Climate actions in Vietnam cities
are crucial since (1) an approximate 75% of the urban population in Vietnam are
living in low-elevation coastal zones, and (2) the changing lifestyle and
carbon-intensive energy mix may increase the GHG emission per capita of 3.5
tones CO2e to ten-fold consistent to the projected 10 times GDP growth rate
increase from 2010-2050.

UN-Habitat
has been partnering with national government agencies such as Ministry of
Natural Resources and Environment and cities across the country to promote
climate resilience interventions both at policy level and programmes that are
with more tangible results at the ground.


In short
term, UN Habitat actions under this will contribute to Vietnam cities and the
government on developing their Climate Action Plans (CAPs) consistent with the national policies
and issuances in line with globally accepted reporting standards and framework
that is promoted by GCOM.</narrative>
