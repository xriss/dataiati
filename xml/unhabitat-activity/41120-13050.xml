  </title>
  <description>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">UN-Habitat is mandated by the UN General Assembly to promote socially and environmentally
sustainable towns and cities. It is the focal point for all urbanization and human settlement matters
within the UN system. Globally, UN-Habitat promotes community-based reconstruction in crisisaffected countries, implementing projects in places such as Afghanistan, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Iraq.
Engaging community members themselves in reconstruction activities, this community-based approach
will empower them socially and economically, enabling them to plan and manage their own activities
for more peaceful and stable community.
In Iraq, as soon as the liberated areas were declared safe, UN-Habitat has been promoting urban
recovery and supporting returnees through community-based housing rehabilitation. UN-Habitat
ensures that community members are capacitated and employed to undertake the rehabilitation of wardamaged houses, thereby creating job opportunities and supporting their livelihoods, as well as
encouraging them to engage in the rebuilding of their community. UN-Habitat engineers are constantly
engaged on site, conducting the field assessments and selecting the contractors, supervising the
rehabilitation activities and running the final inspection before the hand-over of the rehabilitated houses.
Their constant presence ensures the high quality of the work conducted. Throughout the process, the
community members were provided by necessary construction and rehabilitation skills through tailored
capacity building sessions. This approach will thereby empower the community members both socially

and economically, increase community ownership, and encourage targeted communities to solve their
problems independently, which is the key to peaceful recovery and resilience. UN-Habitat&#x2019;s substantive
experience on working closely with government counterparts and community members to support
reconstruction and rehabilitation of housing and infrastructure in areas that are liberated as well as
hosting refugees and IDPs gives UN-Habitat a comparative advantage and technical expertise to plan
and implement this project.</narrative>
