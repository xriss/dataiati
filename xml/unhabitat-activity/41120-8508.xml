   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Strengthening Of Urban Control As A Tool To Prevent And Mitigate Emerging Conflicts In Cities And Human Settlements Of Colombia</narrative>
  </title>
  <description>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the
historic international recognition that all human beings have fundamental
rights and freedoms, recognizes that &#x201C;&#x2026; it is essential [&#x2026;], that human rights
should be protected by the rule of law&#x2026;&#x201D;. The rule of law is the principle of
governance in which all persons, institutions and entities, public and private,
including the State itself, are accountable to laws that are publicly
promulgated, equally enforced and independently adjudicated, and which are
consistent with international human rights norms and standards.

In the Colombian context, the main capital cities
face great challenges derived from the accelerated urban growth. Phenomena such
as social inequality, the unsustainable management of natural resources, the
gaps in the development of the territories, and the insecurity of urban
environmentspose for the cities the challenge of promoting a better quality of
life for the inhabitants of the region. The current state of informality in Colombian
cities creates a difficult control over urbanized areas growth as a result of
inadequate, inappropriate or ineffective policies or legal frameworks, that
regulate activities based on assumptions regarding the socio-economic
environment that do not reflect realities on the ground.

Under this framework, UN-Habitat has as one of its
thematic axes, support capacity building of local and national governments and
other Habitat Agenda partners to implement urban legislation in the areas of
urban extension, densification, urban planning and finance

Central issue addressed

The lack of control in the application of current
legislation, due to limited capabilities and available financial resources and
technical tools, is an important limitation in the building of sustainable
human settlements. The result is the creation and keeping of informality in
urban areas.

The number of innovative, locally relevant urban law
frameworks in fields such as physical planning and development control remains
remarkably low, particularly in the context of the needs of human settlements
with limited institutional structures and financial resources.

Urban law remains a highly segmented and complex
field, where technical objectives in given fields are considered in isolation
from each other as well as from the institutional, financial and social factors
that will determine effectiveness. It is a key factor that should be taken into
account when legislating. 

Physical planning, development control and
investment are all closely linked to law and policy and the extent to which
rights may be exercised independently and regulated in the public interest. To
have a greater control over the implementation of these laws and polices is key
to work against Informality, which is common in the Colombian context.



There is increasing recognition of the plural nature
of urban legal frameworks and of the role of these pluralistic systems in
promoting inclusion and opportunity for the most vulnerable. Legal and
regulatory frameworks are designed for the formal economy and, too often, they
fail to protect, support and recognize the contributions of informal workers,
excluding them instead of including them within frameworks of rights and
responsibilities.

The need to explicitly recognize a range of
empowering tools in law and to link these with institutional structures and
policy objectives is of fundamental importance. In order to avoid that laws,
institutions, and policies governing economic, social, and political affairs
deny a large part of society the chance to participate on equal terms. It is
important to note that informality does not means that there is no system,
merely that what does exist is not formally recognized. Informal local norms
and institutions, including those of a traditional or customary nature, govern
lives and livelihoods.

Most people with low incomes do not live under the
shelter of the law and the opportunities it affords. Because the poor lack
recognized rights, they are vulnerable to abuse. More than 4bn people around
the world are estimated to be excluded from the rule of law, many because their
homes and livelihoods are informal.

The control that the rule of law has over the
ordering, functioning and planning of urban areas, which creates a framework
for the protection of human rights in human settlements, as previously stated,
is a key step towards more resilient and sustainable cities and communities.
Actively working to prevent and mitigate emerging conflicts in cities and human
settlements of Colombia.



Recognition
that a focus on the development of tools for the control of essential law will
provide the most effective support to sustainable urban development.
Governments should identify the minimum set of instruments and tools to deliver
the most important elements of a legal framework with an emphasis on the needs
of small to medium settlements with limited institutional structures and
financial resources. For these resource poor small to medium settlements,
priority must be placed on the principal urban design elements that can
reasonably be achieved and that will have the maximum impact on social outcomes
and livelihoods. Rights and the protection of vulnerable groups must be central
to assessments of impact. Urban law governs the key functions of towns and
cities and reflects the rights and responsibilities of the residents and users
of these urban areas. Effectiveness is the ultimate pursuit and the ultimate
criterion of quality in law making, and control tools are enablers of good
functioning in cities and human settlements.</narrative>
