   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Project For Emergency Support To Poor And Vulnerable Communities In Ethnic Areas</narrative>
  </title>
  <description>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The proposed project focuses on
empowering communities to ensure they will jointly work to build/renovate
quality services (WASH and community infrastructure), and housing (affected by
the 2015 floods), to give them basis for healthy and productive life. The
project is framed within the overall objective of helping Myanmar&apos;s ethnic poor
and vulnerable communities to address the emergency needs to restore their
normal life and to sustainably improve quality of life. 

Empowering communities
means making sure that the voice of the community is being heard, and that the
interests of all community members, without any difference, are being
represented. Access to affordable, suitable and sustainable WASH services and
community infrastructure, as well housing for most vulnerable households which
subsistence is meager and livelihoods stretchily provides them food, is needed
in order to improve living conditions, hence the project&apos;s outputs aim at increasing the capacity of community
to a better understanding of how to identify, prioritize, materialize and
manage their WASH and community infrastructure facilities, and allocate housing
to the right beneficiaries. The project has two components where activities will be designed through community consultations and community
action planning with significant beneficiary inputs. Community driven actions
will contribute significantly to promote social cohesion, build confidence and
take the path towards sustainable improved living conditions. Furthermore it
will allow women and youth to take part in community action planning where
their needs are addressed.

Component one: This component will focus on
providing support through WASH and community infrastructure
construction/upgrading across 200 villages in 4 townships of Chin Sate (Tedim,
Falam, Hakha and Thantlang). Furthermore, it is
anticipated that the project will be focused on creating immediate access to
safe drinking water and adequate sanitation, rehabilitation of access roads and
infrastructure required for immediate recovery of basic services and living
conditions in areas that have been affected by the 2015 floods within project
targeted locations. 

Component two: The project proposes to support estimated 300 most
vulnerable families that were affected by the flood, they will receive support
to build 240 new houses and to upgrade 60 others (approximately 1,800
beneficiaries). Housing is a
multi-faceted need that can be adapted to meet the priority rehabilitation and
development needs of the affected families. Selection of villages will be
carried out in consultation with the Recovery Coordination Committee of the
government based on the level of damage occurred by the floods. The beneficiary
selection will be based on community based selection criteria which will be developed
with wider stakeholder consultation to ensure most needy families are
benefited. 

It is very important to highlight
that the project would face considerable challenges due to geographic location
of targeted villages and access to. Chin State&apos;s poor accessibility and
mountainous terrain will indeed be a factor to hinder smooth implementation,
based on previous experiences many villages are only accessible on foot,
therefore construction materials and others necessary for the project need to
be carried on shoulders. 

Overall, the project is structured alongside 4 expected
accomplishments: 

&#xA7;
Connectivity restored
and condition improved of basic infrastructure in affected rural communities
and regained access to market, health and educational facilities (EA1)

&#xA7;
Increased access to safe drinking water and reduced
incidence of water borne diseases among affected communities; increased access
to adequate sanitation and promoted good hygiene practices (EA2)

&#xA7; 
Most vulnerable
households affected by recent floods rebuilt/upgrade their dilapidated houses
where safety and living conditions of mainly women and children are improved
with better housing conditions, and ensured land tenure rights (EA3)

&#xA7;
Capacity building will
impact in the process of community development as well in ensuring that
communities will fully engage with future improvement activities for their
communities; capacity building will also provide better job opportunities (EA4)

Four townships of Chin State have
been selected as the project coverage area - Tedim, Falam, Hakha and Thantlang
&#x2013; 50 villages in each township (total 200 villages). The project will establish
fours township offices for easy access to targeted villages. The project aims
at reaching estimated 108,043 people;
90,036 as direct beneficiaries and 18,007 indirect beneficiaries from
surrounding villages; UN-Habitat experience in community-driven projects has
demonstrated people from areas surrounding target villages as well benefit from
support provided.</narrative>
