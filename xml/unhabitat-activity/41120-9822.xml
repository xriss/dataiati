   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Inclusive Development Programme In Northern Kosovo/Support To Municipality Of Vushtrri</narrative>
  </title>
  <description>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This programme
was initiated in
directresponse to a joint request to UN-Habitat by the Ministry of
Environment and Spatial Planning (MESP) and the Ministry of Local Government
Administration (MLGA) to extend ad hoc planning and governance
mechanismsin the north of Kosovo with a focus on building the capacity of
municipal institutions and staff, guiding rational investments based on
strategic development planning, and ultimately improving living conditions for
citizens.The request came in recognition of UN-Habitat&apos;s expertise in the
field of spatial and urban planning, and its long engagement as a trusted
international partner in municipal institution and capacity building in Kosovo,
related established support mechanisms (including in non-majority
municipalities and within relevant ministries) as well as the initial and
promising results of engagement with northern municipalities. UN-Habitat also
received a joint request for capacity development support from the mayors of
the four northern Serb-majority municipalities. UN-Habitat joined with PAX to
broaden the scope of the proposed support package, with activities that would
complement technical interventions around municipal planning and governance
with efforts to strengthen the social contract between state and citizen
andestablish trust between all levels of government.The Municipality of Vushtrri requested additional substantive technical assistance from UN-Habitat while offering the required co-financing (subject of the present sub-project).The programme responds to
acute needs for support identified in the report north Kosovo in 2020, based on
extensive consultation with communities and civil society in the northern municipalities,
as well as by newly established local administrations following the local
elections in November 2013. The programme is aligned and supports the
realisation of the 2016-21 National Development Strategy (in which inclusive
development is a sub-theme) and the 2015-2020 Strategy for Modernization of
Public Administration (which includes transparent and responsible public
administration with a clear accountability system as well as continuous
information of citizens on development and delivery of public services, on
their rights and how they can be realized).Finally, the programme is directly linked to
national and global agendas and contributes (but is not limited) to the
Post-2015 Agenda to Goal 11 &#x2013; Make cities and human settlements inclusive,
safe, resilient and sustainable, with target 11.3 &#x2013; By 2030, enhance inclusive
and sustainable urbanization and capacity for participatory, integrated and
sustainable human settlement planning and management in all countries; as well
as to Goal 16 &#x2013; Promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable
development, provide access to justice for all and build effective, accountable
and inclusive institutions at all levels, with target 16.6 &#x2013; Develop effective, accountable and transparent
institutions at all levels, and target 16.7 &#x2013; Ensure responsive, inclusive,
participatory and representative decision-making at all levels.</narrative>
