  <description>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Land disputes are fuelling security concerns, which have a huge impact on
social cohesion and possibilities for reconciliation. At the same time, handling
land disputes and promoting an effective land governance system enable economic
recovery and help to tackle poverty, which removes one of the causes of ongoing
conflict. 

The linkages between land disputes, peace, stability and economic
recovery require innovative approaches to deal with land issues in a holistic
manner. Tackling land issues will contribute to reconciliation, facilitate
return and reintegration for IDPs and refugees, reduce the risks of armed
conflict, and enable a stable environment for livelihood improvement through secure
land tenure and access to means of production. The recognition of the
significance of land issues is gaining momentum in the agendas of both
stabilization and development actors, and approaches based on lessons derived
from previous interventions need to be adapted to the context. 



3.1.
Land disputes as a symptom of underlying causes and
not as an end in themselves:



Many interventions in the land sector are focusing on dealing with land
disputes through mediation. Mediating land disputes is a necessary step but it
is not sufficient. There is a need to tackle the root causes of land disputes,
knowing that conflict derives from various factors (legal, ethnic, political,
institutions). 



An innovative
approach may need to perceive land issues through the lens of governance. The
lack of state authority and the failure of the governance system as a whole have
repercussions on land management and allocation. The former stabilization
framework in Eastern DR Congo (ISSSS) only focused on superficial aspects while
mitigating disputes and conflict over land. The approach did not, however, seriously
consider land conflicts as a matter of governance.

3.2.
Long-term approach to comprehensively deal with
land issuesA humanitarian approach to dealing with land issues in post conflict
settings prevailed in the case of DR Congo. Actors were mainly targeting quick
solutions through ad hoc
interventions without developing a long-term vision for the land sector. An
effective long-term vision requires the development of a realistic agenda that takes
a comprehensive approach and links land issues with other critical sectors for peace and stability,
such as security, decentralization and the restoration of state authority.



The long-term solution in DR Congo on land issues is to reconcile
legitimacy and legality regarding land management and governance. The ongoing
land reform process led by the national government becomes an avenue to capture
changes in the land governance system and to reach durable solutions to the
land conflicts. According to the strategic plan developed in 2013, the GoDRC is
expected to come up with a new land policy from which should derive a new land
legal framework adapted to the new context of the DRC, and this by end of 2016.
But due to some delay on the land program implementation this timeline needs to
be reviewed to be realistic. But in the meantime, some keys can be addressed as
long as the government is committed (regulation of land customary rights,
recognition of alternative disputes resolution mechanisms as part of the
institutional framework.







3.3.
Scaling up experiences from local to national:

Until now, most interventions dealing with land issues focus on the
community level with weak linkages to provincial and national levels. Working with local communities should not
exclude certain levels of cooperation with both the provincial and national
levels. Evidence has shown that powerful
actors with influence at the local level of the political crisis in DR Congo
are not necessarily themselves present on the ground. Some are based in capitals
of provinces while others are in Kinshasa occupying political functions; using
proxy means to manage their interests at the local level. 3.4.
Weakness of interventions in the land sector:



Most of the interventions in the land sector are carried out by local
NGOs, mainly focusing on land dispute resolution. The number of NGOs is very
limited taking into account the number of land disputes emerging at the
community level. Some community members do not have access to formal or well
organized dispute resolution mechanisms in the areas covered by UN-Habitat
program (For example, Irumu and Mombassa Territories in Ituri,, Haut Plateaux
in South Kivu). Disequilibrium in the geographical coverage may lead to
disharmony in the treatment of land issues, leading only to partial solutions
to the problem. 



At the same time, many NGOs lack the technical capacity to deal with
land issues. Based of the inherent sensitivity of land issues, actors working
at the community level require a minimum expertise to avoid doing harm when
dealing with land disputes. Land interventions will always have the potential
to aggravate conflicts. Building
capacity for both community members and local organizations is a perquisite for
a successful resolution of land disputes.



Despites progress made with regards to the perception of importance of
land for peace and stability in the DR Congo through the various frameworks,
interventions are still limited in terms of investment. In 2010, the UN Peace Building Funds
allocated 900 000 USD to only one land program amidst large demand on land
disputes resolution at the community level. The funding covered only two
territories in North Kivu (Masisi and Rutshuru). There is a dare need to scale
up interventions and to sustain investments on the sector to better address the
issue.</narrative>
