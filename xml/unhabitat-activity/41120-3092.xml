   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Fostering Inclusive Development And Good Governance In Northern Kosovo</narrative>
  </title>
  <description>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project represents a unique
collaboration between UN-Habitat, one of the best-established UN agencies in
Kosovo, and PAX, an international NGO with a long-standing presence in Northern
Kosovo. It responds to the urgent needs in Northern Kosovo with a strategic,
comprehensive package of support to build municipal planning and management
capacities, strengthen the social contract and social cohesion, and enhance
coordination within a framework of inter-municipal cooperation and multi-level
governance. 

The
long-term headline goal of the project is to foster inclusive development and
good governance in Northern Kosovo through planned and conflict-sensitive
development of municipalities, with communities integrated at all stages of
planning and implementation, and within a framework of effective
inter-municipal cooperation and multi-level governance.While the Intermediary goal
for inception phase is to conduct baseline assessment and establish
institutional, operational, and political framework for successful
implementation of a three-year programme.

The
objectives of the inception phase are as follows:- Assess municipal and civil society capacities
with a view to calibrate the scope of work/ support to be provided in the core
implementation phase of the programme and devise/ refine related baseline,
targets and indicators - Kick-start building capacities of municipal administrations and
relevant stakeholders in North Kosovo with a view to pave the way for the
development of strategic planning processes and products- Invest in strategic support to civil society
mobilization and public dialogue contributing to increased local government
transparency, responsiveness and accountability - Initiate processes leading to constructive
inter-municipal and local-central dialogue and cooperationMain direct beneficiaries
of the project will include:Local governments. The project will provide valuable
guidance to local governments in North Kosovo, serving as a basis for
policymakers to develop and refine policies and projects that advance inclusive
development and robust governance. Local governments in North Kosovo will be
equipped and empowered to deliver basic services, and strengthen the democratic
engagement of citizens in decision-making, within an effective multi-level
governance framework. Support will also be provided to local governments to
engage in IMC and local-central cooperation activities, enabling them to
develop practical joint projects and advocacy initiatives, to mutual advantage.Civil society. Local civil society organizations
will benefit from opportunities to engage directly with municipal
decision-makers, and contribute to community planning processes and the
formulation of strategic public responses to key issues. Given the limited
political space enjoyed by civil society organizations in North Kosovo, this
will represent an important step toward raising the collective voice of civil
society in the four municipalities.Government of Kosovo. Central line ministries, and
especially MESP and MLGA, will benefit from a neutral institutional bridge to
local governments in North Kosovo, enabling them to pursue deeper engagement
and alignment. More generally, the Government of Kosovo will benefit from
support in implementation of key aspects of the 2013 Brussels Agreement and
subsequent follow-up deals; and be supported to develop future-oriented local
government policies that leverage the advantages of subsidiarity and
decentralization.Main
indirect beneficiaries of the project will include:Population of North Kosovo. By contributing to the
improved effectiveness of local government planning, management, and governance
in the four northern municipalities, the project will be directly associated
with improved prospects for inclusive development and long-term stability. The
impact is likely to be especially significant for the most vulnerable
constituencies, including women, young people, and displaced persons. The project will equip local populations
with new tools and resources to assert voice and agency, to articulate needs
and aspirations to duty-bearers, to demand responsiveness and accountability
from local institutions, and to plan and implement actions in conjunction with
state actors that improve living conditions and reduce drivers of conflict.</narrative>
