   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Support To Palestinians At Risk Of Displacement In Israeli Controlled Area C Of The West Bank</narrative>
  </title>
  <description>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The majority of the Palestinian Communities still lack a Detailed Outline Plan that caters for their natural growth. Approximate 150,000 Palestinians live in Area C in 542 communities, 281 of which are located entirely or mostly (50% or more of their built up area) in Area C.&#xA0; The draft Operational Coordination Plan details these communities further and clarifies how many are covered by Detailed Outline Plans. As the development pressure on Area C is increasing, it is important to accelerate the planning effort and to address the serious planning backlog, as evidenced by the large amount of demolition orders and/or stop work orders issued.&#xA0;
Furthermore it is essential that affected village councils are fully aware of the need for planning; the risks involved and, are as such, in a position to engage with the Israeli Civil Administration (ICA) to negotiate the approval of their plans on behalf of their communities. It is important also that they are in position to guide the implementation of the plans. 
Until now, most planning efforts were led by IPCC, a local NGO. If the intent is to seriously scale up the planning support to Palestinian Communities in Area C. This means that, apart from IPCC who played a key role in piloting planning in Area C and in supporting Village Councils in their negotiations with the Israeli Civil Administration, other capacity will need to be mobilized. Recently, private sector firms have been contracted to prepare five lots of plans for Area C. Coordinating all ongoing initiatives will require capacity to support Village Councils ensuring proper community participation and ownership, coherence and exchange of lessons learnt, quality control and support in the negotiations with the ICA. 
Currently, the engagement with the ICA on the approval of plans is not structured. The situation on the ground and the impact of plans is also not properly documented. Better monitoring is needed with improved information sharing as parties are seeking a common ground in terms of numbers and progress made.</narrative>
