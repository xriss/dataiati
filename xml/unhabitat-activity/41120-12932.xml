  </title>
  <description>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The purpose of the project
is to provide reconstruction and rehabilitation support to those who were most
severely affected by the Xe-Pian Xe-Namnoy dam collapse as well as the flooding
events in July and August 2018. The floods
caused severe damage to the housing and settlements sector in 11 provinces:
Phongsaly, Luangnamtha, Oudomxay, Bokeo, Luangprabang, Xayaboury, Xiengkhuang,
Borikhamxay, Savannakhet, Sekong, and Attapeu. Although the events and
magnitude of the damage differed from province to province, the damage was
highly concentrated in the southern province of Attapeu and the northern
provinces of Oudomxay, Luangprabang, and Xiengkhuang. A total of 1,620 houses
were assessed as destroyed, while 681 were damaged. Overall sector damage was
estimated at 21.1 billion Lao kip (US$ 2.46 million). Losses were mainly
incurred in the form of revenue loss and temporary shelter, totalling 574.0
million Lao kip (US$ 67,000). 



The Xe-Pian Xe-Namnoy dam
collapse resulted in over five billion cubic meters of water, equal to two
million Olympic swimming pools, inundating the surrounding lands, covering it
with mud and sludge. Initial air and ground assessment results led the Prime
Minister of Lao PDR to declare the affected areas as a National Emergency
Disaster Zone[1]. Besides
the displacement of the communities and the losses and damages to housing,
around 100,000 hectares of paddy fields have been damaged and a large number of
live-stock has been lost. Irrigation systems have also been heavily damaged
along with other basic infrastructures, schools and hospitals. Reconstruction
and rehabilitation efforts align with the national development agenda of
building resilience in climate vulnerable communities and will help in
graduating from Least Developed Country status. 

A timely response is needed as future rains will further decrease resilience of the affected people and increase their vulnerability to localised floods and water borne diseases.Basic services and amenities
will be appropriately rehabilitated and/or reconstructed, securing access to
clean water and sanitation needs for those displaced. Providing further
life-saving assistance such as food, clothes, tents and sleeping mattresses
will help in building short term resiliency. 



In the past, UN-Habitat in
Laos has been involved in rehabilitation and reconstruction interventions,
using BBB as the guiding principle, providing assistance in the development of
shelter, both emergency and otherwise, and the development of water supply
networks and the reconstruction and repairs of other infrastructure projects. Currently,
UN-Habitat is implementing a major climate change project in 189 settlements in
the southern provinces, where detailed vulnerability assessments of the
settlements have been conducted, affirming the organisation&#x2019;s experience and
expertise in the housing and WASH sectors.
