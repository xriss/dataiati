   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Proposed Project
Cambodia 
This project plans to improve access to safe piped water in selected communities in Kampong Thom Town - among them &#x2013; Ou Kunthor Khang Tbong community besides the ones already covered by MEK-WATSAN, namely, O&apos;Kantor and Kampong Rotesh communities. UN-Habitat selected Kampong Thom Town because of its low water supply coverage, a water system that has enough capacity for serving all the population and an operative public utility. The target areas were identified after a rapid town assessment was carried out by the Kampong Thom Water Supply Utility (KTWSU) in order to identify areas for expansion and in coordination with local authorities.
Kampong Thom Town is the capital of Kampong Thom Province. It is the economic center of the province serving as an immediate market, processing center and transportation depot for agricultural products, thus contributing to the growth of both urban and rural economies in Kampong Thom Province. According to preliminary results of Census 2008, the province has a total population of 630,803. Population density has risen from 41 persons / km in 1998 to 46 persons / km in 2008. Average household size in urban areas in Kampong Thom Province is 4.7 while growth rate is set at 1.54 percent. As reported by the Kampong Thom Water Supply Utility (KTWSU), the entity responsible for the provision of water at the provincial level, the town has a current population of 52,743 inhabitants distributed in 9,919 households in 8 communes. The population in the town is very scattered and 25 percent is below the poverty line.
Vietnam
This project aims to improve access to safe piped water for about 619 households in a resettlement area of Hoa Vinh, Dong Hoa district, southern part, and 381 households in An Chan commune, Tuy An district, northern part, Tuy Hoa City, Phu Yen Province of Vietnam. The total of beneficiaries is about 4,052. The target areas were identified after a rapid assessment and household survey was carried out by the Phu Yen Water Utility (PYWSD) in order to identify areas for expansion and in coordination with local authorities.
Hoa Vinh is small town belongs to Dong Hoa district, south of the city, with the total population of 14,205 (3,551 HHs) include 1,263 poor HHs; while An Chan is a commune belongs to Tuy An district, north of the city, with a total population of 12,725 (2,350 HHs) mostly is poor. The existing water supply system with a capacity of 1000 CMD has provided clean water to 31% in Hoa Vinh and 7% in An Chan. Only 250 poor households have access to the safe piped. In particular, a new resettlement in Hoa Vinh has no access to the water source at all. 
From the ADB3 loan fund and local budget from province, a new upgraded Water Treatment Plant with capacity of 28,000 CMD is now operating to cover whole city water consumption. In order to utilize the WTP capacity effectively, main pipes and pumping boosters are built to the surroundings and peri-urban areas of Tuy Hoa City include Hoa Vinh small district town and An Chan commune. 
Following up this investment, UN-Habitat plans to expand the piped water network to cover the new resettlement in Hoa Vinh and some settlements in An Chan commune including poor areas. 
It&apos;s expected that this project will increase the rate of access to piped water in Hoa Vinh small town from 31% to 61% and from 7% to 23% in An Chan commune.. This project builds on the efforts of the government and will contribute to strengthening the capacities of the public water utility and district authorities in improving water and sanitation services through participatory and innovative approaches. This project will also improve the awareness of local people in the town through awareness campaigns.
Water Accounting
Total annual volume of water that will be supplied as a result of this project by considering 80 lpcd on average: 5,749 x 80 x 365 = 167.8 million liters.</narrative>
