  </title>
  <description>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The objectives
of the project are to enhance residents&apos; quality of life, to ensure
that communities are fully involved in and benefit from the redevelopment
process of the sub-center, and to generate employment in selected Ger areas in the Sub-centers of
Bayankhoshuu and Selbe in Ulaanbaatar through advisory support to community
participation and SME development in Ger area
re-development in line with requirements and regulations of ADB and the
Government of Mongolia.Conceptual approachIn line with the Investment Program&apos;s aim
of promoting an inclusive peri-urban development in the Ger areas of Ulaanbaatar City, mobilisation and organisation of
both community members and business owners to support the redevelopment of the Ger areas through the sub-center
development has been conducted during 2012-2013 with UN-Habitat support in parallel to ADB TA
7970-MON which prepared the Investment Program. The project purpose builds
on the outcomes of this UN-Habitat Support Project.The above approach will be replicated in
the project with further support to the existing SMEs to
prepare them to engage with the micro-enterprises that will emerge in the
communities, and partner with the CDC members who were trained on specific
skills for possible community contracting for goods and services.The project is envisaged to be relevant throughout the
detailed design and implementation phases of project 1 of the Ulaanbaatar Urban
Services and Ger Areas Development Investment program, in order to sustain the
momentum of the initially established CDCs and SME Development Councils (SDCs).The project is expected to support
the CDCs and SDCs in providing organised stakeholder inputs to the preparation
of Sub-center Development Plans and to the Ger
area re-development projects as they are being prepared in the context of these
Sub-center Development Plans, so as to ensure their
appropriateness to and consistency with the needs of the communities and the
sub-centers&apos; SMEs.Community participation in the
re-development process will also provide an opportunity for the community
groups to support MUB in implementing the initial investment projects in the
two sub-centers (using the MUB&apos;s own budget) through the provision of labor and
earning wages as well as ensuring that the priority needs reflected in their
Community Action Plans (CAPs) are respected.To sustain the community engagement during the implementation phase of
project 1 the project will assist in strengthening the CDCs&apos; engagement
with GADA, which i.a. has the mandate to institutionalize community
participation in the project&apos;s governance. This process will also facilitate
better understanding of how vulnerable groups (i.e. women, children, the very
poor) in the Ger areas can be
capacitated to optimally benefit from the project, as well as put in place
mitigating measures to address possible negative impacts that may result from
the investment projects, as identified in the CAPs and Gender Action Plans
(GAPs) .</narrative>
