   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The cooperation with UN-Habitat aims at mobilizing its expertise and capacities at national, regional and international level to help design and implement a strategic framework for the definition, implementation, monitoring-evaluation and capitalization, in close collaboration with the HAO services and partners of:
1.	A framework to strengthen the territorial cohesion and attractiveness of a new existing town;
2.	A large integrated project of urban extension in a regional metropolis;
3.	Two urban integration projects of &quot;informal&quot; housing neighborhoods, accompanied by strategic recommendations for the prevention of the development of the various forms of irregular housing.
Centered on specific operations under definition, this approach will help achieve concrete and operational results, in terms of accurate definition of the missions of the HAO and its partners, and mobilization of the necessary players for all the interventions.
In addition to meeting concrete needs, this operational approach will allow, through follow-up   evaluation mechanisms and instruments, the in-house capitalization of the procedures developed during these operations and the improvement of public policies, in particular of the Ministry of Housing and Urban Policy.
The capitalization of these three axes by the HAO and its public partners will contribute to the reinforcement of the regulatory and strategic action of the State and local governments in order to ensure a coordinated and integrated urban development; achieve the upgrading of &quot;informal&quot; habitat; and prevent its further development.</narrative>
