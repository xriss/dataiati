   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Support To The Sustainable Development Of The Hawassa City Cluster</narrative>
  </title>
  <description>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The
overall goal of this project is to
support the sustainable development of the Hawassa city cluster by providing
technical assistance to improve and steer the on-going rapid urban growth of
the city triggered by the recent operationalization of the HIP, in order to
contribute to a more sustainable structural, social and economic transformation
of the city, its surrounding areas and the region. 

The specific objective is to provide on-the-job technical assistance,
progressively build the required capacity of the Hawassa City Government and
strengthen the coordination with the HIP, IDPC, the regional government and
other concerned stakeholders to cope with the urbanisation impacts of the
industrial park, with focus on spatial/urban planning, waste management and
housing, at the city cluster scale.

UN-Habitat plans to provide technical
expertise to the Hawassa City Government which is responsible for land use
planning and management in the areas surrounding the HIP.

The aim is to progressively create
sufficient capacity locally and reinforce the coordination with the HIP, IDPC,
the regional government and other concerned stakeholders. 

Specifically, UN-Habitat role will
be to station technical experts in Hawassa with a view to build adequate
capacity on-the-job to cope with the urbanisation impacts of the industrial
park.

This will be done by promoting an
integrated city cluster development approach, with a specific focus on
spatial/urban planning, waste management and housing. In particular, as
described above, proper spatial and urban planning is considered to be the
right entry point to address the housing and waste management issues in an
integrated manner. 

For this purpose, UN-Habitat proposes to place a
capable International Technical Advisor in Hawassa city, specialised in
spatial/urban planning, supported by national specialists on housing and waste
management, especially to build the capacity of the HCG and to reinforce
coordination with the HIP, IDPC, the regional government and other
stakeholders. Importantly, a participatory approach will be mainstreamed during
project implementation</narrative>
