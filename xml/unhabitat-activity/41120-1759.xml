  </title>
  <description>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">TheProgramme to be supported by the Cities Alliance shall establish cooperationbetween the DGHS and three cities in Indonesia that already practicegood governance and already invest in better urban environments. The cooperation shall encourage the &#x2018;goodpractice&#x2019; cities to drive further the development and dissemination ofeffective city investment planning under the &#x2018;RPIJM&#x2019; label. The three cities will set down developshowcase pro-poor and participatory citywide development and financing strategies. DGHS will underscore the efforts bychannelling investment funding to the cities on a priority basis. Together,DGHS and the cities will document and disseminate proven and validated goodurban management and investment practices to new cities, making use of theRPIJM facilitator network, the USDRP city network and city-to-city networkingdirectly undertaken by the three cities, in collaboration with a national localgovernment authority.
The specificobjectives of the cooperation are:
(A) Objectives relevant to each of thethree cities:
a) to capture &#x201C;why urban investmentworks&#x201D;, i.e. the actual city development strategies established in the threecities, with and through city stakeholders 
b) to produce showcase city developmentand financing strategies and action plans in the respective cities, captured incomprehensive RPIJM strategies and action plans, which fully incorporate theCDS (SPK) process and are validated by all relevant stakeholders
c) to channel national-leveldevelopment funding to the respective cities, based on the RPIJMs, in order totest and further strengthen the CDS and RPIJM strategies.
(B) Objectives relevant to the aim ofnational mainstreaming through DGHS:
d) to absorb the good practices,knowhow and experiences into an improved RPIJM toolkit that fully incorporatesthe CDS (SPK) process
e) to disseminate the expertise,through DGHS, via the provincial RPIJM facilitators engaged by DGHS
f) to engage other central governmentagencies in order to validate CDS (SPK) and RPIJM as a general tool for fundingallocation in and to cities
(C) Objectives relevant to the aim ofcity-to-city learning:
g) to engage the USDRP cities, on apriority basis, in city-to-city learning initiatives with the three cities, inorder to disseminate the CDS experiences in the three cities but also todisseminate learning from the investment pilots undertaken in USDRP cities 
h) to promote city-to-city learning,with the three cities in the lead, to a wider audience of city governments andstakeholders in Indonesia,with the assistance of a national local government authority (to be selected).</narrative>
