   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Programme For Emergency Assistance To Poor And Vulnerable Community In Ethnic Minority Areas And Yangon</narrative>
  </title>
  <description>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The
overall objective of the project is
helping Myanmar&apos;s poor and vulnerable communities affected by conflicts and
natural disasters to address the emergency needs to restore their normal life
and to sustainably improve quality of life through improvement of housing
conditions and enhancing access to community infrastructure.The
project has specific objective of assisting vulnerable communities, mostly
women and children, to respond to unexpected disaster conditions through all
project activities, promoting active participation of women, immediate recovery
of vulnerable communities&apos; economic and social actions and providing safer and
healthy environment for children.The
target population of the component one includes families currently living in
squatter conditions and disaster prone area in Yangon &#x2013;who will qualify the stringent
criteria of beneficiary selection carried by Department of Human Settlement and Housing Development /Yangon City Development Committee
(YCDC) and UN-Habitat. These families will be directly benefited from the
housing intervention which facilitate through people&apos;s process to build houses
for them.The
target population of the component two includes communities in the conflict
affected deprived villages in Mansi township (30 villages) and Momauk township
(30 villages) in Kachin State and Pekkon
township (50 villages) in Shan State. Under this communities will be
facilitated and empowered to construct, rehabilitate most needy community
infrastructure which contributes to enhance their normal life.Beneficiary
selection for component one will be on criteria based assessment so that the
project interventions will yield best impact and optimum results and reach out
to the most vulnerable and deserving families. Therefore beneficiaries for the
proposed housing component will be selected byDepartment of Human Settlement and Housing Development/Yangon City Development
Committee (YCDC) and UN-Habitat using the stringent selection criteria
developed by UN-Habitat in consultation with Department of Human Settlement and Housing Development/YCDC. Selected beneficiaries will
be only from project catchment area. Before the beneficiary selection
UN-Habitat will conduct a detailed household survey in the three project target
locations which results will be analyzed to further on used to verify against
the beneficiary application and selection.The
target population of the component two will be selected based on: a) Villages
where people&apos;s urgent needs are not met as per township authorities , b)
Villages which at least more that 50% household do not have easy access to safe
drinking water, c) Villages which at least more than 50% do not have individual
access to adequate sanitation, d) Villages which do not have or have dilapidated
and affected by conflict basic infrastructure, e) Villages which have
reasonable number of household and total population (i.e. 40HH, 200
population), f) Villages where there are no means and ways of getting health
facilities, education facilities, inter / intra villages access roads, g)
Villages where there is high interest of community participation, h) Villages
where there is potential for growth but no initiatives or investment plans of
both Department of Rural Development (DRD) and other development partnersExpected outcomes of the project are:Vulnerable
communities in squatter condition and disaster prone areas of Yangon rebuilt
their dilapidated houses where safety and living conditions of mainly women and
children are improved with better housing conditions, and ensured land tenure
rightsConnectivity
restored and condition improved of basic infrastructure in affected rural
communities and regained access to market, health and educational facilitiesIncreased
access to safe drinking water and reduced incidence of water borne diseases
among affected communitiesIncreased
access to adequate sanitation and promoted good hygiene practicesLivelihood opportunities through
employment-intensive improved; the employment-intensive component will
contribute to the poorest households to start up sustainable livelihood by
injecting cash into local communities.Capacity
building will impact in the process of community development as well in
ensuring that communities will fully engage with future improvement activities
for their communities; capacity building will also provide better job
opportunities.The
project partners are Yangon City Development Committee (YCDC), Village
Development Committee (VDC) in each village (Kachin and Shan), Community
Development Committee (CDC) (Yangon), State and Township Authorities,
Department of Rural Development (DRD), Ministry of Social Welfare, Relief and
Resettlement (MOSWRR) 









































The
project actions are designed and implemented The proposed actions are based on
UN-Habitat experience in response activities carried out immediately after
Cyclone Nargis and Cyclone Giri. After Nargis, UN-Habitat was the shelter
cluster lead and supported emergency shelter coordination and implemented
shelter reconstruction with water and sanitation facilities, in addition
community infrastructure was also either constructed or renovated (Please see
Annex 2). UN-Habitat has successfully implemented number of community driven
shelter recovery projects in the Asia Pacific region over the last two decades
and has gained enormous experience. Through the UN-Habitat Regional Office for
Asia and the Pacific (ROAP) in Fukuoka, the project will obtain support and
guidance sharing lessons learnt from the region during planning and
implementing the project activities in additions to the regional office
supervision.</narrative>
