   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Enhancing The Planning Capacities Of Cities In The Nacala Corridor (Nampula, Tete And Nacala)</narrative>
  </title>
  <description>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project aims to support local authorities along
the Nacala corridor in the development and implementation of sound planning
instruments integrating legal and economic aspects. Specifically, this project
intends to address the above issues in the following way:Strengthen the
capacity of the Planning Support Unit (PSU) and build its credibility as an
autonomous institution that provides fit-for-purpose services to cities and towns
along the Nacala corridor in the field of urban planning. In particular, through the PSU and with the
support of UN-Habitat HQ, attention will be placed on Nampula, Nacala and Tete to
develop (or, in the case of Nacala, to
finalise) planned city extension, resilient urban growth plans and action plans
for prioritization of investments. In addition, conditions will be created to develop
a spatial development strategy for the whole corridor.



Maximise the
ability of the city authorities of Nampula, Nacala and Tete to plan and
sustainably manage urban growth through durable access to technical advice,
public-private platforms and on-the-job capacity building. The idea will be to
effectively capture the economic value of the target cities in the territorial
regulatory instruments so that investments can benefit larger sections of the
populations of Tete, Nampula and Nacala.</narrative>
