   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Initiating Durable Shelter Solutions For Iraqi Idps And Returnees</narrative>
  </title>
  <description>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The overall goal of the project is to support local and national institutional to implement Long Term Shelter Solutions for IDPs and returnees that are currently living in unplanned settlements.
Providing adequate shelter since it is a priority concern for almost half of IDP families (48%). The majority live in rented accommodation and are burdened with high rent prices. A significant population shelter with host families (8.8%), or live in tents or makeshift shelters on the host families&apos; land (1.8 %). In addition, a large percentage of displaced families that cannot afford to rent, live in informal settlements (9.5%), often in structures made from mud, sticks and other salvaged materials, or have occupied public buildings and former military camps (2.6%). These families are threatened with forceful eviction with no alternative accommodation available.[1] 

The target group benefitting from the project are IDPs and other vulnerable living within unplanned settlements in Baghdad. The project will directly benefit approximately 900 vulnerable families, predominantly IDPs that will access secure land tenure and improved living environment through government financed settlement upgrading. IDPs will benefit from technical assistance to a resettlement project in Mahmoudiya; and pending commitment from the Governor of Baghdad, IDP families in Bahith El Almi will also benefit from technical assistance related to the proposed land sharing project. It is expected that through relevant professional training of key institutions within the TC, government will be more able to apply their resources to supporting IDPs and other vulnerable families living in unplanned settlements, accordingly it is expected that this project will trigger support to a wider vulnerable group. 

Based on tools developed in Phase I of the project and lessons learnt from pilot projects, this project will support the GoI and selected Baghdad districts to move forward with the implementation of Shelter Strategy that was developed by MoMD in conjunction with UN-Habitat, by up keeping institutional capacity to do so, following district level roadmaps while undertaking community-led upgrading/resettlement projects.

The main possible implementing partners are: NRC, MoP, MoMD, MMPW, MoCH, Amanat Baghdad, Baghdad Governor, UNHCR and members of the UNDAF Housing Priority Working (PWG).
