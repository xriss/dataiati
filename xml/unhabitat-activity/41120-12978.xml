   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Urban And Territorial Integrated Development Strategy For The Southeast Region In Mexico - Regional Corridor Tren Maya</narrative>
  </title>
  <description>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The
present strategy of collaboration defines the framework of technical collaboration
between the National Fund for Tourism Development (FONATUR) and the United
Nations Human Settlements Program (UN-Habitat) for the Integral Territorial
and Urban Development for the Southeast Region of Mexico - Regional Corridor Tren Maya.

The
formulation of this strategy is covered within the Framework Collaboration
Agreement (2014-2019) between the Government of Mexico, the United Nations
Human Settlements Program (UN-Habitat) and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs
(SRE) through the Mexican Agency for International Development Cooperation (AMEXCID)[1]. FONATUR
expressed its interest in establishing a collaboration scheme with UN-Habitat
through an official letter DG/RJP/052/2019. FONATUR also requested the
preparation of a technical-financial proposal to develop an intervention
strategy within the framework of the integral development project of the
southeastern region of Mexico, Tren Maya.

During
2018 and 2019[2], FONATUR and UN-Habitat
have held several working meetings to identify the approach of the collaboration.
Through this document, UN-Habitat presents a working strategy from the
territorial planning perspective in order to define and design a regional
development corridor to respond, from a logic of integral regional development
of the southeastern region, following the request of FONATUR.

Central Issue addressed:

The generation of this project
proposal is based on normative evidence of the work of UN-Habitat in Mexico and
other countries worldwide, which shows that there is a direct correlation between
urbanization and development.

Likewise, it is based on the existing data and studies for the southeast
region of Mexico, through which it is possible to notice the lag of this region
and the existence of inequality and marginalization conditions with respect to
the rest of the country.

Against that background, the purpose of this project is to generate a
territorial strategy, provide inputs and develop plans and programs that will
transmit the benefits of a strategically organized, well-planned urbanization -
which includes the sustainability principles of the global agendas-, instigate local
development and combat the current backwardness within the entire region.

Correlations between urbanization and development

In 1950, only 29 % of the global population lived in urban areas. In 1990, the global
urban population reached 42.5 %, and in 2009 it stayed at 50 % until reaching
55 % in 2015. It is estimated that by 2020, the global urban population will
have reached 56.2 % of the total world population; 60 % in 2030 and 70 % in
2050.[3]

Mexico has
been predominantly urban since 1960. Today, 77 % of its population is
concentrated in urban centers and this concentration rate tends to be
constantly increasing. The urbanization process in Mexico means that the number
of its cities will increase - from 384 in 2010 to 961 in 2030- where 83.2 % of
Mexican population will be concentrated. This accelerating urbanization
phenomenon presents an opportunity in terms of urban prosperity for Mexican
inhabitants

UN-Habitat has identified that the
countries with the highest income per capita are those with the largest urban
population. Likewise, countries with low incomes are among the least urbanized
a worldwide. On average, globally, high-income countries (41,539.85 GDP per
capita) are the most urbanized (81.53 %) and those with low income (745.94 GDP
per capita) are among the least urbanized (32.44 %).

Mexico is not an exception when it comes to
this correlation. For example, Mexico City and Nuevo Le&#xF3;n State, where
urbanization rates are greater than 95 %, are among the first three entities
showing the highest GDP per capita at national level. In contrast, Chiapas and
Oaxaca, where urbanization rate is the lowest in the country at less than 50%,
are two states showing the lowest income per capita.

Urbanization frequently comes with
development and prosperity, and this positive relationship is evident in Mexico
when analyzing multiple indicators.

As illustrated by the following
graphs, in the five states forming the southeastern region of Mexico - Quintana
Roo, Yucatan, Campeche, Tabasco, Chiapas - the average urbanization rate is
64.4 %, which is about 13 % less than the national average rate. These 5 states
show higher rates of illiteracy, infant mortality, teenage pregnancy, incomes
below the poverty line and marginalization. Similarly, in these states,
indicators such as coverage of basic services, level of education, access to higher
education, average household income, or the human development index, among
others, show a decrease in accordance with the lower urban population rate.

The urban
regional corridor of prosperity

The findings derived from the
measurement of the City Prosperity Index (CPI) in 305 Mexican municipalities
support the relationship between the lowest urbanization and the reduced
development and prosperity observed in the southeast of Mexico.

As indicated in Map 1, the regions or
states with the highest degree of urbanization, particularly in the central-western
region of the country, have the highest prosperity rates and the best development
conditions. Meanwhile, most states in the southeast, where the urbanization
rate is lower than the national average, tend to disappear from the prosperity
map because their levels are below the national average. As a result, there is
a corridor of prosperity located in
the central zone of the country, where the urbanization rate is higher than the
average of that of the southern states.

Considering the current conditions and historical
economic and social exclusion within the southeastern states, it is
recommendable to emulate the conditions of prosperity already existing in the
center of the country within this part of the territory. Developing an urban
regional corridor to extend prosperity to the southeast will improve the
welfare of the total population. This corridor will expand rights and
opportunities to a historically underprivileged region, providing a unique
opportunity to reverse the unequal development accumulated in many years.

The varied data presented shows that the southeast region, although having significant historic,
cultural and environmental assets and being one of Mexico&#xB4;s main touristic destinations, is lagging in terms of socioeconomic development.

In the absence of clear regional planning and properly
organized human settlements, this region has been historically marginalized and
consumed by high rates of poverty and lack of opportunities for the
inhabitants.

This indicates that well-managed
urbanization, with transparency, responsibility and planning, works as a
strategy to increase well-being and quality of life. This is a fundamental
premise of the integral development strategy for the southeast region of the
country.

The integrated development of the southeast region of
Mexico represents a long-range national strategy. Its purpose is to contribute
to improve the living conditions of the entire population, create shared
prosperity in the region while preserving the environment, tangible and
intangible cultural heritage and historical identity.

Under this logic, UN-HABITAT will provide substantive
technical support to FONATUR in defining the parameters and strategies
necessary to develop a comprehensive development proposal for the southeast
region within Mexico. 

This strategy will contribute to trigger positive
results in terms of welfare, development and opportunities for this region to
reduce inequalities and improve the quality of life, under the fundamental
premise of preserving the natural and cultural heritage of the region.

In this sense,
this strategy is based on:Creating a regional corridor based on a territorial planning
and urban development scheme, in which the Tren Maya infrastructure will
be the articulating element.Redefining the regional city system.Rethinking and consolidating the comparative advantages of
the micro-regions.Determining the intermediary roles of some cities to
articulate urban and rural areas.Avoiding generating inequalities in the territory.Creating protection strategies for tangible and intangible
heritage.

It is expected that this collaboration provides an
opportunity to reimagine the 1470 km of railroad tracks through the Tren
Maya project as an opportunity to generate and implement strategies that
will enhance the different territories and urban centers of the region.

In
this context, the following main results expected at the end of the implementation
of the project will contribute to the long-term achievement to create shared
prosperity in the region:The southeast region will have a shared vision generated from
local needs and in consensus with multiple actors, which is aligned with the
principles of the 2030 agenda and the New Urban Agenda. This translates into a
clear and solid narrative that contributes to position, before public opinion,
the notion and implications of a new planning approach that will contribute to
improve prosperity in this region of ??the country.The southeast region will have a well-articulated
coordination structure and a territorial planning strategy that considers
vocations and comparative advantages of local communities for the integration
of a regional city system properly hierarchized that redefines the role of
cities and urban centers and the linkages between urban and rural areas, while
preserving tangible and intangible heritage, in which the Tren Maya
plays the role of articulating element.The municipalities of the region will have strategic
instruments or orientations for the preparation of their urban development
programs and/or the partial plans for the areas of influence of the Tren
Maya stations, consistent with the vision and the regional planning
structure.The southeast development strategy will have a clear
evaluation of expected impacts and a proposal for the consolidation of a regional
monitoring mechanism. This mechanism will enable the evaluation of the actions
carried out for the construction of the railway infrastructure and the
territorial planning at regional and local level; and the development of
preventive or corrective actions in order to achieve the expected results in
the prosperity of the region.

To
achieve these expected results, UN-Habitat will develop 7 strategic components that
have been articulated through 7 deliverables with the following specific
objectives:

1.
Narrative of the project: from the object
(Train) to the concept (Integral development of the southeast region of
Mexico).Build
a narrative based on evidence and technical inputs; generate a structured
vision from a
participatory process to mainstream local needs for an integrated development of the region.

2.
Land
management mechanisms.Propose
inter-institutional coordination and citizen participation schemes for the
management of the project, as well as identify the legal and urban planning
instruments necessary for its implementation.3. 3.	Ex
ante evaluation of the impacts generated by the integral development strategy
of the southeastern region.Establish
an ex ante evaluation system in spatial, socioeconomic and environmental terms,
that allows estimations of how the strategy of integral development of the
southeast and its territorial interventions will impact the social, economic
and environmental conditions of the whole region and specific areas of
development.

4.
Territorial structure plan of the southeast
region (regional corridor) from the perspective of reorganization and
articulation of several micro-regions and city centers. 

Elaborate a Land Management integral Plan at
regional scale for the southeast that allows to create a new strategy of
regional development.



5.
Urban
planning and operational instruments for the municipalities where the Tren Maya stations will be located.	Promote the
sustainable development of the human settlements that exist or can be created
in the influence areas of the Tren Maya stations, through the creation of
Integrated Urban Operations (OUI) that will implement at local scale the
territorial vision oriented to the prosperity of southeastern region of Mexico
and the territorial planning at regional scale.

6.
Monitoring
mechanism to supervise the process and evaluate the results (Regional
Observatory).	Propose an institutional mechanism to create the
Observatory of Regional Prosperity of the southeastern region of Mexico, which
allows FONATUR to monitor and evaluate the impacts generated by the integral
development strategy of the region benefitting the population and the
territory.

7.
Strategy
for the integral resettlement of the population that lives in the right of way
on the route of theTren Maya .	Provide technical support, to FONATUR to develp a
strategy for the resettlement process of the families that live in the rights
of way in Campeche.

The deliverables are interrelated to each other, in
such a way that each one sustains the other, and all contribute to the
consolidation of the narrative and the design of a successful and functional
strategy. The aim is to generate a virtuous circle where the deliverables
reinforce and articulate one another to ensure the sustainability of the
project with clear benefits for the local population.

For the construction of proposals, UN-Habitat will use the
findings from the CPI study of 305 municipalities of the country. This will be
complemented with some other territorial studies on the southeast of Mexico to
identify the comparative advantages of the region.

Likewise, it is relevant to point out that the
project considers addressing in a transversal way two important characteristic
aspects of the region that condition territorial responses:

&#x2022; Biodiversity and natural environment,

&#x2022; Cultural heritage



Although the
mandate of UN-Habitat is not focused on these issues, its relevance in the
territory is significant, through the sphere of urban and territorial planning
and within the framework of the above-mentioned deliverables. Strategies will
be considered to integrate these elements in the project in a way that
guarantees an integral development.

It is relevant to
point out that alliances can be established between FONATUR and other expert
actors (such as UNEP and UNESCO) on specific topics that are outside of the
sphere of expertise and mandate of UN-Habitat.

Biodiversity and natural environment
conservation 

Within
the framework of this project, UN-Habitat recognizes the importance of adopting
a transversal approach of environmental sustainability that allows guaranteeing
the prosperous development of the region, in alignment with the principles of
the 2030 Agenda and the NUA. 

The
southeastern region of Mexico is one of the areas of greater natural importance
of the country, specifically the Calakmul biosphere reserve which is part of
the UNESCO&#x2019;s world heritage list. In this sense, the protection and
conservation of biodiversity, maintaining ecosystem services, and sustainably
managing living natural resources are fundamental throughout the project
lifecycle. 

UN-Habitat has highlighted in several of its projects
that an efficient, well-planned and well-managed territorial planning scheme
that provides specific interventions of urban acupuncture has positive effects
on reducing environmental exploitation to ecosystems and natural resources. While
this finding may seem counterintuitive,
the final political document of the Habitat III Conference &quot;The New
Urban Agenda&quot; recognizes that &#x201C;there is a need to take advantage of the
opportunities presented by urbanization as an engine of sustained and inclusive
economic growth, [&#x2026;] environmental protection.&#x201D;[5] The same document notes
that &quot;by readdressing the way cities and human settlements are planned,
designed, financed, developed, governed and managed, the New Urban Agenda will
help to end poverty and hunger in all its forms and dimensions; reduce
inequalities; promote sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth;
achieve gender equality and the empowerment of all women and girls in order to
fully harness their vital contribution to sustainable development; improve
human health and wellbeing; foster resilience; and protect the environment.&#x201D; [6]

The signatory countries of the New Urban Agenda
recognize that &#x201C;strengthening urban governance, with sound institutions and
mechanisms that empower and include urban stakeholders, as well as appropriate
checks and balances, providing predictability and coherence in urban
development plans enable social inclusion, sustained, inclusive and sustainable
economic growth and environmental protection&#x201D;.[7] 

Under this logic, UN-Habitat has advised a significant
number of countries implementing regional and urban development, mechanisms to
contain predatory practices of environmental protection zones, which is the
case with the Calakmul Biosphere Reserve, that is threatened by exploitation
and illegal logging. A notable case is the intervention of UN-Habitat in the
Amazon Rainforest within the State of Par&#xE1;, Brazil, where the creation of a
local system of cities and urban centers was proposed to create a belt of
responsible protection and governance that would prevent or limit incessant
deforestation in the region.

On
this basis, territorial and urban planning instruments developed in components
4 and 5 of the project will be the main instruments to guide the establishment
of human settlements and economic activities in the region, with a sustainable
approach that guarantees an adequate balance between, environment conservation,
economic growth and social wellbeing. Also, as part of these instruments, strategies
will be implemented as mechanisms to contain predatory practices in
environmentally protected areas. Such strategies will be directed at avoiding
the potential loss of biodiversity and ecosystem services, overexploitation of
water resources, and inefficient practices in land management. 

Cultural
Heritage

The
southeast region of Mexico, together with Guatemala, Belize and El Salvador, is
recognized as the site where the Mayan culture developed. From the year 600 AD,
the great Mayan cities reached their apogee in the region as characterized by
the construction of important structures with unique architectural typologies.
These cities formed a complex system of settlements with different hierarchy
distributed throughout the territory and linked to a socio-political system and
a cosmovision of the world and nature. That heritage (tangible and intangible)
has prevailed through conditioning and characterization of the region till today.

Today,
the region is protected by the National Institute of Anthropology of History
(INAH), responsible for the preservation of historical heritage in Mexico,
according to the Federal Law of Archaeological, Artistic and Historical Zones
and Monuments.

30
archaeological zones open to the public and two Historic Monuments Zones are
located within the areas of influence of the Tren Maya project. Within these 30 archaeological zones, three are
inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List: Palenque, Chich&#xE9;n Itz&#xE1; and
Calakmul (this one as a mixed heritage for its natural and cultural
components). However, according to INAH, a vast number of unexplored areas continue
to be explored through constant archaeological work.

On
this basis, one of the fundamental premises of the project is to recognize the
value of tangible and intangible cultural heritage of the southeastern region
of Mexico and its importance for current and future generations aiming to
ensure its protection during and beyond the project activities. 

In
this sense, within the framework of the project, UN-Habitat will develop
strategies from a territorial perspective to promote historical and cultural
continuity and heritage preservation. Some of the activities considered are:Identify and document the historical and cultural significance
of archaeological zones, buildings and other objects and cultural
manifestations in the region to establish goals for their conservation.Promote the recognition of heritage sites and highlight their
value as an essential part of local culture and cosmovision, guaranteeing that
the territorial and urban planning programs contemplate protection and
preservation areas to avoid negative influences of urbanization that may affect
them, as well as strategic projects to promote their conservation.
