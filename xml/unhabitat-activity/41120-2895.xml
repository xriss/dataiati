  <description>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The main objectives
of the project include capacity building and community organization for the delivery
of safe, good quality, continued and accessible health care and services,
improve knowledge and attitudes of people to prevent diseases, and create
healthy environment by mobilizing inclusion of health issues into urban
environment and to service and infrastructure planning in ger areas, and
strengthening partnerships between national and other partner organizations in
district health issues. The project approach addresses the links of poor health
records of ger area residents as evident in the sector statistics and the poor
housing, environmental and service conditions in ger areas. The leading causes
of morbidity of the population include respiratory diseases, digestive system
diseases, cardiovascular diseases, urinary tract diseases and injuries. The
leading causes of mortality are cardiovascular diseases, cancer, digestive
system diseases, respiratory diseases, neurology diseases and perinatal
disorders. [1]
