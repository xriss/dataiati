  </title>
  <description>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project&apos;s development objective is to build capacities of local authorities and communities at district and provincial level in disaster preparedness and response.

The specific purpose of conducting vulnerability assessment is to develop multi-hazard and vulnerability risk profiles at district level that will facilitate formulation of policy advice for disaster response and resilience building measures, particularly of the vulnerable population. The scope of work would involve investigating in detail the following broad aspects

- Socio-economic profiling: poverty level - opportunities for livelihood
- Social Dynamics: Gender equity - gender adaptability to climate change
 
- Recognition and relevance of DRR strategies and DRM mechanism: availability of financial and human resources for DRM and DRR. 

- Hazards in the settlement: human geography and migration; impacts of climate change on urban growth into more slums, relevance of the migration, humanitarian consequences of climate change. 

- Research and development for appropriate material in the regional and climatic context of construction.

- These aspects would be reviewed further to include any other essential indicator/factor/dimension during the assessment.</narrative>
