  <description>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Clearly, the opportunity to capitalize on the Darfur Doha Peace Document (DDPD) rests with its implementation, which is crucial in setting the conditions agreeable to sustainable recovery of communities affected by the conflict in Darfur. So far, implementation of the DDPD has been slower and less complete than envisaged, placing strain on the mechanisms of the agreement. For example, the absence of local social services despite best efforts continues to be a challenge and is increasing frustrations. Even so, the framework created by the DDP provides a unique window of opportunity to engage in &#x2018;business unusual&apos;.
Efforts have been made to settle conflicts arising from transhumance routes. In 1989 in North Darfur the governor together with local councils and the Native Administration reached an agreement on the rules governing transhumance routes. The North Darfur State Transhumance Act in 1991 enshrined these principles. The Act has been followed by many conferences and workshops, but has remained ineffective due to inadequate involvement by the pastorals and farmers, and the weakness of the Native Administration. A national high committee on transhumance was established by the Ministry of Agriculture and Animal Resources in 1997 to prepare a comprehensive study of livestock corridors, where a Livestock Corridors Act was promulgated by the governor in 1998. The Act defines livestock routes, different categories of pasture and water points, lists activities not allowed on stock routes including farming, burning, cutting of trees, building and harvesting of fodder, and fixes penalties. A conflict resolution committee is created with membership from the administration including the police, and the native administration. There are no herder or farmer representatives. The general opinion is that the lack of real contact with the grass roots makes this committee ineffective. Transhumance routes remain a key issue for the project. 
Useful lessons learned through implementation of Sudan Peace Building and Development Project SPDP have been taken into consideration when designing this Project Proposal, which aims to make contributions towards the following areas:
Better management of natural resources, within and between local communities, and between communities and the state
Legal and policy reform, to clarify the formal framework within which rural land uses take place and conflicts are settled;
Institutional reform for improved natural resource management, including support to creation of an effective local administration which incorporates elements of the customary system reflected by the Native Administration, and capacity building in both government and civil society;
More comprehensive natural resource management strategies and plans, which recognize the important economic role played by pastorals without neglecting farming and adopt planning concepts and approaches relevant to and supportive of pastoral livelihoods;
Strengthened and more democratic representative bodies for pastorals and farmers, so that their interests are better defended in public debate and decision-making
Local pastoral and farming communities in Greater Darfur, especially those affected and are currently exposed to conflicts, who are often among the poorest. Pastoral women and youth will be special target in their roles as initiators and moderators of conflict. Children, who are often among the main victims of conflict, and the youth who are mostly unemployed and becoming increasingly involved in livestock rustling and banditry as alternative livelihoods, will be key beneficiaries. The total number of direct beneficiaries is estimated at 1000 families&apos; people, the majority of whom (more than 60%) are children and women and youth. Indirect beneficiaries in the three-targeted areas is approximately 30,000 people , Government sector officers at State and local level and Key stakeholder along the route identified in the three states including community leaders, CBOs, CSOs, civic unions (farmers and Pastoralists Unions)</narrative>
