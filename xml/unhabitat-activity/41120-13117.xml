   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Urbanisation And Climate Change Adaptation In The Caspian Sea Region - Pre-Concept Note</narrative>
  </title>
  <description>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">At the political level, both Azerbaijan and Iran have taken up the challenge and in their Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDC) have outlined targets for adaptation contributions. Azerbaijan has committed to addressing adaptation measures for decreasing or minimizing the losses that may occur at national, local and community levels per sector in addition to guiding the urbanisation process, including the land-use change towards preservation of agricultural land, open spaces and increased biodiversity, while addressing the impacts of droughts, floods and heat island effect. In Iran, public and private investments are steered towards contributing to sustainable water management, environmental conservation and the protection of natural resources in addition to innovations in the agricultural, forestry, water and industrial sectors as well as the introduction of early warning and monitoring systems for climate observation. The proposed project aligns with regional, national and local policy priorities, strategies and plans. It aims to contribute to the localization and furthering the implementation of elements of those.Regional: Framework Convention for Protection of Marine Environment of Caspian Sea - Tehran Convention. By ratifying the Convention, the five Parties Azerbaijan, Iran, Kazakhstan, Russia and Turkmenistan confirmed their readiness to go the path of sustainable development and to take environmental concerns into account in their development planning. Having entered into force in 2006, the Tehran Convention is the first regional legally binding instrument signed by all five Caspian littoral states. It serves as an overarching governance framework which lays down the general requirements and the institutional mechanism for environmental protection and sustainable development in the Caspian Sea region. Under its umbrella the Parties have developed additional Protocols on priority areas of common concern. The effective implementation of the Tehran Convention and its Protocols will support the protection of the marine environment and with it of the livelihoods, health and well-being of present and future generations around the Caspian Sea.Azerbaijan: the project will help achieving the goals of Azerbaijan&#x2019;s INDC which is based on the reduction of vulnerabilities of Azerbaijan towards climate change impacts, particularly developing relevant adaptation measures for decreasing or minimizing the losses that may occur at national, local and community levels. More specifically, it addresses the objectives, strategies and priority actions specified by national development plans, National Climate Change Adaptation, Disaster Risk Reduction, Environmental and Urbanization Strategies. Relevant key documents identified are: INDC Azerbaijan (2015); National Caspian Action Plan (2002); 3rd Communication to UNFCCU (2010,) Azerbaijan 2020, Law of the Republic of Azerbaijan on Fundamentals of Urban Development (1999); and Law of the Republic of Azerbaijan on Architectural Activity.Iran: the project will help achieving the goals of Iran&#x2019;s INDC which is based on the reduction of vulnerabilities of Iran towards climate change impacts, particularly developing relevant adaptation measures for decreasing or minimizing the losses that may occur at national, local and community levels. More specifically, it addresses the objectives, strategies and priority actions specified by national development plans and resolutions, National Climate Change Adaptation, Disaster Risk Reduction, Environmental and Urbanization Strategies. Relevant key documents identified are: INDC Iran (2015); 3rd Communication to UNFCCU (2017), National Communication (2017), Environmental Policies and National Urban Policy in Iran &#x2013; Abstract Diagnostic Report (2018).</narrative>
