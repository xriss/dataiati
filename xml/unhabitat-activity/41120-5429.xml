   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Leaving No Place Behind:  Strengthening Urban-Rural Linkages In Africa</narrative>
  </title>
  <description>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project is intended to provide support to policy making highlighting
the interdependencies and synergies between urban and rural areas in four
selected African countries. Data and evidence on growing disparities must be
collected to form the basis for policy design, formulation and implementation.
The project will develop gender-and age-disaggregated data, including youth and
gender issues to promote equity and ensure that &#x201C;no place&#x2026;&#x201D; and &#x201C;no-one&#x201D; should
be left behind. Countries will improve their human and institutional capacity
on how to collect data and incorporate key dimensions of urban-rural linkages
into policies, strategies and plans. The project does not only aim to strengthen
the capacity of national, regional and local authorities, but it also includes
other stakeholders such as civil society organizations, NGOs, academia and the
private sector into the decision-making process in order to improve synergy in
the design, formulation, and implementation of integrated urban-rural
development strategies. It is expected that the application of this inclusive
approach to improve urban-rural linkages in national and regional frameworks
and the involvement of all stakeholders in the decision-making process will
foster a constructive dialogue between national governments and regional and/or
local authorities in the target countries.

The project will also reinforce the capacity of key decision makers
(either at national or at subnational levels) to assess their plans, policies
and development strategies. Developing tools and implementing guiding
principles, frameworks and indicators can facilitate effective and inclusive
policies. Due to the complexity of urban-rural linkages issues such as
sustainable management of natural resources, adequate infrastructure and
service provision, equality, equity and social inclusion will be addressed
during the project as well as environmental pressures and the flow of capital,
goods and people.</narrative>
