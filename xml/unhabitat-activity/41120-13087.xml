   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Support To Local Communities In Lebanon: Improving Local Socio-Economic Development Planning Through Strengthened Local Planning Capacities At The Unions/Clusters Of Municipalities Level</narrative>
  </title>
  <description>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Local Planning has been a key issue in Lebanon since decades. This is due to the fact that the prolonged 15-year civil war (1975-1990) has developed a &#x201C;no planning&#x201D; culture amongst public institutions as the State was absent and municipalities were barely functioning with limited resources. The post-civil war era witnessed a number of attempts aiming at helping public institutions and municipalities to develop and implement sound plans. With support from Aid agencies, many municipalities and unions of municipalities have gone through processes to develop local and regional plans. However, these processes haven&#x2019;t achieved their targets due to several reasons and constraints, mainly:Limited capacitiesAll municipalities in Lebanon are hindered by the lack of human resources and limited financial resources. These two factors are primarily due to over-control exerted by the central government. Local plans developed in the past 2 decades were prepared by external consultants who submitted their outputs to mayors and councils, yet without building the local knowledge and participatory planning skills. Moreover, none of the other national or subnational government were involved in the development of local plans which has hindered the transfer of plans into actual actions.Absence of a clear vision   long-term goalsMayors and councils are elected every 6 years. For most of them, planning shouldn&#x2019;t exceed this time duration as they are keen to achieve &#x201C;something tangible&#x201D; before the next elections to ensure that they will be re-elected. In addition to that, the civil war has limited national and local governments from having a vision and limited all interventions to responding to emerging issues. This in fact has affected local planning as mayors   local actors know only how to deal with short-term actions and interventions.Weak Financial ResourcesThe budget of municipalities and unions and municipalities relies on the funds transferred by the central government through the &#x201C;Independent Municipal Fund&#x201D; (IMF). Taxes collected by sector ministries, such as communication, electricity, water, etc. are deposited at the Ministry of Finance who in its turn transfer designated annual funds to the IMF to be distributed to all municipalities according to certain criteria. Funds are transferred to municipalities normally in 2 tranches during the year, yet without any understanding how this is being planned. The lack of control over funds has always been a key reason for municipalities to decline from discussing long-term planning.  Lack of Community ParticipationMunicipalities are keen to invest all available funding on physical infrastructure and basic services. For them, this is a way to show visible achievements to their voters and respond to the pressure caused by their political figures and parties. Moreover, municipalities pretend that they better understand the challenges exist within their communities and therefore, they are in a position to plan and implement needed interventions. This leads to the absence of any social projects within municipal plans, and also to the absence of interventions that target specific vulnerable groups suc as women, youth and children.Capitalizing on UN-Habitat vast experience in partnering with local authorities and in promoting local participatory planning, the proposed action aims to enhance local capacities and knowledge helping local authorities and actors develop sound and comprehensive local plans taking into account the needs of vulnerable population groups.</narrative>
