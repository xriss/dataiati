   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Objective (1): The capacities of planning institutions and policy makers in Lebanon are strengthened for more informed, sustainable and inclusive National Urban Policies. The existing planning tools and policies in Lebanon such as the National Physical Master Plan for Lebanese Territories (NPMPLT), strategic plans, master plans are reviewed, discussed, and practical recommendations to strengthen these frameworks are proposed.Objective (2): Local urban systems are developed and promoted at the level of poor neighborhoods in 4 citiesA holistic approach would be developed and put in place to mobilize resources which will contribute to the upgrading of vulnerable neighborhoods through improving services and developing the capacities of local structures, while at the same time promoting and strengthening community participation.Objective (3): Basic urban services in poor neighborhoods are enhanced through the implementation of multi-sector interventions This objective shall entail producing up to date, cross-sectoral and holistic spatial analysis and documentation taking into consideration the impact of the Syrian refugee influx into targeted cities. This shall be conducted in a participatory manner, building on the existing local and national knowledge and practices and ensuring a strong commitment to the overall project process. As a result, &#x201C;Neighborhood Profiles&#x201D; will be produced to help different stakeholders better understand the implications of the rapid urban extension on the City. This would involve the compilation of data collected at the neighborhood level and analyzing the emerging challenges and risks. It would also examine the impact of displacement on Lebanese cities and would hence provide a comprehensive portrait of the overall urban situation. The overall outcome would serve as an instrument to design relevant joint initiatives, complementary interventions, and propose policies and appropriate governance structures.</narrative>
