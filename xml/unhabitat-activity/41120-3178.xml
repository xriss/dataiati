   <narrative xml:lang="EN">2.3 Project&apos;s Purpose 

Within the context of the challenges and innovative approaches described
earlier, the GRHS 2009 had identified promising trends and opportunities for
urban planning to be re-established as an effective tool for the management of
human settlement in the 21st century.

Opportunities exist for incorporating the informal sector contribution
in urban development, for responding to environmental concerns and to manage
the carbon footprint of cities and the risk and vulnerability to natural
disasters and conflicts, while at the same time ensuring that planning
contributes to managing the growth of cities and to providing shelter for their
inhabitants. 

The project will therefore contribute positively to a new paradigm of
urban/regional planning that is proactive, strategic, flexible, phased,
spatially integrated and linked with municipal-level budgeting and finance
systems, to contribute to sustainable urban development. 

Despite its aspirations, strategic planning is still regarded as too
complex and ineffective. There is still ample room to make it more appealing,
by documenting successes and providing simplified tools. In this context, it is
intended to develop simplified tools and to continue the revision of existing
ones, in order to best incorporate the principle of sustainability. Attention
to the participatory process around strategic planning will be maintained to
ensure its objectives are relevant for all groups, and particularly the urban
poor.

One way to disseminate new approaches will be via institutions of
education. The 2009 GRHS found that, in more than half of the world&apos;s
countries, not a single university offers a degree in urban planning, whereas
even in countries with established planning degrees the programmes may
emphasize the older &#x2018;rational planning&apos; model with little attention to current
trends and approaches. This programme component will help to address that gap
through partnerships with the international Association of Planning Schools.

An ultimate form of impact at the normative level will be achieved
through supporting countries in updating their national urban policies and urban
planning frameworks. The 2009 GRHS found that the planning frameworks in many
developing countries still reflect a colonial legacy; such laws and regulations
could be modified to facilitate the implementation of some of the new urban
planning approaches discussed above. Likewise multi-level planning systems may
feature overlapping responsibilities and lack coherence. UN-HABITAT will engage
where opportunities will be highest to influence ongoing reform processes,
however, it is aware that achieving results at this level may well take years,
and thus may not lie within the present programme component timeframe.

Urban planning at the neighbourhood and city level can play an important
role in promoting sustainable urban development and in contributing to improved
quality of life in the community. The project will pay particular attention to the
planning of urban expansions, and mechanisms for guiding land occupation
towards more orderly patterns, with higher densities and better proportions
between built-up and street space and wider landscape connectivity and
ecosystem functionality. 

The project will aim at filling several gaps at the normative and
operational levels, namely gaps in policy development and analysis, comparative
benchmarking, availability of good practices, capacity within national and
local actors, as well as institutionalized mechanisms for peer learning and
other forms of capacity building. 

The project strategy is
developed at 3 levels: 

At global level it will develop tools and
     guidance to support local action, reform and learning, including awareness
     materials, technical tools, documented case studies and analysis of good
     practices. At national level, it will work on national urban
     policies as well as to analyze planning frameworks as a way to identify
     opportunities for introducing innovations and engage in reform processes,
     and will work with key stakeholders for capacity building and awareness. At city level, it will develop pilot activities
     for implementation of planning initiatives and provide expertise on key
     urban planning issues to local governments and other stakeholders groups. 

A loop of feedback to gather
lessons learnt and develops policy inputs will also be nurtured from local to
global level.</narrative>
