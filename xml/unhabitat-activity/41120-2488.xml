  </title>
  <description>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This community engagement component will facilitate the
community engagement in the MCUD-funded project to ensure that the design
and plans of the infrastructure projects
are according to needs of the residents, that issues especially pertaining to
making land available for the project are adequately discussed and resolved
with the community members, and the community members are prepared to
participate in the implementation of the infrastructure projects to provide
counterpart contribution and paid labor to ensure than some economic benefits
through employment accrue to the community members. This project will put in
place a local community organization composed of the 168 families capable of
taking the lead in addressing their development needs in partnership with
government, the private sector, UN-Habitat, and other stakeholders. Their continuing
engagement in the projects will build a strong sense of ownership of the
processes and results among the members which will sustain the gains of the
projects.</narrative>
