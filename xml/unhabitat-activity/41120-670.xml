  </title>
  <description>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">By the year 2010, the Municipalities of Kandahar and Spinboldak become stable and secure with the capacity to provide self-sustainable service delivery, through partnerships developed with its stakeholders and institutionalized citizen friendly participatory governance mechanisms.
 
 National Ministries of Urban Development and Interior, developed with capacity to promote policies of decentralized urban governance and service delivery.

The Programme
is to make Kandahar a stable
and secure city with the capacity to provide self-sustainable service
delivery, through partnerships developed
with its stakeholders
and institutionalised citizen
friendly participatory governance
mechanisms. An additional
goal
is
to
develop
the
capacity of National Ministries
of
Urban
Development and Interior, to promote
policies of decentralized urban governance and service delivery
throughout the country. The Programme has FOUR main components: GOVERNANCE, SUSTAINABILITY,
SERVICE DELIVERY AND FACILITATING POLICY ENVIRONMENT.



Under Governance, community
level governance structures in the form of Community Development Councils (CDC) will be established
125 settlements including 25 already functioning. These CDCs will carry out Community
Action Planning and undertake settlement improvements from the
block grants provided by the Programme. Municipality






will be supported
with technical assistance and training to improve governance and
establish a strong partnership with the community structures. It will also
bring the Municipal administration closer to the people by the
establishment of 6 district offices.



Under Sustainability, revenue generation of the
Municipality will be enhanced through
registration of all the properties and revamping the collection system. It is targeted
to provide security of tenure to 37,000 households living in informal settlements who will add to the revenue base. A Municipal Development
Fund
will
be
established as a revolving
fund through the sale of land and other properties for the Municipality to improve infrastructure and provide serviced land on a sustainable basis.



Under Service Delivery,
essential services like water supply, roads, drains and waste management
will be improved specially
targeting low-income areas.



Under Policy Environment, Ministry of Urban Development
and Ministry of Interior will be
assisted in the formulation of urban development policies and
legislation based on Kandahar as a model.



The
Programme has also included the
formulation of the City Profile and Strategic
Municipal Action Plan for the city of Spinboldak
where Projects identified by this process will be funded by the Programme.</narrative>
