  </title>
  <description>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">With the new establishment of new government in 2011 and reform process, the government is proactive in addressing poverty alleviation, development strategies for both urban and rural development as well as renewed commitment for disaster risk reduction through MAPDRR in 2012. 

While effort to address existing vulnerabilities through risk reduction measures are important, however it is also equally important to ensure that new development does not increase or magnify disaster risks for e.g. new settlements in hazard prone areas without incorporating hazard resilient construction features. Further, standalone activities at local level cannot bring in changes in polices and systems and there is a need for evidence based information for decision making to bring in changes in policies, procedures and systems. Window of opportunity exists to mainstream disaster risk reduction into development planning during the reform process and also address climate change adaptation. 

The project intervention will target 2 high risk villages of Myay Bon Township (Rakhine State), Bogalay Township (Ayeyarwaddy Region), Kun Chan Gone Township ( Yangon Region), Ye Township ( Mon State) and Kyun Su Township (Tanintharyi Region) and National level officials and directly benefit 9200 people through trainings, workshops, community level interventions and indirect beneficiary of 100,000 (land use, early warning systems and improved shelter construction activities). Since the project targets at all levels spill over impacts of the project interventions will benefit a much wider level which will be captured later during the course of project implementation. 

The current call of USAID/DCHA/ OFDA Annual Program Statement (APS) No. APS-OFDA 12-000005 for USAID/DCHA /OFDA Annual Program Statement (APS) for FY 2012-Reduction of Vulnerability to coastal natural hazards in Asia is apt in the current context as the government is proactively engaged in addressing development, disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation as part of the reform process.</narrative>
