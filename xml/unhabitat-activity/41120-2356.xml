  </title>
  <description>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Strategic Action Plan referenced above started from the basic question on how local spatial planning can be made more effective to reduce the risk of forced displacement and allow Palestinian communities to respond to their growth needs. The consultative process to answer those questions resulted in 10 Action points, as outlined in the Strategic Action Plan (see Annex).
Palestinian Communities in Area C are the target population. Priorities are being set jointly with the Ministry of Local Government. The project will empower them to develop their own plans and work with their community towards the implementation. It will also help to facilitate legal action and help freeze demolition orders issued by the Israel Authorities. It will provide a clear framework also for future infrastructure investments, allowing also importantly to address the urgent housing needs (based on natural growth).
The project will also empower the Ministry of Local Government to continue to play its lead role in supporting Palestinian Communities in Area C, as planning initiatives are being scaled up. It will allow them to help ensure quality control, full participation by the Palestinian Communities, and maintain an unified and coherent approach to planning in the Palestinian territory and in the engagement with the Israeli Authorities.</narrative>
