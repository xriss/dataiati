   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Seventh Session Of The World Urban Forum (Wuf 7)</narrative>
  </title>
  <description>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The purpose of the project is
to contribute to advance the coordinated implementation of the Habitat Agenda
and ensure that sustainable urban development is increasingly incorporated in
the political and media global Agenda. In particular the project, while
addressing the overall issue related to rapid urbanization with its challenges
and opportunities, seeks to contribute to bridge the existing gaps on:




 Lack of legitimated and effective global
     platforms for interaction and debates, exchange of experience and
     knowledge on sustainable urbanization
 Existent poor coordination and cooperation among
     different constituencies dealing with sustainable development
 Insufficient advocacy and awareness on
     sustainable urbanization, which if improved could be the key to include
     the subject in the global political and media agenda with the support of
     all partners




In
addition, the project seeks to contribute to raising the profile of UN-Habitat
as a leading agency in the field of urbanization, through the image building
potential of such a big United Nations conference, along with the consolidation
of its knowledge base and the incorporation of the conference outcomes in the strategies
and work of the agency from the normative to the operation level.



The main
target population of the project is constituted by decision makers like,
National and Local Government representatives, Parliamentarians, as well as other
actors like Intergovernmental organizations, academies, CSOs, women and youth,
professionals, private sector, foundations and general public. 

Decision
makers are supposed to benefit through their learning on how to make decisions
based on international best policies and practices, coordination mechanisms,
partnerships and synergies shared during the World Urban Forum. The same is
valid for the other categories of Habitat Agenda partners, including the
general public that has to influence, support and sustain the decision making
process. 



The
project responds to the real needs and priorities of target groups, creating
tailored spaces and activities for each category of partners as well as spaces
for interaction. In addition, a results oriented preparation and implementation
of the conference ensure that conclusions are drawn from the conference and
outcomes shared by all participants as well as brought to higher instances of
decision making.

In
particular the seventh session of the world urban forum will act as an
important &#x201C;substantive input gathering&#x201D; opportunity to successively feed the
on-going Post 2015 Development Agenda process as well as the Habitat III
preparation. 



UN-Habitat
will ensure that all thematic priority areas of its work are mainstreamed in
the main debates in order to put its knowledge base as well as its technical
and high level policy advisor, at the disposal of all participants and at the
same time feedbacks are collected for successive consolidation. 



The
active involvement and participation of all constituencies from the preparation
to the implementation including the phase of outcomes gathering, will be key
for the success of the project which seeks the central involvement of member
states of the governing body of UN-Habitat and more importantly the WUF7 host
country. 



The city of Medellin will also play a key role
not only to ensure an effective preparation of the conference but also as a
living urban laboratory open to participants, where several strategies and urban
tools are being implemented, and a clear model of sustainable urban development
is shown to the world. To this aim several physical and non-physical
interventions will be implemented in order to leave a tangible legacy to the
host city and its citizens.</narrative>
