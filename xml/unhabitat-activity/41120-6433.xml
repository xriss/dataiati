   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Urban Legislation Knowledge Sharing To Support Nua Implementation (Urban Lex)</narrative>
  </title>
  <description>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The purpose of this project
is to strengthen the role of urban legislation in the Latin American and
Caribbean region through knowledge-sharing to support the Implementation of the
New Urban Agenda. This project is an opportunity to further understand the
regional actors, network and thematic at hand to be able to support the
implementation of the Regional NUA plan as part of an extension of the previous
project on urban knowledge.



UrbanLex is a free online
global &#x2018;library&#x2019; of the legal instruments that govern urban development. The
database features seven critical areas of urban law that are essential to the
sustainability and development of urban areas. Under each legal area the user
will find a catalogue of laws from a wide range of countries from all regions.
The aim of UrbanLex is to be more advanced than a simple data repository, while
still being easy for non-experts to use. A principal element of UrbanLex&#x2019;s
value is in the digests that accompany each law, providing an accessible
description of its key contents and objectives. The laws can be searched by
region, country, theme, and keywords. 



The seven critical areas of
urban law featured on the database include:



?
Taxation, Finance  
Economic Development

?
Governance and Government

?
Infrastructure and Basic
Services

?
Urban Planning

?
Disaster Recovery and Urban
Resilience

?
Building and Construction

?
Land and Environment



Beneath the digest a link to
an external website or document that is relevant to the law is also provided.
The purpose of the link is to provide the user with an opportunity to learn
more about the law and what kind of effects it may have. Many of the external
links will lead to information provided by our partners who specialize in the
relevant legal area and expose the user to research institutions in countries
all over the world.



The reality is that
researchers and urban stakeholders do not have the time or resources to find
and compile urban laws. As a result, a knowledge gap has formed around urban
legislation, especially in developing countries where governments do not make
all laws, and particularly secondary regulations and local law, available
online. This gap is obstructing research efforts and limiting the capacity to
develop solutions. Urban residents and planners watch development take place in
their cities and towns without any adherence to the legal framework, partly
because of the limited access to the laws that shape that framework. UrbanLex
provides a central source of information that not only fills this knowledge gap
but also makes research and comparative analysis easy. 



The New Urban Agenda (NUA)
emphasizes the importance of collaborating with international and regional
organizations and agencies, including within the United Nations system and with
multilateral environmental agreements, development partners, international and
multilateral financial institutions, regional development banks, the private
sector and other stakeholders, to improve the coordination of their urban and
rural development strategies and programs to implement an integrated approach
to sustainable urbanization, incorporating the implementation of the New Urban
Agenda.



It also reaffirms the need
to improve United Nations system-wide coordination and coherence in the area of
sustainable urban development by promoting exchanges of best-practices to
capture and share the lessons learned and the potential for knowledge transfer.
The Agenda recommends expanding regional and international North-South,
South-South and triangular cooperation opportunities, as well as subnational,
decentralized and city-to-city (peer) cooperation to contribute to sustainable
urban development, develop Capacities and promote exchanges of urban solutions
and mutual learning at all levels and to all relevant actors.



In this regard, it is
essential to reaffirm the importance of sharing good and best practices in
transferring knowledge and methodologies, as well as the results obtained, to
other authorities or local organizations struggling to find solutions to
address similar problems. While in different contexts, urban centers face
similar problems to meet the rights of their inhabitants. Therefore, the
systematization and transfer of knowledge, whether in a database or using the
resources of a network of experts, is a great opportunity to seek concrete
solutions and technical capacity to promote sustainable urban development. 



LAC and urban legislation



Latin America is the most urbanized
region in the world, with more than 80% of its population living in cities.
This urban growth took place in the last forty years (1950-1990) due to a
massive migration, commonly referred to as the &quot;urban explosion&quot;. The
rate of urban growth has declined significantly and yielded a second urban
transition, which deals with the failures and problems resulting from this
accelerated growth. Therefore, it is the right moment to focus efforts on
promoting sustainable urban development.



As a middle-income region characterized
by widespread inequality, Latin America and the Caribbean exhibit different
levels of development and knowledge. Its current status represents an
achievement, where several outstanding practices have resulted in surprisingly
positive results, but also a permanent challenge, which has not guaranteed
sustained and inclusive results for all.

This context has produced an
exceptional range of urban practices. The numerous contrasts, great
achievements and continuous bottlenecks offer a rich laboratory for the
exchange with the countries of the region and around the world. While cities
have their specificities, there are similarities with other regions of the
world, and much can be learned from the experience of Latin America and the
direction it is taking.



The recognition of Latin American and
Caribbean practices at the Dubai International Award for Best Practices
demonstrates the richness of projects and initiatives in the region. Since
1996, LAC comprises about 40% of all practices received twice a year, and have
also received better and state award winners. Other awards also spearheaded by
the ROLAC office, such as the Inspiring Practice open-call in 2016 that
received 146 projects submitted from 16 countries, showed an encouraging number
of projects still in the implementation phase already putting in practice
various concepts of sustainable urban development.



The Inspiring Practices Open-call for
the New Urban Agenda aimed to launch a cycle of knowledge management to support
the implementation of this New Agenda. The idea was to take advantage of the
capillarity of regional networks to give the opportunity to more projects to
participate, to be recognized, to learn and to teach. This initiative has been
co-organized with Flacma, the Ibero-American and Caribbean Forum on Best
Practices and Mercociudades.



The projects received reaffirm the
innovative nature of the region on its path towards integrated development. All
the projects underwent a thorough evaluation by a technical committee where
they were evaluated based on pre-established criteria in the bases of the call.


The four finalist projects stood out
for providing an integrated view of urban development, demonstrating tangible
results and tackling the cross-cutting agenda items on climate change, gender,
human rights and youth.



Out of the 146 practices, 86 projects
submitted a relevant response on urban legislation, yet the answers were still
vague and many times did not connect the project with local and national laws.
Urban legislation was often not seen as part of the sustainability of the
project. This shows a gap in understanding the importance of legislation in sustainable
urban development. Without effective urban law, urban development interventions
are one-off projects. With it, they become long term programmes that can be
used by citizens and investors to plan for the future. There can be no
sustainable development without good laws.



This provides an opportunity to
strengthen the understanding and connection between the projects and
legislation in the region. It can also provide great input for further research
that can shape local laws, considering different complexity, density and
diversity of urban life. This project approach is partnership-driven, and
supports comparative analysis with real-time relevance.



Thus, the project will work with its
current networks such as the Iberoamerican and the Caribbean Forum of Best
Practices, the Urban Legislation partners in the region and the other partners
mentioned from the open-call. This project will also aim to increase geographic
coverage in the region, especially to include the Caribbean.</narrative>
