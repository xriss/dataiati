   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Achieving Planning And Land Rights In Area C, West Bank</narrative>
  </title>
  <description>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Spatial planning has proven to be a
remarkable entry point for the strengthening of core state functions and
supporting state building efforts in Palestine. UN-Habitat and other
stakeholders with support from key bilateral partners/donors provided support to
MoLG in a range of spatial planning interventions designed to defend the rights
of Palestinian communities in Area C and bolster the capacity of core state
institutions to perform their functions.
By end of 2018 through all initiatives there were 145 multi-layered
plans produced with and for Palestinian communities in Area C, over 10,000
Palestinians involved in participatory processes in determining the shape and
design of their future built environment and freezing the eviction and
displacement of more than 55,000 Palestinians in the West Bank territory. In
addition, EU and EU member states, and other resource partners are supporting
the implementation of a range of social infrastructure projects in the
Palestinian communities that has prepared local outline plans in Area C through
the Municipal Development and Lending Fund (MDLF). Complementing these efforts
by supporting mapping of land rights in Area C is considered another milestone
to be achieved by all interested stakeholders. 

UN-Habitat has leveraged its spatial planning interventions
in Area C by working closely with the Palestinian partners, especially MoLG,
the Area &#x2018;C&#x2019; national coordination office (now, known as Area &#x2018;C&#x2019; national
coordination team) affiliated to the Prime Minister&#x2019;s Office (PMO), and
Negotiation Affairs Unit affiliated to the Palestinian Liberation Organization.
Likewise, within the land sector, UN-Habitat joined forces with development
partners, especially World Bank to support the land road map of the PA in 2017
to support community mapping of land rights, with focus on Area C. 

Since, Area C is
dealt with as an indispensable part of the West Bank, the planning, land, and
development work there has been on-and-off and indirectly coordinated by donors
through the Local Aid Coordination Secretariat (LACS) that supports the Local
Development Forum under the AHLC mechanism in the Palestinian territory in
providing coherent technical and financial assistance based on national
priorities, with Area C on top of the list, and in line with the OECD-DAC Paris
Declaration on Aid Effectiveness of 2005. Among the key players in this forum
is the EU Representative Office in Jerusalem and Office of the United Nations
Special Coordinator for the Middle East Peace Process (UNSCO) (representing UN
agencies in Palestine, including UN-Habitat), along with MoLG that chairs the
municipal development and local governance sector working group. Relevant to
this is that the LACS mechanism largely mirror the structure of the key
programmes set out in the National Policy Agenda (2017-2022). Nonetheless, for
land issues there has been no designated forum for the resource partners to
convene and coordinate joint activities and ensure complementarity. The EU
takes stock of discussions and commitments that have taken place at both
global, regional, and local level, including the EU Joint Strategy (EJS) in
support of Palestine (2017-2020). The EJS was endorsed by the Heads of Missions
in December 2016. The EU&#x2019;s part of the EJS was formally adopted on December 8, 2017.
A related Result-Oriented Framework was prepared to monitor the impact and
results of European development cooperation, and to inform policy dialogue with
the PA institutions. Area C appears as a geographical focus in some sectors&apos;
outcome indicators.

The project aims at supporting the Palestinian local
authorities to deliver planning and land based functions to communities at risk
of displacement in the Israeli controlled Area C of the West Bank. This will
contribute to providing safe, gender-sensitive, inclusive, and resilient built
environment that would have a broader positive impact, especially on youth and
women groups who will be engaged in the process. The proposed work will
complement the work that has been initiated in partnership with local community
based on the statutory planning tool - local outline plan - prepared and
submitted to the ICA. This planning approach confirms with the policy adopted
by UN agencies in September 2015, more specifically, in the &#x201C;One UN&#x201D; approach
to spatial planning in &#x201C;Area C&#x201D; of the occupied West Bank[1].

The planning and land interventions proposed under this
project are in alignment with priority no. 2 of the Area C Strategic Framework
2018-2019 re. enhance and empower the work of local government units in Area C
and extend their management/administrative reach to respond more nimbly to the
needs of local population. This is of course in alignment with pillar 2 of
National Policy Agenda 2017-2022 related to enhancing public services
provision. Furthermore, mapping of land rights in Area C has been supported by
the PA and development partners in the &#x2018;Road Map for Reforming Palestinian Land
Sector&#x2019; of 2017. In the same time, the project responds to the United Nations
Development Assistance Framework (UNDAF) (2018-2022) for the Palestinian
territory, more specifically, Strategic Priority 1: Supporting Palestine&#x2019;s path
to independence. 

This project contributes to realizing the 2030 Agenda for
Sustainable Development adopted by State of Palestine in 2015. Following the Second
Palestinian Urban Forum[2], which was particularly
designed for this purpose, planning and land-based interventions in Area C were
defined as key component safeguarding the Area C territory which is a
cornerstone to building a sustainable state that works under the normative
frameworks of the SDGs, in particular, SDG11 and SDG 16.

The project will contribute to localizing the following
paragraph of New Urban Agenda, inter-alia: 

&#xA7; 13(f). We
envisage cities and human settlements that: Promote age- and gender-responsive
planning and investment for sustainable, safe and accessible urban mobility for
all and resource-efficient transport systems for passengers and freight,
effectively linking people, places, goods, services and economic opportunities;

&#xA7; 14(a) Leave no
one behind, by &#x2026;. providing equal access
for all to physical and social infrastructure and basic services, as well as
adequate and affordable housing;

&#xA7; 29. We commit
ourselves to strengthening the coordination role of national, subnational and
local governments, as appropriate, and their collaboration with other public
entities and non-governmental organizations in the provision of social and
basic services for all, including generating investments in communities that
are most vulnerable to disasters and those affected by recurrent and protracted
humanitarian crises.

&#xA7; 91. We will
encourage appropriate regulatory frameworks and support to local governments in
partnering with communities, civil society and the private sector to develop
and manage basic services and infrastructure, ensuring that the public interest
is preserved and concise goals, responsibilities and accountability mechanisms
are clearly defined.
