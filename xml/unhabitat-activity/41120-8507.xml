   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Establishment Of One Stop Youth Information Resource Centre- Mandera County One Stop Youth Centre</narrative>
  </title>
  <description>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project implementation process will include the
following activities:

a)
Youth Space and Learning Facility

The applying youth and youth led organizations in Mandera County will
have a space and an opportunity to develop programs that will enhance their
capacity through active participation in peace building, leadership,
development, gender inclusivity, and innovation and learning activities at the
youth resource centre.

b) Providing mentorship to the youth led projects:

The UN-Habitat Youth Mentorship program was developed over
the past 3 years to support Urban Youth Fund projects. Youth groups have been
mentored to great success in their project implementation and creation of
impact to their community. The mentorship program allows UN-Habitat to provide
deeper and better support to those receiving grants from the Youth Fund, by
strengthening the sustainability of the projects through capacity development
tailored for young social entrepreneurs. This mentorship programme will also be
replicated to promote learning and exchanges between the different projects in
Mandera and the local community. This mentorship programme provides to both the
recipients of the fund and non- recipients. 

d) Building the capacity of the Mandera Youth and the
community

The capacity building project will aim to build on the
resilience of youth. This will involve building of skills that will help the
selected youth and other community youth groups will be expected to attend
various project management and entrepreneurship training that will be necessary
in their project implementation while also promoting entrepreneurship. The
training covers modules on project management, organizational management,
financial management, reporting, communication, monitoring, evaluation and
developing of business plans, marketing and financial inclusion. The training also provides a space for
discussing the individual projects in depth while also restructuring the
project along the same idea so as to achieve the intended project goals

e) Monitoring and evaluation:

a) Remote
Monitoring

The youth unit team will make the necessary resources available
for providing project support via field visits, phone, email, and written
correspondence to project beneficiaries seeking assistance.

b) Monitoring
Visits

This includes physical field visits to the respective
projects to assess their progress. This is also an opportune time to provide
feedback to the projects and advise what can be done better to achieve better
results. 

f) Dissemination of Programme Results

Based on project reports, monitoring visits and
communication with beneficiaries, the youth unit team and the county government
of Mandera will collaborate in documenting the projects in a case study
publication. The case study will be published by Accept International and
UN-Habitat. UN-Habitat will organize and attend project-related events in order
to showcase and critique the results and implementation of activities at the
Youth Resource centre. 

a)
Research on relevant thematic areas.

By undertaking research on best practices in youth-led
development, the fund enhances awareness of youth-led development and the
urgency to ensure that youth perspectives are incorporated into local,
national, and international development policies and strategies. It is expected that the projects will provide best
practices and innovative ideas on active youth development that can be shared
globally for other conflict and fragile context. Documenting these best
practices and analyzing their impact to the community, their influence to
governance structures, consequent inclusion of youth by various stakeholders in
decision making among other will be interesting to have.

Representation and
participation of youth in democratic decision making processes

The project will work hand in hand with the county government of
Mandera in developing forums and councils on youth and peace building. With
this youth will well be represented during the implementation process.

g) Knowledge and exchange visits

The project will conduct knowledge and exchange visits in the region
and the national level. This will increase on exposure of the project
beneficiaries while also creating a learning platform on social innovation and
entrepreneurship.</narrative>
