   <narrative xml:lang="EN">To increase social inclusion for all through the whole
school approach, child protection and social protection interventions will
focus on specialized responses for those children who already dropped out of school or are at risk of
being excluded, and are exposed to other risks that will have a long-lasting
effect on their future.


The lack of social
protection mechanisms and specialized child protection services exacerbates the
already difficult life circumstances facing IDP families and host communities.
This is particularly true for families facing marginalization and social
exclusion, such as families with children with disabilities. Further attention
needs to be paid to resilience building and strengthening of existing social
protection systems.


In response to the complex crisis, the UN &#x2018;Education
for All&apos; programme will contribute to ensuring that more children and young people have access
to quality learning, skills building and community participation including
those in hard to reach and besieged areas. 

A joint planning model, such as the Municipal and Neighborhood
Action Planning approach used by Syrian municipalities, will be used to jointly
identify needs, priority schools and complementary projects, facilitate access
and approvals and maximize local participation. The approach envisions schools
to act as a geographical anchor point where collective interventions occur both
within the school itself and the adjoining neighborhoods to meet multiple
dimensions of children&apos;s needs in a more holistic manner. Coordination on the
ground involves local discussion groups communicating with various
stake-holders in order to effectively map out available services and address
key gaps.

A wide variety of children&apos;s critical nutritional,
educational, health and protection needs will be addressed by the UN agencies
through the provision of different services. Children excluded from schools
will be supported with integrated responses that will ensure their social
inclusion and equal access to services and opportunities. In addition, schools
will be a platform where teachers can access professional development
opportunities and where communities access awareness-raising activities, social
protection services, as well as livelihood assistance.</narrative>
