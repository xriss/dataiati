   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Improving Sustainability Of Wash Service Delivery In Za&#x2019;Atari And Azraq Refugee Camps.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This initiative will develop a systematic way of assessing refugee communities&apos; needs and developing a systems approach to section of technologies and management systems, aimed to improve the operation and maintenance activities of the WASH sector in the campsThe project marks a new operation and maintenance approach towards more sustainable WAH provision in two Syria refugee camps, which offers high visibility. Besides, Best practices will be introduced to promote activities that will propel communities towards achievement of SDG Goal 6: Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all.Therefore, along with its efforts
to introduce good practices and knowledge on an alternative, cost efficient,
community managed WASH system in the camps, which is more sustainable, it will
recommend application of tools and guidelines that can be used to implement, or
monitor and evaluate for sustainability of WASH maintenance and operations in
the future.As per the registered refugee
figures from UNHCR data portal (8 March 2017), 79,737 refugees in Za&apos;atari camp
and 53,833 refugees in Azraq camp will directly benefit from this project,
which will also enhance role of refugee Women and Youth to UNHCR and UNICEF
supported construction, operation and maintenance of WASH facilities in the
camps.In terms of access to services, the
refugees are dissatisfied predominantly in related to water supply shortage due
to wastage, misuse and other pipeline leaks and spills as well as due to lack
of storage containers and the distance to the tap stand. Similarly, the
distance between WASH blocks and shelters are larger, and with considerably
more people sharing the facilities creating issues of privacy, safety and
security, particularly for women and girls. Many households have constructed
their own facilities, primary used by women and young girls, however, most
drain in to an open pit, posing significant health concerns. Disease outbreak
was reported and hygiene promotion activities intensified in the camp focusing on
prevention and treatment.The project will require
interaction with many different stakeholders including local authorities,
UNICEF, UNHCR, water and sanitation experts of stakeholders, local institutions
and, improvement of the water and sewage services will be achieved through
innovative operational and maintenance approachesThis initiative will develop a
systematic way of assessing refugee communities&apos; needs and developing a systems
approach to section of technologies and management systems, aimed to improve
the operation and maintenance activities of the WASH sector. UN-Habitat
intervention will ensure clarity of links between partners&apos; roles and camp
coordination structure by assuring technical provisions to establish a
well-functioning coordination and monitoring system for the WASH sector. It
will conduct rapid analysis of data and issues, including technical and
management gaps in the WASH sector, and work on solutions with key partners,
and advice agencies of last resort for service delivery needs.The response will also introduce
best practices and guidelines to strengthen and improve overall WASH services
through an agreed list of WASH minimum standards and requirements for WASH in
camp settings. These standards will be based on national standards, Sphere
standards, UNHCR WASH standards for refugees and have been agreed by all WASH
partners including the Government of Jordan.</narrative>
