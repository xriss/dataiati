  <description>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Based on the problem-what is
     the purpose of this project? Therefore, the hereby proposed
     project represents the UN-Habitat contribution to what should become a
     longer and more comprehensive effort leading to the reinforcement of the
     national capacity for proper urban planning and development. The project
     will complement the on-going Participatory
     Slum Upgrading Programme (PSUP), a global UN-Habitat initiative
     currently in its second phase of implementation, and will serve as
     preparatory work to the UN-Habitat proposal to the Innovative Fund of the Millennium
     Challenge Account - Zambia (MCAZ), which is expected to open in August
     2013.The
     aim of this proposal is to assist the GRZ and the LCC in building adequate
     institutional capacity at both central and local levels regarding urban
     planning, especially concerning city extensions. This includes the support to the development of a robust urban
     policy and regulatory framework for Zambia and the Lusaka city in
     particular. Residents
     living in unplanned settlements will benefit directly through improved city
     planning which is expected to lead to reduced overcrowding, adequate water
     supply, and improved environmental conditions, improved sanitation, good
     drainage, scheduled collection of solid waste and more importantly secured
     land tenure and adequate housing for most of the population and continued
     improvement in environmental conditions. Through
     participatory planning processes in which not only government officials at
     National and City levels are consulted but residents of unplanned
     settlements are also consulted through their Residents Development
     Committees&apos; (RDC) which are the recognized community based organisations
     that represent their interests.By
     building GRZ and the LCC in urban planning, especially concerning city
     extensions including providing support to the development of a robust
     urban policy and regulatory framework for Zambia and the Lusaka city in
     particular. Proposed
     solutions: 

(i) Reinforce
Institutional capacity regarding urban
planning, especially regarding city extensions and urban densification, in
Lusaka.

(ii) Promote Inter-sectorial coordination and
multi-stakeholder dialogue to start developing a National Urban Policy.

Who
     are the possible partners internal and external that will help in
     implementing the solution? 

(i) Internal: UNCT, ILO, UNCTAD, UNICEF

(ii )External: MLGH, LCC, RDC and relevant CBOs

Is
     UN-Habitat providing knowledge services or high-level policy advisory
     services?
