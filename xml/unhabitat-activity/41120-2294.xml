   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Strengthening Partnerships For A New African Urban Agenda</narrative>
  </title>
  <description>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project aims at raising the profile of urbanization as an imperative for development in Africa. It will contribute towards promoting democratic governance through mobilization, sensitization and strengthening of non-state actors to partner effectively with sub-Sahara African governments in articulating Africa&apos;s priorities for the next 20 years with focus on; Urban planning for streets and common spaces, youths and urban job creation, urban inequalities and poverty, governance and the role of non-state actors including private sector, research and knowledge institutions.Project implementation will entail practical and evidence &#x2013; based research, consultative workshops, policy dialogues and capacity building for key partners&apos; networks and government officials who are engaged with driving the urban agenda. It specifically addresses the current disconnection between state and non-state actors, and seeks to build collaboration and complementarity around agreed priorities and promote support for them at the national and global levels. The project focuses on strengthened partnerships in identifying, formulating and promoting sustainable urbanization with the identified components as pillars for programme implementation.The participants &#x2013; HAPs and selected officers of national governments benefit directly by participating in all planned expert group meetings, validation workshops, policy dialogues and training sessions. They will contribute directly to the priority identification and formulation of strategies. They will benefit from the networking and exchanges of experiences, all backstopped by UN-Habitat expertise at the headquarters and at country level. They will be equipped with knowledge of current challenges ofurbanization and what their roles are in addressing them.Currently, HAPs are disjointed and dissatisfied with programmes of governments in urban planning. They are also displeased that UN-Habitat policies concerning them have not been systematic and coordination has been inadequate. The project provides an opportunity to strengthen the position of HAPs in their countries with technical support from UN-Habitat. It also offers UN-Habitat the opportunity to streamline its engagement with its partners especially towards Habitat III.The representatives of HAPs would be trained and involved in validating the priorities through their participation in supporting the preparation of the national reports on Habitat III, validate research findings at sub-regional level, and further equipped with conceptual skills required to promote the new vision of UN-Habitat as it strengthens the New African Urban Agenda. They will in turn be more effective actors at their neighborhood, and influence policies at the local and national levels in partnership with their municipalities and national governments.This project aims to build an understanding between non-state actors and national governments, thereby building an African consensus with a strong momentum of support for a continent-wide urban agenda for the next 20 years. The project will build collaboration and complementarity between state and non-state actors through inclusive and participatory preparation for the post 2015 agenda and national reports for Habitat III.The proposed solutions are the most appropriate ways of raising a critical awareness which is required to drive the Urban Agenda. CSOs often fail to make the connections between felt problems/disasters and lack systemic planning of the human settlement they live in. They further fail to appreciate the impact of certain types of policies on physical planning issues. This project seeks to build a strong balance for the urbanization tripod - of Government, CSOs including academia, and the private sector. The solutions are aimed at consensus building, thereby removing the mutual suspicion between state and non-state actors.The partners include UN agencies working in the African region, African Union and related institutions, private sector operators and national governments. The UN-Habitat would be providing knowledge services, high level advisory services as well as support skills through consultations, network management, training and reporting.</narrative>
