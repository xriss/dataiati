   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Achieving Local Solutions To Displacement Crises In Somalia: A Human Security Approach To Durable Solutions</narrative>
  </title>
  <description>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Human
mobility should be considered in conjunction with the spatial repercussions
that population movements have on the locations affected by displacement. Over
the course of more than two decades of conflict, access to land, security of
tenure and more broadly settlement
have become central issues affecting Somalia&#x2019;s security and stability going
forwards; influencing the country&#x2019;s trajectory towards recovery and development
in future; and ultimately playing a key role in establishing the foundations
for human security for displaced populations, returnees, other mobile groups
and their hosts. 



Issues
related to land tenure in Somalia are inextricably linked to voluntary and
forced migration. Land is central to many different economic, social, cultural,
environmental and political goals, making tenure security vital for peace and
stability. Yet, land becomes a conflict driver when forms of dispossession take
place, or when rights to land use, access and transferability are violated. Any
disruptive or forcefully imposed change in how groups and individuals connect
with their land usually produces contentions, which may &#x2013; and in Somalia did -
result in forms of organised violence. Conflict, natural disasters or rapid
social and economic transformations (e.g. state formation, industrialization
and urbanisation) trigger migrations that separate populations from their
belongings, assets, livelihoods and the cultural landmarks they identify with.
Having in place fair mechanisms to protect formal and customary rights to
access, use and transferability of land and regulate land use and allocation is
essential to prevent outbreaks of conflict and violence.



Regarding movements
and dispossessions produced by conflict and natural disasters, in Somalia the
number of internally displaced has almost tripled over the past ten years. The
urban dimension of internal displacement is evident and corroborated by the
trends in rural to urban migration which has, over the past ten years, averaged
rates of 4.1-4.5%. The relevance of cities in strengthening security,
responding to large population influxes and consolidating peace dividends is
unquestionable. Yet, city expansion in major urban centres in Somalia is
largely unplanned and unregulated and land is arbitrarily redistributed.
Increased commercial interests have triggered large-scale investments, as well
as construction works for commercial and residential structures. However, the
trickle-down effect of this renewed commercial interest is extremely limited.
Vulnerable populations hardly ever are in the position to harness the benefits
of this rapid transformation. Displaced persons, returnees urban dwellers and
urban poor are caught in a negative feedback loop, whereby the lack of
regulation, good governance and law enforcement, exacerbates insecure access to
land, exposure to violent land disputes and forcible eviction, as well as
exclusion from public service delivery. This vulnerability and marginalization
contributes to pervasive fragility and conflict, In sum, nascent formal
institutions are unequipped to equitably re-establish tenure units, and
customary rights are often arbitrary and not accessible to &#x201C;identity-defined&#x201D;
strangers - this would be the case of returnees and migrants who cannot access,
control and transfer land customary rights on the same grounds as local
communities.



The recent
announcement by the government of Kenya expressing intention to repatriate
Somali refugees has raised the already prominent issue to a critical level in
some areas. In the absence of a well-established legislative framework and law
enforcement procedures for land, context appropriate, consensus based, and
equitable solutions to land remain key establishing foundations for sustainable
recovery and stability. Conversely, the failure to address land issues,
security of tenure and sustainable housing could result in instability,
conflict and the destitution of affected groups. 



The multidimensional
aspect of community driven responses to instability and conflict mitigation
related to mobility and housing, land and property as well as urban planning
requires a multi-agency approach, through which each agency will capitalize on
its own experience and expertise. The International Organization for Migration
(IOM) and the United Nations Human Settlements Programme (UN-HABITAT) have the
expertise and mandates to support these locally owned processes in addressing
mobility/displacement and space/urban planning. IOM, as the leading agency on
mobility and migration, will utilize its experience in supporting community
driven approaches to respond to drivers of displacement and mitigate disputes
related to mobility and movements, while UN-HABITAT, as the leading agency for
urban planning and addressing issues related to space, including land, will
employ its expertise in supporting locally driven approaches to promote
participatory urban planning, participatory settlement upgrading, resolve land disputes and map conflicts and
dispute resolution mechanisms related to housing, land and property.



Given the scale of
Somalia&#x2019;s population movements summarized above, geographic targeting through a
first phase of support needs to be carefully considered and the following
criteria are used to prioritize targeting for this project. Firstly, areas
impacted by the return of Somalis from Dadaab refugee camp are prioritized for
this intervention. Whilst the number of IDPs by far exceeds the number of those
returning from Dadaab, the former are living in protracted situations of
displacement and the latter will return over a short space of time. This
justification is therefore based on the time critical impact that returns will
have in existing fragile contexts and the accompanying need to provide support
at social, infrastructural and legislative levels. The second criterion is to
target those areas highly impacted by internal displacement particularly those
not currently covered by existing interventions. When combined with the first
targeting, of areas being impacted by return, the following areas become an
obvious priority.

For the funding from
the Human Security Trust Fund, the interventions will focus on Kismayo and
Afmadow, while additional co-funding from other sources (Peacebuilding Fund,
etc.) will focus on other locations within Jubaland. Members of the joint
programme currently have either an existing operational footprint or will
expand to these locations in the coming months which also supports the
feasibility of supporting interventions there.
Furthermore, all of the above referenced locations have been identified as
priority by the Federal Government Ministry of Interior and are therefore in
line with government&#x2019;s current focus for the types of interventions proposed.</narrative>
