  </title>
  <description>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The purpose of this project is to
provide for shelter needs of the most vulnerable refugee families and thereby
establish practices that can be replicated, and also to support the provision
of basic WASH services in communities under strain. The project specifically
addresses the limited capacity of municipalities to meet increased WASH demands
in communities under strain. The target populations are refugee families
benefitting from shelter support and municipalities, as well as host
communities and refugee families benefitting from better WASH services.



The project seeks to identify real
priorities through consulting affected communities applying the house-to-house
surveys and local focus group discussions; interventions will be designed and
implemented to meet these priorities. The experience gained and lessons learnt
from the first phase will help build up a base for a more comprehensive project
with sustainable impacts. The current project seeks to improve the living
conditions (shelter   WASH) in accommodations rented by refugee families in
the three KR governorates using a combination of methods as required. The
self-help procedure will be applied to mobilize a quick start of work and ensure
simultaneous independent progress. An NGO will be employed to manage this
process. The self-help will create a win-win situation where the house owner
replaces the contractor and employs tenants as labor (if they are capable).
Both parties will benefit from the upgrade. For owners unable to undertake the
construction management, the NGO will provide that. Habitat will do the
assessment, monitoring and make sure the evaluations are correct and quality of
work is up to standard.

Within the self-help method for improving shelters, the house owner is given
either cash or coupons to buy building materials for fixing is house and pay
for labor as well. The cash is provided in installments (two or more) based on
the type of upgrade and level of completion. The NGO will hand out the
installments based on monitoring reports and provide technical assistance for
implementing the job. Habitat will be monitoring the implementation, providing
technical assistance and quality control. 

The proposed solutions include a range of affordable shelter support
options, eg cash for owner driven improvements on host houses, basic
improvements of incomplete houses being rented to allow basic appropriate
shelter, etc. The possible partners are local NGO Kurds; basic services
directorates of Duhok, Erbil and Suleymaniah municipalities, Governorates and
Governors of Duhok, Erbil and Suleymaniah, UNHCR, non-camp Shelter/WASH working
group. UN-Habitat will incorporate lessons learnt into the non-camp
Shelter/WASH strategy.

It is expected that the number of assisted families will be as follows:
Duhok 225 families, Erbil 160 in Sulymania 48 families (total 433 families in
three governorates). The amount allocated for each family will be around $1600
on average allowing more sustainable rehabilitation to be undertaken. 

As for WASH projects, the municipalities in KR are engaged in numerous
upgrading projects and are in need of support to improve their service delivery
and bridge the existing funding gap. Habitat will engage in supporting
municipalities in implementing their projects in areas with high concentrations
of Syrian refugee families. The support will be in the form of procurement, technical
assistance encouraging coordination between service provision directorates and
direct implementation.</narrative>
