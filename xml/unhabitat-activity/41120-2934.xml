  </title>
  <description>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Afghanistan
Urban Peacebuilding Programme (AUPP)is predicated on the vital linkage
between state-society relations, local government capacity, and basic service
provision in strengthening safety and security. It will provide direct
assistance to the development of state capacity at the sub-national level,
focusing on municipal administrations in eight of the country&apos;s most strategic
cities. 

By
concentrating on the urban terrain of peacebuilding and state building, the
programme will strengthen the production of public goods, especially security;
improve local government responsiveness and accountability; and strengthen
partnerships with communities, civil society, and security providers,
contributing to collective efficacy&#x2013; all of which are central peacebuilding and
state building goals in the New Deal (see Box 1). The programme complements
the international community&apos;s efforts to support a highly centralized state
building approach, with a bottom-up strategy that builds the state out from community
and subnational levels.



Box 1: Operationalizing the &quot;New
Deal&quot; in Afghan Cities: 

The New Deal for
Engagement in Fragile States was endorsed by self-identified fragile states
and bilateral and multilateral donor partners in 2011. It was adopted as a key
step for improving the ways in which national and international partners work
in conflict-affected and fragile states. It prioritizes five interdependent
Peacebuilding and State building Goals (PSGs): 

 1. Legitimate politics: Foster
inclusive political settlements and conflict resolution.

 2. Security: Establish
and strengthen people&apos;s security.

 3.
 Justice: Address
injustices and increase people&apos;s access to justice.

 4. Economic Foundations: Generate
employment and improve livelihoods.

 5. Revenues   Services: Manage
revenue and build capacity for accountable and fair   service
delivery.

In
line with the principles of the New Deal, the AUPP will support city-led
and city-owned processes in support of national Peacebuilding and State
building Goals (PSGs). It will emphasize
local capacity development and utilization of city systems. It will invest
heavily in activities that rebuild the social contract from the bottom-up,
including efforts to strengthen the legitimacy and accountability of state
bodies, reciprocal linkages between local and national institutions, and social
solidarity. 

Afghanistan is one of
the seven New Deal Pilot Countries, and is supported by Denmark, Netherlands,
United Kingdom as partner countries.
Several of the key international supporters of the GoIRA have signed up
to the New Deal, including Switzerland; The Netherlands; Germany, EU, Norway,
among others.
