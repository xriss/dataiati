   <narrative xml:lang="EN">A Short Step From Improved Wash To Healthier Communities</narrative>
  </title>
  <description>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The
project pursues to provide communities with high-quality hygiene education,
improved sanitation focused on zero open defecation (ZOD) and access to safe
drinking water in order to give them basis for healthy and productive life
through continuous community mobilization and engagement. Heading for the
long-lasting goal of the Dry Zone program level outcome to achieve improved
nutrition, the project aims to create an enabling environment to contribute to two
major programme outcomes: safeguarded access to and sustainable use of natural
resources, and improved nutrition, sanitation and hygiene practices.The
project will work to improve access to safe drinking water, aiming at decreasing
the incidence and intensity of diarrhea and water-borne diseases in order to
improve nutrition.Overall, the project is structured alongside three
expected accomplishments:




 Local government improves policy and includes in
     their villages plans WASH-nutrition sensitive interventions (EA1)
 Communities are utilizing and running functioning
     and sustainable WASH services and their capacity to use and maintain
     these, and improve hygiene practices in general, is strengthened (EA2)
 Empowered communities practice healthy behaviors
     with incidence of water-borne and fecal-transmission diseases reduced
     (EA3) 


Access to
improved sanitation with zero incidence of open defecation and to affordable,
suitable and sustainable water supply is crucial to improve basic health. Hence
the project outputs aim at strengthening community&apos;s knowledge and attitudes
regarding hygiene practices, stressing on ZOD, and that communities do not only
have access to affordable suitable and sustainable WASH services - from a
better understanding of how to identify, prioritize and materialize them - but communities
are empowered to manage those, and are responsible for their sustainability.
The project interventions will build an enabling environment in which
communities are aware of their roles and responsibilities, it will center on
Behavior Change Communication (BCC) by implementing Participatory Hygiene and
Sanitation Transformation (PHAST), where communities themselves promote
awareness and practice improved hygiene behavior. PHAST
will strongly campaign for Zero Open Defecation (ZOD) to eradicate this problem.
By developing Water Safety Plans (WSPs) communities will be able to strengthen
their capacities and capabilities for cost-effective management of their water
supply resources; this will also help them sustain WASH services after the
project phases out. Empowering
communities means making sure that the voice of the community is being heard,
and that the interests of all community members, without any difference, are
being represented. The project will support communities to jointly engage in
the construction/upgrading of water supply quality services and create demand
for construction of latrines to eliminate open defecation that badly increases
women and children&apos;s malnutrition. The project will empower communities&apos; skills
capacity through various trainings and will hire trained artisans throughout
the project. Improved
WASH do not only require good and feasible design, they require adequate and
sustainable management therefore their financial capacity will be enhanced to
operations and maintenance. Moreover, the project will support community water
management planning (Water Safety Plans, WSP) thus communities become aware of
their water resources within their village for more efficient utilization. It
also aims at engaging communities in advocacy with local authorities for
improved policy and budget allocation for WASH-nutrition sensitive
interventions to be included in future village plans, especially those to be
developed by DRD. Actions
under the project will benefit 165,314 people as direct beneficiaries in
targeted villages (total population of each village) as they will benefit both
from water supply systems and improved sanitation (zero open defecation, ZOD),
and approximately ten per cent of surrounding villages&apos; population as indirect
beneficiaries (40,676 people). The
project proposes to support 212 targeted villages in 6 townships. The
project will also benefit surrounding villages. Out of 212 villages 164
villages will receive support for both water and sanitation facilities through
community based implementation. Remaining 32 villages will receive mostly
sanitation facilities as these villages have already received community based
water solutions under the ongoing UN-Habitat WASH initiative (yet not in
totality), the Shae Thot program funded by USAID.











The
project will advocate with policy makers and development partners for the
stronger scaling up of nutrition-sensitive intervention; highlighting that is
worthwhile investing on improved WASH services to reduce malnutrition, stunting
and children&apos;s health issues. The project will advocate with the Government of
Myanmar not only for the integration of nutrition-sensitive interventions but
also for conducting quality research to better understand different WASH
disease-related pathways of transmission and how it affects health and
long-term development.</narrative>
