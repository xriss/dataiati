   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Community-Led Ger Area Upgrading In Ulaanbaatar City</narrative>
  </title>
  <description>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The overall objective of the Community-Led Ger Area Upgrading Project in
Ulaanbaatar City, Mongolia is to improve the quality of life of selected Ger area
communities through community-led Ger area upgrading by empowering them
through their mobilization and organization, utilizing a community-led and
integrated approach and undertaking a package of inter-related activities.
This will be achieved through the initiation and implementation of
community-led Ger area upgrading in Ulaanbaatar city with the inclusion of four
inter-related project components:
1) Empowerment of Ger area communities through social mobilisation and
organisation;
2) Community-based assessment and prioritisation of local needs for Ger
area upgrading;
3) Improvement of the quality of life by using community-led processes;
and
4) Documentation and monitoring of project implementation progress and
urban governance

(1) Empowerment of Ger area communities through social mobilisation and
organisation: As a first step, the Ger area communities in selected project sites
will be &#x201C;empowered&#x201D; through their mobilisation and organisation so that they
are able to articulate and identify their common needs related to basic urban
services, infrastructure and socio-economic development. The methodology for
social mobilisation and organisation will include the following:
a) Mobilisation of Ger area communities aimed at community-led Ger area
upgrading;
b) Formation of &#x201C;Primary Groups&#x201D;;
c) Formation of &#x201C;Community Development Councils&#x201D; at community-level;
and
d) Formation of &#x201C;Federation of Community Development Councils&#x201D; at
Sub-district level.
Expected result: In the selected project sites: (a) Well-organised Ger area
communities; and (b) Establishment of Community Development Councils and
their federations.
(2) Community-based assessment and prioritisation of local needs for
Ger area upgrading through &#x201C;Community Action Planning&#x201D; process developed
by UN-HABITAT in several Asia-Pacific countries: Community Development
Councils will prepare local-level Community Action Plans in partnership with the
local government, line departments (such as those responsible for finance, land
administration, basic urban services and infrastructure) and other relevant
stakeholders.
This will be achieved by using the adaptation of specialised Community Action
Planning method to the Mongolian urban context. The Community Action
Planning process will help in assessing and identifying local needs and
priorities for Ger area upgrading on which actions would be taken in partnership
with the local government.
Expected result: In the selected project sites, Community-based assessment,
identification and prioritisation of local needs for Ger area upgrading. Moreover,
through this component, institutional capacity will be strengthened at various
levels, including Ger-area communities, Municipality of Ulaanbaatar
(Sub-District, District and city level governments) and Ministry of Construction
and Urban Development.4. Pect Descr
(3) Improvement of the quality of life by using community-led processes:
This will be achieved through the construction of local infrastructure and the
provision of basic urban services in selected Ger area project sites. Based on
the needs identified and prioritised by respective Ger area communities in five
project sites, the infrastructure and basic urban services to be provided will
include a combination of:
a) Public Service Centre including Bath-house and Rental Space (in view
of availability of water supply and sanitation/drainage arrangements);
Community Meeting Space; Kindergarten &#x2013; all including toilet facilities);
b) Access Infrastructure, including Footpaths/Foot-bridges; Street lights;
Drainage; and Solid waste collection spaces; and
c) Water Kiosks.
Community-based project implementation will be undertaken with the testing of
Community Contracting method.
Expected result: Quality of life improvements in the selected Sub-districts
through investments in development of local infrastructure and provision of
basic urban services.
(4) Documentation and monitoring of project implementation progress
and urban governance, and project evaluation: Under this component,
project implementation progress will be documented and monitored. Moreover,
improvements in urban governance at Sub-District and District levels will be
documented.
Expected result: (a) Systematic monitoring of project implementation progress
and evaluation; and (b) the documentation of lessons learnt and improvements
in urban governance.</narrative>
