  </title>
  <description>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">LAC as an urban laboratoryLatin America
has experienced continuous growth of urban centers during the XXI century. This
context has produced an exceptional range of urban practices. The contrasts,
great achievements and continue challenges, offer a rich laboratory for
exchange with countries around the world. To meet and ensure the demands of
future urban citizens in relation to their quality of life and availability of
public services still remains a major urban challenges.To meet the
growing demand for urban solutions, knowledge of best practices and its
implementation for a good adaptation according to the local context is sought.
This systematic and qualified information facilitates decision-making and
dialogue between practice and public policy, and manages to scale the impact
and ensure long-term strategic funds. The purpose of this project is to better
communicate project results to external stakeholders and exemplify via concrete examples the
meaning of the New Urban Agenda in the territory. Auditors have pinpointed how
UN-Habitat is good at implementing their projects, yet does not excel in its
systematization of them, lacking proof of results and references for future
interventions. The same challenges is often
present in many public institutions and organizations in general, that have
implemented great projects with successful results, but have not had the time
or budget to be able to communicate theses processes and identify
lessons-learned. This project will provide the opportunity for practices that
are already following directives of good urban planning to be disseminated and
also recognized. It will also be important to identify how these projects have
addressed needs and rights of vulnerable people. Also it&apos;s important to bring
new examples, as opposed to have the same cities and projects being mentioned
in urban development circles and network. The projects will benefit all urban
technicians, practioners, planners and politicians seeking good urban planning
directives to address various common urban challenges. The project will benefit
all via the knowledge produced as it reflects good planning directives. This
systematized project/case study will provide inspiration, ideas, lessons
learned to practioners and policy makers to both orient projects/programs and
policy. The importance of urban solutionsThe stakeholders mentioned are interested in
proven strategies that can aid them to make decisions. The
identification and validation of urban solutions, which have been successful in
the region and have the potential to scale, can demonstrate positive
correlations between intervention and results. Such cases must be thoroughly
studied, validated (the identification of what has worked and what hasn&apos;t
through a practical and theoretical framework), contextualized (through the
recognition of the specificity of the setting and structure) and systematized
to ultimately facilitate the dissemination of knowledge in various formats and
forms to other territories. Examples of concrete actions and experiences allow
local knowledge seekers to maximize the use of their resources and direct their
energy towards the adaptability of strategies that have shown results elsewhere.The
project will address the problem through a strategic approach by developing a
framework to ease the identification of New Urban Agenda practices, as well as
strengthen a network of regional urban professionals and ultimately systematize
practices that will add great value to the mentioned target groups. The
systematizations will be carried out in situ in order to gauge the real impacts
of the identified practices.For
this project to come to fruition, while respecting the great achievements of
the last 20 years, its important to work with the Iberoamerican and Caribbean
Forum of Best Practices, partners with a consolidated and extensive network in
their own countries and focus areas. The idea is also to reach out to other
organizations and secretaries that also work with urban development and are
interested in becoming part of this exchange and discussion. It is also an
opportunity to mobilize municipal governments and secretaries that have carried
out important investments in urban projects and would like to have it
systematized and disseminated. . Some members of the Forum will also be invited
to be part of the selecting committee that will evaluate the received practices
to choose finalists. This exchange is planned to happen virtually, but has also
the opportunity to happen in a meeting during Habitat III, in case the
calendars of the committee members align.In
addition, the systematization of internal New Urban Agenda projects as well
external projects also aligned with this agenda will provide interesting input
for future technical cooperation with other stakeholders. As they will be used
as examples of concrete projects that have shown fruitful results and is
promoting its way towards sustainable urban development.






















































Due
to budget constraints, this project will initiate the systematization of only four
practices, the goal is to be able to systematize many more in the near
future, yet funds need to become
available to increase the work. Once
selected and later systematized, these practices will also be part of a final
event to exchange how these inspiring practices can be further scaled and
disseminated regionally and how can they serve as ambassadors of the
implementation of this New Urban Agenda.</narrative>
