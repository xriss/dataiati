   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Urban Climate Change Resilience In Cities Along The Greater Mekong Sub-Region East-West Economic Corridor (Ewec) In Lao Pdr</narrative>
  </title>
  <description>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The proposed project originated as a request from the
government of Lao PDR, articulated through MoNRE, for further support in the
development of resilient investment in the EWEC area. Thus, the project is in line
with the Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) of Laos of the Paris
Agreement. Laos&#x2019; NDC has five priority areas for adaptation projects; 1)
Agriculture, 2) Forestry and Land Use Change, 3) Water Resources, 4) Transport
and Urban Development, 5) Public Health. This project aligns with the Transport
and Urban Development priority area. It also will provide some support to the
mitigation priority area on the implementation of climate change action plans
(which include adaptation, but in many cases have not been developed yet). 

The proposed project also builds on UN-Habitat&#x2019;s
implementation comparative advantage, acquired through an extensive country
programme and history of project implementation is Laos. The project aligns
with and complements UN-Habitat&#x2019;s existing portfolio of projects in Laos.
Currently, UN-Habitat is implementing the Climate and Disaster Resilient Rural
and Emerging Human Settlements Project in nearby Attapeu, Sekong and Saravan
Provinces. Other projects under implementation or recently completed led by
UN-Habitat and that are of direct relevance to the proposed GCF Readiness
project include the Mekong Region Water and Sanitation Initiative (MEK-WATSAN),
the Water for Asian Cities Programme, and the Low Emissions Development
project, implemented in conjunction with ICLEI.</narrative>
