  </title>
  <description>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Purpose: 
To facilitate private investment durable solutions for IDPs and returnees in Baghdad, Iraq
The project addresses the need fo lare-scale and compehensive approaches to addess the critical housing needs of IDPs and returnees in Baghdad. Through the existing PRM-funded project, UN-Habitat is working closely with the Government of Iraq to allocate a predictable share of its annual budget to addressing the shelter and related needs of IDPs and informal settlement residents. The current project, however, only has limited resources available for encouraging private investment in housing and mixed-used developments. This additional funding from UNHCR will enable the project to adopt a twin-track approach to investment mobilization: working through the Government of Iraq as well as through private investors.


The project will use the existing pre-feasibility studies as the basis for engaging in a dialogue with investors on their interest and concerns regarding investment in Baghdad. Each site has a population of between 3 and 10,000 people who have expressed their interest to negotiate with Government to find a durable solution and avoid eviction. Land sharing is one option being explored as it enables residents to remain in situ, while enabling developers and the Government to gain from increased density.

The project builds on the existing high-level policy and advisory services UN-Habitat is providing to the Government of Iraq and local authorities in Baghdad. It will also build on the partnerships established with the Norwegian Refugee Council, who provide operational and community mobilization support to engage with the informal settlement residents.</narrative>
