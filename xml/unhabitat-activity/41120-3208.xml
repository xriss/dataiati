   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Enhancing Global Action For Safer Cities: Support To Action For The Creation Of Safer Cities</narrative>
  </title>
  <description>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">To provide a powerful evidence-based platform for
interaction and exchange as well as expertise services for stakeholders and
partners from the crime prevention and law enforcement field as well as the
various sectors of urban development.

Although small in size, this project will enable
UN-HABITAT to establish necessary mechanisms that will allow for enhanced
access to safer cities knowhow for cities and partners to exchange and consolidate
their ongoing efforts to address urban safety for all and to leverage resources
with other projects. This project will largely seek to build on existing
UN-HABITAT plans within the area of advocacy, outreach and communications and
importantly the agency-wide World Urban Campaign.


 
  
  
  
  
  
  
 
 
  
  Design and
  implementation of Network Architecture
  
  
  Advance common platform and structured dialogue
  among partners championing the safer cities approach to stimulate exchange
  between policymakers and practitioners, facilitate standardization of
  principles on prevention at the local level, institutionalize knowledge,
  support dissemination of proven and promising approaches, spread a culture of
  prevention, and increase coordination on advocacy among cities and donors. It
  will also grow the visibility of the urban safety and security agenda,
  through joint advocacy and communications activities, and leverage collective
  policy and political weight to influence other orders of government,
  especially at the national level.
  
 
 
  
  Design and
  implementation of Virtual Knowledge-Based Platform 
  
  
  Improved
  access to safer cities knowhow, as an impetus to knowledge exchange and cost
  effective expert resources/services, and as a first step towards the
  progressive institutionalization of the Network&apos;s city to city cooperation
  structure.</narrative>
