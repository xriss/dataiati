   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Mainstreaming Human Rights In Human Settlements (2016-2019)</narrative>
  </title>
  <description>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">2.3.	PurposeThe overall goal of the Human Rights Mainstreaming Project in UN-Habitat (the Project) is to ensure that UN-Habitat country programmes and their strategic development frameworks, project implementation and otherwise technical advisory services promote, respect and protect the rights of residents in urban areas. While recognizing and reaffirming the indivisibility and interrelatedness of all human rights, UN-Habitat&#x2019;s mandate will most often retain a primary focus on the key areas of housing, water and sanitation, basic services and land. This Project furthermore strives to apply and reinforce the principles of non-discrimination, equality, participation, inclusion, accountability and the rule of law to all of UN-Habitat&#x2019;s work, including projects, programmes, strategies and policy making. An essential adjunct to promoting specific rights is that general rights (empowering vulnerable and marginalized groups; non-discrimination and equality; consultation and participation; accountability and the rule of law; universality and inalienability; indivisibility; interdependence and interrelatedness of all rights) are also frequently ignored when dealing with specific rights to housing and basic services and the mainstreaming activity will also address these. Particular attention in this regard will be paid to the rights of women.The operational phase of the human rights mainstreaming process beginning in early 2014 will continue to assist UN-Habitat programme officers and Regional and Country Offices in the implementation and realization of human rights in cities. In addition, the continued engagement with the global human rights machinery will further the protection and provision of human rights in cities all over the world.A significant benefit of a human rights-based approach is that it is embedded in solemn and binding commitments already made by governments. They therefore have a moral and legal commitment to meet them. Investment in housing and basic services moves from being an elective action to being an incumbent responsibility. Target populations of low income and excluded urban dwellers benefit because governments are less easily able to ignore the legitimacy of claims to remedy housing and basic services deficits. More specifically, forced evictions of low-income urban households could become less common if governments are held to and meet higher standards of accountability to their international obligations vis-&#xE0;-vis security of tenure.The main changes mainstreaming human rights seek to introduce to address the identified problem are three fold. The first is to proactively empower claim-bearers to assert their rights. The second is to enable duty-bearers to meet their obligations with regard to the rights of claim holders. The third is to hold duty-bearers to account in fulfilling their obligations. These considerations will be systematically incorporated into the design of all UN-Habitat projects.AlignmentHuman rights as an overarching principal framework to guide all of the policy and programmatic engagement of the UN has been reaffirmed by the UN Leadership (Secretary General&#x2019;s 1997 Reform Agenda); UN Member States (2005 World Summit) and by the UN Development Group (2003 Common Understanding on the HRBA). The responsibility of UN-Habitat to respect, protect and fulfill the principles and standards of human rights stems from the organizational mandate of the United Nations and as such is aligned with its global, regional and national development priorities.</narrative>
