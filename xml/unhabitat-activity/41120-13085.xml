  <description>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Access to education has been significantly disrupted due to the cyclone Idai. Schools and classrooms have suffered considerable damage and destruction, especially in Sofala. Numbers vary but as of 22 April, total estimated 620 schools (3,504 classrooms) have been destroyed in the emergency, affecting over 335,000 school-aged children (approximately 47% girls) and 7,800 teachers (approximately 50% women in the first cycle of Primary (EP1) and 25% women in the second cycle of Primary EP2), according to the government .With high dropout rates being reported in these affected areas pre-crisis, it is doubly important to provide immediate access to learning for affected children who are deprived from their right to education. During emergencies and crisis these children who are out of schools or learning are more exposed to other kinds of risks for their health, protection and well-being. As schools begin to be vacated by families, rehabilitation, re-furnishing and cleaning/disinfecting of classrooms and WASH facilities are required.Cluster partners, led by Department of the Ministry of Education and Human Development (MINEDH) and the National Institute for Disaster Management (INGC), are conducting Needs Assessments of school infrastructure. A high percentage of schools there have suffered major damage to roofs, windows, doors, etc., of classrooms, administrative blocks, and latrines. Other education institutions, such as sub-national governmental offices, vocational training centres and non-formal institutions also require rehabilitation and reconstruction efforts to resume services and responsibilities. Many school facilities in affected provinces have been badly damaged by the flooding or are being used as shelter for families. Combined, this means that 740,000 of children (407,000 girls) are at risk of missing extended periods of school. Evidence shows that children who are out of school for prolonged periods of time after a disaster are less likely to ever return to the classroom. Delays in the resumption of education services will seriously affect the school year and leave substantial number of children and adolescents without the protective environment that school brings. There is a potential risk associated with the absence of positive, relevant and educational attention being given to adolescents; with the fuelling of any community or political tensions by frustrated young people concerned about their future.Reportedly 100% of school supplies being lost has been reported in most affected schools; meaning that teachers and children have no access to learning and instructional materials. School supplies must be replenished rapidly to avoid the negative impact on learning outcomes among learners in the affected schools.In consideration of lessons from past emergencies in Mozambique (in situations of drought) and considering the high rate of displacement, damage/destruction to schools and homes and disruption of transportation, it is likely that teacher absenteeism is and/or will become a significant issue with serious implications. Teacher absenteeism is likely to have an impact on students&#x2019; ability and willingness to attend school in the period ahead.The Education Secondary Data review that was finalised and shared 11 April indicates that: damage to school infrastructure has been highest in Sofala province, causing teachers and children to be blocked from returning to school in an area where teacher attendance and school enrolment were already low. The Cyclone&#x2019;s impact on food security may prove to be a barrier to education in the coming months; and that cases of trauma among children and teachers, assume the need for the provision of psychosocial support.The Multi-Cluster/Sector Initial Rapid Assessment (MIRA), conducted from 1 to 14 April in 14 districts revealed that more than half of the school infrastructure in Beira, Nhamatanda, Dondo, Gondola are damaged, preventing many children from attending school.The current Post Disaster Needs Assessment (PDNA) is ongoing, having begun on 22 April, it ended 1 May with a presentation to the government.Senior MINEDH officials have been advocating for learning to resume in Primary, Secondary and Technical Vocational Education, particularly in those city schools or training centres being used as dwellings by temporarily displaced people. Government led inter-sectoral support to prepare schools for classes - after they have been vacated in a dignified and safe manner - so that classes resume in safe, sanitary conditions. This particularly includes cleaning and sanitizing in coordination with WASH partners, and the provision of education supplies.This project will be aligned with the Mozambique Humanitarian Response Plan, as well as feeding into the upcoming Education Sector Plan 2020- 2029.The Project will contribute to respond to immediate, emergency needs &#x2013; getting children (aged 3- 18 years old) back into school and learning by: establishing temporary learning spaces, providing roofing for classrooms; supporting the resumption of learning activities through the provision of live-saving messaging, hygiene education and psychosocial support by teachers, and through child-lead disaster risk reduction activities; and supporting the government to re-establish their role as duty-bearers for this right. This immediate phase will be dovetailed into and strategically linked with planning and investments for durable solutions in the form of quality, gender-sensitive rehabilitation efforts over the first 12 months following Cyclone Idai.The overall objective of this strategy is to integrate and deliver multi-sectoral education assistance to cyclone Idai affected children and communities, as well building local capacities to prepare for and respond to emergencies (DRR), contributing to reducing risk and vulnerabilities in the districts of Buzi, Beira, Dondo, Nhamatanda, Chinde, Maganja da Costa, Namacurra, Sussudenga, Gondola and Moatize.Partnership with the Construction (MINEDH) in all project actions will be a guiding principle for the response. Using government approved models and standards for supplies and kits will be undertaken by all Education Cluster partners. This includes in engagement and selection of schools to be supported, the repair of school infrastructure, provision of education kits and support and the engagement with teachers and other education personnel. In infrastructural work, partners align all interventions to the UN-Habitat resilience model . In the provision of temporary learning spaces, safety will be critically focused upon and ensured, and approaches will be taken according to local best practice.The technical approach aims to deliver capacity development and on-the-job trainings on school vulnerability reduction and building back better measures to be shared and demonstrated to the NGOs, Contractors, Government Technicians and relevant stakeholders at provincial and local levels to integrate improved technical measures.Coordination with other Clusters (Child Protection and the GBV sub-cluster, WASH, FSL, Logistics, Health) is in place, with common objectives driving collaboration towards achieving shared goals.Build Back Better Resilient Infrastructure rehabilitation and Disaster Risk Reduction lessons from the cyclone response will be integrated into the Mozambique Education Sector Plan (2020- 2029), so the Education Cluster commits to participating in the process to ensure contributions are relevant, quality and included in the final documents.It is essential that children receive both WASH facilities and appropriate life-saving messaging on health and hygiene. Schools that were used as evacuation centres and accommodation sites and the WASH facilities must be cleaned and disinfected prior to resumption of classes.The Education Sector receives regular financial support from local development donors through the pooled fund Fundo de Apoio ao Sector da Educacao (FASE). FASE also serves to channel Global Partnership for Education (GPE) funding to the Ministry of Education (MINEDH). The possibility a GPE investment in the emergency response is under discussion within MINEDH. Furthermore, MINEDH is currently engaged in conversations with Cooperation Partners Group, on reallocation of Education funds to the emergency response, including potentially towards hardship allowances for teachers. The proposed use of ECW funding within this application is fully aligned and complementary to other funding and investments within the Education Sector in Mozambique.The project investment will enable the Education Cluster to participate in the process of producing the Education Sector Plan 2020- 2029, ensuring that lessons and best practices in education preparedness, response and recovery are clearly included.</narrative>
