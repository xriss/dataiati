   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Tackling Precarious Neighborhoods And Vulnerable Urban Dwellers In Rio De Janeiro: The Social Territories Project In Large Favelas Complexes (Phase I)</narrative>
  </title>
  <description>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">UN-Habitat, in
collaboration with Minurvi[1] and
the Regional Economic Commission (Cepal) elaborated the Regional Action Plan
for the implementation of the New Urban Agenda in Latin America and the
Caribbean[2] -
PAR. This document states that the
region&apos;s main challenge is to improve urban living conditions and reduce
intra-urban inequalities. The first principle and strategic results stated in
this document is the eradication of urban poverty, discrimination and
socio-spatial segregation. This alignment sustains the central relevance of
this project within the regional context. 



At the national
level, the Brazilian UNDAF[3] for
2017-2021 is structured according to the 5 P&#x2019;s (People, Planet, Prosperity,
Peace and Partnership) of the 2030 Agenda and is aligned with the federal
pluriannual plan - PPA[4] of
the Brazilian government for 2016-2019. Both UNDAF and PPA put a strong
emphasis on the gender and the ethno-racial dimensions of the 2030 Agenda in
the promotion of social inclusion. 



The UNDAF
strategically adopts the strengthening of the institutions and the promotion of
human rights, especially of gender and race equality. As, additionally,
violence affects unequally vulnerable populations, public security and
institutional racism are also a central dimension of this document. The
persistent spatial inequalities are referred to as a challenge to be tackled by
the UN System in Brazil. Adaptation to this diversity of realities is
necessary. The UNDAF calls for an appropriate results evaluation and support to
the decision-making process based on evidence. The overall objective is to have
a learning process that lies on lessons learnt towards a greater
sustainability. 



The first axis
of the UNDAF is People: inclusive societies, equitative and with full rights
for all. This project is directly aligned and contributes to the first outcome
of this axis: &#x201C;strengthened social development throughout the territory, with
the reduction of poverty, oriented by the access to quality public goods and
services, especially in the areas of education, health, social assistance, food
and nutritional security, decent work, with equity focussing on gender, race,
ethnicity and generational equality&#x201D; (translated from Portuguese).

The PPA
establishes seven guidelines, the two initial ones being: &#x201C;Sustainable
development oriented by social inclusion&#x201D; and &#x201C;the continuous improvement of
the public services quality&#x201D;. The objectives of this project tackles exactly
those priorities.



The Municipal Social Territories Programme has
been incorporated in the city strategic plan[5].

In addition to
this given broad alignment, the project approach is also based on the
recognition of the local public institutions responsibility to identify and
integrate the most vulnerable urban dwellers. Multidimensional poverty, by
definition, must be tackled in an integrated manner, with sectorial bodies
coordination. Planning, decision-making and resource allocation regarding the
provision of basic services and social policies are more effective when
transversally considered. 



For more
information about the context of poverty and inequality, please refer to the
&#x201C;Regional, national and local context&#x201D; paragraphs at the beginning of the &#x201C;Project Description&#x201D; section.

The IPP sought
the support of UN-Habitat to implement the Social Territories Project in Large Favelas Complexes,
building on:

? UN-Habitat&#x2019;s international mandate and
expertise to promote socially, economically and environmentally sustainable cities;

? the historical and fruitful partnership
with the city of Rio de Janeiro;

? the previous Rio+Social Program
experience in the favelas.



UN-Habitat&#x2019;s global mandate gives
special attention to slum upgrading, providing
adequate basic services and making cities
inclusive. The Agency supports municipal institutions in addressing the
challenges of poverty and spatial segregation
linking consistent data collection and monitoring
and urban
planning mechanisms. 



According to UN-Habitat&#x2019;s lessons learned, especially from the
Rio+Social experience but also from projects in other countries[6], the
challenge of sustainably reducing urban poverty is closely linked to
empowerment and awareness building. Empowerment requires a two-ways
communication channel to be secured between the population and public
institutions. Awareness is sustained by training and capacity building
activities.
