  <description>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">A regional approach for this project is justified for the following reasons:Common natural threats: the four selected countries for this project are annually affected by cyclones originating in the Indian Ocean and moving westwards during the period stretching from November to March, hence provoking strong winds, high precipitations and floods with devastating effects in urban areas. In addition, three out of four countries (i.e. with exception of Malawi) suffer from coastal erosion which is compounded by the effects of sea-level rising. It is crucial that the countries start learning from each other on how to adapt to these common climatic threats. Historically, this has not been the case especially because of the language barriers and prolonged conflicts affecting southern Africa for several decades until the end of the Apartheid regime in South Africa. Generally-speaking, inter-country cooperation has been weak, especially regarding DRR. Yet Madagascar, for example, is much more advanced comparing to its neighbours to withstand cyclones, being one of the most vulnerable countries in the world to this type of natural hazard. The country has developed adapted building codes which are being systematically enforced in all types of constructions. That is why the Government of Mozambique, through INGC, has requested UN-Habitat in 2012-2013 to support the transfer of knowledge from Madagascar to Mozambique in terms of cyclone-resistant construction. This was successfully done thanks to the financial support of the World Bank through the Safer schools initiative, which is now being scaled-up in the country (see: http://dimsur.org/safer-schools-project_inception-report-lessons-learned/).Similarly, Mozambique has a greater experience than its neighbours in terms of flood risk management and has been providing technical assistance from 2010 to 2014 to other SADC countries. However, these recent (and still much under-developed) inter-country cooperation initiatives have been carried out in an ad-hoc manner, based on time-bound projects and/or funding, hence knowledge is then lost once the project ends or the key people are gone, since it knowledge management practices are not systematised. This very well justifies the need for a regional approach. The current proposal scales up these existing initial knowledge and cross-learning processes, notably through Component 3.A common institution: the four countries targeted by this project requested UN-Habitat to verify the feasibility of establishing a sub-regional technical centre for Disaster Risk Management, Sustainability and Urban Resilience (DiMSUR)40, which was launched in 2013. The Centre, which was described in greater detail earlier, aims at fostering development and dissemination of knowledge and solutions in the four concerned countries, as well as developing capacities for disaster risk management, climate change adaptation and urban resilience. In the centre&#x2019;s 10-Year Strategic Plan approved in October 2015 by the DiMSUR Executive Board, (see DiMSUR 10-Year Strategic Plan: http://dimsur.org/dimsur-10years-strategic-plan/), the Centre has defined among its six areas of work the Strategic Priority n. 4: &#x201C;Establishing networks and partnerships towards better knowledge management and dissemination for urban resilience&#x201D;. Therefore, this Centre is the best possible mechanism already in place to manage and disseminate knowledge and best practices being generated by the project. As mentioned earlier, there is currently a strong request for DiMSUR support by the targeted countries and even additional SADC member States. Meanwhile, the World Bank / GFDRR is providing financial support to satisfy this demand. It is highlighted that in the DiMSUR MoU (see DiMSUR MoU and Charter: http://dimsur.org/dimsur-mou-and-charter/) the intention is to enlarge DiMSUR&#x2019;s geographical coverage to the whole SADC region (as mentioned, Botswana, Zambia and Zimbabwe have already expressed interest to join). The Asian Disaster Preparedness Centre (ADPC &#x2013; created in the 1980&#x2019;s for similar reasons as DiMSUR) has already contacted UN-Habitat (in its role as DIMSUR Secretariat ad interim) several times in the past few years to establishing a joint collaboration and deliver technical advisory services in the SADC region. Furthermore, sustainability, as explained in the DiMSUR feasibility study, (see Feasibility Study DiMSUR: http://dimsur.org/feasibility-study-dimsur-summary/), it is being ensured by:o Securing the full endorsement and ownership of the initiative from the concerned countrieso Involving SADC, other UN agencies, civil society, academia, and bi/multilateral donors in the initiativeo Carrying out constant advocacy and resource mobilisation effortso Establishing the credibility of the Centre as a viable income generator in order to sustain itself; this can be achieved if the quality of the services delivered and results achieved by the Centre are ensured; the centre needs to make itself an indispensable part of the DRR fabric in the region (NB: the fulfilment of this recommendation is on the right track through the development and consolidation of the CityRAP tool, which is currently on high demand)o Establishing the centre progressively, through a multi-phased process: the costs for maintaining and running the centre will be shared among: 1) the contribution from external donors (which should decrease over time); 2) the contribution from the countries (which should remain fixed over time, and can also be in-kind); and 3) the contribution from income generation activities (which should increase over time);A new topic and the possibility to learn from each other: adaptation to the effects of climate change in urban areas is a relatively new topic in Africa. The cities selected in each country suffer from different types of effects of climate change because of their diverse physical conditions: Moroni and Morondava are coastal cities, affected mainly by sea level rise and cyclones/floods, while Chokwe and Zomba are located inland, the first suffering mainly from river floods and the second from flash floods due to deforestation. This means that the selected urban centres will provide a wealth of diverse experiences and solutions for adapting to the negative effects of climate change in urban settings from which all four countries will be able to learn from, thanks to the adopted regional approach. In addition, these four cases will be a valuable representative sample of diverse situations from which different urban adaptation models and practices can be extracted, in order to compile lessons learned and further disseminate them in the SADC region.The above-mentioned issues provide a strong justification for adopting a regional approach instead of working in each country individually. In addition, SADC, which plays the role of the regional executing entity in this project, is interested in using the lessons learned to influence its current regional policies and strategies regarding disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation in urban areas, and to promote similar approaches in other countries of the region. As indicated above, UN-Habitat has developed a proposal on behalf of DiMSUR at the request of SADC that is being funded by the World Bank / GFDRR to carry out CityRAP Training of Trainers and implementation/dissemination in four additional southern African countries and supporting them to mainstream urban DRR and resilience in their policies and strategies.(For more information on DiMSUR, please see the Centre&#x2019;s website at: http://dimsur.org/)</narrative>
