   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Integral Strategy For The Implementation Of Key Urban Development Projects In The State Of Quintana Roo</narrative>
  </title>
  <description>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The present strategy of collaboration defines the
framework of technical collaboration between the Government of Quintana Roo,
through its Agency for Strategic Projects (AGEPRO) and the United Nations Human
Settlements Programme (UN-Habitat) for the Integral Strategy for the
implementation of key urban development projects in the State of Quintana Roo.

Its formulation is covered within
the Framework Collaboration Agreement (2014-2019) between the Government of
Mexico and the United Nations Human Settlements Programme (UN-Habitat) and the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs (SRE) through the Mexican Agency for International
Development Cooperation (AMEXCID)[1] and the official letter 0164/2018
where AGEPRO expresses its interest in establishing a collaboration scheme with
UN-Habitat, through its office in Mexico. AGEPRO requested the preparation of a
technical-financial proposal to develop an intervention strategy on urban
development within the stations of the Tren Maya project, the Nichupt&#xE9;
connectivity infrastructure project and a public space network in the
municipality of Benito Ju&#xE1;rez that starts by the development of design
guidelines for La Equidad park project.

During 2018 and 2019[2], AGEPRO and UN-Habitat have held
several working meetings to identify the approach of the collaboration. Through
this document, UN-Habitat presents a working strategy from the territorial
planning and public space perspective in order to define and design to attend
specific matters requested by the counterpart.
In particular, during the month of August 2019, both agencies held face-to-face
meetings (Mexico City and Canc&#xFA;n) and several telephone calls to redefine
expectations, technical scopes and budget for the development of strategic
actions in urban development and public spaces, which are framed in this
collaboration proposal.

Justification:

Correlations between urbanization and development


In 1950, only 29 % of the world population lived in urban areas. In 1990, the
world urban population reached 42.5 %, and in 2009 it stayed at 50 % until
reaching 55 % in 2015. Prospects indicate that this urban growth will continue
in the coming years. It is estimated that by 2020, the global urban population
will have reached 56.2 % of the total world population; 60 % in 2030 and 70 %
in 2050.[3]

Mexico has been showing the tendency of being predominantly
urban since 1960. Today, 77 % of its population is concentrated in urban
centers and this concentration rate tends to be constantly increasing. The
urbanization process in Mexico means that the number of its cities will increase
- from 384 in 2010 to 961 in 2030- where 83.2 % of Mexican population will be
concentrated.

This accelerating urbanization phenomenon
presents an opportunity in terms of urban prosperity for Mexican inhabitants. 



UN-Habitat has identified that the countries
with the highest income per capita are those with the largest urban population.
Likewise, countries with low incomes are those among the least urbanized, and
this is a worldwide constant. On average, globally, high-income countries
(41,539.85 GDP per capita) are the most urbanized (81.53 %) and those with low
income (745.94 GDP per capita) are among the least urbanized (32.44 %).

Mexico is not an exception when it comes to
this correlation. For example, Mexico City and Nuevo Le&#xF3;n State, where urbanization
rates are greater than 95 %, are among the first three entities showing the
highest GDP per capita at national level. In contrast, Chiapas and Oaxaca,
where urbanization rate is the lowest in the country - less than 50%, are two
states showing the lowest income per capita.Graph

Urbanization frequently comes with development
and prosperity, especially in the cases when it is well planned and managed; this
positive relationship is maintained in Mexico -even with its low control and
planning standards- this is reflected not only in the GDP, but also in other
social, economic and urban indicators. 

As illustrated by the following graphs, in the
five states forming the southeastern region of Mexico - Quintana Roo, Yucatan,
Campeche, Tabasco, Chiapas - the average urbanization rate is 64.4 %, which is
about 13 % less than the national average rate. These 5 states show higher
percentages of illiteracy, infant mortality, teenage pregnancy, people with
incomes below the poverty line and more marginalization. Similarly, in these
states, indicators such as coverage of basic services, level of education,
access to post-basic education, average household income, or the human
development index, among others, show a decrease in accordance with the lower
urban population rate.

This indicates that a well-managed
urbanization with transparency and responsibility, can work as a strategy to
increase well-being and quality of life. This is a fundamental premise of the
integral development strategy of the southeast region of the country.

Likewise, UN-Habitat has highlighted in
several of its operational projects that an adequate well-planned and managed
territorial planning scheme, which provides for specific urban acupuncture
interventions, has positive effects on reducing the exploitation of the
environment, its ecosystems and natural resources. Such a finding seems
counterintuitive, but the final political document of the Habitat III
Conference &quot;The New Urban Agenda&quot; recognizes that &quot;it is
necessary to take advantage of urbanization as a driving force for sustained
and inclusive economic growth [...], and environmental protection
ambient&quot;. The same document notes that &#x201C;by reorienting the way cities and
human settlements are planned, designed, financed, developed, managed and
managed, poverty and hunger can be ended, inequalities reduced, promote
sustained economic growth, achieve gender equality, build resilience and
protect the environment &#x201D;.



The signatory countries of the New Urban
Agenda recognize &#x201C;the strengthening of urban governance, with strong
institutions and mechanisms that empower and include stakeholders in urban
areas, as well as adequate control mechanisms, which facilitate greater
predictability and coherence in the development plans promote social inclusion
and environmental protection &#x201D;.



Under this logic, UN-Habitat has advised a
significant number of countries in territorial and urban development as a
mechanism to contain predatory practices in protected environmental areas. A
notable case is the intervention of UN-Habitat in the State of Para, Brazil, in
the Amazon Rainforest, where together with the state government it was proposed
to create a local system of cities and urban centers whose function has been to
create a belt of protection and responsible governance that will avoid or limit
incessant deforestation in the region.

Purpose:

The purpose of this proposal is to generate a strategy for the implementation of transformative
urban development and public space projects around strategic nodes in different
municipalities of the state of Quintana Roo, particularly around the areas of
influence of 3 (three) Tren Maya stations in the entity. The proposal includes
the development of urban planning schemes around the &quot;Nichupt&#xE9;
Bridge&quot; connectivity infrastructure project, as well as &quot;La
Equidad&quot; park, which will potentially be a structuring vector of the
public space system of the municipality of Benito Ju&#xE1;rez.
