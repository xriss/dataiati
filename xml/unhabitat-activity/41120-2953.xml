   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Migration And Inclusive Cities In The Arab Region</narrative>
  </title>
  <description>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The main purpose of
the project is strengthening the Arab region municipal capacities in coping
with migration impact through the creation of toolkit for local authorities and
concerned organisations and to implement the toolkit in four pilot cities. The
toolkit will provide local best practices, lessons learnt and recommendations
on all impact dimensions of migration in urban and per-urban space. Moreover,
the toolkit will be implemented by local authorities and concerned
institutions, with the support of UN-Habitat and the partner organsisations, in
pilot cities to review and refine its implementability and efficiency. This
tool will support and strengthen capacities of municipalities facing complex
issues derived from migration processes and create a local community of
practice in the countries and region. In this project UN-Habitat will provide
knowledge service. The partners involved in the project are local, regional and
national authorities of the selected cities, as well as concerned civil society
organisations and private sector. Moreover, concerned regional and global
agencies will support in the elaboration, analysis and implementation of the
project.</narrative>
