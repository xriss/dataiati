   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Integration Of Long-Term Idps Into The Host Community In Bossaso- Additional 150 Housing Units Supplementary Funding By Chf</narrative>
  </title>
  <description>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The main goal of the project is to improve the living situation of IDP families who own a piece of land in already well-established settlements in Bosasso to achieve their greater integration into the host community. The target is to provide the long term IDP communities with a basic but permanent house with one room including basic sanitation and to replace the temporary shelters that are inhabited by the families since years. The project is a continuation of a previous activity done by UN-HABITAT in Bossaso, where land-owning IDPs where provided with a basic house and latrine. The current project will extend this activity into a wider approach including the upgrade of settlement infrastructure, neighbourhood rehabilitation, job creation and skill training to the unemployed and unskilled groups as to increase their employment chances and to create a livelihood basis.

The proposed project aims to replicate the previous shelter intervention, providing permanent housing units to 150 IDP households now living in emergency shelters, to be added to a 500 units (ongoing) project, to address needs of a total of 650 households. It is envisaged to build housing units (one room per household) coupled with basic sanitation, access to water, upgrade of public space, roads and construction of public facilities for the wider community. The primary stakeholders of the neighbourhood rehabilitation activities will be the beneficiaries themselves, the Municipality of Bosasso, The Puntland Ministry of Public Works, and the local construction and trading companies.

Providing houses to IDPs has then been proven as a successful strategy, capable of been replicated, ultimately having a great impact in the development of the city as a whole, along the lines of integration and not segregation. The project supports that, while responding to the continuous need to improve living standards by providing permanent houses made of durable fire resistant materials, reducing tensions between IDPs and the host communities, and addressing broader issues of protection, and spatial and socio-economic integration. The upgrading of the settlements, in some way to be determined in discussions with the communities, is also an important part of the project, paving the way for future improvement.</narrative>
