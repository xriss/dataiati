   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Job Creation Through Public Market Rehabilitation In Mogadishu</narrative>
  </title>
  <description>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">It
is clear that there is an urgent need to address the challenges that Somalia
faces regarding the lack of functioning economic infrastructure, service
provision, loss of social cohesion and chances for positive interactions among
the communities as well as the serious lack of sustainable economic
opportunities for marginalized and vulnerable groups, especially women and
youth. 

In
Mogadishu, where informal urbanization is advancing fast, priority should be
given to public spaces, particularly those focused around economic
infrastructure and trading hubs, as a critical city component for economic
growth, and as a driver of social cohesion where different collectivities can
meet and interact. The creation of such spaces for common use has the potential
not only to improve living conditions and public well-being, but also act as a
catalyst for the development of economic activity, private sector development,
sustainable livelihood opportunities and job creation for the increasingly
present urban poor. The systematic and holistic development of public spaces is
a major element contributing to ensuring the development of the local economy
and ensuring that growth is inclusive. 



Many previous and on-going
projects in Somalia have focussed on cash-for-work programmes and short-term
employment opportunities. UN-Habitat&apos;s extensive expertise in the fields of
sustainable employment creation in Somalia, as well as upgrading public spaces
and creating respective management systems, puts the organisation in an unique
position to significantly contribute to filling the current gap in Mogadishu&apos;s
economy and social wellness. The project aims to create public places that also
serve as economic hubs for the generation of sustainable job opportunities, whilst
also contributing to the fostering of people-to people contacts and therefore
creating an optimal urban environment. This will in turn enhance the quality of
life of Mogadishu&apos;s residents, in particular for the urban poor, youth, women,
and persons with disabilities.</narrative>
