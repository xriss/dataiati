   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The overall objective of this proposal is to support the preparation of Communtiy-based Settlements Upgrading Action Plans (CSUAPs), for Taurama Valley and June Valley in Port Moresby&apos;s National Capital District (NCD), and Fanuifa in Goroka City, and connect them to citywide primary and secondary infrastructure through the preparation of City Infrastructure Investment Programmes (CIIPs) for NCD and Goroka City, which will also support pre-feasibility studies for priority investment projects identified in prior UN-Habitat support to the cities through OoU. The documented experiences and lessons learned will include recommendations for more sustainable urban development financing systems which give specific attention to improved service delivery and in-situ community based settlement upgrading. Given the coastal location of NCD, special attention will be paid to identify its vulnerability to potential Climate Change Impacts when developing its CSUAPs and CIIP.
In the process, the capacity of NCDC and Goroka City as well as OoU and other implementing partner staff, national and city institutional frameworks and coordination mechanisms for urban planning, serviced land management adn shelter delivery will be strengthened through application of an intensive and continous in-service &quot;learning-by-doing&quot; capacity-building programme, so they can better support the creation of more inclusive, participative, productive, livable and sustainable human settlements development. Similarly, implementation of the national urbanisation policy and legislative framework will be strengthened as proposal implementation is documented, lessons synthesized and shared for structured city, national (through the Economic Ministerial Committee) and Pacific regional stakeholder dialogues, resulting in inclusion of settlement upgrading policies.
As a result, proposal implementation is expected to help the OoU, NCDC and Goroka City to adapt the Cities Alliance &quot;Cities without Slums&quot; methodology, global experience and good practices to the PNG contect through its support to settlement upgrading in the selected priority Taurama Valley and June Valley of Port Moresby and Faniufa (Goroka) settlements to set the foundations for subsequent efforts to up-scale the lessons learned city-wide, nationally to other cities, as well as mainstream them in the NUP and legislative reforms. The long term outcome is expected to be the more sustained provision of serviced and affordable shelter for urban poor dwellers, and thus contribute significantly to the PNG Government&apos;s efforts to achieve its MDG targets, especially MDG 7/11, as well as those of water and sanitation 7/10. As these experiences are progressively intergrated into PNG&apos;s National Sustainability Development Planning process, the proposal will progressively support PNG to implement its commitments under the Pacific Urban Agenda and especially Initiative 13.5 of the Pacific Plan.
The lessons learned and documented good practice from this proposal will also enrich the NUP, including national debates and dialogues on the importancce of urbanisation through the Economic Ministers Committee.</narrative>
