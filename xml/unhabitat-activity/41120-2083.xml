   <narrative xml:lang="EN">UN-Habitat is the city agency and focal point for local
governments within the UN system. UN-Habitat, and indeed the Habitat Agenda,
have made it quite clear that it is at the local or city level where the Agenda
(and other related international human settlements development goals) must be implemented
and succeed. Since local authorities are the level of governance closest to
people, they play a vital role in educating, mobilizing, and responding to the
public to promote sustainable urbanization. Local authorities are the main
Habitat Agenda Partner. Local authorities consist of the group that include
mayors, municipal councils, and other decision-makers who are involved in
constructing, operating and maintaining economic, social and environmental
infrastructure; who oversee planning processes, establish local policies and
regulations, and assist in implementing national and sub-national policies. Through
UNACLA, UN-Habitat has an effective and strategic way for collaborating with,
and obtaining inputs of, a well-organized and geographically represented group
of local authorities. UNACLA is also one of the channels by which to build on
cooperation with local authority associations and, as a result, complement
parallel activities within country-level technical cooperation.

The global and regional engagement of local
authorities is important to the success of UN-Habitat&apos;s overall partnership
approaches and strategy. Global and regional approaches consist of normative,
advocacy, and knowledge management activities. UNACLA can be a means by which
the broader network of local authorities can participate in the meetings of
regional ministerial conferences supported by UN-Habitat, which allow for
normative debate on key issues brought forward by national governments and UN-Habitat
working within the Enhanced Normative and Operational Framework (ENOF) and are
informed by major UN-Habitat analytical publications such as the &#x201C;Global Report
on Human Settlements&#x201D; and the &#x201C;State of the Cities&#x201D; reports. 



UN-Habitat has established information activities at
the national and global levels as a way to ensure that the concerns and
priorities of the human settlements sector are mainstreamed into national
policies and programmes. This is done especially through the over 40 UNDP
country offices where Habitat Programme Managers (HPMs) are located. UNACLA can
provide strategic inputs to these important UN-Habitat processes, by providing
the local government and local governance dimensions to emerging issues being
promoted by UN-Habitat.



As for the planning and preparations for the Habitat
III conference in 2016, the focus must be on building partnerships and on the
commitments UN-Habitat as well as Governments, local authorities and all other
partner groups will make towards achieving sustainable urbanization and shelter
for all. UNACLA, together with the World Urban Campaign, the World Urban Forum,
the Partners Platform, National Habitat Committees and other supporting
clusters of partner organizations, will have to be utilized to mobilize support
for Habitat III at the global, national and local levels and to activate
preparatory committees for Habitat III.</narrative>
