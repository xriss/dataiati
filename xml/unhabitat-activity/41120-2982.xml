   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Addressing The Impacts Of The Syrian Refugee Crisis In Tripoli And Tyre</narrative>
  </title>
  <description>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The overarching goal of the
project is to improve the living conditions of Tripoli and Tyr urban dwellers
(including refugees and host communities, men, women and boys and girls),
through integrated and cross sectoral neighbourhood upgrading and improved
access to basic services. In order to reach this goal,
the project shall focus on attaining two key objectives: Objective (1): strengthen
local capacities and enhance urban knowledge of decision-makers and community
representatives to implement pro-poor policies and plans at the city level. This
will be done through developing and promoting City and Neighbourhood Profiles,
which are tools that will provide an up-to-date, holistic analysis and
documentation of the impact of the Syrian refugee influx on the cities (Tripoli
and Tyr), and mainly on the poor neighbourhoods (including Palestinian
gatherings). This cross-sectoral and spatial mapping exercise will be conducted
in a participatory manner, building on the existing local knowledge and practices
and ensuring a strong commitment to the overall project process. Neighbourhood
profiling will involve training and on-the-job learning in conducting diagnosis
of the situation in the neighbourhoods and in proposing feasible actions. Objective (2): Improve access
to basic services for poor urban dwellers through the implementation of upgrading
projects in vulnerable neighbourhoods of the two cities















Based on the generated data, a
holistic neighbourhood upgrading plan will be developed and pilot projects will
be implemented to contribute to the upgrading of vulnerable neighbourhoods
through improving both shelter conditions and access to basic urban services, while
at the same time strengthening social cohesion, mitigating tension and promoting
tenure security.</narrative>
