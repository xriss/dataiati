  </title>
  <description>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The impact / overall objective
(OO) is to improve stability and stimulate local economic development in
Kabul city through enhancing municipal governance and strengthening the social
contract between citizens and the state.

The Specific Objective (SO) is to
improve tenure security and land management and administration for inclusive
urban economic growth and service delivery in Kabul city

The three expected Results (R)
are:

R1:  Strengthened municipal
capacities and systems for urban planning, land management  and municipal revenue/finance;

R2:  Improved municipal service delivery and
strengthened &apos;social contract&apos; between citizens  and municipal authorities;

R3:  Improved enabling environment
for urban land management and administration,  municipal
governance, local economic development and service delivery. 

The core program activities/outputs
include:

A1.1 - Municipalities to
undertake citywide property survey/registration and house numbering;

A1.2 - Strengthen municipal finance and revenue collection systems and
capacities especially of Nahia offices;

A1.3 - Support strategic urban planning for LED and inclusive service
delivery;

A2.1 - Kabul Municipality
delivers strategic service/infrastructure projects in line with Nahia strategic
plans to stimulate local economic development;

A2.2 - Establish representative
Gozar Assemblies (GAs) to foster improved municipal-citizen relations in land
management, service delivery to build social contract and sense of civic
responsibility, and government legitimacy; 

A2.3 - Improve access to
Gozar-level infrastructure and services; 

A3.1 - Strengthen the national
enabling environment and institutional capacities (MUDA, ARAZI and KM) for land
management, strategic urban planning, and inclusive municipal governance.

Impact hypothesis and theory of
changeOverall
impact hypothesis:

Land is a fundamental
resource in Afghanistan&apos;s cities, yet insecurity of tenure, and uncertainties
in access to and control over it are key drivers of conflict, fragility, and
socio-economic exclusion, especially for women and IDPs. Increasing de-facto
tenure security, through an incremental process (see Figure 1) produces
considerable socio-economic benefits including improving state-society
relations and stimulating household and city economic development and investment. This
tenure security improvement will have a direct impact on people&apos;s lives through
facilitating investment in housing improvements and people&apos;s feelings of social
inclusion.

Medium-term Strategic
Municipal Action Planning (SMAP) and short-term Nahia level action
planning are essential for managing urban growth, effective land utilization
and management, environmental protection, service delivery planning, and
stimulating local economic development, especially in a context of limited
financial resources and socio-political fragility;

As donor funds reduce in the
coming decade, greater emphasis will be placed on raising local revenues. Safayi
taxation is a cost-effective and sustainable revenue source for
municipalities. Safayi also supports improved urban land management.
Significant gains can be made in reducing inefficiencies and stumbling blocks
by improving the enabling environment (e.g safayi regulations);

However, citizens will only
pay Safayi tax if they trust that their tax is used accountably and
transparently for inclusive service delivery from which they directly benefit;

A virtuous cycle of improved
state-society relations can be fostered where citizens pay tax and
municipalities deliver services accordingly. This can be achieved by
simultaneously building the human and institutional capacity of municipalities
(duty bearers) and expanding opportunities for the meaningful participation of
citizens in municipal decision-making (rights holders) (see Figure 2,
Conceptual Model);

However, the &apos;virtuous cycle&apos;
can also become predatory and counter-productive to the overall goal, therefore
effective and sufficient systems and safeguards need to be put in place to
ensure transparency and accountability of revenue collection and use, and to
ensure the land and property rights of women, IDPs and the vulnerable are
upheld;

Appropriate national policies
and guidelines (e.g. on land, settlement upgrading, municipal finance, revenue
management and urban planning and design) buttress improved governance
structures for Municipalities. Such policies and guidelines support improved
efficiency and effectiveness within the operations of municipal and national
institutions and can help make more gender-responsive urban environments; and

Improving state-society
relations in cities significantly contributes to national state building and
peace-building efforts. As nearly 50% of Afghan men, women and children will
live in cities by 2060, improvements in municipal governance and the economy
can achieve a significant impact for millions of Afghans in the long term.

  an improved safayi system, including user-friendly citywide
  property databases invoicing systems, and institutionalised tax collection
  systems in the target cities, a process owned and administered by municipal
  staff and authorities;
  which enables a sustainable
  increase in
  municipal revenue from safayi taxation as well as increases tenure security
  for approx. 330,027 households, including
  female-headed households;
  and supports informed urban spatial
  planning and land management, including supporting participatory land, housing
  and economic assessments/profiles;
  which feed into 5-year Strategic Municipal
  Action Plans (SMAP) for each city with associated (realistic!) Capital

Description of the target groups and
the expected changes
Direct target groups: The
direct target groups of the program can be sub-divided into six sub-groups:1.
330,027 urban households (HH)
(~2.9 million people; 50%
women and girls) will have improved tenure security and land rights, and a
sense of urban inclusion resulting from the property registration process.2.
386 Gozar Assemblies
registered with municipalities and with elected representatives, including
female engagement and representatives in leadership positions.3.
80 Gozar Assemblies (80,000
HH; 720,000 residents; 50% women and girls) with improved services and local
infrastructure through Gozar grants.4.
Nahia residents
(est. ~2.9 million people. 50% women and girls) of 20 Nahias in Kabul
City with improved living conditions from the Nahia block grant projects
and improved opportunities for municipal engagement; 5.
The private sector
in Kabul City will benefit from improved opportunities and stability for local
investment, business expansion, and construction contracts from the Municipal
and Gozar block grant projects; and this increased local investment and
economic development in the city will improve construction employment
opportunities for city residents.6.
Kabul Municipality will
have increased capacity and municipal revenues in including: (i) Nahia
offices; Engineering Departments; Finance Departments; Revenue Departments
(including GIS section); Property Management Departments; and strengthened municipal-citizen
engagement mechanisms.7.
Government Institutions in
Kabul will have clearer land rights and improved tenure security
and improved local services and infrastructure;8.
Central government
authorities, including MUDA, IDLG/GDMA and ARAZI, will have
increased human and institutional capacity and improved coordination and
engagement with Kabul Municipality;Secondary target groups include the following:a.
Line departments
in Kabul City that will have increased opportunities to plan, align, and
implement projects and plans with Strategic Municipal and Nahia Action
Plans;b.
The Ministry of Finance
will have improved understanding of the municipal finances of Kabul City, and opportunities
for structural improvements and improved fiscal transfers;c.
The Central Statistics
Organization, Afghanistan National Disaster Management Agency
(AMDMA), and the Ministry of Interior (MoI) will have improved data on
the spatial distribution of households in Kabul City to help with their programs
and interventions (e.g. ANDMA earthquake risk mapping; MoI e-taskera
roll-out);d.
The international community,
donors and international investors will have a
clearer baseline assessment of Kabul city, and an government-endorsed urban
planning framework for investments and interventions during the Transformation
Decade, aligned with the Urban National Priority Programme (U-NPP).Outreach: geographical area of the
intervention and level of interventionThe program will be implemented in Kabul City, using the municipal
boundary in the JICA Masterplan, approved by H.E. President Karzai, which has
22 city Nahias. Two Nahias will be covered under the MGSP program
(acting as a &apos;phase one&apos; roll-out for this program, tentatively District 5 and
District 11). Therefore, this program will operate in the remaining 20 Nahias.The majority of the dwelling stock in Kabul is detached houses (90%).
One-quarter (26%) are in a regular urban form, nearly half (48%) irregular
urban form; and 16% on hillsides.[3] Based purely on urban form
(i.e. not land tenure arrangements), this corresponds to the prevailing
anecdote that &#x201C;around 70% of housing in the city is informal&#x201D; (48% irregular
plus 16% hillsides). Notably, the majority of housing is irregular but in a
suitable location and can therefore be upgraded in-place by &apos;micro-surgery&apos; for
improving streets, housing and infrastructure improvements. Property
registration is the first step for this process.Figure 3 below shows the number of dwellings in each city district (Nahia)
and the average residential density. District 5, for example, has a diversified
housing stock, a high number of dwellings (25,570 houses and 3,134 apartments),
and high density (26 dwellings per hectare). In contrast, District 13 is almost
wholly irregular housing (32,996 irregular and 572 hillside) and has a lower
density (24 dwellings per hectare). Overall, the inner city districts have much
higher densities than the peripheral districts (D14, and 18-22).Table 5 details the geographical reach of the program according to Nahias.
The data is based on the rapid assessment from the State of Afghan Cities
2014/15 Programme.Table 5:

As articulated in the
preceding sections the program aims to work at the micro (Gozar/community);
meso (Municipal/local government) and macro (national government)
levels. The implementing agency will harness its ability to work at these
multiple levels and promote coordination, exchange and integrated solutions
across them, always putting people - especially communities, women and people in vulnerable
situations - at the centre of
development processes whilst also building government capacity and legitimacy.

for an overview of the importance of increasing tenure security along the lines
of UN-Habitat&apos;s Continuum of Land Rights. 





[2] Full citywide coverage is essential. Piecemeal
coverage (as seen in previous and current programmes, including UN-Habitat
CBMSP, is difficult to enforce and achieve significant impacts, for various
reasons, explained below.
