  <description>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Given the current global attention
on the New Urban Agenda and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Urban Development,
it is important for all relevant stakeholders, state and non-state, to trust
each other and work together in advancing sustainable human settlements and
urban development. The PCNUA project aims to increase the engagement of all
stakeholders of human settlements and urban development, including people in
vulnerable situations, in the design and implementation of national and
regional policies and programmes on human settlements and urban development. 

The second phase of the PCNUA
project proposes to build in established partnerships and progress made in the
first phase of the project to enhance the success of multisectoral partnerships
by ensuring that all stakeholders take part in ongoing processes at all
levels. Project implementation will
entail (a) support to the participation of all stakeholders at regional and
global platforms, and to their engagement with governments and
intergovernmental institutions at national, regional and global milestones
including the Asia Pacific Urban Forum, implementation of the New Urban Agenda
and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, (b) raise awareness and share
information with both state and non-state actors on the importance of
inclusivity and participatory approach in the attainment of sustainability in
human settlements and urban development, (c) sensitize and mobilize Partners
for engagement in processes related to sustainable urban development in the
Asia Pacific region while building their capacity to effectively advocate for
adequate policy tools, legislation and frameworks that will help ease the
pressure by challenges of urbanization, (d) strengthen state and non-state
partner relations as well as with other UN agencies and development partners,
and (e) provide networking opportunities among different stakeholders of human
settlements and urban development in the Asia Pacific region.

The project&#x2019;s target beneficiaries,
stakeholders of human settlements and urban development and selected officers
of cities, national and local governments will benefit directly by
participating in all planned activities. They will contribute directly to
debates, discussions and capacity building initiatives and by sharing outcomes
of these activities with their respective networks. They will benefit from the
networking and exchanges of experiences, all backstopped by UN-Habitat
expertise at the headquarters and at regional level. They will expand their
networks, strengthen their voice at regional and global political processes,
and be equipped with knowledge of current challenges of urbanization and what
their roles are in addressing them. They will in turn be more effective actors
at their neighborhood, and influence policies at the local and national levels
in partnership with their municipalities and national governments. 

From partners feedback received
during the project&#x2019;s first phase, most of the non-state stakeholders are
disjointed and dissatisfied with government led policy and programmes
development and implementation processes. The project provides an opportunity
for partners from the region to share the same platform with their respective
governments for joint discussions and debates aimed at strengthening their
relations. The project further compliments the agency&#x2019;s External Relations
Division in its efforts to streamline UN-Habitat&#x2019;s engagement with respective
stakeholders especially in positioning itself as the lead agency in issues
related to sustainable human settlements an urban development. 

The project partners include all
UN-Habitat Branches, offices and liaison offices, ACHR, UCLG ASPAC, Kemitraan
Habitat, all human settlements and urban development stakeholders, ASEAN,
SAARC, private sector operators and national governments. Through PCNUA,
UN-Habitat will be providing knowledge services, advisory services as well as
support skills through consultations, network management, capacity building,
and reporting.</narrative>
