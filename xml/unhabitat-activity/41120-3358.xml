  </title>
  <description>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project intends to recognize the limited choices that
slum dwellers have in terms of employment, housing, access to public and common
spaces and security of tenure. It aims to continue to institutionalize a more
positive outlook focusing on what slum dwellers by forming strategic partnerships at country level between National and Local authorities (main target group) aimed at investing in slums dwellers as
citizens whose potential can be tapped through their contribution to the
broader urban environment: employment, livelihood activities, local economic
development, cultural diversity and urban resilience. The project recognizes
the slum dwellers as people with needs and rights, like all other urban
dwellers and therefore deserving inclusivity in urban fabric.

This intervention advocates for slum upgrading which is a
process through which informal areas are gradually improved, integrated into
the city itself, through extending access to land and/or providing security of
tenure, strengthening basic services and infrastructure, strengthening mobility
and economic links &#x2013; and thus working towards the recognition of slum dwellers
with the rest of the urban environment.</narrative>
