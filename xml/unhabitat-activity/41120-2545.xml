  </title>
  <description>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The
present project is expected to provide the LGUs of Tacloban, Ormoc and Guiuan a
critical head-start to formulating appropriate Recovery and Rehabilitation
Plans, formulated through collaboration and consultation and based on
appropriate technical advice. UN-Habitat and UNDP recognize that both in
Tacloban and Guiuan, the process of moving from the establishment of
coordination and planning commitments and mechanisms for the recovery and
rehabilitation to a functioning capacity to plan and implement requires critical
early support interventions: 

&#xB7;
Shelter and settlement recovery needs assessments and mapping,
reflecting the new realities of displacement, tenure insecurity, hosting, use
of space for temporary versus durable sheltering and other needs, gradual
services recovery.

&#xB7;
City and settlement recovery multi-hazard reviews and
vulnerability/resilience assessment

&#xB7;
City Land Use Plan reviews incorporating critical recovery issues, risk
reduction and adaptation

&#xB7;
Policies and ordinances providing guidance to the recovery process and
programmes based on the recovery and rehabilitation plans. 



&#x201C;Recovery
and Sustainable Development Working Groups&#x201D; have been established in Tacloban
and Guiuan and are co-led by the Local Governments and UN-Habitat. These groups
address priority areas within the local planning framework along the following
entry points: Social Development, Shelter, Economy, Environment, Infrastructure
(and Governance).

The
Working Groups provide an ideal framework for the LGUs to take control of the
recovery and rehabilitation planning while integrating the valuable work done
by the Humanitarian agencies through the cluster system. UN-Habitat as co-lead
and partner in the cluster system is well places to further facilitate this
integration.

Furthermore,
it has been a challenge for most LGUs to relate emergency response actions with
the medium and longer term development aspects of the locality which as
mandated are embodied in their Comprehensive Land Use Plans. This project
therefore likewise intends address such issue by building capacities of target
LGUs to link emergency and early recovery actions with the general development
directions of their localities through technical advisory support and other
relevant activities. The said initiatives would be crucial for the LGUs so that
their proper bodies can appropriately define and/or amend policy issues as well
as programme human and financial resources available in their respective local
governments towards making actions more sustainable.</narrative>
