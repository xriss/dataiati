   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Joint Programme On Local Governance And Decentralised Service Delivery, Un-Jplg  (Phase Ii)-Danida</narrative>
  </title>
  <description>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The overall objective of JPGL II is to promote
improvements in local governance quality that can contribute to peace
consolidation, development and equitable service delivery. For JPLG&apos;s overall
objective to be realised, a number of agents
will have to
promote change that
can alter the
status quo in
a direction that
fosters a stronger, more
responsive and accountable
compact between the
state and its
citizens in the
provision of service delivery.
Despite progress the
current context is
still characterised by
limited trust in
government structures at both central and local levels, which in turn
means that their legitimacy is often contested.
This can increase the
risk of a
return to instability
and conflict. Moreover, the political space is still limited especially in southern areas, where
radical groups restrict the voice of many, including women. There is thus
a need
to consolidate and
enlarge the space
for non-state actors
in the rest
of Somalia and
to restore a healthy and accountable state citizen
nexus. 



To achieve the overall objective of JPLG II, the
programme outcomes are structured around three mutually reinforcing
strategies: 



1. Supporting policy and legislative reforms for
functional, fiscal and administrative decentralization that clarify and enhance
the role of local government, its relationship to central government, and as a
means to improve local service delivery.



Outcome 1 will focus on policy
and legal frameworks across Somalia
and is initially designed to address weaknesses in current laws on
decentralization in Somaliland and
Puntland. These provide an incomplete
account of the responsibilities and functions to be devolved to local
government, ignore the fiscal implications and lack supporting regulations for
implementation. These issues need to be
clarified in order to resolve disputes between central line agencies and
districts, and to provide a stronger foundation for local governments to move forward; 



2. Improving local government capacity for
equitable service delivery.



Outcome 2 aims to address the
weak capacity of most local authorities in Somalia by providing a
comprehensive package of training and technical support covering basic elements
of local administration. It also seeks
to improve coordination between
districts and the
centre in planning
and programming to ensure
better consistency and use
of resources. A third output is concerned with increasing
locally generated revenues and strengthening the role and coverage of the LDF;
and, 



1.
Improving
and expanding the delivery of sustainable services to citizens in an equitable,
responsive and socially accountable manner and promoting local economic
environment.



Outcome 3 focuses on improving
the delivery of local services. This is
to be achieved by collaborating more closely with central line
departments, engaging more
directly with non-state
providers, and enhancing
the accountability of local governments to their constituents. Another
element relates to strengthening the local economy, promoting private
investment and enterprise, and creating more and better job opportunities. 



In all of these efforts, JPLG II recognizes the
paramount importance of respecting and promoting local ownership, commitment
and leadership. Without these ingredients,
the prospects of sustaining gains are substantially diminished. For this purpose, JPLG II will continue seek
support and political commitment at the highest
levels of Government,
and sustain commitments
already established in
Phase I with
the Vice Presidents of Somaliland and Puntland nominated as Champions
for Local Governance.</narrative>
