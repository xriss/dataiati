  <description>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The main purpose of the project is to improve the living conditions of the Ro&#xE7;a Sundy community through
sustainable resettlement. In order to achieve it, the community will
participate in the design, decision-making and physical implementation of the
project. The design of the future resettlement will incorporate eco-friendly
materials with the minimum CO2 footprint and will be in line with
the Right to Adequate Housing minimum standards. This will guarantee the access
of the community of Ro&#xE7;a Sundy
to adequate, resilient and sustainable housing with tenure security,
infrastructure, basic services and public facilities. Also, the project has a
component on livelihoods and capacity-building to guarantee the social
sustainability of the resettlement process. For that reason, the project was
carefully designed in line with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development,
incorporating 17 SDG indicators as its Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). This
has enabled UN-Habitat to engage with other UN agencies and development
partners in the initiative; the UN Resident Coordinator for S&#xE3;o Tom&#xE9; and
Pr&#xED;ncipe proposed to UN-Habitat to develop a UN Joint Programme on Sustainable
Development in Principe Island around this initiative, which will be led by
UN-Habitat, with immediate engagement of ILO and UNDP and possibly UNICEF and
FAO as well (discussion already started). In this sense, the project will also work
as a monitoring platform of the SDGs in Principe Island.



In this sense, the target
population will not only benefit from the outputs of the 5.5 million Euros
granted by HBD (of which 4.7 million Euros will be implemented through
UN-Habitat), but also from resources to be mobilized by development partners
and in-kind contributions such as the land for housing by HBD, the land for
agriculture and land titling by the RGP, among others.



The identified partners to this
project area: the RGP (the Regional Secretariats of Economy, Infrastructure and
Social Affairs) MIRNA, UNRCU, UNDP, ILO, UNICEF, FAO and ALISEI, a local NGO
that will act as an implementing partner.

UN-Habitat is providing both knowledge services and high-level
policy advisory throughout this project. The agency is providing knowledge
services to the RGP on land conflict management, basic service provision and
social housing implementation and to the community on the use of local building
materials and local sanitation solutions. It is also providing the RGP and
MIRNA high-level policy advisory on land management and community development.</narrative>
