   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In light of this context,
the Government of Haiti represented by the designated lead institution l&apos;Unit&#xE9;
de Construction de Logements et de B&#xE2;timents Publics (UCLBP), as part of their
over-arching strategy for Canaan, has committed to ensuring oversight and
coordination of the actions of all stakeholders in order to achieve better
management and ensure equitable, and planned development of the area to avoid
the creation of an uncontrolled slum in the outskirts of the capital city. As
the communities in the area have demonstrated capacity for collective urban
development and self-regulation, UCLBP intends to harness their existing
capacities and commitment in a consultative manner while at the same time
regulate the interventions at all levels from stakeholders that have been
demonstrating increasing interest in implementing and supporting the
development of the area.

This project aims to
support the UCLBP&apos;s Plan of Action for the Development of the Zone
Canaan-Jerusalem-ONAville (&#x201C;Plan d&apos;action pour le d&#xE9;veloppement de la zone de
Canaan-J&#xE9;rusalem-Onaville&#x201D;), which has been developed in line with the
Government of Haiti&apos;s Strategic Development Plan for Haiti (&#x201C;Plan Strat&#xE9;gique
de D&#xE9;veloppement d&apos;Ha&#xEF;ti (PSDH)&#x201D;) and which is also in line with the UCLBP&apos;s
overarching Housing and Urban Development Policy (i.e. the &#x201C;Politique Nationale
du Logement et de l&apos;Habitat&#x201D; (PNLH)).

UN-Habitat proposes to support the Government
Strategy implemented through UCLBP through delivery of the following objectives:

Support the UCLBP and other Haitian
institutions with strategic and technical planning by leveraging the informal
dynamic of ongoing developments, identifying strategic adjustments and
consolidating knowledge management.2) Improve settlement conditions and kick-start
community engagement by implementing five participatory quick-win upgrading
projects across the different neighborhoods.3) Improve the quality of the housing stock in
the Canaan area by increasing knowledge and driving behavior change regarding safer
construction.





The project will adhere to the following principles
during its implementation:

   Government
partnership: Coherent vision: The programme proposed here will be developed
in close coordination with and under the direction of the Government of Haiti,
led by UCLBP and with participation by and institutional support for concerned
line ministries and local authorities. The programme supports sectorial
priorities in terms of strengthening government capacity to carry out and
regulate urban growth, to respond to the needs of informal areas, to reduce
vulnerability to natural hazards and to build constructive relationships with
local communities. A key role will also
be played by the Ministry of Planning, Transport and Communications (MTPTC) for
the construction components of the project which will adhere to the minimum
construction standards endorsed by the MTPTC and utilize the public information
and communications materials on Safer
Construction developed by MTPTC with UN-Habitat support as part of previous
earthquake recovery and reconstruction Programmes. Community
driven development: Harnessing private sector resources: The approach of the
programme is to harness, leverage and guide the considerable community capital,
including local private sector capacity and momentum evident in Canaan;
enabling local communities to drive their own development, through
representation and engagement in decision making and up skilling to assume
responsibility for implementation. The programme emphasises local ownership of
sustainable housing and planning principles to ensure replication beyond the
scope of the project intervention, and therefore a wider and longer term impact
on the city&apos;s development.  Build local
and political support: Strategic practical results: The programme aims to
promote improved planning, improved settlement conditions and improved housing.
The focus is on practical application and field implementation with associated
outreach to test and refine appropriate solutions, to build skills and
awareness and to ensure there are early visible results in terms of housing and
basic services provision to generate confidence in the planning and development
process.    Responding
to a dynamic context: Achievable and adaptable: The programme has over-arching
goals and a number of fixed targets, but retains a degree of flexibility, to
account for the highly dynamic institutional and local area context. The
activities described build on existing best practices methodologies, including
those adapted to the Haiti context, and implemented by personnel and partners
with extensive expertise and local experience. The linked elements of the
programme should ensure coherence and complementarity in approach, as well as
optimisation of time and resources.</narrative>
