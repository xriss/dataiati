   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Technical Assistance To The Municipal Government Of San Nicol&#xE1;s De Los Garza In The Consolidation Of A City Vision For Urban And Territorial Development Of The Municipality, Aligned With The 2030 Agenda And The New Urban Agenda</narrative>
  </title>
  <description>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Background

In August 2018, the municipality of
San Nicol&#xE1;s de los Garza and UN-Habitat initiated informative talks on the
metropolitan workshop about the extended CPI from agglomeration of the city
Monterrey. On November 8, 2018, UN-Habitat received a letter of expression of
interest from Mr. Oswaldo Cervantes Rodr&#xED;guez, the Technical Secretary of the
office of the presidency of San Nicol&#xE1;s de los Garza, stating an interest in
exploring areas of opportunity with UN-Habitat to establish a possible partnership
framework.

After various conversations, the
municipality has shown its interest in receiving technical assistance from
UN-Habitat to develop a Vision Document that can serve as a main input for developing
the Municipal Urban Development Program and updating its regulations on urban
and ecological development and priority issues in administration.

Following up on this request,
UN-Habitat presents a technical proposal through this document. To formalize
this technical collaboration, by mutual agreement between the parties, we will
proceed with the signing of a Contribution Agreement (CA). Its objectives and
scope will be included in Technical Annex of the CA.

The signature of the CA will be
subject to legal opinions from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.[1]


Justification

The municipality of San Nicol&#xE1;s de
los Garza is located in the center-western region of the state of Nuevo Le&#xF3;n;
northern Mexico. It is one of the main municipalities in Monterrey conurbation,
contributing to urban agglomeration of Monterrey along with its other
municipalities such as Apodaca, Guadalupe, Monterrey, General Escobedo, Santa
Catarina, Ju&#xE1;rez, Garcia, San Pedro Garza Garc&#xED;a, Cadereyta de Jim&#xE9;nez, General
Zuazua, Santiago, Salinas Victoria, Ci&#xE9;negas de Flores, Pesquer&#xED;a and El
Carmen.

The urban agglomeration of
Monterrey in northeastern Mexico, in the state of Nuevo Le&#xF3;n, is the second
largest urban area in Mexico with an area of 784 km2 including 16
municipalities. Due to its strategic location, it has positioned itself as the
most important urban center in northern Mexico, with an outstanding dynamic in
business, industry and education.

In 2015, the urban area of San
Nicol&#xE1;s de los Garza was 58.6 km&#xB2;, which is equivalent to 7.5% of the urban
area of the agglomeration of Monterrey and a population of 430,143 inhabitants[2].

The urbanization index of San
Nicol&#xE1;s is 100% and is above the average of the agglomeration rate (98.2%).
However, the average annual growth rates between 2000-2015 of population
(-1.0%) and housing (0.4%) are well below the values presented by the
agglomeration rates (2.1% and 3.3%, respectively). This trend of low population
growth in the municipality is expected to continue. It is estimated that for
the 2015-2030 period the growth rate will be higher than the current rate of 1.0%
annual average. By 2030, according to projections of the National Population
Council, the population will be of 499,418 inhabitants (CONAPO, 2015).

As explained in the CPI Report, the
close relationship between San Nicol&#xE1;s de los Garza and the municipalities of
the urban agglomeration, its economic dynamics, decreasing demographic dynamism
and the exhaustion of urbanizable land, stand out as the main contextual
elements that should be considered in interpreting the results of the CPI and
the agglomeration.

The economically active population
(PEA) of the municipality is 50.8%, 69.3% of the employed population is
concentrated in the tertiary sector, 28% is in the secondary sector and less
than 1% in the primary sector (table 4).

ONU-Habitat (2018) a partir de INEGI (2000), INEGI (2010a), INEGI (2009), INEGI
(2010b), INEGI (2010c), INEGI (2014) CONAPO (2015), INEGI (2015).



As exhaustion of urbanizable land in the
municipality restricts its possibilities for future expansion the reuse of land
through densification policies is of relevance to this issue (City of
Monterrey, 2013). On the other hand, real estate investment in unconsolidated
land has facilitated a disorderly and unsustainable expansion, lacking an
adequate territorial and ecological planning strategy, which in turn has led to
environmental problems.

The City Prosperity Index of the Municipality of San Nicol&#xE1;s de
los Garza is 58.96/100, classified as moderately
weak, which implies that it might be important to strengthen public
policies in areas with less favorable results and, at the same time, to
consolidate the areas with the best results. This value is considerably higher than 53.80/100, which is the value of the
urban agglomeration of Monterrey, delimited from processes and spatial analysis
of remote sensing with satellite images and also higher than the national average
of the basic CPI (53.74/100).

Nicol&#xE1;s de los Garza.

The results of the CPI indicate that the city has the comparative
advantages in the dimensions of &#x2018;Quality of Life&#x2019; and &#x2018;Equity and Social
Inclusion&#x2019; where the city has obtained relatively solid results; but at the
same time, its challenges must be addressed as well, particularly in the
dimensions of Urban Governance and Legislation and Environmental Sustainability,
where it shows the lowest
values.

Likewise, an imbalance is
observed in the results of the CPI dimensions. Therefore, there are some
dimensions that contribute to the development of the municipality, but others
are conditioning factors for its prosperity and well-being.

The Municipal Government of San
Nicol&#xE1;s de los Garza has a &quot;Municipal Development Plan 2018-2021&quot;,
which has a long-term vision for achievement of the 2030 Agenda and in
coherence with the 2030 Strategic Plan for the State of Nuevo Le&#xF3;n. This
municipal plan is structured through three guiding axes. The first one is
sustainable territorial and urban development, which seeks, among others, to
consolidate the municipality as an intelligent city, where an orderly planning
is promoted in order to orient the processes and policies towards urban growth,
housing, equipment and infrastructure, land uses and urban mobility.

The
municipal government, through its Technical Secretariat and the Directorate of
Strategic Projects, seeks to strengthen strategic planning in terms of urban
and territorial development by preparing and updating the different urban
planning instruments and promoting citizen participation.

Currently,
the updating its Municipal Urban Development Program (MUPD) is in progress with
a vision to 2040, and an Urban Identity Project 2019-2021 formulation is anticipated
through update of regulations. The MUPD is a binding technical-legal instrument
that will determine where and how the city will develop in the coming decades.
Likewise, it will enable the city to have a development plan based on its
interaction with two other municipalities of Guadalupe and Apodaca.

In this context, a unique opportunity is identified
for the municipality to have a long-term City Vision aligned with the
fundamental principles of &#x2018;leave no one
and no place behind&#x2019;. These principles dominate the sustainable development
mentioned in the global agreements and international and national agendas such
as the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the New Urban Agenda, the Paris
Agreement, the Sendai Framework, the National Development Plan and the 2030
Strategic Plan of Nuevo Le&#xF3;n, the Municipal Development Plan of San Nicol&#xE1;s,
among others. The principles are also to be embodied in the planning
instruments that are to be updated. 

Under this collaboration, the establishment of an
international cooperation framework is envisaged, seeking to develop an
innovative urban planning strategy for the city, with a development vision
agreed by its citizens. A territorial approach and the purpose of leading urban
development are also included, with the collaboration of the private, public,
and social sectors for the collective actions and a long-term vision.

Based on the above, it is
possible to point out that San Nicol&#xE1;s is at a critical period to strengthen
its planning based on the existing evidence through a holistic and integrated
approach that would eventually lead to a more prosperous future with a better
quality of life for its inhabitants.

Human Settlements Programme (UN-Habitat).





[2] The methodology of the CPI uses the concept of
&quot;urban agglomeration&quot; to interpret and delimit the territory from a
socio-spatial analysis, in which technical processes of geomatics are
considered to provide elements of statistical support to calculate the index, improving
the comparability of the Mexican cities with those analyzed in the Atlas of
Urban Expansion (Lincoln Institute of Land Policy, 2012).</narrative>
