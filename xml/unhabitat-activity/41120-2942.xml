  </title>
  <description>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Many countries globally have introduced new
land policies, especially in Asia and Africa.
Often it is not possible for these countries to implement pro-poor and gender
sensitive land policies, because the underlying tools and practices do not always
exist, or have not been sufficiently documented and disseminated. Emerging from
the 1990s some organizations and individuals have been trying to address this
issue, but have struggled with the scale of the challenge geographically and
conceptually. In essence, most developing countries use conventional land
administration systems which cover less than 30 percent of the country, leaving
up to 70 percent of citizens looking to informal and/or customary approaches
for their tenure security. 



Prior to GLTN launch in 2006, an analysis was conducted which drew
several important conclusions. First,
while there are many examples of good land policies, there are few policies
that have been fully implemented due to lack of pro-poor, gender-sensitive and
large-scale land tools. Second, a
conclusion was that conventional land titling approaches have largely failed to
deliver their expected results: existing technical solutions are too expensive,
inappropriate for the range of tenure found in developing countries,
unsustainable financially or in terms of available capacity, and instead a
range of land tenure options is more appropriate. Third, an agreement was that land sector work in country cannot be
done at scale successfully in many countries without the combination of various
underlying factors and strategies including better donor coordination,
strengthening partnerships of key land actors, capacity development initiatives
and continuous dialogues and
communications between and amongst key stakeholders including government (at
various levels), professionals, civil society groups, academia/research
institutions, grassroots and target communities themselves. 



To address these
challenges, UN-Habitat has taken the lead and facilitated the establishment of
the Global Land Tool Network that aims at contributing to poverty reduction and
to the achievement of MDGs through the development of pro-poor and gender
sensitive land tools to improve tenure security of the urban and rural poor
since its launch in 2006. GLTN Phase 1 has already achieved significant results
in its 4 years of operations as concluded by the independent mid-term
evaluation and echoed by various partners and land actors. For example, there
is now a growing paradigm shift towards the adoption of a pro-poor, gender
sensitive and large scale land tools, policies and approaches; as well as the
recognition of the need for a &#x2018;continuum of land rights&apos; to replace the more
conventional approaches of reliance on cadastre and individual titles. Global
discourse on key GLTN&apos;s tools and approaches are well captured by various
global and regional interventions. Examples include the following: World Bank
is taking the lead in the development of Land Governance and Administration
Framework (LGAF) globally; FAO is taking the lead in the development and implementation
by member-states of the Voluntary Guidelines on Responsible Governance on Tenure of Land, Forests and
Fisheries, wherein UN-Habitat has played a critical role, the adoption of the
African Land Policy Framework and Guidelines which was supported and adopted by
the Third African Ministerial Conference on Housing and Urban Development (AMCHUD)
and the Bamako Action Plan. 



Moreover, Phase 1 has
already developed significant land tools and training packages ready for
rolling out with partners at national and local government levels.
Some partners are already adopting these land tools for their use and for their
capacity development initiatives. For example, the gender evaluation criteria
tool has now been adopted by Huairou Commission for their implementation and training
for trainers (ToTs) will be conducted before the end of the year. Likewise, the
International Land Coalition has indicated that they would like to adopt and
implement the same on their country-level projects in various countries. Training
for land professionals on this tool has also started. As part of GLTN Phase 2,
the gender evaluation criteria will also be introduced and mainstreamed in UN-Habitat
operations particularly in providing in-country support to tool implementation
in targeted countries and/or cities/municipalities and the needed capacity development initiatives
will be undertaken. The Kenya
experience in land policy formulation, donor coordination and engagement with
non-state actors has been used as a model for other country&apos;s interventions by
UN-Habitat (e.g. DRC, Eastern Caribbean Island
States, South Sudan and Liberia). GLTN
partners from the academia and training institutions are now adopting the land
tools developed, concepts and training packages in their training and
educational curriculum. For example, ITC-Netherlands is now teaching the
concept and use of the Social Tenure Domain Model (STDM) &#x2013; a pro-poor land
rights recording system to their Masters&apos; Program while the Technical
University of Munich has been mobilizing resources to adopt some GLTN training
packages for their curriculum as well as for conducting the same training
sessions. GLTN&apos;s partnership with grassroots organizations has also yielded
some significant successes. Aside from understanding the underlying reasons why
good grassroots land projects have difficulties in going to scale, specific
experiences like that of Brazil resulted in the regularization of an estimated
55,000 slum dwellers.



While significant results have been achieved by GLTN Phase 1, a great
deal more work is required for gains made to be consolidated and extended. GLTN
Phase 2 will further expand its partnership and scope from its known
international partners to UN-Habitat staff and selected land programmes/projects.
It will also implement some of its priority land tools in targeted countries
and/or cities/municipalities in partnership with UN-Habitat&apos;s field projects
and/or international partners with their national and local networks,
particularly in regard to the agencies new priority areas of urban land,
legislations and governance. GLTN Phase 2, in close collaboration with UN-Habitat&apos;s
regional offices and field operations, and other partners will ensure that
in-country interventions will be within the framework of &#x2018;One UN System&apos; as
delivering as one and in accordance with the country&apos;s Poverty Reduction
Strategy Papers (PRSPs) and/or strategic plans. The key objective is to have
more change agents and champions that have the capacity and knowledge to
promote and implement land policies, tools and approaches that are pro-poor,
gender-sensitive, effective and sustainable to improve tenure security of the urban and rural poor. 



In this context, there is an urgent need and
increasing demand for GLTN to: continue its work; expand its brand and help
develop capacities of its partners (internal and external); and support the adoption
and implementation of pro-poor and gender appropriate land policies, tools and
approaches at national and local government levels through forging strategic
partnerships and piloting and working at country level.
