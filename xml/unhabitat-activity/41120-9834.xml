   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Since 2014 UN-Habitat has developed its Urban Lab Facility which supports local authorities and Member States with sustainable urban projects and policies. Under UN-Habitat, the Lab works towards implementing the New Urban Agenda and achieving the Sustainable Development Goals by 2030. The Urban Lab&#x2019;s methodology aims to create stakeholder commitment through design driven processes. The methodology focuses on implementation and it utilizes the planning process to deduct projects that can be politically prioritized and financially supported. UN-Habitat&#x2019;s interest in supporting this innovative WaL programme is based, on the one hand, on the programme&#x2019;s similar methodology to that of the Urban Lab Facility. On the other hand, it matches thematic areas around which the Urban Lab has built a body of knowledge: sustainable urban planning and finance, particularly as they relate to climate change and resilience.We see collaboration with the WaL programme as a unique opportunity to match UN-Habitat&#x2019;s Urban Lab and WaL&#xB4;s approaches and learn together throughout the process. The Urban Lab never sees any process as similar to another, making this learning component particularly important to find innovative solutions and to not run on &#x2018;automatic pilot&#x2019;. To stay in the driver&#x2019;s seat means to be open to inputs from all stakeholders, while keeping track of key decisions to accelerate the process. To address the collective learning effectively, experience is crucial. It will help not to be naively excited as the process evolves. Experience will help to identify drivers and barriers for progress in an early stage. The Urban Lab`s extensive experience in leading inclusive, participatory, multi-stakeholder design processes with local authorities will contribute as such to this programme.UN-Habitat is also particularly interested in the ways in which WaL proposes to overturn the traditional silo-ed, sectoral, hierarchical model of urban planning and design that has failed to get to grips with the biggest urban sustainability challenges of our times. Achieving the paradigm shift to water as leverage will not only be about &#x2018;how&#x2019;, or simply a matter of perfecting &#x2018;the process&#x2019;. A workable balance must be struck. UN-Habitat has a rich history of lessons from which to draw, including from its nearly 20 year-long Sustainable Cities Programme.In addition to the relevant water, climate change and resilience topics related to sustainable urbanization and urban planning, the Urban Lab has also begun collaborating with development banks. Our latest global meeting at the World Urban Forum in Kuala Lumpur brought together representatives of global and regional development banks to discuss bankability in innovative projects in the city. Being part of the WaL process adds to this ongoing investment in financing sustainable urbanisation globally.Building on the above experience, working modalities of the Urban Lab Facility have been developed, providing an innovative approach which can ensure a crucial balance of substance and process</narrative>
