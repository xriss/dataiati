   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Increasing The Resilience Of Informal Urban Settlements In Fiji That Are Highly Vulnerable To Climate Change And Disaster Risks</narrative>
  </title>
  <description>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Recognizing the cumulative challenges facing the residents
of informal settlements in towns and cities across Fiji, the project aims to
increase the resilience of informal urban settlements in Fiji that are highly
vulnerable to climate change and disaster risks. To do so, the project combines
horizontally and vertically interrelated resilience strengthening of
institutions, communities and physical, natural and social assets and
ecosystems. By taking a comprehensive approach of city-level institutional
capacity strengthening including support for community level actions for
resilience building that respond to current and future needs, all actions will
benefit the inhabitants of the informal settlements while aiming to sustain the
identified concrete adaptation measures. Therefore, with a strong mix of soft
and hard interventions, it is anticipated that local resilience including at
the household, community and informal settlements level is sustainably
strengthened. Moreover, the specific needs of women, indigenous people, people
with disabilities and youths will be considered at all stages of the project.
This is achieved through engaging representatives of these vulnerable groups in
community and stakeholder consultations with a community-based approach and
people&apos;s process &#x2013; where community groups are formed and sustained throughout
all stages of the project and through which communities participate in project
implementation: in planning and executing activities and monitoring.</narrative>
