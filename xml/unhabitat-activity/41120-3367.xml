  </title>
  <description>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Findings of the Neighbourhood
Profiling, show that residents in both neighbourhoods, mainly males, work as
daily labourers, street vendors, or run micro businesses, mostly in the
informal sector. Female residents are rarely active in the labour market.. The
Project will promote job opportunities to dwellers, mainly youth by engaging them
in restoration works (males), or work as guides (males/females) in proposed historic
trails. While contributing to generate
more income opportunities for poor families, this will also provide critical
employment chances for youth currently without future prospects and at risk for
recruitment into local gangs/sectarian fractions and engagement in violent
activities. 

The Project will complement
other efforts taking place over the past years. The Cultural Heritage Project,
funded by the World Bank, focuses on the restoration of shops and public
buildings, aiming to enhance economic activities in historic neighbourhoods. 

The Project will furthermore complement
already initiated activities by UN-Habitat, focusing on upgrading water, sanitation
and storm water infrastructure to enhance service delivery and reduce further
negative structural degradation of buildings (through funding from the
Governments of Italy and Norway). Both Azm   Saade and DPNA has been
partner to these ongoing projects, and UN-Habitat will capitalize on their recent
experience of raising awareness of dwellers and shops&apos; owners on the social and
financial value of historic buildings.</narrative>
