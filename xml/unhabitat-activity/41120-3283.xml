  </title>
  <description>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">At present, 54 per cent of the world&#x2019;s population
resides in urban settlements. This is expected to rise to 66 per cent by 2050
and surpass the six billion mark by 2045[1][1]. In the current process of rapid urbanization, failure to fully
mainstream gender equality into urban planning, legislation and economic
development will hinder the inclusiveness of cities and preventing the
realisation of the just city. Gender inequalities in cities affect all
inhabitants, both female and male - and measures for GEWE therefore need to
include men and boys, as well as, women and girls. UN-Habitat aspires to
mainstream GEWE, with a consideration for intersectional realities and
identities by considering the rights and inclusion of sexual and gender
minorities in urban settlements.



The Gender Equality Unit is charged with the
responsibility to ensure that gender equality is mainstreamed throughout
UN-Habitat&#x2019;s policies, projects and programmes. The project wishes to expand
mainstreaming activities into research and capacity building on intersectional
issues of identity, including issues of sexual orientation and gender identity
(SOGI) in cities. 



A number of provisions in the Convention on the
Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW)and Beijing
Declaration and Platform for Action (1995) are particularly salient to
UN-Habitat priorities, including in the areas of: political and public life,
representation, education, employment, health, and economic and social
well-being. The Beijing Declaration has a focus on empowering women and achieving equality between
women and men as prerequisites for achieving political, social, economic,
cultural and environmental security among all peoples. The critical areas of
concern in this Declaration are; persistent increasing burden of poverty on
women, inequalities and inadequacies in and unequal access to education,
training, health care and related services, violence against women, effects of
conflict on women, inequality in economic structures and policies, in
productive activities and access to resources and in the sharing of power and
decision-making, insufficient mechanisms at to promote the advancement of
women, lack of respect of the human rights of women, stereotyping of women and
inequality in women&apos;s participation in all communication systems, gender
inequalities in the management of natural resources and in the safeguarding of
the environment, and the persistent discrimination against and violation of the
rights of the girl child.</narrative>
