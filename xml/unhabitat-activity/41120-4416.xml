   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Strategic Development Phase For The Global Future Cities Programme 2018</narrative>
  </title>
  <description>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The purpose of the project is to translate the
findings of the scoping phase conducted by the UK FCO, into defined and
validated interventions which are relevant and ready for moving into the
follow-up phase of bidding and implementation.

The strategic development phase will build on scoping
studies and government to government engagement that has been undertaken by the
Global Future Cities Programme; and will work with partner city governments and
wider stakeholders in each city in order to:

-Confirm the proposed programme interventions are the right
ones and fit with the local strategic context and needs &#x2013; addressing the key
barriers to sustainable urban development and prosperity, having maximum impact
and are feasible (building on existing scoping studies and government to
government engagement)-
Engage stakeholders from all relevant segments of the economy
and wider society to ensure that the interventions have full local stakeholder
ownership (a &#x2018;coalition of the willing&apos; exists) and strategically fit with
existing strategies and plans, thereby maximising the probability that
subsequent plans etc developed by the programme will be implemented-
Further refine and document details of the individual
interventions within the programme





The main outputs of the
strategic development phase will include:

1) Context appropriateness validated and
technical accuracy of intervention tested;2) Stakeholder buy-in documented and
confirmed;3) Capacity and capability of market to engage
with and deliver the proposed interventions determined;4) Confirmation of intervention is likely to
deliver impact to support increased inclusive and equitable prosperity; and5) Global contribution of Future Cities
Programme to prosperity, SDGs and NUA assessedExternal
and Internal Partners

The Urban Planning and Design Lab will closely
collaborate with UN-Habitat&apos;s Regional and Country Offices, Urban Planning and
Design Branch&apos;s Climate Change Planning Unit as well with Urban Basic Services
Branch&apos;s Urban Mobility Unit, Urban Economy Branch and Urban Legislation, Land
  Governance Branch.

The main partner is UK Foreign   Commonwealth
Office / Prosperity Fund Global Future Cities Programme. The project is built
around UN-Habitat as a lead executing agency supported by two implementation partners
for knowledge and relation management: The International Growth Center and the UK Built Environment Advisory Group (UKBEAG). Both implementing partners
have been identified by UK FCO. The International Growth Centre&apos;s (IGC) Cities that Work initiative will work alongside UN-Habitat&apos;s
knowledge management team, as a knowledge partner on this project. The UK Built
Environment Advisory Group (UKBEAG)will leverage its extensive global network,
using its influence and soft power to create additional linkages with the
cities where the projects are ongoing.

The International Growth Centre (IGC) is run by the
London School of Economics (LSE) and Oxford University. This partnership has
been crucial to the success of IGC in terms of independence, neutrality and
authority and has made the IGC a credible and trusted strategic academic
partner for governments. Through this partnership the IGC has the status to
attract specialist academic and policy experts of the highest standing as well
as the international reputation to influence global debates. LSE and Oxford
also have long traditions of outstanding contributions to the study of
developing economies and have specific expertise and experience working on
economic growth policy across Africa and Asia, and some limited experience in
South America.

The IGC model is based on the recognition that
building effective growth policies in lower and middle-income countries,
requires more than imported solutions. Countries face a range of challenges
that require new thinking, new evidence and a flow of new ideas. The IGC uses
an innovative &#x2018;co-generation&apos; approach &#x2013; enabling policymakers and researchers
to jointly set research agendas and to work collaboratively as research
progresses.

The IGC&apos;s contribution to the Global Future Cities
Programme, will build on ten years&apos; experience delivering policy impact through
frontier research. They have pioneered a new approach to policy influencing and
have a strong track record of generating impact. Based on this, the IGC will
combine their network of world-renowned academics and policy experts to provide
an evidence base for the proposed programmes in the implementation phase and to
make better choices about key productive sectors, providing the foundation for
prosperity and creating opportunities for increased trade and investment. The
overarching aim is to drive better growth policies in the partner cities as
part of this programme.

The main partner for UN-Habitat on this programme will
be IGC&apos;s Cities that Work initiative. This initiative brings together
cutting-edge urban research and the practical insights of mayors, policymakers,
and practitioners to develop a policy-orientated knowledge guide to facilitate
better policy decisions on urban development issues in lower and middle-income
countries. The Council members underpin its strong academic and policy
foundations.

Given the stock of research and policy synthesis that
the Cities that Work team has already undertaken, this will allow for swift
incorporation of research and evidence for the design of the Global Future
Cities Programme.

The UK Built Environment Advisory Group (UKBEAG) is a
collaboration between the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA), the
Royal Town Planning Institute (RTPI) and the Institution of Structural
Engineers (IStructE), which collectively define the standard of professional
practice for their respective disciplines in the United Kingdom and are
internationally recognised as leaders in their field.

The group was created to provide a more effective
conduit for the transfer of built environment expertise to a range of
development partners together with foreign governments. Launched at the Habitat
III conference in Quito in 2016, the group provides engagement, advocacy and
dissemination together with access to the best of British skills in the field
of built environment expertise. Members of the UKBEAG are all independent,
non-profit making professional bodies. The group is capable of drawing on the
following resources: RIBA, RIBA Enterprises, RTPI and IStructE.

In addition to the above, the UKBEAG is capable of
drawing upon its extensive professional network and the following are among a
range of organisations which could also be called upon to support UN-Habitat
during this important phase of the project: British Standards Institution,
Building Research Establishments, The Barlett Development Planning Unit and
Design Council CABE.</narrative>
