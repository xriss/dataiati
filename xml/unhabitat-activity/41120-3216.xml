   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project shall enhance the organizational capacity of local
governments units to better manage their land, urban development and the linked
local revenues. Furthermore, the project activities and achievements shall also
support ongoing efforts aimed at improving the related legal and institutional
frameworks at the national level. 

This project shall be implemented by UN-Habitat,
as well as selected national and international external experts in two
Governorates. One new city extension site and one inner city site in each
Governorate shall benefit from the project.

Main activities and results to achieve under
each component are as follows: 

Component I 

Improved land management and infrastructure shall be supported in four
selected sites of proximately 100 feddans &#x2013; 40 ha &#x2013; each. There will be one new
urban expansion site and one inner city site to be rehabilitated in each of the
two Governorates (Qena and another yet to be determined during the inception
phase). 

In each of the selected site, at least 80% of the landowners shall agree
with a new land readjustement / upgrading plan. The project shall also produce
land tenure and value assessment reports that will detail the potential of
land-based revenues. Detailed investment plans shall allow first infrastructure
works to be planned for new urban expansion sites and be locally tendered and implementedin inner city areas
through the project (e.g. in the water supply, sanitation, municipal waste
management, electricity sectors).

Component II 

Roles, responsibilities and processes in investment management shall be
clarified. Investments shall be prioritized through financial feasibility
studies and cost-benefit analysis. A mid-term investment plan and an action
plan for the provision of infrastructure shall be produced, while future local
revenues and expenditures for the cities will be estimated.

Operational recommendations to improve the current management of the
Housing Fund locally financing
infrastructure shall be adopted and measures implemented by the Governorate. Local
revenues shall increase through the better use of land-based financing
instruments, such as the betterment levy and the developer exaction.

Component III 

Policy recommendations for enhancing detailed plan implementation,
cadastral map, land registration, compliance with building regulations, land-value
capture and the Housing Fund management shall be issued. Guidelines to enhance
the coordination for capital investments shall be produced. Lessons
learned shall be disseminated to other sites of the Governorates and to other
Governorates.

As result of the activities under this
Component, several policy reforms are targeted to be implemented, e.g. in the
fields of detailed and investment planning, land registration, economic housing
fund management, land value capture instruments. Interest of other Governorates
to replicate and scale-up the project is expected to be officially communicated.</narrative>
