   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Local Integration Of Idp Families In Herat, Afghanistan</narrative>
  </title>
  <description>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project seeks to respond to the urgent needs of IDP
families currently living in the Maslakh settlement by de-facto formalizing the
settlement and providing basic services (water, shelter and in a later stage
also other facilities), and support for livelihood opportunities. The upgrading
of Maslakh will also offer in the future opportunities to other IDP families
living in Shaydaee who expressed interest to be relocated to
Maslakh. Shaydaee is a settlements which are lacking the political
and landowner support for local integration at the current location and cannot
be formalized and upgraded due to the high value of the land they occupy. 

This
project focuses on supporting the approximately3,518 IDP families living
in Maslakh, and in a later stage 581 families in Minaret and 2,188 families in
Shaydaeeby using the existing political will to accept local integration
of IDP families. The project will conduct necessary surveys to register plots
and properties (Maslakh only) of and to issue occupancy documents to those
families who have been denied the basic human rights of decent shelter, tenure
security and access to basic services so that they will be accepted as
permanent residents of Herat and alleviate some of the most pressing needs for services
(school, clinic and additional water supply).</narrative>
