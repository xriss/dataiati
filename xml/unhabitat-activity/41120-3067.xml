   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Risk managementUN-Habitat committed to the implementation of an Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) through a memo to all staff from the Executive Director dated 30 April 2015ERM is an important management tool aimed at identifying, assessing and mitigating risks. UN-Habitat particular business model and operational environment makes such tool even more crucial for our operations as highlighted in the recently completed evaluation of UN-Habitat by OIOS (2015) which stressed the need to strengthen ERM in UN-Habitat .Fraud and corruptionUN-Habitat operates in high-risk environments, with large field operations located in post-disaster post-conflict areas with weak regulatory framework and institutions. The risk of fraud and corruption is in inherently higher in this setting. As part of its Enterprise Risk Management (ERM), UN-Habitat is planning to integrate the risk of fraud and corruption in its risk management processes. The impact of fraud on UN-Habitat operations and image can be significant. In addition to immediate monetary losses, fraud can have damaging effects on the organization&#x2019;s reputations, placing at risk its ability to implement programmes, forge partnerships, and receive contributions. The risk of Fraud and corruption in UN-Habitat operations is a recurrent concern from management and donors.Risk managementUN-Habitat is currently lacking formal Enterprise Risk Management (ERM). The need for an ERM is strongly supported by:(i)	One of the main findings of the 2015 Office of Internal Oversight Services (OIOS) evaluation of UN-Habitat was the lack of risk management in the organization despite the high risk profile of its operations. Accordingly OIOS recommended that UN-Habitat should strengthen its risk management approach.(ii)	Furthermore, following the GA Resolution 64/259 which gave the Secretary-General the mandate to enhance &#x201C;the current capabilities in the Secretariat responsible for risk assessment and mitigation and internal control&#x201D;, the SG adopted in May 2011 a risk policy and methodology which requires UN Secretariat entities to implement risk management.(iii)	In addition, many donor assessments routinely enquire about the existence of formal risk management in the organization and with some highlighting the need for formal risk management. The most recent of such assessment is the European Commission internal controls assessment of April 2016.(iv)	 The UN Board of Auditors in their report for the biennium ended 31 December 2011 also recommended the implementation of an organization-wide risk management approach .(v)	Finally the ED of UN-Habitat committed to the implementation of ERM ( April 2015) http://intranet.unhabitat.org/sites/default/files/documents/UNH-OED-M-20150430-01MemoUN-HabitatERM.pdf.Fraud and corruptionThe UN Joint Inspection Unit (JIU) in its recent UN system-wide review of the &#x201C;Fraud prevention, detection, and response in the United Nations system organizations &#x201C; (2016 &#x2013; report in draft status ) identified 16 areas of improvement in prevention and detection of fraud in UN organizations. JIU observed that the UN fraud detection rate of 0.03 % is much lower that the industry average of 1 to 5%. In other words, under-reporting and/or non-detection could be massive and endemic.In 2014 UN-Habitat implemented approx. USD 69 million of its activities through implementing partners. UN oversight bodies ( OIOS internal audit and investigation and UN Board of Auditors) have identified the activities of implementing partners as a significant risk driver with respect to fraud and corruption. Several areas of improvements in UN-Habitat policy and procedures dealing with the selection and management of implementing partners have been identified and in order to strengthen controls against fraud and corruption.UN-Habitat will embed fraud and corruption risks and implementing partner risks in its ERM process.</narrative>
