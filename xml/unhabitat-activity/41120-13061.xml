   <narrative xml:lang="EN">India, with a population of over 1.21 billion, account for 17.5% of the world population (Census of India 2011). According to the provisional figures of Census of India 2011, 377 million people live in the urban areas of the country. This is 31.16 % of the Country&#x2019;s total population. It is expected, that by 2030, about half of the Indian population will be residing in urban areas. It is expected that by 2030 India, 40% of the population will live in cities, almost a doubling of the urban population over the next two decades. Approximately 60% of GDP is derived from the Indian urban economy. This urbanization process has been occurring for many decades, and cities have become more crowded. it poses serious challenges for India&#x2019;s service delivery systems and consequently for the living conditions in the cities. The lack of single institution at the municipal level with clear planning authority and institutional accountability for delivery of municipal services continues to challenge urban India to this day. The existing pace of urbanization is becoming a cause for increasing concern for managing the cities. Most of problems have their origin in unplanned development of cities leading to significant increase in energy use and waste generation, with increased pressure on food production systems, and which results in increase GHG emissions and in severity of environmental and social problems observed in Indian cities.The role of cities in addressing global environmental issues is two-pronged &#x2013; they are both sources of emissions and other types of pollution, as a consequence of their being economic power houses; and, they can be avenues for providing innovative solutions for many of world&#x2019;s most important environmental issues. As the world continues to urbanize, sustainable development challenges will be increasingly concentrated in cities. The project will be addressing following key sustainability issues faced by cities:High sprawl of urban areas leading to severe environmental, social and economic problems: Prevailing urban development is creating urban areas which expand their footprint twice as fast as the population within them. Low-density urban development often increases travel distances, disperses the factors of production and encroaches on agricultural land. Often this is occurring on the peripheries of cities whose cores are simultaneously experiencing abandonment and dereliction. As urban population increases, the demand for land to serve various urban activities also rises. Green areas are converted into other forms of use (agriculture, infrastructure, buildings) due to expanding cities. This is a challenge because reduced green cover leads to a decrease in CO2 absorption and increase in surface temperature. This is also a serious threat to cities&#x2019; resilience capabilities.Limited efficiency of urban structure with consequent economic losses: Clean water and sanitation are the basic elements for a healthy city&#x2019;s population&#x2019;s development. Due to increase in population and the slum problem, it becomes difficult to ensure drinking water supply and to manage the wastewater generated in the city. Also the enormous amounts of waste produced in cities pose a serious health threat. Many cities in fast growing developing countries do not have proper systems and facilities to collect and utilize solid waste, and most of the wastes are dumped usually into rivers or into open drains, causing inland water bodies to be polluted and water extracted unfit for human consumption, as well as urban flooding. While urban areas generate more than 1,00,000 MT of garbage every day with a collection efficiency of between 40 to 90 percent , only 10 percent of the collected waste is treated making solid waste one of the main priorities for urban environment. Thirteen of the world&#x2019;s most polluted cities in terms of air quality are in India, including the capital Delhi, and medium sized cities such as Kanpur, Gwalior and Raipur. Waste disposed in open dumps may contaminate soil and ground water and open burning of waste add to a problem of poor air quality. In this context the most important aspects to consider are air quality and sanitation, as well as low grade housing (slums). Slums are a physical and spatial manifestation of urban poverty and intra-city inequality.Increased vehicles in shrinking transportation network, leading to pollution, and a waste of man-hours for commuting purposes: Due to growing population of urban areas and to inadequate urban planning, cities have grown with low percentage of public space and poorly connected urban fabric. According to the World Health Organisation, air quality is currently one of the main issues for world cities, especially in developing countries where the fumes of growing numbers of diesel cars are combining with emissions from farming, wood and coal firing, tyre burning, open dumping, and dust from construction sites and brick kilns. This toxic air leads to heart and respiratory diseases, strokes, lung cancers and other long-term illnesses.Low environmental awareness of urban population resulting in unsustainable lifestyle: Urban areas accounted for 67&#x2013;76% of global energy use and 71&#x2013;76% of global CO2 emissions from final energy use. In addition, urban areas are uniquely vulnerable to climate change like flooding (incl. sea level rise), cyclones, heat waves, water stress, among others.To solve these major problems and challenges it is necessary to introduce integrated sustainable city strategies covering all city&#x2019;s sectors and sphere of activities in the urban planning process in India. Integration of different dimensions and scales of the city and between all sectors directly involved on sustainable urban development is key for the effectiveness and impact of the project. The greatest challenge of sustainable city development in the Indian context is the rapid growth of urban population, which if not managed leads to:High sprawl of urban areas leading to severe environmental, social and economic problems;Limited efficiency of urban structure with consequent economic losses and loss of local revenue (both public and private) and inadequate management of economic growth and lack of funds and revenue for improving the infrastructure;Increased population increases unemployment, which in turn creates a burden on the economy due to restless, unemployed people creating crime problems for which a huge police force has to be maintained; Unusual strain on education and health infrastructure;Increased vehicles in shrinking transportation network, leading to pollution, and a waste of man-hours for commuting purposes.Low environmental awareness of urban population resulting in unsustainable lifestyle;Inefficient funding for necessary investments which are not economically viable. The PPP formula has implementation challenges in India;The segmented approach in city&#x2019;s political and operational structures result in poor integration of plans and actions;Insufficient transfer of knowledge on sustainability management and sectoral solutions, which are needed for improving environmental performance;Lack of integrated planning resulting to sustainable development strategies not being largely taken into account in development plans and are not addressed cohesively in different policy areas; andLow sustainability of externally funded investment projects (in the context of continuity of projects).The existing pace of urbanization has become a cause for increasing city problems concerning emissions, transportation, water supply, sewage disposal, municipal waste, the lack of open landscaped spaces, and water pollution. Most of these environmental problems have their origin in unplanned development of cities leading to significant increase in energy use and waste generation. To meet the challenges of this inevitable urbanization, India needs well-performing cities. In order to address the urban challenges, India has launched flagship Missions (Smart City Mission, Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT), Heritage City Development and Augmentation Yojna (HRIDAY) and Swachch Bharat Mission (SBM). The focus of these missions is on sustainable and inclusive development. It is envisaged that these initiatives will not only strengthen the Urban eco-system but also will help India to fulfill its commitment towards implementing Sustainable Development Goals &#x2013; Particularly Goal eleven of &#x201C;making cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable&#x201D;. This project will contribute towards building and strengthening cities&#x2019; approach towards achieving implementing the envisaged objectives of these missions. This project will contribute towards building and strengthening cities&#x2019; approach towards achieving implementing the envisaged objectives of urban missions.As all the sustainability issues are interconnected with each other and therefore require an integrated, holistic approach to be resolved. Coordinated sustainable development policies, land use and transport planning efforts, combined with smart policies to promote efficiency in the built environment, offer significant potential to put cities on the path to low carbon development. As the 2014 Revision of World Urbanization Prospects summarizes: successful sustainable urbanization requires competent, responsive and accountable governments charged with the management of cities and urban expansion, as well appropriate use of information and communication technologies (ICTs) for more efficient service delivery. There is a need for building institutional capacities and applying integrated approaches so as to attain urban sustainability. If managed well, compact, resilient, inclusive and resource-efficient cities could become drivers of sustainable development and economic growth, contributing to both local livability and global public goods. If managed poorly, sprawling urban areas will result in land degradation and cause a strain on ecosystems and essential infrastructure services, increase levels of air and water pollution, and increase the size of vulnerable population.</narrative>
