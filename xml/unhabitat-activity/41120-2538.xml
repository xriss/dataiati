   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Emergency Flood Response In Khartoum For Vulnerable Communities</narrative>
  </title>
  <description>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In order to break the annual cycle of emergency response and its humanitarian consequences and economic losses, urgent action is required in applying effective mitigation measures to protect the most vulnerable communities, as well in developing strategies for the incremental application of mitigation actions at all levels of government and communities.
For this purpose, the following problems need to be considered:
1)There is need to support the Ministry of Planning and Urban Development (MPUDs) and Local Governments to develop master plans and urban development plans and provide direction and guidance to communities on preparedness activities,  technical solutions for manage resilient to floods urban settlements, basic services and infrastructure reconstruction and drainage systems.
2)There is a need to disseminate and use more resilient to floods building standards and construction materials, and to develop an early warning system
3)There is a need to identify sustainable livelihood options by offering vocational training on construction trades linked to the reconstruction process after the later floods.
4)There is a need to promote local economy ownership and sustainability through capacity development of the local community, small local contractors and suppliers. 
Therefore this project was designed with an overall goal to strengthen government and community capacities to conduct emergency construction of public facilities and necessary infrastructure through adaptation and implementation of resilient to floods urban planning and building techniques.
Accordingly, the following three main objectives are defined:
1.To develop the required institutional and managerial capacity of the state and locality government  institutions and the local communities regarding urban planning, land management and public services delivery through a &#x201C;learning by doing&#x201D;.
2.To demonstrate that more resilient to floods construction standards for services and infrastructure and self-help housing can be delivered at an affordable cost using environmental-friendly technologies, by mainstreaming community participation, ensuring government&apos;s ownership and promoting social integration and economic recovery mechanisms
3.To develop the required institutional and managerial capacity of the Government of Sudan in the Emergency Construction of Drainage Systems and Access Roads to the main roads</narrative>
