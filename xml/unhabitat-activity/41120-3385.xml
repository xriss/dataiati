   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Sustainable Tourism And Green Growth For Heritage Settlements Of Kathmandu Valley</narrative>
  </title>
  <description>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The overall outcome of the
project is the promotion of sustainable consumption and production practices by
promoting sustainable tourism and green growth in the heritage settlements of
the Kathmandu Valley, through policy advice, dialogue and advocacy, with a
focus on sustainable rebuilding, entrepreneurship among women and youth,
engagement of SME and investment, product innovation and campaigns.The main expected accomplishments of the project are:1) Promotion of SCP with heritage tourism sector stakeholders,
including among the policy makers of reconstruction, through (a) demonstration
in the Bungamati settlement and (b) policy advice, dialogue and advocacy at
Kathmandu Valley/Nepal level;2) Developing, and demonstrating in Bungamati and Pilachhen, tools
for Green Growth for the heritage tourism sector, with a focus on sustainable
rebuilding, entrepreneurship among women and youth, SME engagement and
investment, product innovation and sector campaigns.The action contributes to SDG12 and more broadly promotes poverty
reduction, green jobs, innovation, sustainable urbanization, avoiding
loss of biodiversity, and contributes to climate change mitigation and
adaptation.The action contributes to conservation of
heritage settlements in the post-disaster recovery context and sustaining them
through creating sustainable tourism opportunities for the MSMEs, youths and
women.The project will address three dimensions
of the problem collectively: i) conservation of heritage (both tangible and
intangible); Adoption and promotion of green growth; and build the economy of
local people through policy support, capacity building and networking with
stakeholders. Target population will be benefitted from the protection of their
environment, promotion of their livelihood by improving their skill and market,
thereby will help them to reconstruct their houses in a sustainable way. This
will reduce their exposure to the risks and create resilience.

The project aim to work together with the
government agencies including municipalities at the policy and governance level
and with the community and professional associations at local level that will
pull both the ends together to make the imitative sustainable. Each of the
partners of the project are specialized in their area of work which will be
pulled by UN-Habitat to bring the synergies. Further the expertise and
experiences of UN-Habitat both at regional and central level will be brought in
particularly on climate change, green growth, urban economy and SCP.</narrative>
