   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Post-Conflict Assistance To West Timorese Women And Indigenous Communities</narrative>
  </title>
  <description>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The overall objective of the project subscribes to the EU guidelines, i.e. to improve the social-political integration of uprooted people as citizens. The specific objective is to provide training, capacity-building and advocacy interventions for local administrations and local parliamentarians to better respond to the needs of uprooted women and IDPs in West Timor.
 
 This objective should be framed with the aim of the Aid to Uprooted People and aims of the concurrent post-conflict programmes within the policies of the Indonesian government. Widespread conflict and displacement affected several regions of Indonesia, including Maluku, Central Sulawesi and West Timor, in the period 1998 and 2002. Healing and integration are still ongoing. In the case of West Timor the violent post-referendum phase in East Timor caused a large influx of pro-Indonesia fighters and sympathizers and their families, and other caught up. The influx took place in areas where traditional community conflicts had simmered for long, and where indigenous communities clashed with new elites, whether military or economic. Many of these local tensions were suppressed during the Suharto era, but erupted (and where often intentionally ignited) as of 1997. The East Timor crisis, however, caused a full blown political displacement crisis in West Timor. 
 
 The Indonesian Government expects that overall policies should now focus on &#x2018;moving ahead&#x2019;, on sustainable development. Conflict prevention and peace building was written in into national policies. The last National Medium Term Development Programme (2005-2009) called for a &#x2018;safe and peaceful, just and democratic Indonesia with better welfare&#x2019;. The present five-year plan is more specific, and calls for a special development focus on zones which are least developed, frontier, outer or post-conflict. In NTT, the government states that restitution issues have been dealt with and that peace consolidation is not at the order. Displaced people should become full citizens; they should be part of communities of citizens. 
 
 
    
 The present calls of the EU look for closure as well. The Aid to Uprooted People programme was delivering direct assistance to people affected by conflict and displacement. To phase out, in line with the expectations of the Indonesian Government, it now addresses the last groups of uprooted people which have failed to find for themselves or find assistance from others for a more secure future. These &#x2018;most vulnerable&#x2019; are often women, children, female headed households and certain groups of indigenous people (or local people in hosting communities in general) which were also affected by the displacement crisis. The first 2010 call delivered assistance directly to communities. The second call was for improved monitoring and early warning capacity. The third and present call wants to assist local governments and elected officials to also deliver assistance, now and in the future</narrative>
