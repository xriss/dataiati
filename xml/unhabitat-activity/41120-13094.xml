   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Leading Urban Change In Rahovec Through Revitalization Of The Central City Square</narrative>
  </title>
  <description>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Based on the initial concept note this project
document was developed in directresponse to the municipality of Rahovec
willing to advance
sustainable development of the municipality through strategic, comprehensive and
inclusive planning processes and informed decision-making vis-&#xE0;-vis capital
investment projects; collaborate on enhancing opportunities for the citizens
and the civil and business community to engage directly with local
decision-makers and to contribute to the formulation of strategic public
responses to key issues; and ultimately improve
living conditions for citizens.The request came in recognition of
UN-Habitat&apos;s expertise in the field of spatial and urban planning, and its long
engagement as a trusted international partner in municipal institution and
capacity building in Kosovo, including with the municipality of Rahovec.A
Memorandum of Understanding was signed in May 2019 between UN-Habitat Kosovo
Office and the municipality of Rahovec to start framing the collaboration
around spatial
planning support and public space development and management, and citizen
dialogue.

Local Priorities: The
project responds to acute needs and strategic orientations reflected in the
Municipal Development Plan (2018-2026 +) of Rahovec municipality.

National Priorities: The project is aligned and supports the realisation of the
2016-21 National Development Strategy (in which inclusive development is a
sub-theme) and the 2015-2020 Strategy for Modernization of Public Administration
(which includes transparent and responsible public administration with a clear
accountability system as well as continuous information of citizens on
development and delivery of public services, on their rights and how they can
be realized).

Global Priorities: The project helps moving Kosovo institutions and communities
localizing the Sustainable Development Goals, especially Goals 11 and 16 but
also 5, 8, 10 and 13. This reflects well discussions being held within the UN
family in Kosovo and may be further integrated in the upcoming United
Nations Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework (UNSDCF) for Kosovo.

The
project will build on UN-Habitat&apos;s principles and approaches in terms of
inclusive planning and sustainable local governance and the results and
toolsgenerated by the Municipal Spatial Planning Support Programme in
Kosovo and Block by Block initiatives which supported efficient management of
local governments through capacity-building programmes and on-the-job
assistance, notably in terms of participatory spatial planning processes as
well as public space design and delivery. The project will act as a substantive continuum and keep
fueling the experiences and lessons learned by the UN-Habitat Kosovo Office. The project will trigger good practices and lessons learned from the
tools developed for the Kosovo context, i.e. &#x2018;Turning spaces into places&#x2019;,
&#x2018;Guidelines for gender mainstreaming in spatial planning&#x2019;, and other relevant
experiences and action-research i.e. &#x2018;Public Space Profile of Pristina&#x2019; and
&#x2018;Sustainable Urban Mobility Plan guidelines&#x2019;. Finally, the project will
be using dedicated tools developed by the Global Public Space Programme with a
view to quickly assess
both city-wide public space and the delineated area for the competition
(particularly within Phase 1).</narrative>
