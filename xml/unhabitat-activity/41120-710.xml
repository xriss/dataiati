   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The overall objective of this proposal is to contribute to sustainable development of multi-ethnic Kosovo through planned and balanced development of municipalities, urban and rural areas and neighbourhoods, as well as integration of communities in the planning, development and implementation processes while bringing Kosovo closer to EU integration. Sustainable development applies to economic, social and cultural aspects as well as, in this context, particularly to the environment.

More specifically the overall objectives are aiming at:


Sustainable development of the municipalities at the overall as well as the urban and community level. 

Improved living conditions for the citizens, social cohesion, gender equity as well as sustained natural and cultural resources 

Improved governance and efficiency in service provision with better responsiveness to the needs of citizens including vulnerable groups



Within the framework of the overall objectives the specific project objectives can be expressed as follows:



Objective 1: Contribute to sustainable development of partner municipalities through strategic and comprehensive planning interventions with particular focus on the environment



Objective 2: Enhancement of local democracy through participatory and transparent municipal planning processes



Objective 3: Improvement of the physical environment through demonstration projects identified and designed through urban planning interventions



Objective 4: Strengthening of capacities of central level institutions



The specific objectives of the project will be achieved through: 

&#xB7; Application of modern planning methods, including GIS, in cooperation with municipal staff and stakeholders in order to develop skills for the drafting of municipal and urban plans &#x201C;in- house&#x201D; and thereby rendering sustainability to the planning process for the future, 

&#xB7; Building understanding of integrated sustainable planning able to address issues related to informal settlements, the environment and cultural heritage;

&#xB7; Use of the planning instruments for the purpose of promoting territorial cohesion and social inclusion, particularly in ethnically-mixed municipalities; 

&#xB7; Application of action planning and implementation methods in cooperation with stakeholders to strengthen good governance practices and transparency of decision making, design and implement projects, address the needs of various social groups including vulnerable populations, to achieve tangible and visible results for a sustainable and balanced living environment; 

&#xB7; Cooperation with central and local government bodies and other partners to strengthen capacities for integrated, sustainable, participatory planning with a view to improving living conditions of all, particularly the vulnerable people; 
Sharing experiences from municipal planning processes in Kosovo, ensuring efficient use of resources, deriving and integrating lessons-learned and good practices for the benefit of a broader group of municipalities, and thus their citizens.</narrative>
