   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Our prior project with the Dutch Government, &#x201C;Subsistence to Self-Reliance &#x2013; Bringing the Power of Markets to Africa&#x2019;s Lowest-Income Farmers&#x201D; underscored our shared passion for inclusive economic development and showcased the key milestones that we can accomplish together. Core operating support from DGIS facilitated the strategic expansion of One Acre Fund&#x2019;s &#x2018;impact ecosystem.&#x2019; Within two years, we doubled the scale of our farmer network, launched operations in two new country programs (Malawi and Uganda), and rolled out impactful new products like tree planting kits and clean cookstoves at country-wide scale. Simultaneously, we refined our innovative systems-change platform, leveraging our core organizational competencies to improve large-scale public and private actors&#x2019; service to smallholders. This success has now placed One Acre Fund in a position where we can realistically envision moving the needle on hunger and poverty across the entire African continent. Our current project with DGIS, &#x201C;Leading the Charge to Eradicate Rural Poverty,&#x201D; aims to capture this powerful opportunity. The project involves a smartly structured two-part investment spanning September 15, 2018 &#x2013; December 31, 2022: First, DGIS is once again providing critical support to the varied, evolving platforms within our organization that lay the foundation for our growth and impact. Core operating support from DGIS will enhance and extend One Acre Fund&#x2019;s proven model by funding key strategic priorities across our M&amp;E, R&amp;D, and new country expansion units. Secondly, DGIS is also providing working capital to revolutionize One Acre Fund&#x2019;s growth trajectory. This injection to our &#x2018;permanent fund&#x2019; will completely fund our projected expansion of 245,000+ new farm families in 2019, bringing us past the 1 millionth farmer milestone. Crucially, farmers&#x2019; loan repayments will replenish our permanent fund each year, allowing us to re-extend this contribution to provide input loans to an estimated 245,000 farm families (including over 980,000 children) annually. This project will anchor One Acre Fund&#x2019;s expansion to directly serve 1.85 million farm families annually by year-end 2022. Simultaneously, it will help us reach an additional 3.5 million farmers via systems-change partnerships that are expressly designed to transform entire agricultural ecosystems. Together, the reach of these efforts will generate transformative change for rural communities across rural Africa.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Nigeria team just completed enrollment and pre-payment for the 2022 season and is now coordinating input delivery in preparation for planting period taking place May-July. As Africa&#x2019;s most populous country and home to one of the largest smallholder populations on the continent, Nigeria presents an exciting opportunity for One Acre Fund to achieve a truly transformative impact. Over the last 4 years, the Nigeria program has grown to become the highest impact generating core model that One Acre Fund has ever set up (at ~$298 per farmer in 2021 and $250 in 2020). These promising successes have led us to form an ambitious goal to reach 1.1 million Nigerian smallholders by 2030 through core program and systems change work.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">Despite COVID-19 related disruptions, we nearly quadrupled the number of farmers we serve in 2021, reaching 8,863 families. To continue scaling at this rate, we are committed to innovating technological tools to drive operational efficiencies, generating consistent impact, and building the underlying systems to accommodate rapid future scale. As the pilot is on track to achieve positive site economics, we anticipate unlocking a sharper growth trajectory in subsequent seasons.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">In 2020, we had strong enrollment despite major disruptions from COVID-19, enrolling 1,800 farmers - more than double the clients from 2019 (800). We credit several factors for driving increased enrollment this year, including our growing presence in our areas of operation, strong harvests last year, field officer recruitment initiatives, and the introduction of a new, high-demand cash crop (yams). In addition, in early 2020 we received positive reception from village leaders &#x2014; many of whom used to be skeptical of our program due to past experiences with fraudulent organizations &#x2014; which undoubtedly drove demand for our program. An additional factor in our ability to scale has been increasing visibility and credibility with our government partners e.g. we built strong relations with high-ranking government officials in Niger State, including two members of the Niger State&#x2019;s cabinet and the Director-General of the state coordinating agency for Commodities and Export Promotion.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">Through our core program, we anticipate unlocking a sharper growth trajectory in subsequent seasons. In 2022, we plan to double our core program to reach 18,000+ farmers. Key measures to drive this growth include improving our value proposition by rolling out new crops (including trials with yams and groundnuts), further improving site economics, and strengthening government relationships at the local and state levels.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">In response to the large number of groups that failed to complete their repayment in previous years, we set out to improve repayment in 2020 by pegging our repayment pushes to mid-year harvests such as melons, when farmers are likely to have cash on hand. We also worked to promote group cohesion and provided additional guidance on group formation during the enrollment process. Note that our Nigeria program, still in the pilot stage, does not yet benefit from the economies of scale and operational efficiencies of our larger programs. As such, we achieved an SROI of 0.5.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">We measure our efficiency, or Social Return On Investment (SROI), as the amount of new profits our farmers generate for every $1 of donor investment in our program. SROI from our Nigeria program was well above target. For impact, as mentioned above, we achieved above-target results. For costs, revenues were largely in line with expectations thanks to robust loan repayment (96% vs 94% target), a strong sign of farmer demand for and satisfaction with our program. Program spending was similarly in line with budget.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">In 2022, we expect to achieve an SROI of 4.6 in Nigeria, meaning that every $1 donated will generate $4.60 in farmer impact. While scaling, we will continue to make strides in cost-effectiveness, such as raising the average loan transaction from $227 in 2021 to $264 in 2022.</narrative>

Primary factors included strong maize harvest improvements over control farmers (43%) and high crop selling prices. Looking ahead, we are deepening our commitment to crop diversification to ensure our farmers are food secure.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">Coming out of the 2021 season, we are deepening our commitment to crop diversification to ensure our farmers are food secure. We will continue to fine-tune and scale programs for yams, groundnuts, and maize to increase farmer revenues. We are also implementing promising buy-back trials for maize, and groundnuts. For maize, for example, we will aggregate farmer harvests and sell in bulk to a commodities firm to earn a price premium for farmers, raising their revenues.</narrative>
