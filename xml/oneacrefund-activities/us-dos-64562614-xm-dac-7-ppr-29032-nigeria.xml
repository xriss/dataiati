   <narrative xml:lang="EN">2021 Q3 Country Update: Our Nigeria program achieved major milestones in impact, scale, and financial efficiency in 2021 &#x2014; despite numerous obstacles related to the pandemic &#x2014; and we are continuing to adapt our core program to generate consistent, cost-effective impact and establish a platform for growth to reach an increasing number of families in Nigeria who could benefit from our model. While 2021 harvest measurement is ongoing, we are continuing to improve our value proposition to farmers.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Our prior project with the Dutch Government, &#x201C;Subsistence to Self-Reliance &#x2013; Bringing the Power of Markets to Africa&#x2019;s Lowest-Income Farmers&#x201D; underscored our shared passion for inclusive economic development and showcased the key milestones that we can accomplish together. Core operating support from DGIS facilitated the strategic expansion of One Acre Fund&#x2019;s &#x2018;impact ecosystem.&#x2019; Within two years, we doubled the scale of our farmer network, launched operations in two new country programs (Malawi and Uganda), and rolled out impactful new products like tree planting kits and clean cookstoves at country-wide scale. Simultaneously, we refined our innovative systems-change platform, leveraging our core organizational competencies to improve large-scale public and private actors&#x2019; service to smallholders. This success has now placed One Acre Fund in a position where we can realistically envision moving the needle on hunger and poverty across the entire African continent. Our current project with DGIS, &#x201C;Leading the Charge to Eradicate Rural Poverty,&#x201D; aims to capture this powerful opportunity. The project involves a smartly structured two-part investment spanning September 15, 2018 &#x2013; December 31, 2022: First, DGIS is once again providing critical support to the varied, evolving platforms within our organization that lay the foundation for our growth and impact. Core operating support from DGIS will enhance and extend One Acre Fund&#x2019;s proven model by funding key strategic priorities across our M&amp;E, R&amp;D, and new country expansion units. Secondly, DGIS is also providing working capital to revolutionize One Acre Fund&#x2019;s growth trajectory. This injection to our &#x2018;permanent fund&#x2019; will completely fund our projected expansion of 245,000+ new farm families in 2019, bringing us past the 1 millionth farmer milestone. Crucially, farmers&#x2019; loan repayments will replenish our permanent fund each year, allowing us to re-extend this contribution to provide input loans to an estimated 245,000 farm families (including over 980,000 children) annually. This project will anchor One Acre Fund&#x2019;s expansion to directly serve 1.85 million farm families annually by year-end 2022. Simultaneously, it will help us reach an additional 3.5 million farmers via systems-change partnerships that are expressly designed to transform entire agricultural ecosystems. Together, the reach of these efforts will generate transformative change for rural communities across rural Africa.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">In 2020, we had strong enrollment despite major disruptions from COVID-19, enrolling 1,800 farmers - more than double the clients from 2019 (800). We credit several factors for driving increased enrollment this year, including our growing presence in our areas of operation, strong harvests last year, field officer recruitment initiatives, and the introduction of a new, high-demand cash crop (yams). In addition, in early 2020 we received positive reception from village leaders &#x2014; many of whom used to be skeptical of our program due to past experiences with fraudulent organizations &#x2014; which undoubtedly drove demand for our program. An additional factor in our ability to scale has been increasing visibility and credibility with our government partners e.g. we built strong relations with high-ranking government officials in Niger State, including two members of the Niger State&#x2019;s cabinet and the Director-General of the state coordinating agency for Commodities and Export Promotion.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">Despite COVID-19 related disruptions, we nearly quadrupled the number of farmers we serve in 2021, reaching 8,700 families. To continue scaling at this rate, we are committed to innovating technological tools to drive operational efficiencies, generating consistent impact, and building the underlying systems to accommodate rapid future scale.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">While 2021 harvest measurement is ongoing, our preliminary M&amp;E reports suggest lower impact results than projected due to patchy rainfall. We enabled farmers to harvest 43% more maize than their non-participating neighbors in 2020, and hope for similar results this year &#x2014; a substantial impact on food security during another year of economic disruption. Coming out of the 2021 season, we are deepening our commitment to crop diversification to ensure our farmers are food secure. By year end, we plan to implement a promising maize buy-back trial, through which we will aggregate farmer maize harvests and sell in bulk to a commodities firm to earn a price premium for farmers, raising impact figures.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">In response to the large number of groups that failed to complete their repayment in previous years, we set out to improve repayment in 2020 by pegging our repayment pushes to mid-year harvests such as melons, when farmers are likely to have cash on hand. We also worked to promote group cohesion and provided additional guidance on group formation during the enrollment process. Note that our Nigeria program, still in the pilot stage, does not yet benefit from the economies of scale and operational efficiencies of our larger programs. As such, we achieved an SROI of 0.5.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">We project reaching our SROI target in Nigeria this year, despite lower impact projections than anticipated. This result is in line with our expectations for such a young program. As we move forward with the pilot, we are implementing a range of innovations that will contribute to higher SROI projections, including introducing tablets for field officers to increase their ability to serve more farmers more efficiently, more structured repayment tracking, and building realistic repayment plans with clients pegged to harvest timing and peak harvest price periods.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">Our Systems Change unit is currently investigating partnership opportunities to expand beyond our core program in Nigeria. In particular, we are dedicated to strengthening our existing agroforestry model and aim to introduce tree-planting partnerships with the government in Nigeria in the near future. Looking ahead to 2022, we will continue to invest in partnerships with our government hosts at the local and state levels. We will continue our ambassadors program in 2022; we will replicate the &#x201C;Meet &amp; Greet&#x201D; visits with traditional leaders that we conducted in 2021 to cultivate local champions of our program.</narrative>
