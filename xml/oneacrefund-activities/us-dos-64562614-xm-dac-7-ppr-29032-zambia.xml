   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Our prior project with the Dutch Government, &#x201C;Subsistence to Self-Reliance &#x2013; Bringing the Power of Markets to Africa&#x2019;s Lowest-Income Farmers&#x201D; underscored our shared passion for inclusive economic development and showcased the key milestones that we can accomplish together. Core operating support from DGIS facilitated the strategic expansion of One Acre Fund&#x2019;s &#x2018;impact ecosystem.&#x2019; Within two years, we doubled the scale of our farmer network, launched operations in two new country programs (Malawi and Uganda), and rolled out impactful new products like tree planting kits and clean cookstoves at country-wide scale. Simultaneously, we refined our innovative systems-change platform, leveraging our core organizational competencies to improve large-scale public and private actors&#x2019; service to smallholders. This success has now placed One Acre Fund in a position where we can realistically envision moving the needle on hunger and poverty across the entire African continent. Our current project with DGIS, &#x201C;Leading the Charge to Eradicate Rural Poverty,&#x201D; aims to capture this powerful opportunity. The project involves a smartly structured two-part investment spanning September 15, 2018 &#x2013; December 31, 2022: First, DGIS is once again providing critical support to the varied, evolving platforms within our organization that lay the foundation for our growth and impact. Core operating support from DGIS will enhance and extend One Acre Fund&#x2019;s proven model by funding key strategic priorities across our M&amp;E, R&amp;D, and new country expansion units. Secondly, DGIS is also providing working capital to revolutionize One Acre Fund&#x2019;s growth trajectory. This injection to our &#x2018;permanent fund&#x2019; will completely fund our projected expansion of 245,000+ new farm families in 2019, bringing us past the 1 millionth farmer milestone. Crucially, farmers&#x2019; loan repayments will replenish our permanent fund each year, allowing us to re-extend this contribution to provide input loans to an estimated 245,000 farm families (including over 980,000 children) annually. This project will anchor One Acre Fund&#x2019;s expansion to directly serve 1.85 million farm families annually by year-end 2022. Simultaneously, it will help us reach an additional 3.5 million farmers via systems-change partnerships that are expressly designed to transform entire agricultural ecosystems. Together, the reach of these efforts will generate transformative change for rural communities across rural Africa.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Zambia Q4 2020 Country Update: In Q4, we concluded enrollment for the 2021 season, serving 14,000 clients. This lower scale year-on-year was expected and is the result of a program modification designed to increase the amount of upfront payment clients must make prior to taking inputs (from 20% to 50%). This shift was in response to several years of significant repayment challenges in Zambia, and seeks to improve our long-term financial sustainability at the expense of short-term scale growth.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">Currently Zambia is One Acre Fund&apos;s largest pilot program, where we are testing our model at increasing levels of scale to verify demand, impact, farmer repayment rates, and government support before making a full-scale launch. Since our first pilot season in 2016, our Zambia operation has grown faster than any other pilot in our history, with 19,000 farm families from four districts (Chibombo, Chisamba, Kapiri North, and Kapiri South) enrolled in our just concluded 2019 season. This is a positive indicator that our clients are pleased with our service as they feel more dignity from being able to plant more land in our program. We are currently preparing for harvests (April-June 2020) and continue our farmer trainings on improved harvesting techniques, post-harvest storage, and methods of enhancing soil fertility.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">Final M&amp;E data indicates that our Zambia program generated an average impact of $39 per farmer in 2019 which represents a similar impact to what we experienced in 2018. We would like to note that newer countries generally report lower impact, but we also recognize the need to fundamentally improve our ag package. Despite the low impact numbers, on the other hand - farmers tell us they have more dignity from being able to plant more land in our program, they recognize factors beyond 1AF&#x2019;s control (e.g., weather, prices) have hurt yields these past two years, and they see long-term potential in working with us. Zambia is a special case where we are working with 10-15 acre farmers who see farming more as a business and for whom severe hunger is not a prevailing challenge - they are better willing and able to take risks and seem to be taking the long view in wanting to continue in our program.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">We are still collecting data from the 2020 harvest, so our impact estimates remain very preliminary. Based on the information we currently have, we remain cautiously optimistic about this season&#x2019;s impact. Programmatic factors that appear to be major factors in robust harvests this year include the rollout of new crops (soya and groundnuts) and favorable weather in our districts of operation.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">SROI was below target, primarily due to the aforementioned impact shortfall. We would also like to note that in in the early years, Kenya and Rwanda also had SROIs below 1 (it takes time to build client trust and realize higher transactions and economies of scale to improve SROI); further we did see much stronger performance in 2019 vs. 2018 and look forward to share final results which will be available in our Q1 2020 report.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">With the season now concluded, we can report a final loan repayment figure of 90.06%, below our original target of 98%, yet largely in line with recent COVID-19 updated projections. While we were originally on track to surpass recent years&#x2019; repayment performance due to a strategic focus in this area, the pandemic unfortunately depressed the final figure. Not only did farmers face significant cash constraints due to the unforeseen crisis, but the ability of field staff to conduct key repayment activities was limited due to social distancing requirements. This in turn limited our SROI to a projected 1-1.5 below our internal targets.</narrative>
