   <narrative xml:lang="EN">As discussed in our previous communications, impact and repayment challenges, combined with a major currency loss, led our leadership to close our core program in Zambia following the 2021 season. The Zambia team wound-down core program activities in Q4 of last year, and the program is now undergoing significant changes with a transition away from input loans for staple crops to a tree planting program model (a planned combination of tree giveaways, tree sales, and carbon credit programs for permanent tree planting). The team&#x2019;s current focus is on seedling distribution and delivering training to clients with relation to field preparation and planting.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Our prior project with the Dutch Government, &#x201C;Subsistence to Self-Reliance &#x2013; Bringing the Power of Markets to Africa&#x2019;s Lowest-Income Farmers&#x201D; underscored our shared passion for inclusive economic development and showcased the key milestones that we can accomplish together. Core operating support from DGIS facilitated the strategic expansion of One Acre Fund&#x2019;s &#x2018;impact ecosystem.&#x2019; Within two years, we doubled the scale of our farmer network, launched operations in two new country programs (Malawi and Uganda), and rolled out impactful new products like tree planting kits and clean cookstoves at country-wide scale. Simultaneously, we refined our innovative systems-change platform, leveraging our core organizational competencies to improve large-scale public and private actors&#x2019; service to smallholders. This success has now placed One Acre Fund in a position where we can realistically envision moving the needle on hunger and poverty across the entire African continent. Our current project with DGIS, &#x201C;Leading the Charge to Eradicate Rural Poverty,&#x201D; aims to capture this powerful opportunity. The project involves a smartly structured two-part investment spanning September 15, 2018 &#x2013; December 31, 2022: First, DGIS is once again providing critical support to the varied, evolving platforms within our organization that lay the foundation for our growth and impact. Core operating support from DGIS will enhance and extend One Acre Fund&#x2019;s proven model by funding key strategic priorities across our M&amp;E, R&amp;D, and new country expansion units. Secondly, DGIS is also providing working capital to revolutionize One Acre Fund&#x2019;s growth trajectory. This injection to our &#x2018;permanent fund&#x2019; will completely fund our projected expansion of 245,000+ new farm families in 2019, bringing us past the 1 millionth farmer milestone. Crucially, farmers&#x2019; loan repayments will replenish our permanent fund each year, allowing us to re-extend this contribution to provide input loans to an estimated 245,000 farm families (including over 980,000 children) annually. This project will anchor One Acre Fund&#x2019;s expansion to directly serve 1.85 million farm families annually by year-end 2022. Simultaneously, it will help us reach an additional 3.5 million farmers via systems-change partnerships that are expressly designed to transform entire agricultural ecosystems. Together, the reach of these efforts will generate transformative change for rural communities across rural Africa.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">Currently Zambia is One Acre Fund&apos;s largest pilot program, where we are testing our model at increasing levels of scale to verify demand, impact, farmer repayment rates, and government support before making a full-scale launch. Since our first pilot season in 2016, our Zambia operation has grown faster than any other pilot in our history, with 19,000 farm families from four districts (Chibombo, Chisamba, Kapiri North, and Kapiri South) enrolled in our just concluded 2019 season. This is a positive indicator that our clients are pleased with our service as they feel more dignity from being able to plant more land in our program. We are currently preparing for harvests (April-June 2020) and continue our farmer trainings on improved harvesting techniques, post-harvest storage, and methods of enhancing soil fertility.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">We served 14,295 clients in 2021, or roughly in line with our 2020 results. Our Zambia program has experienced multiple years of poor repayment results; this year, repayment rated were especially affected by the financial constraints being experienced by our clients on account of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as macro-trends in Zambia&#x2019;s economy (e.g., currency fluctuations, increased prices of goods and services). Because farmers must repay their loans in full in order to re-enroll in the following season, repayment challenges in the 2020 season were a factor with enrollment in 2021.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">Final M&amp;E data indicates that our Zambia program generated an average impact of $39 per farmer in 2019 which represents a similar impact to what we experienced in 2018. We would like to note that newer countries generally report lower impact, but we also recognize the need to fundamentally improve our ag package. Despite the low impact numbers, on the other hand - farmers tell us they have more dignity from being able to plant more land in our program, they recognize factors beyond 1AF&#x2019;s control (e.g., weather, prices) have hurt yields these past two years, and they see long-term potential in working with us. Zambia is a special case where we are working with 10-15 acre farmers who see farming more as a business and for whom severe hunger is not a prevailing challenge - they are better willing and able to take risks and seem to be taking the long view in wanting to continue in our program.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">We achieved an above-target average impact of $41 through the core program in Zambia in 2021. Clients harvested 118% more maize per client compared to non-clients, a dramatic increase. While this is well above our conservative targets, various external factors, including low maize prices, limited farmers&#x2019; ability to translate harvest gains into higher revenue corresponding to the yield increases.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">We anticipate significant improvements in impact as we fully transition into our tree planting program model anchored by our carbon credit work. To achieve this, we are aiming to achieve greater than 60% seedling survival for the 2022 season through prioritizing planting trainings. We are also modeling a new blended finance structure for our carbon pilot&#x2019;s intercropping agroforestry model. Farmers will receive tree survival cash incentives and the balance of future carbon credits; although we are in the initial stages of verifying carbon credits, we don&#x2019;t anticipate generating revenue from our carbon project until year 4 of the pilot. The Faidherbia albida trees that are being planted as part of the carbon pilot, will also improve overall crop impact (via nutrient cycling, soil health improvements, and improved water management).</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">SROI was below target, primarily due to the aforementioned impact shortfall. We would also like to note that in in the early years, Kenya and Rwanda also had SROIs below 1 (it takes time to build client trust and realize higher transactions and economies of scale to improve SROI); further we did see much stronger performance in 2019 vs. 2018 and look forward to share final results which will be available in our Q1 2020 report.</narrative>

While we were originally on track to surpass recent years&#x2019; repayment performance due to a strategic focus in this area, the pandemic unfortunately depressed the final figure. Not only did farmers face significant cash constraints due to the unforeseen crisis, but the ability of field staff to conduct key repayment activities was limited due to social distancing requirements. This in turn limited our SROI.</narrative>

We served 9,078 non-core program farm families through our agroforestry platform in 2021. While below our target, this constitutes a rapid scale-up in just its first year of operation. As part of our agroforestry work, particularly promising work is now underway to link the country&#x2019;s smallholders to carbon markets. In September 2021, One Acre Fund provided 220 farmers with Faidherbia albida seedlings to plant in rows, intercropped across a hectare of their annual crop fields (e.g., maize). Apart from providing tree inputs and training, One Acre Fund will also offer tree survival incentives to encourage farmers to keep trees in the ground long-term. Carbon credits will be brokered and verified (via remote sensing) by the Acorn program, a key partner for facilitating eventual carbon transactions.</narrative>

We are pursuing an agroforestry-based carbon credit pilot in Zambia, through which farmers will plant Faidherbia trees, intercropped across their annual crop (e.g., maize, soy) and receive payments to incentivize keeping trees in the ground. As previously mentioned, our first pilot kicked off in September 2021 with 220 farmers. Beginning in June, we will start enrolling our second cohort of farmers.
