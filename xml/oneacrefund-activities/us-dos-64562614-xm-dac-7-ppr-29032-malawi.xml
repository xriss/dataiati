   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Our prior project with the Dutch Government, &#x201C;Subsistence to Self-Reliance &#x2013; Bringing the Power of Markets to Africa&#x2019;s Lowest-Income Farmers&#x201D; underscored our shared passion for inclusive economic development and showcased the key milestones that we can accomplish together. Core operating support from DGIS facilitated the strategic expansion of One Acre Fund&#x2019;s &#x2018;impact ecosystem.&#x2019; Within two years, we doubled the scale of our farmer network, launched operations in two new country programs (Malawi and Uganda), and rolled out impactful new products like tree planting kits and clean cookstoves at country-wide scale. Simultaneously, we refined our innovative systems-change platform, leveraging our core organizational competencies to improve large-scale public and private actors&#x2019; service to smallholders. This success has now placed One Acre Fund in a position where we can realistically envision moving the needle on hunger and poverty across the entire African continent. Our current project with DGIS, &#x201C;Leading the Charge to Eradicate Rural Poverty,&#x201D; aims to capture this powerful opportunity. The project involves a smartly structured two-part investment spanning September 15, 2018 &#x2013; December 31, 2022: First, DGIS is once again providing critical support to the varied, evolving platforms within our organization that lay the foundation for our growth and impact. Core operating support from DGIS will enhance and extend One Acre Fund&#x2019;s proven model by funding key strategic priorities across our M&amp;E, R&amp;D, and new country expansion units. Secondly, DGIS is also providing working capital to revolutionize One Acre Fund&#x2019;s growth trajectory. This injection to our &#x2018;permanent fund&#x2019; will completely fund our projected expansion of 245,000+ new farm families in 2019, bringing us past the 1 millionth farmer milestone. Crucially, farmers&#x2019; loan repayments will replenish our permanent fund each year, allowing us to re-extend this contribution to provide input loans to an estimated 245,000 farm families (including over 980,000 children) annually. This project will anchor One Acre Fund&#x2019;s expansion to directly serve 1.85 million farm families annually by year-end 2022. Simultaneously, it will help us reach an additional 3.5 million farmers via systems-change partnerships that are expressly designed to transform entire agricultural ecosystems. Together, the reach of these efforts will generate transformative change for rural communities across rural Africa.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Q4 2021 was a busy period for our Malawi core program, with enrollment, inputs delivery, and planting occurring for the 2022 long-rains season. The 2021 long-rains season concluded with harvests in March-April of 2021, and One Acre Fund harvest measurement and analysis taking place thereafter. Since its founding in 2013, our Malawi program has established a track record of improving farm productivity in a food-deficient and environmentally vulnerable context. It remains a developing program, and its current focus is to increase farmer financial impact through improvements to our maize program, driving adoption of non-maize crops, and expanding our agroforestry platform.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">In 2020, One Acre Fund served 56,200 clients, significantly above our internal targets and a testament to the service our program is offering to farmers. We believe that our robust enrollment was the result of two factors: our strong harvest results in the past season (in which One Acre Fund farmers achieved ~50% higher production than their neighbors who did not enroll in our program), as well as digital tools that have enabled our field staff to continue working while social distancing.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">We served a below-target 57,000 clients in 2021, encompassing an estimated 148,000 children. We continue to pursue conservative growth in Malawi, as we seek to first improve our farmer financial impact prior to scaling more aggressively. Our ability to grow from 56,000 in 2020 to 62,300 in 2021 can be attributed to our marketing and brand-awareness efforts in expansion areas, as well as robust investments in radio advertising and advocacy-building among local leaders.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">One Acre Fund&#x2019;s systems change work in Malawi is best reflected by our growing agroforestry trials; we are ramping up production and distribution of seedlings, both to client families through our core program and to non-client families through our decentralized nursery model. Please note that the systems-change scale figure indicated in this report is for our agroforestry work within both the core program and decentralized nursery model). (i) In our core program model, we distributed 24,570 seedlings of three different tree species (Albezia labeck, Gliricidia sepium and Melia azederachwere) to 2,730 farmers in 2019, a meaningful proportion of One Acre Fund&apos;s total core clients in Malawi. (ii) In the decentralized nursery tree-planting model, we partnered with site-level outgrower nurseries to produce and distribute trees. Local entrepreneurs receive nursery &#x2018;starter kits&#x2019; (sockets, seeds and tools) to produce seedlings, then One Acre Fund buys back the seedlings (less the cost of kits) and distributes them to nearby farmers. In the 2019 season, a total of 145,500 Albizia lebbeck seedlings were distributed to 7,540 participating non-client farmers. We are optimistic that our decentralized nursery trial is an exciting innovation with the potential to extend the reach of our agroforestry work beyond our core program.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">We define farm families &apos;reached&apos; as households that benefitted from at least one systems-change intervention. We served 149,000 families through our systems-change platform in Malawi in 2021, well above our target of 120,000. Currently, our systems-change work is centered on agroforestry; we enabled the planting of 2.5 million trees by non-core program clients through this platform. Last year marked the program&#x2019;s largest expansion to date, with evidence of related logistical challenges (e.g., delayed seed delivery). We are closely monitoring site-level nursery performance and providing targeted guidance to ensure that partners are able to meet the increase in farmer demand.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">Our Malawi program missed our impact per farmer target on an absolute basis to achieve $14. In 2019, impact suffered from some flooding due to Cyclone Idai at the end of the season, and overall yields were suppressed by too much rain throughout the season. Protecting current impact and increasing impact even further will be a challenge for the next few seasons. We need to ensure food security, but simultaneously need to support farmers with building resilience to various shocks and slightly improve farm incomes through diversified crops. However, in spite of low impact, we recorded a ~80% yield gain which represents the value that our program can continue to generate for farmers.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">Our clients saw strong harvests this year, a powerful impact on food security in a very challenging year: One Acre Fund farmers improved their program yields by an impressive 45% compared to non-participating farmers. When we monetize this harvest improvement, we find that the average One Acre Fund farmer gained an additional $22 in agricultural profit relative to non-participating farmers and another $2 from trees, which altogether represents a 12% boost in profit. While external obstacles such as low maize prices appear to have reduced farmers&#x2019; ability to convert bigger harvests into significant new income, larger harvests represent a significant food security driver; According to the Food Insecurity Experience Scale, participating farmers saw a reduction in moderate to severe food insecurity of 8% and a reduction in severe food insecurity of 20%.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">We project to achieve impact of $24 from our Malawi core program in 2021, below our targets. One Acre Fund clients achieved harvests on average 47% higher than control farmers, providing a crucial safety net against food insecurity. A new government subsidy program drove higher adoption of fertilizer for non-One Acre Fund clients &#x2014; a positive for Malawi&#x2019;s farm families. However, this narrowed the yield difference between One Acre Fund clients and non-clients, and reduced our apparent impact. This was partly counteracted by strong adoption of and impact from groundnuts, a higher-revenue crop than maize, by our clients. Lastly, robust adoption of tree planting among core clients accounted for around $13 of per-client impact, with adopting clients planting an average of 8 trees that are expected to survive past one year.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">Malawi finished the 2020 season with a 97% loan repayment rate. This represents a strong improvement compared to the previous year, which we attribute in part to the convenience and security of our digital systems. Mobile repayment was a strong asset this season, as it enabled us to collect loan repayments while social distancing. However, SROI was affected by lower revenues due to narrow margins, higher costs due to unbudgeted COVID-19 spending (including health trainings to clients and soap distribution to clients and their neighbors), and higher transport costs related to fertilizer supply chain challenges.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">We measure our efficiency, or Social Return On Investment (SROI), as the amount of new profits our farmers generate for every $1 of donor investment in our program. We project to achieve an SROI of 1.7 in 2021, 20% above our target. Despite below-target farmer impact, on the cost side, strong loan repayment (98.4%) and cost savings counteracted foreign exchange losses, equating to strong SROI versus our targets. Looking ahead, our program has committed to achieving an SROI of 5 by the end of 2024; to unlock this robust efficiency, we will continue to scale our core program while improving impact and controlling costs; scale up our agroforestry platform; and roll out our rural retail program, which sells inputs (seed and fertilizer) to clients and non-clients alike.</narrative>
