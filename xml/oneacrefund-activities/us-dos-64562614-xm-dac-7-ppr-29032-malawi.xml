   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Malawi 2021 Q3 Country update: Malawi has enjoyed favorable conditions with adequate rainfall in recent months, resulting in a healthy crop in 2021, with significantly higher yields as compared to 2020 -- despite the ongoing impacts of COVID-19. This harvest boost is also increased by a new national fertilizer subsidy program that reached a large share of farmers (a program we helped support as a distributing partner with the government).</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Our prior project with the Dutch Government, &#x201C;Subsistence to Self-Reliance &#x2013; Bringing the Power of Markets to Africa&#x2019;s Lowest-Income Farmers&#x201D; underscored our shared passion for inclusive economic development and showcased the key milestones that we can accomplish together. Core operating support from DGIS facilitated the strategic expansion of One Acre Fund&#x2019;s &#x2018;impact ecosystem.&#x2019; Within two years, we doubled the scale of our farmer network, launched operations in two new country programs (Malawi and Uganda), and rolled out impactful new products like tree planting kits and clean cookstoves at country-wide scale. Simultaneously, we refined our innovative systems-change platform, leveraging our core organizational competencies to improve large-scale public and private actors&#x2019; service to smallholders. This success has now placed One Acre Fund in a position where we can realistically envision moving the needle on hunger and poverty across the entire African continent. Our current project with DGIS, &#x201C;Leading the Charge to Eradicate Rural Poverty,&#x201D; aims to capture this powerful opportunity. The project involves a smartly structured two-part investment spanning September 15, 2018 &#x2013; December 31, 2022: First, DGIS is once again providing critical support to the varied, evolving platforms within our organization that lay the foundation for our growth and impact. Core operating support from DGIS will enhance and extend One Acre Fund&#x2019;s proven model by funding key strategic priorities across our M&amp;E, R&amp;D, and new country expansion units. Secondly, DGIS is also providing working capital to revolutionize One Acre Fund&#x2019;s growth trajectory. This injection to our &#x2018;permanent fund&#x2019; will completely fund our projected expansion of 245,000+ new farm families in 2019, bringing us past the 1 millionth farmer milestone. Crucially, farmers&#x2019; loan repayments will replenish our permanent fund each year, allowing us to re-extend this contribution to provide input loans to an estimated 245,000 farm families (including over 980,000 children) annually. This project will anchor One Acre Fund&#x2019;s expansion to directly serve 1.85 million farm families annually by year-end 2022. Simultaneously, it will help us reach an additional 3.5 million farmers via systems-change partnerships that are expressly designed to transform entire agricultural ecosystems. Together, the reach of these efforts will generate transformative change for rural communities across rural Africa.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">In 2020, One Acre Fund served 56,200 clients, significantly above our internal targets and a testament to the service our program is offering to farmers. We believe that our robust enrollment was the result of two factors: our strong harvest results in the past season (in which One Acre Fund farmers achieved ~50% higher production than their neighbors who did not enroll in our program), as well as digital tools that have enabled our field staff to continue working while social distancing.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">One Acre Fund&#x2019;s systems change work in Malawi is best reflected by our growing agroforestry trials; we are ramping up production and distribution of seedlings, both to client families through our core program and to non-client families through our decentralized nursery model. Please note that the systems-change scale figure indicated in this report is for our agroforestry work within both the core program and decentralized nursery model). (i) In our core program model, we distributed 24,570 seedlings of three different tree species (Albezia labeck, Gliricidia sepium and Melia azederachwere) to 2,730 farmers in 2019, a meaningful proportion of One Acre Fund&apos;s total core clients in Malawi. (ii) In the decentralized nursery tree-planting model, we partnered with site-level outgrower nurseries to produce and distribute trees. Local entrepreneurs receive nursery &#x2018;starter kits&#x2019; (sockets, seeds and tools) to produce seedlings, then One Acre Fund buys back the seedlings (less the cost of kits) and distributes them to nearby farmers. In the 2019 season, a total of 145,500 Albizia lebbeck seedlings were distributed to 7,540 participating non-client farmers. We are optimistic that our decentralized nursery trial is an exciting innovation with the potential to extend the reach of our agroforestry work beyond our core program.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">Our systems change work in Malawi is centered on expanding our agroforestry program. This year marks Malawi&apos;s tree planting program&#x2019;s largest expansion to date, as demand for trees has surged among our core farmers. Despite evidence of logistical challenges throughout the expansion (e.g., delayed seed delivery), the adoption of a new decentralized nursery model in Malawi this year has proven successful. This model enables farmer-entrepreneurs to run the nurseries themselves, which directly supplies farmers with tree seedlings, cuts costs for delivery, reduces tree harm during transit, and ensures greater survival rates.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">Our Malawi program missed our impact per farmer target on an absolute basis to achieve $14. In 2019, impact suffered from some flooding due to Cyclone Idai at the end of the season, and overall yields were suppressed by too much rain throughout the season. Protecting current impact and increasing impact even further will be a challenge for the next few seasons. We need to ensure food security, but simultaneously need to support farmers with building resilience to various shocks and slightly improve farm incomes through diversified crops. However, in spite of low impact, we recorded a ~80% yield gain which represents the value that our program can continue to generate for farmers.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">Our clients saw strong harvests this year, a powerful impact on food security in a very challenging year: One Acre Fund farmers improved their program yields by an impressive 45% compared to non-participating farmers. When we monetize this harvest improvement, we find that the average One Acre Fund farmer gained an additional $22 in agricultural profit relative to non-participating farmers and another $2 from trees, which altogether represents a 12% boost in profit. While external obstacles such as low maize prices appear to have reduced farmers&#x2019; ability to convert bigger harvests into significant new income, larger harvests represent a significant food security driver; According to the Food Insecurity Experience Scale, participating farmers saw a reduction in moderate to severe food insecurity of 8% and a reduction in severe food insecurity of 20%.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">We are tracking above our impact targets in Malawi due in part to diversifying our crop offerings, incorporating new products that have higher profit potential than maize. To improve our monetary impact, we are focusing on maize production improvements, including introducing new seed types and fertilizer blends, as well as scaling legume and commercialization activities. Our agroforestry program also offers huge impact potential, as the low-cost program presents a unique opportunity for high returns on investment.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">Malawi finished the 2020 season with a 97% loan repayment rate. This represents a strong improvement compared to the previous year, which we attribute in part to the convenience and security of our digital systems. Mobile repayment was a strong asset this season, as it enabled us to collect loan repayments while social distancing. However, SROI was affected by lower revenues due to narrow margins, higher costs due to unbudgeted COVID-19 spending (including health trainings to clients and soap distribution to clients and their neighbors), and higher transport costs related to fertilizer supply chain challenges.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">SROI was below target, primarily due to the aforementioned impact shortfall.

      <comment>
       <narrative xml:lang="EN">We expect to meet our SROI target of 1.4 in Malawi this year because we improved impact (as detailed above) and cut operational operational costs. Lower costs are attributed to a) lower transport costs resulting from COVID-19 restrictions, b) lower mobile money fees (transaction charges incurred when farmers repay their loans via a digital service) resulting from better contracts with mobile network companies, and c) lower input prices and transaction sizes to align with the newly introduced government subsidy program. Repayment rates are also encouraging as they are closing at 98%, a highly positive figure for what remains a maturing country program.</narrative>
