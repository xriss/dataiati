   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In Rwanda, planting for the 2022A season concluded in October 2021, with harvest being conducted in January - March 2022. Enrollment for the 2022B season occurred in November-December 2021. One Acre Fund Rwanda&#x2019;s clients just started harvesting crops grown in the second planting season of the year. This year the Rwanda team is focusing on improving sustainability (which allows us to serve more farmers) through trialing new repayment strategies. These trials include a Credit Limit Trial happening in Nyaruguru and Ngoma districts, whereby farmers are being advised on optimal credit amounts that they will be able to pay in time, with pre-set credit caps for districts, among other innovations.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Our prior project with the Dutch Government, &#x201C;Subsistence to Self-Reliance &#x2013; Bringing the Power of Markets to Africa&#x2019;s Lowest-Income Farmers&#x201D; underscored our shared passion for inclusive economic development and showcased the key milestones that we can accomplish together. Core operating support from DGIS facilitated the strategic expansion of One Acre Fund&#x2019;s &#x2018;impact ecosystem.&#x2019; Within two years, we doubled the scale of our farmer network, launched operations in two new country programs (Malawi and Uganda), and rolled out impactful new products like tree planting kits and clean cookstoves at country-wide scale. Simultaneously, we refined our innovative systems-change platform, leveraging our core organizational competencies to improve large-scale public and private actors&#x2019; service to smallholders. This success has now placed One Acre Fund in a position where we can realistically envision moving the needle on hunger and poverty across the entire African continent. Our current project with DGIS, &#x201C;Leading the Charge to Eradicate Rural Poverty,&#x201D; aims to capture this powerful opportunity. The project involves a smartly structured two-part investment spanning September 15, 2018 &#x2013; December 31, 2022: First, DGIS is once again providing critical support to the varied, evolving platforms within our organization that lay the foundation for our growth and impact. Core operating support from DGIS will enhance and extend One Acre Fund&#x2019;s proven model by funding key strategic priorities across our M&amp;E, R&amp;D, and new country expansion units. Secondly, DGIS is also providing working capital to revolutionize One Acre Fund&#x2019;s growth trajectory. This injection to our &#x2018;permanent fund&#x2019; will completely fund our projected expansion of 245,000+ new farm families in 2019, bringing us past the 1 millionth farmer milestone. Crucially, farmers&#x2019; loan repayments will replenish our permanent fund each year, allowing us to re-extend this contribution to provide input loans to an estimated 245,000 farm families (including over 980,000 children) annually. This project will anchor One Acre Fund&#x2019;s expansion to directly serve 1.85 million farm families annually by year-end 2022. Simultaneously, it will help us reach an additional 3.5 million farmers via systems-change partnerships that are expressly designed to transform entire agricultural ecosystems. Together, the reach of these efforts will generate transformative change for rural communities across rural Africa.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">We measure our efficiency, or Social Return On Investment (SROI), as the amount of new profits our farmers generate for every $1 of donor investment in our program. Our Rwanda program ended the year with an SROI of 7.2, falling below our 2021 target of 9.5. Despite strong impact, it was more expensive to operate our program than expected, which drove down our SROI result. However, our Rwanda program remains our most cost-effective country program for 2021. In response to early-season indicators of below-target loan repayment, we implemented a number of debt relief measures &#x2014; including an extension of the 2021 season repayment deadline, a grace period for struggling clients, and repayment incentives for group leaders. These measures enabled us to collect 91% of loans (slightly above our 2020 rate of 90%); while well below our historical 98%+ repayment, our debt relief initiatives prevented a much lower rate while enabling thousands of families to re-enroll in the 2022 season.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">In 2022, we expect to achieve an SROI of 9 in Rwanda, meaning that every $1 donated will generate $9 in farmer impact. This year, we expect repayment to decrease slightly to 92% due to the higher costs of living as a result of the ongoing economic turbulence. However, we expect to enroll more farmers, and thus indirect costs per farmer to decrease through economies of scale.</narrative>

Our strong alignment with the Rwandan government&apos;s national priorities continues to boost our long-term goal of reaching every farming household country-wide through our core program or partnerships. In 2020, this work reached over 2.8 million farmer touchpoints (individual project interactions) in addition to our core program. Projects sought to catalyze local hybrid seed production, improve agricultural extension services, and expand the country&apos;s rural retail sector.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">We define farm families &apos;reached&apos; as households that benefitted from at least one systems-change intervention. We generated an above-target 4.1 million farmer &#x201C;touchpoints&#x201D; through our systems-change platform in Rwanda in 2021. In Rwanda as in Kenya, we are working to adapt our traditional core model to better serve smallholders in these rapidly evolving agricultural markets. Accordingly, these programs are developing new, highly flexible channels for ensuring that our services are as close to the farmer as possible, and available not just during annual enrollment seasons, but also year-round. As arguably One Acre Fund&#x2019;s most cost-efficient country context, our Rwanda program is continuing to deepen the scope and impact of its &#x201C;systems-change approach.&#x201D; By syncing its core program, government extension, rural retail, commercialization, and seed production efforts, we are on track to impact every farm family in Rwanda through at least one intervention (core program or systems-change) in the country over the coming years.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">In 2022 we plan to reach 4.7 million farmer touchpoints through our systems-change work. We will continue to focus on our partnership work with retail shops, private-sector actors and government extension agencies, coupled with the roll-out of our digital tools, to increase flexibility and accessibility for client and non-client farmers to access our products and services. 

The Smallholder Resilience Fund (SRF), kicked off last year and generously supported by DGIS, is a systems-change project that seeks to boost farmer profits and climate resilience. To date, the pilot has produced exciting proof points in its ability to improve smallholder production in a targeted value chain, and simultaneously invest in businesses that can then capitalize on that increased production. For more details, please review the SRF update report recently submitted to DGIS.</narrative>

      <comment>
       <narrative xml:lang="EN">We achieved an impact of $116 per farmer for the 2021 season, which is roughly in line with our set target of $117.60. Our crop impact increased by 18% compared with 2020, driven primarily by increased yields relative to control farmers, more cultivation of higher-revenue crops such as potatoes, and on-time delivery of farm inputs despite movement restrictions. To deepen farmer resilience and expand profits, we are continuing to explore market access pilots; these seek to help farmers diversify their crops, lessening their exposure to market or weather shocks, and improve their revenue through crop buy-backs. For example, in 2021, we tested aggregation, buyback, or export models for maize, poultry, avocados, and chilis. We are also piloting the SRF, supported in its pilot stage by DGIS, whereby we intervene at multiple levels within a given farm value chain to improve smallholder profits and climate resilience.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">We reached 631,400 farm families in Rwanda through our core program in 2020, expanding by an encouraging 67%. Key to this breakthrough growth included tech solutions for enabling operations in the COVID-19 context &#x2014; in particular, nationwide scale-up of USSD enrollment has allowed client signup and product ordering without face-to-face contact with our staff. Another key factor in our expansion this year was robust government support; we were encouraged by the government to expand to reach all of Rwanda&#x2019;s agricultural districts where we had not yet established operations. This invitation reflects the government&#x2019;s deep trust in our program and our strong support for government priorities. Our program now has very high program penetration in most areas of the country (we estimate that about 40% of all smallholder farmers in Rwanda are enrolled in our core program), and farmers typically cycle in and out of the program. There are some areas in which it is very difficult to find comparison farmers who have not been in the program, and those who have not might have picked up farming practices from nearby participating farmers. While all of this represents a measurement challenge, we view this &#x201C;whole market&#x201D; penetration overall as great news for farmers nationwide. With this type of reach, our work has the potential to achieve truly transformative impact on Rwanda&apos;s agriculture sector.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">We reached 631,834 farm families through our core program in Rwanda in 2021. While below our ambitious target of 692,700, this number nonetheless equals approximately one third of the total farming households (1.7 million) in Rwanda. Enrollment in 2021 was roughly in line with 2020 results. Economic factors linked to the global pandemic hurt farmer cash flow and thus drove lower loan repayment relative to past levels; since clients must fully repay their loans as a condition for re-enrolling in the following season, 2020&#x2019;s below-target loan repayment (90% vs. 98%+ historically) meant that fewer than expected clients from the 2020 season were eligible to participate in our program during the 2021 season.</narrative>
