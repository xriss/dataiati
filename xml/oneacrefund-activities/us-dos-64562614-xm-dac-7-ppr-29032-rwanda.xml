   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Our prior project with the Dutch Government, &#x201C;Subsistence to Self-Reliance &#x2013; Bringing the Power of Markets to Africa&#x2019;s Lowest-Income Farmers&#x201D; underscored our shared passion for inclusive economic development and showcased the key milestones that we can accomplish together. Core operating support from DGIS facilitated the strategic expansion of One Acre Fund&#x2019;s &#x2018;impact ecosystem.&#x2019; Within two years, we doubled the scale of our farmer network, launched operations in two new country programs (Malawi and Uganda), and rolled out impactful new products like tree planting kits and clean cookstoves at country-wide scale. Simultaneously, we refined our innovative systems-change platform, leveraging our core organizational competencies to improve large-scale public and private actors&#x2019; service to smallholders. This success has now placed One Acre Fund in a position where we can realistically envision moving the needle on hunger and poverty across the entire African continent. Our current project with DGIS, &#x201C;Leading the Charge to Eradicate Rural Poverty,&#x201D; aims to capture this powerful opportunity. The project involves a smartly structured two-part investment spanning September 15, 2018 &#x2013; December 31, 2022: First, DGIS is once again providing critical support to the varied, evolving platforms within our organization that lay the foundation for our growth and impact. Core operating support from DGIS will enhance and extend One Acre Fund&#x2019;s proven model by funding key strategic priorities across our M&amp;E, R&amp;D, and new country expansion units. Secondly, DGIS is also providing working capital to revolutionize One Acre Fund&#x2019;s growth trajectory. This injection to our &#x2018;permanent fund&#x2019; will completely fund our projected expansion of 245,000+ new farm families in 2019, bringing us past the 1 millionth farmer milestone. Crucially, farmers&#x2019; loan repayments will replenish our permanent fund each year, allowing us to re-extend this contribution to provide input loans to an estimated 245,000 farm families (including over 980,000 children) annually. This project will anchor One Acre Fund&#x2019;s expansion to directly serve 1.85 million farm families annually by year-end 2022. Simultaneously, it will help us reach an additional 3.5 million farmers via systems-change partnerships that are expressly designed to transform entire agricultural ecosystems. Together, the reach of these efforts will generate transformative change for rural communities across rural Africa.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Rwanda 2021 Q3 Country update: Our Rwanda program is on track to meet or exceed 2021 targets for all milestones, despite the ongoing effects of COVID-19. As of writing, farmers have received their inputs for the 2022A (September 2021 planting, January-February 2022 harvest), and planting is taking place in most areas. Our ability to continue to serve farmers in Rwanda during this challenging period &#x2014; and indeed to grow our client base &#x2014; continues to be driven by sustained demand for our program in new and existing areas of operation, supported by digital tools that enable farmer interaction with limited contact from our staff.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">We are on track to meet our SROI target of 9.5 in Rwanda this year. Our impact numbers on track, and we have significantly lowered operational costs this season, compensating for lower repayment rates (at 97%) than our historical averages. This achievement has been supported by the rapid expansion of our digital farmer engagement this year. One Acre Fund developed and scaled a novel USSD platform that enables clients to directly enroll in our program using their mobile phones, access e-banking services (e.g., auto SMS repayment receipts and loan balance monitoring), and receive real-time tailored information via SMS (e.g., weather/planting guidance, and crop pest/disease alerts). In Rwanda, over 700,000 farmers successfully enrolled in our core program in 2021 via this platform. Additionally, the platform has significantly improved the country program&#x2019;s field staff efficiency; farmers served per Field Officer (FO) is projected to increase from 399 in the 2020 season to 481 in 2021.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">Rwanda continues to represent one of our largest, most impactful, and uniquely dynamic programs. Our strong alignment with the Rwandan government&apos;s national priorities continues to boost our long-term goal of reaching every farming household country-wide through our core program or partnerships. In 2020, this work reached over 2.8 million farmer touchpoints (individual project interactions) in addition to our core program. Projects sought to catalyze local hybrid seed production, improve agricultural extension services, and expand the country&apos;s rural retail sector.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">Our Rwanda team is leading our systems change work across several channels through focused partnerships with public and private sector actors. Our Rwanda &#x2018;agro-dealer partner shops&#x2019; model, for example, is an exciting initiative that enables us to reach non-client farmers with quality inputs and training as in our core program, but with the flexibility of year-round access and alternate payment options (e.g., cash sales, layaways). Additionally, we support the growth of these agro-businesses by investing in their services (i.e., digitization, new products, and financing). We have partnered with 66 agro-dealers since 2019, generating an estimated $21 per farmer impact via the shops. We now plan to gradually resume growth and scale to 126 shops by 2022, stimulating a greater market for quality inputs and training through Rwanda&#x2019;s rural network of agro-dealers.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">Early data suggests that we will likely achieve our impact targets in Rwanda this year, helping families protect their food security and improve their livelihoods despite the challenges resulting from the pandemic. Favorable weather, combined with on-time delivery of farm inputs despite movement restrictions, appear to have enabled strong harvests once again, leading to a projected income boost of $118 per farmer. To deepen farmer resilience and profits, we are continuing to explore market access pilots that seek to help farmers diversify their crops, lessening their exposure to market or weather shocks, and improve their revenue through crop buy-backs. In 2021, we are testing aggregation, buyback, or export models for maize, poultry, avocados, and chilies.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">We reached 631,400 farm families in Rwanda through our core program in 2020, expanding by an encouraging 67%. Key to this breakthrough growth included tech solutions for enabling operations in the COVID-19 context &#x2014; in particular, nationwide scale-up of USSD enrollment has allowed client signup and product ordering without face-to-face contact with our staff. Another key factor in our expansion this year was robust government support; we were encouraged by the government to expand to reach all of Rwanda&#x2019;s agricultural districts where we had not yet established operations. This invitation reflects the government&#x2019;s deep trust in our program and our strong support for government priorities. Our program now has very high program penetration in most areas of the country (we estimate that about 40% of all smallholder farmers in Rwanda are enrolled in our core program), and farmers typically cycle in and out of the program. There are some areas in which it is very difficult to find comparison farmers who have not been in the program, and those who have not might have picked up farming practices from nearby participating farmers. While all of this represents a measurement challenge, we view this &#x201C;whole market&#x201D; penetration overall as great news for farmers nationwide. With this type of reach, our work has the potential to achieve truly transformative impact on Rwanda&apos;s agriculture sector.</narrative>
