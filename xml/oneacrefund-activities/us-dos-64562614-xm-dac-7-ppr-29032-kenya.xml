   <narrative xml:lang="EN">At the end of 2021, we kicked off operations supporting the 2022 long-rains season, with contract signing concluding in November. One Acre fund delivered inputs to farmers who successfully submitted repayment. The current long-rains season will conclude in September. 

After a successful four-district trial in 2021, we are also now scaling our multi-channel program model enabling year-round access to farm products and training, through multiple payment options (ex: group credit, individual credit, cash, or layaway). These channels are: (a) field officer (our traditional &#x2018;core program&#x2019;), (b) rural retail &#x201C;duka&#x201D; shops, and, soon, (c) a digital platform that will enable home delivery orders, digital trainings, and optimized agronomy (ex: weather data, plot-specific seed, fertilizer and lime recommendations). A key reason we are expanding dukas (or retail shops) in particular is that it allows us to serve the poorest farmers in the communities where we work - farmers who do not feel comfortable taking on the core bundle loan. Through the dukas and the added flexibility of the multi-channel model, cash-strapped farmers can choose exactly what transaction size they are comfortable with, at the timing they are most comfortable.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Our prior project with the Dutch Government, &#x201C;Subsistence to Self-Reliance &#x2013; Bringing the Power of Markets to Africa&#x2019;s Lowest-Income Farmers&#x201D; underscored our shared passion for inclusive economic development and showcased the key milestones that we can accomplish together. Core operating support from DGIS facilitated the strategic expansion of One Acre Fund&#x2019;s &#x2018;impact ecosystem.&#x2019; Within two years, we doubled the scale of our farmer network, launched operations in two new country programs (Malawi and Uganda), and rolled out impactful new products like tree planting kits and clean cookstoves at country-wide scale. Simultaneously, we refined our innovative systems-change platform, leveraging our core organizational competencies to improve large-scale public and private actors&#x2019; service to smallholders. This success has now placed One Acre Fund in a position where we can realistically envision moving the needle on hunger and poverty across the entire African continent. Our current project with DGIS, &#x201C;Leading the Charge to Eradicate Rural Poverty,&#x201D; aims to capture this powerful opportunity. The project involves a smartly structured two-part investment spanning September 15, 2018 &#x2013; December 31, 2022: First, DGIS is once again providing critical support to the varied, evolving platforms within our organization that lay the foundation for our growth and impact. Core operating support from DGIS will enhance and extend One Acre Fund&#x2019;s proven model by funding key strategic priorities across our M&amp;E, R&amp;D, and new country expansion units. Secondly, DGIS is also providing working capital to revolutionize One Acre Fund&#x2019;s growth trajectory. This injection to our &#x2018;permanent fund&#x2019; will completely fund our projected expansion of 245,000+ new farm families in 2019, bringing us past the 1 millionth farmer milestone. Crucially, farmers&#x2019; loan repayments will replenish our permanent fund each year, allowing us to re-extend this contribution to provide input loans to an estimated 245,000 farm families (including over 980,000 children) annually. This project will anchor One Acre Fund&#x2019;s expansion to directly serve 1.85 million farm families annually by year-end 2022. Simultaneously, it will help us reach an additional 3.5 million farmers via systems-change partnerships that are expressly designed to transform entire agricultural ecosystems. Together, the reach of these efforts will generate transformative change for rural communities across rural Africa.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">In 2019, our Kenya program attained an social return on investment (SROI) of 3.8 falling below our 2019 core program target of 4.8. Our SROI was affected by various challenges which include: 1) Constrained rainfall (rain started, farmers planted, and then rain stopped for a full month when crops were most vulnerable), 2) The aforementioned impact shortfall - which was as a result of material expansion into newer program areas (where One Acre Fund has less experience), and 3) Below target loan repayment which resulted in a shortfall of our sustainability target allowing for only 79% of our field costs being covered by farmer loan repayments, compared to our deliberately ambitious target of 88%.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">SROI in 2020 was 4.7 despite of the unprecedented COVID-19 challenges this season. We recorded decreased revenues due to lower loan repayment; the Kenya program ended the 2020 season with 92.2% repayment, below our target and three-year average of 98%, yet largely in line with COVID-19 updated projections. We attribute the below-target repayment rate to farmer cash constraints caused by the ongoing pandemic, coupled with flooding and locust infestation in some parts of the country. We achieved sustainability of 85.3%, meaning that 85.3% of total costs for Kenya were covered by field revenues collected here.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">We measure our efficiency, or Social Return On Investment (SROI), as the amount of new profits our farmers generate for every $1 of donor investment in our program. We achieved an SROI of 3.6, meaning that every $1 in donor funding generated $3.60 in farmer impact. Our improved SROI performance for 2021 can be credited, in part, to cost reduction initiatives such as instituting staff tablets and mobile repayment, which have rapidly expanded our digital farmer engagement. Kenyan clients can now retrieve loan balances, register for farm inputs, and receive product advice and crop support through their mobile phones - reducing the burden on field officers and increasing efficiency. In addition to measures we implemented to enhance our impact (as described above), we also implemented several debt relief measures and extended repayment deadlines to boost long-term repayment rates.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">In 2022, we expect to achieve an SROI of 3.6 in Kenya, meaning that every $1 donated will generate $3.60 in farmer impact. This year, we expect the repayment rate to increase from 88% in 2021 to 94% and sustainability to also slightly increase through cost-optimization measures like site mergers, investments in field team skills, and increasing the number of farmers served by each field officer, primarily through the introduction of new channels as we scale our multi-channel program model. As we enroll more farmers, indirect costs per farmer will continue to decrease through economies of scale. We expect some volatility in this metric as the global supply chain challenges further unfold.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">Our Kenya program grew by 11% in 2020, reaching 451,700 farm families. Expansion was below historical growth due to impact challenges dating back to the last two seasons in which a perfect storm of ill-timed rainfall, crop damage from the invasive pest fall armyworm, and record-low maize prices reduced profits for farmers; these challenges understandably made farmers reluctant to commit to agricultural loans in 2020.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">Our Kenya program grew by 16% in 2021, reaching 527,580 farm families. We are pleased that &#x2014; despite the substantial obstacles imposed by the pandemic &#x2014; we increased our total client base by 75,880 farmers in 2021. We attribute this growth to improved digital tools that facilitate farmer interactions (e.g., enrollment, ordering of farm inputs, mobile money repayment, training, and tracking of loan repayment balances), that enabled safe service delivery amid the pandemic. Additionally, our debt relief initiatives rolled out this year enabled farmers who struggled to repay their loans in 2020 to re-enroll in 2021. This has led to a strong year-over-year client retention rate of 76%.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">For the 2022 season, we are set to serve 447,900 clients through our core program. Changes made in 2022 to the way farmers enroll in our program is expected to slow program growth in the short term (decreasing enrollment by ~15%). In recognition of repayment challenges in 2020-2021, we implemented a modest increase in the farmer prepayment requirement. The purpose of this change was to increase repayment by reinforcing farmer commitment and mitigating our overall portfolio risk. Ultimately, we are confident that this short-term reduction in scale is a reasonable tradeoff for the long term efficiency and health of the program.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">Our Kenya program experienced a second year of challenging impact in 2019, primarily due to adverse weather. Poorly timed rains meant that maize yields were lower than expected. Still, One Acre Fund remained a good investment for the average farmer &#x2013; we estimate that Kenyan farmers achieved 43% higher incomes than their non-enrolled neighbors on activities we support. To preserve and deepen our impact moving forward, we are focused on improving farmer resilience through increased crop and income diversification (e.g., agroforestry, livestock, and other cash crops). We are running a number of distinct crop diversity trials in Central region, where farmers are already accustomed to growing a range of crops beyond maize and where we see strong potential for added impact. We are also working to optimize our input delivery schedule to better meet the needs of farmers in the northern part of Central region, where the rainy season is timed differently than our other program areas in Kenya.</narrative>

Maize impact was significantly higher in 2021 vs 2020, and crop and income diversification (e.g., through tree planting and non-maize crops such as potatoes and beans) helped boost our farmer impact despite the significant challenges this season. We were also able to secure loan forgiveness of $450,000 from our weather index insurance for farmers whose harvests were disrupted by dry weather during the growing season.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">Though Kenya is one of our mature country programs, our systems-change work in the country remains at a much earlier stage than One Acre Fund&apos;s other country contexts (e.g., Rwanda). As mentioned in our previous reports, we are continuing to lay the groundwork for promising potential partnerships focused on rural retail and solar inputs. For example, to address farmers&apos; demand for high-quality products year-round, we launched our rural retail trial in late 2019. In August 2019, we incorporated poultry sales into this trial, selling 122 chickens to 22 farmers in the first week of this intervention. We will look to scale these up in subsequent years if M&amp;E demonstrates a strong impact and business case. Since the launch of this trial, we have sold 1,523 Rainbow Rooster chickens to over 100 farmers via 4 dukas.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">We define farm families &apos;reached&apos; as households that benefitted from at least one systems-change intervention. We increased the number of farmers reached by our systems-change unit in Kenya by 300% in 2021, reaching 261,749 farm touchpoints, despite falling slightly short of our ambitious target of 300,900. Our Kenya country program is currently transitioning to a new multi-channel program model, as noted above, focused on reaching more ultra-poor smallholder farmers as part of our systems-change work. A key element of this model is One Acre Fund owned and operated rural retail shops, or Dukas, which we are continuing to scale up rapidly. Dukas allow us to serve the poorest farmers where we work, including those who may choose not to participate in our core program; farmers can choose exactly what transaction size they are comfortable with, at the timing they are most comfortable.</narrative>
