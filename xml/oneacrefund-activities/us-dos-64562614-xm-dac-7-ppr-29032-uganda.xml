   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Our prior project with the Dutch Government, &#x201C;Subsistence to Self-Reliance &#x2013; Bringing the Power of Markets to Africa&#x2019;s Lowest-Income Farmers&#x201D; underscored our shared passion for inclusive economic development and showcased the key milestones that we can accomplish together. Core operating support from DGIS facilitated the strategic expansion of One Acre Fund&#x2019;s &#x2018;impact ecosystem.&#x2019; Within two years, we doubled the scale of our farmer network, launched operations in two new country programs (Malawi and Uganda), and rolled out impactful new products like tree planting kits and clean cookstoves at country-wide scale. Simultaneously, we refined our innovative systems-change platform, leveraging our core organizational competencies to improve large-scale public and private actors&#x2019; service to smallholders. This success has now placed One Acre Fund in a position where we can realistically envision moving the needle on hunger and poverty across the entire African continent. Our current project with DGIS, &#x201C;Leading the Charge to Eradicate Rural Poverty,&#x201D; aims to capture this powerful opportunity. The project involves a smartly structured two-part investment spanning September 15, 2018 &#x2013; December 31, 2022: First, DGIS is once again providing critical support to the varied, evolving platforms within our organization that lay the foundation for our growth and impact. Core operating support from DGIS will enhance and extend One Acre Fund&#x2019;s proven model by funding key strategic priorities across our M&amp;E, R&amp;D, and new country expansion units. Secondly, DGIS is also providing working capital to revolutionize One Acre Fund&#x2019;s growth trajectory. This injection to our &#x2018;permanent fund&#x2019; will completely fund our projected expansion of 245,000+ new farm families in 2019, bringing us past the 1 millionth farmer milestone. Crucially, farmers&#x2019; loan repayments will replenish our permanent fund each year, allowing us to re-extend this contribution to provide input loans to an estimated 245,000 farm families (including over 980,000 children) annually. This project will anchor One Acre Fund&#x2019;s expansion to directly serve 1.85 million farm families annually by year-end 2022. Simultaneously, it will help us reach an additional 3.5 million farmers via systems-change partnerships that are expressly designed to transform entire agricultural ecosystems. Together, the reach of these efforts will generate transformative change for rural communities across rural Africa.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Uganda 2021 Q3 Country update: After trials in 2020, we are now serving clients in Uganda across two agricultural seasons each year: the long rains (February &#x2013; July) and the short rains (August &#x2013; November). This two-season approach enables farmers to take more agricultural inputs that will boost their farm production and food security. Harvesting for the long rains season has just began, and enrollment and input delivery for the short rains season has recently been completed.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">In 2018, we made the decision to reduce our program size to focus on the districts that had the highest loan repayment rates in 2018: Kamuli, Jinja, and Iganga. In 2019, these districts had a total of 8,000 farmers who signed up for our program. While this is slightly lower than the 10,000 farmers we served in 2018, it is above our initial target of 7,000 farmers this year. Significantly, this streamlining of our program has allowed us to refine our operations as we look towards future expansion.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">Despite the onset of COVID-19 in 2020, we grew by 8% year-on-year to reach nearly 13,000 farm families, signaling strong farmer demand for our services. We attribute this growth to farmer interest in our new crop offerings (especially beans and groundnuts) that have served to improve our program&#x2019;s value proposition during an economically challenging time. While we are tracking below our 2021 target, we are continuing to expand our interventions in Uganda to achieve stronger market penetration through systems change work.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">Our Uganda program attained an absolute impact of $18 in 2019. Unpredictable weather, droughts, and pests affected our clients&#x2019; harvests and food security, underscoring the need to build their capacities to adapt to climate change. Our insight about the profitability of maize in growth countries such as Uganda has led us to formulate new action plans to both improve the profitability of maize and promote alternative, resilience-focused interventions such as radical crop diversification. In Uganda, for example, we plan to trial new crops for which markets already exist such as beans, coffee, bananas, and vegetables.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">Although the Uganda program has shown consistently robust yield gains for our maize farmers, our dollar impact per farmer has been relatively low, mainly driven by economic / demographic factors that make Uganda ill-suited to a maize-based core program. To compensate for this difficult operating environment, we have made investments into other high-value crops (beyond maize) as targets for agricultural market development, including coffee (detailed above) and agroforestry. In 2020, we set up the infrastructure for an agroforestry program in Uganda and began agroforestry training to all core program clients.  In 2021, we delivered tree seedlings to all Uganda clients for free; more than 370,000 trees have been delivered to 12,000 farmers to date, and we anticipate at least $30 of additional impact per farmer through this product (depending on survival rates). We plan to continue building on successful early tree work in Uganda as a supplementary source of long-term assets and environmental impact.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">We saw strong repayment in 2020, with 96% of farmers repaying their loans. This, along with cost-cutting measures to improve efficiency, drove a significant increase in our field sustainability year-over-year (40% in 2020 vs 20% in 2019). Despite strong repayment lifting revenues, below-target farmer impact limited our 2020 SROI. To drive higher cost-effective impact, we are better meeting farmer needs by serving clients in multiple seasons, optimizing our products to ensure consistent demand, rolling out a free tree product, and implementing a range of program adjustments to improve operational efficiency.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">While we are on track to meet our SROI target of 1.5 in Uganda, our team is committed to raising this number country-wide and have identified opportunities to both improve monetary impact as detailed in our impact section while cutting costs. First, we succeeded in increasing our ratio of clients served by each field officer to 260 (up from 220 in 2020) without any geographical expansion, thus improving our economies of scale. We also enrolled all clients using tablets for the first time, and are conducting repayment in the same way. Leveraging digital tools in this way effectively reduces the transport costs and other expenses associated with paper-based processes.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">Our systems change work in Uganda is centered on a new product offering: coffee. We have had initial success with coffee trials (reaching 3,000 farmers), and are projecting promising results: it achieved an enrollment target of 3,000 farmers amid COVID-19 lockdowns, with over 90% of them showing strong compliance with recommended agricultural practices. We are actively pursuing potential partnerships for coffee distribution and intend to accelerate this initiative in the year ahead.  We also see strong potential to drive even higher impact in the future through key partnerships across Uganda&#x2019;s coffee value chain and plan to enter a formal partnership with UGACOF, Uganda&#x2019;s largest private coffee exporter, for buy-back of coffee produced by clients in our ongoing trial this year.</narrative>
