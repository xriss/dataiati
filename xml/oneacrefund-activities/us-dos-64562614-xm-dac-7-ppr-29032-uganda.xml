   <narrative xml:lang="EN">One Acre Fund has chosen to transition away from our traditional core program in Uganda in 2022. Despite recent improvements in clients&#x2019; maize yields, our impact has remained low in Uganda due in part to a uniquely challenging export-driven maize market. After assessing the effectiveness of strategic approaches developed in 2020, we decided to chart a new way forward based on two strong pillars: coffee and agroforestry. We are confident that this two-pillar program will offer a rare and powerful opportunity for farmers to transform their livelihoods through higher farmer profits from our coffee program and long-term assets and climate resilience embedded in our agroforestry model.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Our prior project with the Dutch Government, &#x201C;Subsistence to Self-Reliance &#x2013; Bringing the Power of Markets to Africa&#x2019;s Lowest-Income Farmers&#x201D; underscored our shared passion for inclusive economic development and showcased the key milestones that we can accomplish together. Core operating support from DGIS facilitated the strategic expansion of One Acre Fund&#x2019;s &#x2018;impact ecosystem.&#x2019; Within two years, we doubled the scale of our farmer network, launched operations in two new country programs (Malawi and Uganda), and rolled out impactful new products like tree planting kits and clean cookstoves at country-wide scale. Simultaneously, we refined our innovative systems-change platform, leveraging our core organizational competencies to improve large-scale public and private actors&#x2019; service to smallholders. This success has now placed One Acre Fund in a position where we can realistically envision moving the needle on hunger and poverty across the entire African continent. Our current project with DGIS, &#x201C;Leading the Charge to Eradicate Rural Poverty,&#x201D; aims to capture this powerful opportunity. The project involves a smartly structured two-part investment spanning September 15, 2018 &#x2013; December 31, 2022: First, DGIS is once again providing critical support to the varied, evolving platforms within our organization that lay the foundation for our growth and impact. Core operating support from DGIS will enhance and extend One Acre Fund&#x2019;s proven model by funding key strategic priorities across our M&amp;E, R&amp;D, and new country expansion units. Secondly, DGIS is also providing working capital to revolutionize One Acre Fund&#x2019;s growth trajectory. This injection to our &#x2018;permanent fund&#x2019; will completely fund our projected expansion of 245,000+ new farm families in 2019, bringing us past the 1 millionth farmer milestone. Crucially, farmers&#x2019; loan repayments will replenish our permanent fund each year, allowing us to re-extend this contribution to provide input loans to an estimated 245,000 farm families (including over 980,000 children) annually. This project will anchor One Acre Fund&#x2019;s expansion to directly serve 1.85 million farm families annually by year-end 2022. Simultaneously, it will help us reach an additional 3.5 million farmers via systems-change partnerships that are expressly designed to transform entire agricultural ecosystems. Together, the reach of these efforts will generate transformative change for rural communities across rural Africa.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">We define farm families &apos;reached&apos; as households that benefitted from at least one systems-change intervention. Our systems-change work in Uganda is centered on a new product offering: coffee. We have had initial success with coffee trials (reaching 3,000 farmers), and are projecting promising results. We achieved our enrollment target amid COVID-19 lockdowns, with over 90% of them showing strong compliance with recommended agricultural practices. We are actively pursuing potential partnerships for coffee distribution and intend to accelerate this initiative in the year ahead.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">In 2022, we will build on the success of our early-stage trials through a market access partnership for our coffee program. In November 2021, we launched a pilot with the coffee processor UGACOF. This initial venture will help us refine and improve market access opportunities as we integrate the UGACOF partnership into our wider coffee program. We anticipate reaching 6,000+ smallholder farmers through our coffee platform this year. We will pause the scaling of our tree program this year and focus on improving our new agroforestry model through reaching our target seedling survival rates of 60%+ and increasing farmer access to seedlings. We are on track to distribute 310,000 seedlings to 10,000 farmers by year-end.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">In 2018, we made the decision to reduce our program size to focus on the districts that had the highest loan repayment rates in 2018: Kamuli, Jinja, and Iganga. In 2019, these districts had a total of 8,000 farmers who signed up for our program. While this is slightly lower than the 10,000 farmers we served in 2018, it is above our initial target of 7,000 farmers this year. Significantly, this streamlining of our program has allowed us to refine our operations as we look towards future expansion.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">Starting in 2022, we made the strategic decision to pivot away from our core program in Uganda to a two-pillar program focused on cash crops (i.e., coffee and trees). We are looking into ways to support staple crops as we transition into our new model. For this year, farmers are still able to purchase the inputs that we have offered in previous years, but without the credit (which requires a lot of time/effort to administer). Farmers are able to place orders through the Tree Officer and then pay using a lay-away system and receive their inputs in time for the LR2022 season. Under our coffee program, we are also running an input sales trial, providing fertilizer and tools to farmers in our training program.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">Clients in Uganda earned an income boost of $47 from activities we supported in 2021, below our target of $69. Extensive improvements to our core program in Uganda have helped to drive yield increases for our clients; early harvest analysis shows significant yield increase of 70% compared to non-clients. However, low crop prices in Uganda meant that harvest yield increases did not correspond to targeted financial impact for our clients. As noted above, $ impact challenges have prompted the strategic decision to pivot from food crops (maize) towards cash crops (coffee) and trees beginning in the 2022 season.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">Our Uganda program attained an absolute impact of $18 in 2019. Unpredictable weather, droughts, and pests affected our clients&#x2019; harvests and food security, underscoring the need to build their capacities to adapt to climate change. Our insight about the profitability of maize in growth countries such as Uganda has led us to formulate new action plans to both improve the profitability of maize and promote alternative, resilience-focused interventions such as radical crop diversification. In Uganda, for example, we plan to trial new crops for which markets already exist such as beans, coffee, bananas, and vegetables.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">In 2022 we anticipate generating an average impact of $50 per farmer through our coffee and agroforestry program. This year we are focusing on improving our new two-pillar program through developing the market access support component of our coffee program to ensure farmers have access to better prices and greater profits that will significantly improve their livelihoods. We estimate that combined with annual yield increases, market access partnerships will unlock an $80-100+ impact per farmer. As part of our push to improve the seedling survival rates of our tree program, we are now moving from a centralized nursery model to a fully decentralized model. With the new decentralized model, each mid-size tree nursery will produce seedlings in proportion to the population of the surrounding villages. Our clients can then simply walk to their neighborhood nursery to pick up their tree seedlings. Ultimately, this cuts delivery costs, reduces tree harm during transit, and ensures greater survival rates. We are confident that our new cash crop and tree focused program will generate higher farmer impact in years to come.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">We saw strong repayment in 2020, with 96% of farmers repaying their loans. This, along with cost-cutting measures to improve efficiency, drove a significant increase in our field sustainability year-over-year (40% in 2020 vs 20% in 2019). Despite strong repayment lifting revenues, below-target farmer impact limited our 2020 SROI. To drive higher cost-effective impact, we are better meeting farmer needs by serving clients in multiple seasons, optimizing our products to ensure consistent demand, rolling out a free tree product, and implementing a range of program adjustments to improve operational efficiency.</narrative>
