   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Our prior project with the Dutch Government, &#x201C;Subsistence to Self-Reliance &#x2013; Bringing the Power of Markets to Africa&#x2019;s Lowest-Income Farmers&#x201D; underscored our shared passion for inclusive economic development and showcased the key milestones that we can accomplish together. Core operating support from DGIS facilitated the strategic expansion of One Acre Fund&#x2019;s &#x2018;impact ecosystem.&#x2019; Within two years, we doubled the scale of our farmer network, launched operations in two new country programs (Malawi and Uganda), and rolled out impactful new products like tree planting kits and clean cookstoves at country-wide scale. Simultaneously, we refined our innovative systems-change platform, leveraging our core organizational competencies to improve large-scale public and private actors&#x2019; service to smallholders. This success has now placed One Acre Fund in a position where we can realistically envision moving the needle on hunger and poverty across the entire African continent. Our current project with DGIS, &#x201C;Leading the Charge to Eradicate Rural Poverty,&#x201D; aims to capture this powerful opportunity. The project involves a smartly structured two-part investment spanning September 15, 2018 &#x2013; December 31, 2022: First, DGIS is once again providing critical support to the varied, evolving platforms within our organization that lay the foundation for our growth and impact. Core operating support from DGIS will enhance and extend One Acre Fund&#x2019;s proven model by funding key strategic priorities across our M&amp;E, R&amp;D, and new country expansion units. Secondly, DGIS is also providing working capital to revolutionize One Acre Fund&#x2019;s growth trajectory. This injection to our &#x2018;permanent fund&#x2019; will completely fund our projected expansion of 245,000+ new farm families in 2019, bringing us past the 1 millionth farmer milestone. Crucially, farmers&#x2019; loan repayments will replenish our permanent fund each year, allowing us to re-extend this contribution to provide input loans to an estimated 245,000 farm families (including over 980,000 children) annually. This project will anchor One Acre Fund&#x2019;s expansion to directly serve 1.85 million farm families annually by year-end 2022. Simultaneously, it will help us reach an additional 3.5 million farmers via systems-change partnerships that are expressly designed to transform entire agricultural ecosystems. Together, the reach of these efforts will generate transformative change for rural communities across rural Africa.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Uganda represents potential for widespread impact, as a majority of its smallholder population face a large yield gap due to factors such as low fertilizer adoption. Our Uganda program has sought to capture this possibility, and provided our core bundle of services for nearly 13,000 farmers in 2021. Also in 2021, One Acre Fund&#x2019;s country leadership in Uganda began exploring new approaches for improving our program&#x2019;s impact. While maize is the main crop that we support in most of our program countries, economic and demographic factors mean that a maize-focused program in Uganda faces unique challenges: as a net exporter of most staples, the market prices of maize, groundnuts, beans, etc. are significantly lower in Uganda than in Kenya and Rwanda. As a result, even though One Acre Fund&#x2019;s program has a strong impact on client maize yields in Uganda &#x2014; for example, a 79% improvement per acre in 2020 &#x2014; our dollar impact on maize profits has been consistently lower than our targets. In response, starting in 2022, we made the strategic decision to pivot from maize (food crop) towards cash crops (i.e., coffee and trees). While these discussions are still ongoing, new interventions in coffee and trees offer an opportunity for One Acre Fund to serve Uganda&#x2019;s smallholders and broader agricultural systems at a deeper level of impact.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">In 2018, we made the decision to reduce our program size to focus on the districts that had the highest loan repayment rates in 2018: Kamuli, Jinja, and Iganga. In 2019, these districts had a total of 8,000 farmers who signed up for our program. While this is slightly lower than the 10,000 farmers we served in 2018, it is above our initial target of 7,000 farmers this year. Significantly, this streamlining of our program has allowed us to refine our operations as we look towards future expansion.</narrative>

While below target, growth was driven by farmer interest in our new crop offerings (especially beans and groundnuts) that have served to improve our program&#x2019;s value proposition during an economically challenging time.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">Our Uganda program attained an absolute impact of $18 in 2019. Unpredictable weather, droughts, and pests affected our clients&#x2019; harvests and food security, underscoring the need to build their capacities to adapt to climate change. Our insight about the profitability of maize in growth countries such as Uganda has led us to formulate new action plans to both improve the profitability of maize and promote alternative, resilience-focused interventions such as radical crop diversification. In Uganda, for example, we plan to trial new crops for which markets already exist such as beans, coffee, bananas, and vegetables.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">We project that clients in Uganda will earn an income boost of $47 from activities we support in 2021, below our target of $69. As noted above, extensive improvements to our core program in Uganda have helped to drive yield increases for our clients; early harvest analysis shows significant yield increase of 70% compared to non-clients. However, low crop prices in Uganda meant that harvest yield increases did not correspond to targeted financial impact for our clients. As noted above, $ impact challenges have prompted the strategic decision to pivot from maize (food crop) towards cash crops (i.e., coffee and trees) beginning in the 2022 season.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">We saw strong repayment in 2020, with 96% of farmers repaying their loans. This, along with cost-cutting measures to improve efficiency, drove a significant increase in our field sustainability year-over-year (40% in 2020 vs 20% in 2019). Despite strong repayment lifting revenues, below-target farmer impact limited our 2020 SROI. To drive higher cost-effective impact, we are better meeting farmer needs by serving clients in multiple seasons, optimizing our products to ensure consistent demand, rolling out a free tree product, and implementing a range of program adjustments to improve operational efficiency.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">We measure our efficiency, or Social Return On Investment (SROI), as the amount of new profits our farmers generate for every $1 of donor investment in our program. We project SROI from our Uganda program to fall below target in 2021. Along with slightly lower impact, costs were higher than projected, particularly due to lower loan repayment (83% vs 92% targeted) as we wound down our core program.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">We define farm families &apos;reached&apos; as households that benefitted from at least one systems-change intervention. Our systems-change work in Uganda is centered on a new product offering: coffee. We have had initial success with coffee trials (reaching 3,000 farmers), and are projecting promising results: it achieved an enrollment target of 3,000 farmers amid COVID-19 lockdowns, with over 90% of them showing strong compliance with recommended agricultural practices. We are actively pursuing potential partnerships for coffee distribution and intend to accelerate this initiative in the year ahead. We also see strong potential to drive even higher impact (i.e., greater farmer profits) in the future through key partnerships across Uganda&#x2019;s coffee value chain and plan to enter a formal partnership with UGACOF, Uganda&#x2019;s largest private coffee exporter, for buy-back of coffee produced by clients in our ongoing trial this year.</narrative>
