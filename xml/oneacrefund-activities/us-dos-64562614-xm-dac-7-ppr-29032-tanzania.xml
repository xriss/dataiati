   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Our prior project with the Dutch Government, &#x201C;Subsistence to Self-Reliance &#x2013; Bringing the Power of Markets to Africa&#x2019;s Lowest-Income Farmers&#x201D; underscored our shared passion for inclusive economic development and showcased the key milestones that we can accomplish together. Core operating support from DGIS facilitated the strategic expansion of One Acre Fund&#x2019;s &#x2018;impact ecosystem.&#x2019; Within two years, we doubled the scale of our farmer network, launched operations in two new country programs (Malawi and Uganda), and rolled out impactful new products like tree planting kits and clean cookstoves at country-wide scale. Simultaneously, we refined our innovative systems-change platform, leveraging our core organizational competencies to improve large-scale public and private actors&#x2019; service to smallholders. This success has now placed One Acre Fund in a position where we can realistically envision moving the needle on hunger and poverty across the entire African continent. Our current project with DGIS, &#x201C;Leading the Charge to Eradicate Rural Poverty,&#x201D; aims to capture this powerful opportunity. The project involves a smartly structured two-part investment spanning September 15, 2018 &#x2013; December 31, 2022: First, DGIS is once again providing critical support to the varied, evolving platforms within our organization that lay the foundation for our growth and impact. Core operating support from DGIS will enhance and extend One Acre Fund&#x2019;s proven model by funding key strategic priorities across our M&amp;E, R&amp;D, and new country expansion units. Secondly, DGIS is also providing working capital to revolutionize One Acre Fund&#x2019;s growth trajectory. This injection to our &#x2018;permanent fund&#x2019; will completely fund our projected expansion of 245,000+ new farm families in 2019, bringing us past the 1 millionth farmer milestone. Crucially, farmers&#x2019; loan repayments will replenish our permanent fund each year, allowing us to re-extend this contribution to provide input loans to an estimated 245,000 farm families (including over 980,000 children) annually. This project will anchor One Acre Fund&#x2019;s expansion to directly serve 1.85 million farm families annually by year-end 2022. Simultaneously, it will help us reach an additional 3.5 million farmers via systems-change partnerships that are expressly designed to transform entire agricultural ecosystems. Together, the reach of these efforts will generate transformative change for rural communities across rural Africa.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Tanzania 2021 Q2 Country Update: We are continuing to scale our program in Tanzania despite the challenges brought on by COVID-19. Key to our ability to expand are our innovation trials launched in 2021. This year, our Program Innovations team in Tanzania is trialing a program in four districts dubbed &#x201C;Shamba Darasa&#x201D; (&#x201C;farm classroom&#x201D;). Farming plots under the program are primarily used to train field staff, but will also be used to test various planting recommendations to increase yields. Additionally, in a new trial aimed at boosting repayment rates, we are offering mobile phones to farmers as an add-on product in our package to improve access to digital services and mobile payment opportunities and boost digital literacy.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">We collected 94.7% of total loans disbursed country-wide in 2020, below our historical average of 97%. However, this is an improvement from our 2019 season&#x2019;s result of 92% &#x2014; a particularly positive outcome given the challenges faced by farmers during the pandemic. The main factors driving the year-over-year decrease in SROI include: lower revenues due to narrow margins, higher costs due to unbudgeted COVID-19 spending (including health trainings to clients and soap distribution to clients and their neighbors), and higher transport costs related to fertilizer supply chain challenges.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">To strengthen SROI in 2021, we are focusing on improving the three &#x201C;fundamentals&#x201D; of efficiency: clients per Field Officer, transaction size per farmer, and farmer loan repayment. Some activities that are driving progress along these areas include phone distributions trials (to improve repayment), and equipping field officers with better tablet-based client management applications (to facilitate Field Officers to serve more clients; we drove the average from 180 to 242 this year).</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">In 2020, our systems change work in Tanzania consisted of two workflows: 1) a marketing incentive trial that uses a voucher subsidy to improve the adoption of hybrid maize seed and fertilizer in low adoption areas; and 2) the distribution of tree seedlings. We reached 28,000 farmers through the seed voucher program, and 4,000 through our agroforestry platform.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">Our systems change work in Tanzania currently consists of three workflows: 1) a marketing incentive trial that uses a voucher subsidy to improve the adoption of hybrid maize seed and fertilizer in low adoption areas; 2) the distribution of tree seedlings; and 3) rural retail shops. The latter work stream will allow farmers in areas outside our core program to purchase high-quality farm inputs individually through local shops. This approach is attractive to farmers who want products year-round, who want products and training topics &#x201C;&#xE0; la carte,&#x201D; or who are hesitant about group liability in our core program. Districts that had previously been unable to meet enrollment targets in Tanzania have adopted these initiatives and have seen early success in attracting farm families.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">Impact challenges in our growth countries (Uganda, Malawi, Tanzania, and Zambia) caused social return on investment (SROI) to dip below our targets for this cohort in 2019. Uncontrollable, external factors such as severe weather shocks, market price movements, currency fluctuations, and other shocks severely influenced our impact and SROI which led to lower harvests and farmer revenue, respectively. These factors decreased impact and farmer repayment while negatively affecting our revenue model via lower farmer repayment&#x2014;i.e. decreasing our SROI. Our impact forecasts in Tanzania have meaningfully evolved since launching our latest partnership there in 2017. One Acre Fund Tanzania program is part of our &#x2018;growth countries unit,&#x2019; a designation that refers to contexts where we are still refining our programming to achieve reliable impact and growth. Performance in such countries tends to be variable in line with changing realities on the ground; in Tanzania, two consecutive seasons (2018 and 2019) of challenging weather and low maize prices increased farmer risk aversion, affecting impact. Final impact figures will be shared in our 2020 Q1 update.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">We are tracking slightly below our impact target, at $45. Still, we believe that our work to improve farmer resilience through crop diversification and agroforestry will contribute to protecting food security during the pandemic. This year, we launched early-stage trials of new crops (e.g., biofortified beans) with the potential to further diversify farm families&#x2019; incomes, and expanded our tree portfolio to include avocado, pine, grevillea, and two soil-improving varieties.</narrative>
