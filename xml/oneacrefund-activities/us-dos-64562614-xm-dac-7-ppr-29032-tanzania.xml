   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Our prior project with the Dutch Government, &#x201C;Subsistence to Self-Reliance &#x2013; Bringing the Power of Markets to Africa&#x2019;s Lowest-Income Farmers&#x201D; underscored our shared passion for inclusive economic development and showcased the key milestones that we can accomplish together. Core operating support from DGIS facilitated the strategic expansion of One Acre Fund&#x2019;s &#x2018;impact ecosystem.&#x2019; Within two years, we doubled the scale of our farmer network, launched operations in two new country programs (Malawi and Uganda), and rolled out impactful new products like tree planting kits and clean cookstoves at country-wide scale. Simultaneously, we refined our innovative systems-change platform, leveraging our core organizational competencies to improve large-scale public and private actors&#x2019; service to smallholders. This success has now placed One Acre Fund in a position where we can realistically envision moving the needle on hunger and poverty across the entire African continent. Our current project with DGIS, &#x201C;Leading the Charge to Eradicate Rural Poverty,&#x201D; aims to capture this powerful opportunity. The project involves a smartly structured two-part investment spanning September 15, 2018 &#x2013; December 31, 2022: First, DGIS is once again providing critical support to the varied, evolving platforms within our organization that lay the foundation for our growth and impact. Core operating support from DGIS will enhance and extend One Acre Fund&#x2019;s proven model by funding key strategic priorities across our M&amp;E, R&amp;D, and new country expansion units. Secondly, DGIS is also providing working capital to revolutionize One Acre Fund&#x2019;s growth trajectory. This injection to our &#x2018;permanent fund&#x2019; will completely fund our projected expansion of 245,000+ new farm families in 2019, bringing us past the 1 millionth farmer milestone. Crucially, farmers&#x2019; loan repayments will replenish our permanent fund each year, allowing us to re-extend this contribution to provide input loans to an estimated 245,000 farm families (including over 980,000 children) annually. This project will anchor One Acre Fund&#x2019;s expansion to directly serve 1.85 million farm families annually by year-end 2022. Simultaneously, it will help us reach an additional 3.5 million farmers via systems-change partnerships that are expressly designed to transform entire agricultural ecosystems. Together, the reach of these efforts will generate transformative change for rural communities across rural Africa.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Tanzania 2021 Q1 Country Update: In 2021, we are looking forward to growing our scale in Tanzania despite the challenges brought on by COVID. So far, we have completed input delivery and planting in the Southern Highlands, where farmers have planted maize. We have experienced some isolated weather challenges (heavy rains) but it appears that these will not affect our overall impact.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">We collected 94.7% of total loans disbursed country-wide in 2020, below our historical average of 97%. However, this is an improvement from our 2019 season&#x2019;s result of 92% &#x2014; a particularly positive outcome given the challenges faced by farmers during the pandemic. The main factors driving the year-over-year decrease in SROI include: lower revenues due to narrow margins, higher costs due to unbudgeted COVID-19 spending (including health trainings to clients and soap distribution to clients and their neighbors), and higher transport costs related to fertilizer supply chain challenges.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">To strengthen SROI in 2021 (and planned for the next three years), we are taking decisive action to improve our cost-effectiveness. This will involve a laser focus on improving the three &#x201C;fundamentals&#x201D; of efficiency: clients per Field Officer; transaction size per farmer; and farmer loan repayment. Notably, loan repayment collection is now occurring via mobile money, which was scaled in our country-wide program in 2020. So far, we have recovered 45.6% of total credit country-wide.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">Impact challenges in our growth countries (Uganda, Malawi, Tanzania, and Zambia) caused social return on investment (SROI) to dip below our targets for this cohort in 2019. Uncontrollable, external factors such as severe weather shocks, market price movements, currency fluctuations, and other shocks severely influenced our impact and SROI which led to lower harvests and farmer revenue, respectively. These factors decreased impact and farmer repayment while negatively affecting our revenue model via lower farmer repayment&#x2014;i.e. decreasing our SROI. Our impact forecasts in Tanzania have meaningfully evolved since launching our latest partnership there in 2017. One Acre Fund Tanzania program is part of our &#x2018;growth countries unit,&#x2019; a designation that refers to contexts where we are still refining our programming to achieve reliable impact and growth. Performance in such countries tends to be variable in line with changing realities on the ground; in Tanzania, two consecutive seasons (2018 and 2019) of challenging weather and low maize prices increased farmer risk aversion, affecting impact. Final impact figures will be shared in our 2020 Q1 update.</narrative>
