  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Our prior project with the Dutch Government, &#x201C;Subsistence to Self-Reliance &#x2013; Bringing the Power of Markets to Africa&#x2019;s Lowest-Income Farmers&#x201D; underscored our shared passion for inclusive economic development and showcased the key milestones that we can accomplish together. Core operating support from DGIS facilitated the strategic expansion of One Acre Fund&#x2019;s &#x2018;impact ecosystem.&#x2019; Within two years, we doubled the scale of our farmer network, launched operations in two new country programs (Malawi and Uganda), and rolled out impactful new products like tree planting kits and clean cookstoves at country-wide scale. Simultaneously, we refined our innovative systems-change platform, leveraging our core organizational competencies to improve large-scale public and private actors&#x2019; service to smallholders. This success has now placed One Acre Fund in a position where we can realistically envision moving the needle on hunger and poverty across the entire African continent. Our current project with DGIS, &#x201C;Leading the Charge to Eradicate Rural Poverty,&#x201D; aims to capture this powerful opportunity. The project involves a smartly structured two-part investment spanning September 15, 2018 &#x2013; December 31, 2022: First, DGIS is once again providing critical support to the varied, evolving platforms within our organization that lay the foundation for our growth and impact. Core operating support from DGIS will enhance and extend One Acre Fund&#x2019;s proven model by funding key strategic priorities across our M&amp;E, R&amp;D, and new country expansion units. Secondly, DGIS is also providing working capital to revolutionize One Acre Fund&#x2019;s growth trajectory. This injection to our &#x2018;permanent fund&#x2019; will completely fund our projected expansion of 245,000+ new farm families in 2019, bringing us past the 1 millionth farmer milestone. Crucially, farmers&#x2019; loan repayments will replenish our permanent fund each year, allowing us to re-extend this contribution to provide input loans to an estimated 245,000 farm families (including over 980,000 children) annually. This project will anchor One Acre Fund&#x2019;s expansion to directly serve 1.85 million farm families annually by year-end 2022. Simultaneously, it will help us reach an additional 3.5 million farmers via systems-change partnerships that are expressly designed to transform entire agricultural ecosystems. Together, the reach of these efforts will generate transformative change for rural communities across rural Africa.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">[Note: DGIS funding does not fund our Burundi operations.] In Burundi, we recently concluded repayments for the 2022A season, while delivering our trainings on harvest and post-harvest storage. We also launched  the 2022B season with input distribution, land preparation, and planting and are now focused on collecting repayments. 

Since launching in Burundi in 2011, One Acre Fund has seen powerful results and growing demand for
our services. This demand has fueled farmer retention and loan repayment rates that are consistently
among our highest organization-wide, positioning the Burundi program as a distinctly effective market
for One Acre Fund&#x2019;s core staple crop work. Our cost per farmer in Burundi is set to further improve as we recently won government authorization to reintroduce service fees in our pricing, which were removed in 2018 due to government stipulations. We plan to utilize this momentum to accelerate our growth trajectory and strengthen farmer impact in 2022 (as described below).</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">We are pleased to report that strong farmer demand for our services enabled us to achieve an above-target scale growth to serve 105,000 farm families (encompassing approximately 556,500 beneficiaries, including 283,500 children). This growth has been fueled by strong farmer demand for our services, coupled with the reality that access to high-quality inputs is quite limited in Burundi. To serve this greater number of farmers, our Burundi program also successfully grew to 753 total field staff; the vast majority of these staff are from the communities we serve, and many are farmers themselves.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">We reached 110,000 farm families in 2020, growing 5% year-on-year. This relatively conservative expansion is due to our strategy of pausing outward expansion (i.e., opening new districts or sites) due to regulatory and election-related uncertainty, as well as our desire to improve margins and impact before resuming robust growth.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">In 2019, we attained an average impact of $34 per farm family - well below our historical impact trajectory in the country. We attribute this shortfall to extensive, consecutive regulatory challenges. For instance, our November 2018 operational suspension (in the 2019A season) limited the products we were able to offer (preventing our distribution of solar lights or trees) and forced a streamlined training schedule that lowered farmer compliance. Similarly, in the 2019B season, many farmers missed the ideal window for planting due to delays among Burundi&#x2019;s authorized fertilizer importers. In spite of these challenges, One Acre Fund remained a strong investment for Burundi&#x2019;s farm families last year, boosting income from supported activities by nearly 27%.</narrative>

Key factors in this success include: 1) favorable weather that led to above-average bean harvests from the 20B season; 2) work by our government relations, procurement, and logistics teams to ensure farmers received inputs on time and in the right quantities; and 3) adaptation of our training program to ensure delivery of a full suite of field trainings that comply with social distancing protocols (e.g., limiting training group size).</narrative>

We will build on last year&#x2019;s successful behavior change campaigns (focused on boosting compliance in good agricultural practices) through ongoing investments in demonstration plots, radio awareness sessions, and raffles where farmers with correctly planted fields can win prizes. We plan to expand the number of farmers participating in our market access trials, which will boost farmer incomes and diversify the crops grown by our farmers.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">Since the obligatory removal of our service fees in 2018 by the Burundi government, we have been pursuing operational efficiencies and smart cost-cutting for non-core activities (e.g., R&amp;D) to ensure long-term financial sustainability in the country. We are drawing on our valuable cost-cutting experience in Rwanda, whose smallholder sector closely resembles Burundi&#x2019;s, and where in 2016, this government also prohibited our collection of service fees. In 2017, program streamlining cut 20% from Rwanda&#x2019;s net deficit, helping to generate $4.70 in farmer impact per donor dollar. We believe that our Burundi program is well-positioned to achieve similar outcomes over time.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">We achieved 100% loan repayment in the 2020B season (2020 reporting), once again demonstrating extraordinary farmer demand for and satisfaction with our Burundi program. Loan repayment is projected to cover 72% of total program costs in Burundi, slightly better than our 2019 results. Factors affecting this result include lower revenues due to narrow margins, higher costs due to unbudgeted COVID-19 spending (including health trainings to clients and soap distribution to clients and their neighbors), and higher transport costs related to fertilizer supply chain challenges.</narrative>

The continued improvement in our impact performance resulted in a significantly above-target social return on investment (SROI) of 4.3, meaning that every $1 invested by donors unlocked $4.30 for clients. In addition to Burundi&#x2019;s strong impact in 2021 (the numerator in the SROI calculation) we also had lower field operational costs than expected (the denominator).</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">In 2022, we expect to achieve an SROI of 4 in Burundi, meaning that every $1 donated will generate $7 in farmer impact. We expect efficiency and sustainability to increase through increasing the number of farmers served by each field officer, increasing transaction size and finally decreasing the net deficit per farmer. As we enroll more farmers, indirect costs per farmer will continue to decrease through economies of scale. We expect some volatility in this metric as the global supply chain challenges further unfold.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">We are initiating a program in 2022 that provides training services to cooperatives. Last year we launched a soybean and groundnut production and sale trial with four cooperatives. Our two soybean cooperatives are made up of a total of 500 farmers, and we are hoping to aggregate 2 tons of harvested soy in the coming year. We are in talks with potential local buyers looking to purchase the cooperatives&#x2019; production. Our other two cooperatives participating in the groundnut trial will harvest their planted groundnut this year. We are currently working to facilitate the sale of this yield on the market as well. We are hopeful that these cash crop trials will help us provide access to higher-value markets for more of our farmers in the future.</narrative>
