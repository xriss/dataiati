   <narrative xml:lang="SV">Insatsen syftar att st&#xF6;dja ett projekt som tagits fram av UNIDO och som implementeras via SADC Centre for Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency (SACREEE) and EAC Centre of Excellence for Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency (EACREEE). B&#xE5;da organisationerna &#xE4;r nyligen etablerade center f&#xF6;r f&#xF6;rnybar energi och energieffektivisering inom SADC och EAC som bl a arbetar med att koordinera medlemsl&#xE4;ndernas inf&#xF6;rande av standarder f&#xF6;r energieffektiv belysning och utrustning. UNIDO och &#xF6;sterrikiska bist&#xE5;ndsorganet Austrian Development Agency (ADA) st&#xF6;djer uppbyggnaden av centren och dess verksamhet, bl. a. genom att sekundera personal till SACREEE. UNIDO har v&#xE4;l utvecklade rutiner f&#xF6;r planering, finansiell kontroll och rapportering. UNIDO har gjort en framst&#xE4;llan om st&#xF6;d f&#xF6;r insatsen fr&#xE5;n Sida med ett projektdokument som underlag f&#xF6;r projektet och insatsen. Projektdokumentet, med resultatramverk och budget, har utarbetats med konsultst&#xF6;d fr&#xE5;n Sida.

Insatsen f&#xF6;rv&#xE4;ntas, i enlighet med detaljerade planer i projektdokumentet fr&#xE5;n UNIDO, leda till marknadsintroduktion av energieffektiv belysning och annan elektrisk utrustning som ger en minskad energiintensitet i medlemsl&#xE4;nderna. Detta leder i sin tur till minskade CO2-utsl&#xE4;pp, minskar kostnaderna f&#xF6;r s&#xE5;v&#xE4;l slutkonsumenter som energileverant&#xF6;rer samt m&#xF6;jligg&#xF6;r fler och mer h&#xE5;llbara investeringar i ny och f&#xF6;rnybar teknik inom SADCs och EACs energisystem. Vidare skapar insatsen en grund f&#xF6;r ett l&#xE5;ngsiktigt strategiskt arbete med energieffektivisering genom att bidra till f&#xF6;rdjupad kompetens inom ovanst&#xE5;ende regionala organisationer samt metodst&#xF6;d till genomf&#xF6;randefasen i medlemsl&#xE4;nderna, genom att uppr&#xE4;tta s.k. Minimum Energy Performance Standards (MEPS). Medlemsl&#xE4;nderna deltar via g&#xE4;ngse etablerade strukturer f&#xF6;r standardiseringsprocessen vilket leder till utveckling och efterlevnadskontroll av nationella standarder. Centrala institutioner i medlemsl&#xE4;nderna, s&#xE5; som test-laboratorier och tullverk, erbjuds kompetensutveckling och den regionala insatsen bidrar ocks&#xE5; med investeringsst&#xF6;d f&#xF6;r testutrustning baserat p&#xE5; det samlade regionala behovet. 

Denna regionala insats st&#xF6;djer privatsektorsamarbete genom att tillhandah&#xE5;lla metoder och information, utbildning och forum f&#xF6;r n&#xE4;tverkande. Ut&#xF6;ver denna regionala insats bed&#xF6;ms att s&#xE4;rskilda marknadsdrivna &quot;Code of Conduct&quot; insatser i medlemsl&#xE4;nderna bidrar till en snabbare marknadsf&#xF6;r&#xE4;ndring. Denna insats f&#xF6;respr&#xE5;kar nationella, marknadsdrivna aktiviteter och driver dialogen bl.a. genom uppr&#xE4;ttande av dialogforum och metodkoncept. Dock avses finansiering av nationella projekt ske utanf&#xF6;r denna regionala insats. 

Ut&#xF6;ver avtalet med UNIDO beslutas att avs&#xE4;tta 1 miljon kronor inom den regionala strategin f&#xF6;r Sidas uppf&#xF6;ljning och f&#xF6;r l&#xE4;randet mellan l&#xE4;nder. Med anledning av denna miljon, skiljer sig den totala summan och delsummorna per &#xE5;r i beslutet fr&#xE5;n den totala summan samt delsummorna per &#xE5;r i UNIDO&#x2019;s avtal. Syftet &#xE4;r att f&#xF6;rb&#xE4;ttra: - Uppf&#xF6;ljningen av EELAA-insatsens metoder, resultat och betydelse f&#xF6;r utvecklingen av energieffektiv utrustning. - L&#xE4;rande mellan l&#xE4;nder i Afrika s&#xF6;der om Sahara, fr&#xE4;mst Sveriges samarbetsl&#xE4;nder, avseende energieffektivisering med s&#xE4;rskilt fokus p&#xE5; energieffektiv belysning och utrustning. Ett s&#xE4;rskilt beslut kommer att fattas om anv&#xE4;ndningen av dessa medel.</narrative>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The contribution aims at supporting a project developed by UNIDO and implemented through the SADC Center for Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency (SACREEE) and the EAC Center of Excellence for Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency (EACREEE). Both organizations are newly established renewable energy and energy efficiency centers within the SADC and EAC areas, which, among other tasks, work to coordinate member states&apos; implementation of energy efficient lighting and equipment standards. UNIDO has supported their emergence and establishment. UNIDO and the Austrian Development Agency (ADA) support the development of the centres, i.e. through seconding staff to SACREEE. UNIDO has well-developed routines for planning, financial control and reporting. UNIDO has made a request for support from Sida based on a project document. The project document, with the results framework and budget, has been prepared with consultancy support, financed by Sida.

The contribution will lead to increased market introduction of energy efficient lighting and other electrical equipment that will reduce energy intensity in the member countries. This, in turn, leads to reduced CO2 emissions, reducing costs for final consumers as well as energy suppliers, as well as enabling more and more sustainable investments in new and renewable technologies within the SADC and EAC energy systems. In addition, the initiative creates a foundation for long-term strategic work on energy efficiency through capacity support for the above regional organizations as well as in the member countries. In the member states, the establishment of standards and testing requirements will be developed outside this contribution, but where the regional centers have a coordinating and supportive role. The same goes for setting up national platforms for &quot;Code of Conduct&quot; with the private sector, where the regional contribution will be providing methods and information, training and networking forums.

In addition to the agreement with UNIDO, it is decided to set aside 1 million Swedish kronor within the Swedish regional SSA strategy for Sida&apos;s monitoring and for sharing lessons learned. For this reason, the total sum and the annual sub-totals are different in the agreement with UNIDO and in this decision. The purpose is to improve: - Monitoring of the EELAA contribution and its development impact. - Sharing lessons learned among the sub-Saharan African countries, mainly countries where Sweden has cooperation strategies, regards energy efficiency with special focus on energy efficient lighting and appliances. A separate decision will be taken on the detailed use of these funds.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The overall objective of the regional EELAA project is to achieve improved access to sustainable energy and mitigation of negative externalities of the energy system by promoting a market transformation for energy efficient lighting and appliances in the EAC and SADC region.
More specifically, the project aims to create market and institutional conditions to enable a sustainable and inclusive transformation of the sector towards an increased diffusion of efficient lighting products and appliances. It will support the increased use of energy efficient high-quality lighting and appliances through the engagement of private sector companies as well as enabling regional regulatory and trade harmonisation.
UNIDO has applied to Sida for funding of 61,803,300 SEK to carry out the &quot; Energy Efficient Lighting and Appliances Project (EELA Project) to be implemented in the EAC &amp; SADC regions, for a period of five years (July 2019 to June 2024).
The EELA project seeks to promote a market transformation for energy efficient lighting and appliances in EAC and SADC regions. More specifically, the project aims to create market and institutional conditions to enable a transformation of the sector to stimulate increased diffusion of efficient lighting products and appliances across all sectors. The EELA project will bring regional support to private sector-led activities that will lead to increased use of energy efficient high quality lighting and appliances through regional regulatory and trade harmonization interventions; while also considering inclusiveness of all project activities to assure socially sustainable project outcomes.
Ultimately, the EELA project will increase access to modern energy services across various sectors and promote private sector involvement.
During a six months preparatory phase (EELA-PREP), a series of activities have been carried out, including market assessment, gender analysis, preliminary inventory of existing test laboratories in SSA and their level of capabilitiy, preliminary inventory of existing and relevant lighting product quality standards in SSA.The EELA project will support a common, regional agenda for regulation and trade harmonisation regarding requirements on efficient high-quality lighting and appliances and contribute to awareness raising at all levels.
The implementation of minimum energy performance standards as well as test laboratories, compliance certification and market surveillance measures will be supported. Pilot business model concepts will as well be incentivised as part of the EELA project.The common agenda will provide a ground for collaboration with other initiatives at regional and national level as well.
The Sida funded (regional) EELA project is special in that it supports the testing capabilities and test laboratories (through the Swedish Energy Agency) and that it incentivises business models for effective market up-take.Private sector engagement will be a key factor in the market transformation and marketbased incentives for increased energy efficiency will be motivated and cost effective in most countries. However, to be effective, market-based incentives must relate to existing legislation and regulations or at least volontary code of conduct statements.
An overall objective of the EELA-project will be to package projects around the products that can sustain and attract climate funding. EELA will also provide backstopping to numerous national energy efficiency initiatives, targeting the reach out of quality energy services and the establishment of energy service companies.
The regional project plays a central role in the transformation of all member countries&#x2019; transition towards a more energy efficient economy. UNIDO and the two African centres SACREEE and EACREEE (SADC Centre for Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency and East African Centre for Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency will lead the agenda on developing and enforcing minimum energy performance requirements on lighting and appliances on the African market. This is together with the established standardisation mechanisms, existing and emerging test laboratories, customs bodies and other relevant partners. To provide support and capacity building, UNIDO has teamed up with the Swedish Energy Agency (and CLASP, SIS).
EELAA project outcomes are: 1. The establishment of a regional mechanism and platform to coordinate actions on market transformation of energy efficient lighting and appliances in SADC and EAC including the support of national code of conduct programs and the exchange among the member states. The reason for doing this is to create a common regional road-map and momentum for the transition based on specific areas of electricity use, such as lighting and other specific appliances, to create a common timeline for both the regulatory aspect and the market actors and including public institutions in the member states, a common monitoring and evaluation framework and a platform for exchanging experiences and lessons learned within the region as well as for a consented priority agenda on building up and equipping test-laboratories within the regions. It is also a way of seriously engaging the private actors and financiers such as commercial banks into the transition. This is different from the ad hoc policies that member states have traditionally presented for energy efficiency. SACREEE and EACREEE will together be hosting this platform with UNIDO support. 2. Improvement of the regional policy and regulatory environment for energy efficient lighting and appliances in the SADC and EAC region, with a view of the climate impact and gender responsiveness. The reason for doing this is regulations and standards, e.g. Minimum Energy Performance Standards is a strong measure for transitioning the market and a prerequisite for most policy measures such as financial incentives schemes, procurement praxis, or labelling schemes. The outcome is achieved through activities of three kinds: 2.1. Developing a gender sensitive and regulatory environment for energy efficiency lighting and appliances in the SADC and EAC regions &#x2013; including to influence that EELAA is reflected in member states strategic climate change policy documents and strategies (most notably NDC, GFC, etc.). This strategic work as well includes narrowing down on a few specific product types within each category. For example, within the area of lighting, a set of 2-5 specific product types will be in focus for MEPS, street-lighting (on-grid/off-grid), general lighting, PV-lanterns, planar luminaires, down light luminaires, or other types as identified in the studies. Alongside with overall decreased energy efficiency, these priority technologies and energy services will be selected based on concern about poverty reduction and gender equality. 2.2. Developing harmonized Minimum Energy Performance Standards for lighting and other appliances This will be through the established channels for standardisation within the regions. (SADCSTAN- a SADC Cooperation in Standardisation mandated by the SADC Council of Ministers to coordinate Standardisation activities and services in the region, established 1997 in Port Louis, Mauritius and one of the seven structures implementing the Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT) Annex to the SADC Protocol on Trade; and The East African Standards Committee (EASC) - a Sectoral Committee established by Article 4 of the EAC Standards Quality Management, Metrology, and Testing (SQMT) Act (2006), which aims to harmonize standards and technical regulations in the region). This project will complement the established procedures with creating technical committees specifically for the lighting and appliances technologies of concern. 2.3. Improved environmental management, including waste management and recycling, for lighting and appliances in the regions. For example, this project will seek to influence that member countries establish firm requests on recycling of lighting and appliances in public procurement. 3. Strengthened capacities of key institutions, testing centres and stakeholder groups. This outcome is achieved through capacitating test-laboratories with advice, equipment and on the job training. Moreover, customs will be trained regarding import control of products. 4. Enhanced awareness among market players and policy makers on energy efficient lighting and appliances; establishing a strategy and running a campaign. This outcome is achieved through activities at regional level, including to support and influence that sector ministries in member countries&#x2019; governments incorporate energy efficiency in regular planning procedures. It is also an ambition that member states public procurement guidelines for lighting and appliances shall incorporate requirements on minimum life cycle costs. To reach this outcome, it is planned to organise side events alongside major global and regional energy and climate events. More-over, this project will maintain a set of best practice sensitisation material and a web-page for use throughout the regions. 5. Launch of incentive mechanisms to encourage the uptake of EELA in SADC and EAC. This outcome will be achieved through engaging with the private sector firms that are willing and capable of delivering quality energy services (based on the concerned technologies, lighting and other appliances). The framework for cooperation aims at contributing to the development of sustainable business models for the supply of energy efficient lighting and appliances, that can be replicable throughout the regions. Priority services are to be consented as part of the above activities and outcomes, e.g. outcome 2.1. The mechanism aims to create models that can be attracting further development resources and climate funding. It could for example be financial schemes for public lighting, where public institutions and regional politicians throughout the two regions are offered energy efficient pubic lighting schemes on a cost sharing basis rendering a lessened burden on these budgets as well as at the power suppliers&#x2019; end. It can also be off-grid business models offering cost effective, quality lighting services to remote households and other users.</narrative>
