   <narrative xml:lang="SV">Population Council (the council) arbetar med att f&#xF6;rb&#xE4;ttra medicinska och juridiska sektorers capacitet att bem&#xF6;ta &#xF6;verlevare av sexuellt och k&#xF6;nsrelaterad v&#xE5;ld (SGBV). The council har under de senaste sju &#xE5;ren, med st&#xF6;d av Svenska Ambassaden i Lusaka, arbetat med att bygga upp en faktabas kring SGBV, anpassad f&#xF6;r s&#xF6;dra och &#xF6;stra Afrika. Under f&#xF6;reg&#xE5;ende projektfas identifierade the council samt partners behovet att bygga kompetens kring barn och flyktingkvinnor som drabbats av k&#xF6;nsrelaterat v&#xE5;ld. B&#xE5;da dessa grupper bed&#xF6;ms vara extra s&#xE5;rbara f&#xF6;r att drabbas av SGBV och ha s&#xE4;rskilda v&#xE5;rdbehov efter de varit utsatta f&#xF6;r &#xF6;vergrepp som skiljer sig fr&#xE5;n kvinnor i den generella befolkningen. 

The council vill d&#xE4;rf&#xF6;r, tillsammans med partners, dels genomf&#xF6;ra studier som kartl&#xE4;gger f&#xF6;rekomsten av SGBV mot barn och flyktingkvinnor och dels genomf&#xF6;ra studier som provar metoder f&#xF6;r hur existerande insatser f&#xF6;r &#xF6;verlevare av SGBV kan anpassas till barn och flyktingkvinnor. 

The council vill &#xE4;ven forts&#xE4;tta med det arbete organisationen gjort kring integrering av insatser f&#xF6;r s&#xE4;kra aborter i generellt bem&#xF6;tande av &#xF6;verlevare av SGBV. 

Det &#xF6;vergripande m&#xE5;let &#xE4;r att dessa delar sammantaget ska leda till f&#xF6;rb&#xE4;ttrade policies och program f&#xF6;r &#xF6;verlevare av SGBV i s&#xF6;dra och &#xF6;stra Afrika.</narrative>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">World-wide, 35% of all women have experienced either sexual and/or physical intimate partner violence or non-partner sexual violence. Consequences of sexual and gender-based violence (SGBV) could be stigmatisation, discrimination, physical and psychical suffering and transmission of infectious diseases, among them HIV. 

The project proposal submitted by Population Council (hereafter the council) focuses on three key populations of SGBV survivors in East and Southern Africa: women in the general population, female refugees and children. The overall objective of the proposed project is to mitigate the consequences and occurrence of SGBV by strengthening the capacities of the medical, legal and justice sectors to care for survivors of such voilence.  

Many of the survivors of SGBV are children and there is a lack of knowledge on suitable approaches for targeting children. Refugee women are increasingly vulnerable to SGBV, due to the particular setting that they live in, lacking the safety of a home. Through replicating the already tested SGBV responses to target children and refugees, the council intends to strenghen the evidence-base on occurance of SGBV and methods for reaching survivors of SGBV that are refugees or children. By strengthen the evidence-base, the council expect to influence regional policy and programs on SGBV to better meet the needs of survivors, through dissemination of results to key audiences.</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Population Council submitted the completion report 2014-2018 on time and according to the terms in the agreement. Sida provided The Council with feedback, which was addressed. The quality of the report is sufficient and&#xA0;provides information that enables Sida to assess the achievement of results.&#xA0;
The Expanding the Evidence Base and Networks for Sexual Violence Response program has enabled regional partners to collectively test and document experiences in tackling violence against children and SGBV in humanitarian contexts. To foster SGBV prevention, and ensure that responses to SGBV are effective, the program has targeted a range of stakeholders, including influential regional bodies, the health, education and justice sectors, and children and refugees &#x2014; both as survivors and as members of communities where prevention is being promoted.
The program has helped to change the way people in the region think about SGBV, and how to respond to it, evinced by the responses of regional bodies such as the UNHCR Regional Service Centre in Nairobi, to ensure utilization of evidence-based programming in refugee operations in the region. UNHCR and many other organizations (e.g. EAC, ECSA-HC, ICEC, IPPF, SVRI, WHO) have solicited evidence generated by this program, referenced it, recommended it, asked for technical support in using it, and solicited partnerships to promote it on a larger scale, or developed policies around it.
Programs and policies have changed because of this initiative. One can see this at the national level, where, in each core Network partner country, interventions have been developed in direct relation to this program, or new policies have resulted. There is no country in which pilot projects developed by this program has not expanded beyond its initial contexts. In a relatively short period, The Council have witnessed actual policy change in countries such as Kenya, where policy documents on responding to children (which hitherto did not exist) are now an integral part of how child survivors are supported. The Council and the Kenyatta National Hospital (KNH) tested the feasibility of screening children in schools and health facilities for sexual violence. The Ministry of Health is currently in the process of adopting the screening tool developed under this study for use in public health facilities. The Council is continuing to provide technical support to facilitate this process with other funding. Furthermore, Kenya&#x2019;s revised (2018) draft National School Health Policy and Guidelines now includes child sexual abuse screening as a key intervention to be carried out in schools. The original screening tool developed under this program in Phase II (to screen for intimate partner violence) was also officially integrated into client in-take protocols within selected clinics (the Youth Center and the Mental Health Unit) at KNH in 2018, as well as in several public health facilities in Rwandan refugee settings. 
In South Africa, where Thohoyandou Victim Empowerment Programme (TVEP) adapted its community-based SGBV prevention model (the Zero Tolerance Village Alliance) to the needs of children in school. This adapted model (the Zero Tolerance School Alliance) has been replicated in three additional schools in South Africa since the end of the study. Furthermore, the Zero Tolerance Village Alliance model was taken up by UNHCR during the program period, and has so far been implemented in at least 5 humanitarian settings in Uganda and Rwanda. 
In 2017, Swaziland&#x2019;s Ministry of Education instructed&#xA0;Swaziland&apos;s Action Group Against Abuse (SWAGAA) to develop comprehensive manuals to be used for both girls and boys in both primary and secondary schools, including topics such as sexual and reproductive health, HIV and AIDS, and self-efficacy. The new manuals borrow heavily from the SWAGAA&#x2019;s girls&#x2019; club curriculum (developed under this program) and are currently the only manuals officially approved by the Swaziland Government to be used in schools for extra curricula activities related to gender and GBV Prevention. The new, government-approved manuals are currently used in SWAGAA&#x2019;s school-based girls&#x2019; clubs across the country.
In Zambia, where the Population Council and Zambia Police Service have collaborated for years to respond to survivors by strengthening the capacity of police and police stations (e.g., training police to provide eligible survivors with emergency contraceptive pills [ECPs]; post-exposure prophylaxis for HIV; and with transportation to health facilities for comprehensive care), the provision of ECPs by trained police to eligible sexual violence survivors is has now (since 2015) been incorporated into the national pre-service training curriculum of police officer recruits.
Network partners to the Council have received requests from organizations such as the Centers for Disease Control, IPPF, and UNHCR Regional Service Centre for presentations on this program processes and findings to improve their own programming on violence against children and SGBV in refugee settings.
Children and adults in humanitarian and non-humanitarian contexts have demonstrated social norm change in their communities because of this work. Due to their participation in the program&#x2019;s interventions and research, the Council has witnessed demonstrations of their new abilities to disclose SGBV and seek services, to take a personal stand against violence, to refrain from violent behavior, and &#x2014; from providers &#x2014; to confidently play a role in effectively addressing SGBV.&#xA0;
In Rwamwanja Refugee Settlement, Uganda, the Council heard from women survivors about the positive effects that a simple screening tool had on their ability to disclose their experiences of SGBV &#x2013; many for the very first time:
[The screening questions] gave me insight, and this is the first time I could open up and talk about what I have been going through in marriage.&#xA0; No woman will ever talk about their issues until they have been asked about them, and this is a very good program that will help women in this community. &#x2026; This is a very good step because these questions will address the issues that most women and girls have been going through, and they don&apos;t talk about it unless they are asked, like me.&#xA0; People don&apos;t talk about violence and rape here at all.&#xA0; They keep it to themselves, and given this kind of opportunity, it was very easy to express myself.
I will come back [again] for counseling and guidance. &#x2026; Counseling heals more than medicine.
A key question for this regional program has to do with the role of men/boys and of male involvement in SGBV interventions. This program deliberately embraced a gender-synchronized approach, in that its activities were designed to engage both girls and boys, and/or women and men, from the inception. This approach acknowledges the importance of female empowerment, without forgetting that if boys and men are not simultaneously empowered, only limited progress can be made in addressing gender equity issues. The program therefore worked to ensure that, wherever possible, boys and girls (and women and men) played an integral part as beneficiaries or service deliverers. In this way, the hope was that a balance of male-female responsibility would be fostered in the intervention contexts.
As the program ends,&#xA0; other donors have sought to build upon this work. This program permitted the Africa Regional SGBV Network to expand its reach to new populations &#x2014; children and refugees &#x2014; and to be one of the first groups in the region to really begin to investigate what works to address violence against children. The Council will be implementing Kenya&#x2019;s second national Violence Against Children Survey in 2018, in collaboration with Network partner LVCT Health, and with funds from the Centers from Disease Control and Prevention. The Council will also continue to lead the Africa Regional Network until 2020&#x2014;this time, with new funding that supports the scale up of selected Network models in refugee settings, in collaboration with the UNHCR Regional Service Center. These developments demonstrate the appreciation and understanding of these issues that the Network has built.
The Network approach supported by Sida&apos;s Regional Team for SRHR continues to serve as an efficient means of generating a coherent body of evidence on SGBV in the region. The support provided by the Regional Team has permitted the Network to develop expertise in new and important areas, and Network partners are ready to use this expertise to address SGBV on a larger scale in refugee settings, and within violence against children research and programming in the region.
Financial result
A financial deficit of USD 632,284 was noted in the final financial and audit report.&#xA0;The deficit&#xA0;is a result due to exchange losses and factors in earned interest of USD 927. However,&#xA0;it has not affected the results of the programme since the Council&#xA0;provided resources out of their own reserves to guarantee the objectives of the programme was being met.</narrative>
