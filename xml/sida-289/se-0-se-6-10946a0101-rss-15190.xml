M&#xE5;let med insatsen &#xE4;r att utveckla AUCs (Afrikanska Unionens Kommission), RECs (Afrikanska ekonomiska kommissioner) och afrikanska staters kapacitet att implementera programmet med syftet att f&#xF6;rb&#xE4;ttra arbetsmigrationspolitik och -ledning, arbetsmigrationsstatistik, underl&#xE4;tta migreringspolitikens kompetensportabilitet, st&#xE4;rka utvecklingen av migrationspolitiken p&#xE5; regional- och landniv&#xE5; samt att st&#xE4;rka migranters r&#xE4;ttigheter. Insatsen genomf&#xF6;rs av AUC i samarbete med International Labour Organization (ILO), International Organization for Migration (IOM), som &#xE4;r Sidas avtalspart och ansvarar f&#xF6;r koordineringen av programmets genomf&#xF6;rande, samt tre av kontinentens ekonomiska samarbetsorganisationer: Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), Southern African Development Community (SADC), och East African Community (EAC). 35 av afrikanska unionens medlemsstater ber&#xF6;rs direkt av st&#xF6;det. Indirekt f&#xF6;rv&#xE4;ntas samtliga 54 medlemsstater dra nytta av st&#xF6;det. Den totala budgeten uppg&#xE5;r till drygt 12 miljoner USD. Sveriges bidrag uppg&#xE5;r till 8.8 miljoner USD, dvs. 73% av det totala budgetbeloppet.

Insatsen f&#xF6;rv&#xE4;ntas bidra till arbetsmarknadsinstitutioners f&#xF6;rb&#xE4;ttrade effektivitet och &#xF6;ppenhet vad g&#xE4;ller leverans av arbetsmilj&#xF6;styrningstj&#xE4;nster; f&#xF6;rb&#xE4;ttrade politiska system och regleringssystem f&#xF6;r arbetskraftsmigration p&#xE5; land- och regional niv&#xE5;; &#xF6;kat st&#xF6;d f&#xF6;r samr&#xE5;d med intressenter och praktisk samordning om arbetskraftsmigration och arbetmigranters r&#xF6;rlighet; samt till att bidra med r&#xE5;dgivande st&#xF6;d till medlemsstater, RECs och AU. 

Med ovan angivna huvudm&#xE5;l f&#xF6;rv&#xE4;ntas st&#xF6;det bidra till f&#xF6;ljande specifika resultat:

AUC och de f&#xF6;reslagna genomf&#xF6;randeorganisationerna ILO och IOM har tidigare erfarenhet av samarbete med Sverige och kapacitet att leverera f&#xF6;rv&#xE4;ntade resultat. Sidas centrala bed&#xF6;mning av IOMs bekr&#xE4;ftar att de har tillr&#xE4;cklig projektlednings- och finansiell kapacitet att hantera insatsen. Detta bed&#xF6;ms ocks&#xE5; g&#xE4;lla f&#xF6;r dess lokala sambandskontor i Addis Abeba. Trots att AUC erh&#xE5;ller finansiellt st&#xF6;d fr&#xE5;n Sida f&#xF6;r genomf&#xF6;randet av institutionsst&#xE4;rkande projekt inom ramen f&#xF6;r det s.k Pillar V, kommer denna insats inte inneb&#xE4;ra att medel &#xF6;verf&#xF6;rs direkt till AUC. IOMs roll &#xE4;r att ansvara f&#xF6;r de medel som anv&#xE4;nds f&#xF6;r att genomf&#xF6;ra de av AUC och RECs planerade projektaktiviteterna.        

Ett antagande som beaktas f&#xF6;r projektet &#xE4;r att de tv&#xE5; FN genomf&#xF6;randepartnerna IOM och ILO har operativ n&#xE4;rvaro i kontinenten samtliga regioner och i de flesta medlemsstaterna.

AUCs otillr&#xE4;ckliga samordnings- och kommunikationskapacitet med RECs, brist p&#xE5; politisk vilja p&#xE5; medlemsstats- och subregional niv&#xE5;, otillr&#xE4;cklig samordning mellan REC och MS samt den p&#xE5;g&#xE5;ende reformprocessen f&#xF6;r AU &#xE4;r n&#xE5;gra av de riskfaktorer som som m&#xE5;ste tas omh&#xE4;ndertas under projektets genomf&#xF6;rande.</narrative>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The three year Priority Implementation Actions of the AUC-ILO-IOM Joint Programme on Labour Migration Governance for Development and Integration in Africa (JLMP) is aimed at developing the necessary technical capacity required at African Union Commission (AUC), Regional Economic Communities (REC) and Member States (MS) level to build a strong base for the successful implementation of the Joint Labour Migration Programme (JLMP). The main focuses of the project are improving the labour migration governance, labour migration statistics, facilitate migrant workers skill portability, facilitate the development of migration policies at RECs &amp; MS level and support protection of migrant rights. Sida is interested to support the project, which is already being supported by other donors including EU, GIZ and MS of the African Union. The project directly benefits 35 MS and indirectly all AUC MS.  This project will be implemented by a consortium of two UN Organizations namely International Organization for Migration (IOM) and International Labour Organization (ILO) together with AUC and the threes RECs Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), Southern African Development Community (SADC) and East African Community (EAC).  IOM is the lead agency responsible for signing agreement with Sida on behalf of the consortium and also coordinating the entire implementation of the project as Administrative Agent while ILO will be a participating organization. IOM will sign Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with ILO to facilitate the fund transfer for the implementation of activities under the responsibility of ILO is. There is no direct fund transfer from IOM to AUC and RECs. Rather IOM will facilitate the financial managment for activities implemented by AUC and RECs. The total budget of the project is 12, 034 484 USD out of which Sida will contribute  78, 000 000 SEK) or ( 8.8 MUSD) which is 73% of the total budget.

The Joint Labour Migration Programme (JLMP) was initiated at the beginning in response to the impediments to labour migration governance on the continent due to absence of implementation of free movement protocol rights and mechanisms, prevalence of rigid border formalities, abundance of road blocks and security checkpoints on international highways, and along transportation routes and lack of coherent labour migration policy framework. The bigger JLMP is planned to be implemented over ten years period with the estimated overall total budget of 26 million USD.  

The programme is part of the instrument dedicated to the implementation of the 5th Key Priority Area of the Declaration and Plan of Action on Employment, Poverty Eradication and Inclusive Development which were adopted by the Assembly of Heads of States and Governments (AU/Assembly/AU/20(XXIV)/Annex 3, January 2015) in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia in January 2015. Its strategy is focused on intra-African labor migration. It is in line with and supports the achievements of the First Ten Year Plan of the AU Agenda 2063 and of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) adopted by the UN. 

According to our initial analysis, the Joint Labour Migration Programme for Africa (JLMP), adopted in 2015 by African Heads of States represents an obvious entry point.  The absorption capacity of JLMP, which aims to be a comprehensive program for labour migration governance on the continent, is potentially very large, though start-up  and progress so far has been slow. 

The under-pinning assumptions for the development of JLMP are that establishing regular, transparent and comprehensive labour migration policies, legislation and structures at the national and regional levels can result in significant benefits for States of origin and destination. Remittances, skills and technology transfers can assist source countries development objectives whereas satisfying the existing labour market need is the benefit for the destination countries.

In order to translate the programme into action, AU, IOM and ILO (implementing partners of the three years project) have undertaken series of successive consultations, discussions including with donors and agreed to start the three years initial pilot project which is a sub-set of the bigger JLMP. Accordingly, priority areas of the programme were identified including the sequencing of activities which are believed to facilitate the ground works such as setting up institutions, prepare policy framework and putting the necessary capacities in place mainly at AUC and the three RECs  (ECOWAS, SADC and EAC).  Based on this, the embassy received the draft three-year pilot project in early April 2018 after adequate consultations and discussions among all the potential development partners (donors) have been conducted under AUC&#x2019;s facilitation. The development partners of AUC that are interested to support JLMP mainly, Sweden, Germany and EU have contributed to the revision and development of the three years project proposal within the framework of the bigger JLMP that was adopted by the African Union Heads of State in April 2015.

The main implementation challenge has been the lack of predictable funding. However, several achievements were obtained since the programme launched in 2015, mainly because of ILO&#x2019;s technical support with the funding from the European Union (EU). The First Labor Migration Statistics Report was produced and published in 2017. In addition, study was conducted on social security access and portability for migrant workers at RECs level which led to the formulation of a two-year project funded by the EU and implemented by ILO.

Based on the breakdown of the bigger JLMP into the different phases, Sweden is interested to support the initial three-year project, which will be implemented by IOM, ILO and AUC and the three RECs (ECOWAS, EAC and SADC). 

The main objective of the intervention is to develop the necessary technical capacity required at AUC, RECs and Member States&#x2019; level to build a strong base for the successful implementation of the JLMP.

Within the framework of the above stated objective, the following are the specific objectives (outcomes) of the planned three years project. These are: -
. To enhanced effectiveness and transparency of the labour market institutions on delivering labour migration governance services;
. To improve the policy and regulatory systems on labour migration at Member states and RECs levels;
. To provide advisory support to multi stakeholder policy consultation and practical coordination on labour migration and mobility to MS, AU and RECs decision makers; and
. To build the capacity of continental and regional operational leadership to spearhead/steer coordinate the implementation of the JLMP at all levels

Given the above stated main and specific objectives, the major outputs of the planned intervention are also summarized as follows.
1. Training and capacity building programs developed
2. Capacity building training sessions organized
3. Advisory and consultancy services to enhance the capacity of labour market institutions on labour migration governance strengthened.
4. Increased production of labour migration information
5. Skills shortages reduced; increased recognition of harmonized qualifications across Africa; strengthened the employability of migrants to prevent brain waste, unemployment.
6. Enhanced Labour Migration Policy Frameworks in MS and RECs
7. Active international cooperation to build the necessary cooperation framework on labour migration with non-AU Member states and other regions developed
8.Strengthened protection of migrant workers and labour migration international through cooperation
9.Improved capacity of the AUC, RECs and Regional social partners to effectively coordinate and contribute regional and sub-regional social security programmes for migrant workers
10.Regular sessions of the AU Labour Migration Advisory Committee facilitated

The project covers two main thematic components: governance and operational implementation. The governance component addresses the critical need to develop four concrete cardinal pillars of labor migration governance: law based on international standards, establishing viable and coherent policy, strengthening the core institutions, and engaging tripartite participation and cooperation among the main economic actors at national, regional and international levels. The main stakeholders of JLMP are AUC, RECs, MS, social partner institutions, relevant national government institutions; concerned civil society organizations; and the private sectors. The AUC provides overall vision and political perspective for the project, mobilizing consultation with and participation of the respective the Regional Economic Communities (ECOWAS, SADC and EAC) plus Member States.

The implementation component covers key inter-dependent technical operational areas which includes decent work and social protection for migrant workers and their families, addressing the key constraint of skills shortages, and obtaining essential data and knowledge for governance of labor migration and protection of migrants. Each of these reflects a specific area of standards, policy and technical competences for distinct institutions and stakeholders.

From the detail assessment made by the embassy, it is underlined that the proposed intervention on labor migration governance on the continent is directly related to Swedish Regional Development Cooperation Strategy for 2016-2021. In a boarder terms, the intervention is directly contributing to support area three stated as &#x2018;&#x2019;better opportunities and tools to enable poor and vulnerable people to improve their living conditions&#x2019;&#x2019;. The proposed contribution is specifically linked to sub-result area focusing on strengthening the capacity of regional actors to work towards sustainable solutions concerning refugee situations and migration flows and embrace the positive effects of migration. The planned contribution is  also inline with what is analyzed and explained in detail in the regional development cooperation operationalization plan approved in April 2017. 

The intervention will contribute to the efforts of strengthening Africa based institutions capacity to better manage and embrace the positive effects of migration on the continent. &#x2018;&#x2019; As mentioned above, migration flows within Africa are much larger than those out of Africa, with most migrants remaining on the continent. The composition of the flows has changed over the years, with an increasing number of female and young people seeking employment or security in another countries on the continent. African governments face significant difficulties to manage this situation, which has contributed to xenophobia and violence in both destination and transit countries, sometimes followed by repression and expulsion, imposing heavy costs on migrants and disrupting local economies. Simultaneously, migration holds a great potential to contribute to development and welfare for all countries, whether they are origin, transit or destination countries. For this potential to materialize, better understanding, improved policies and strengthened capacity as well as political accord at regional levels are required.
Migration and refugee situations on the continent have not explicitly been part of previous regional strategies, but are obviously a development challenge which can benefit from a regional cooperation approach along with coordination with Swedish humanitarian support. Swedish support in this area will start from scratch and areas to be explored in this context are labour migration; financial remittances (one of the most obvious positive and development related aspects of migration, with strong links to financial sector integration); data and analysis (a precondition for improved migration policies and governance); migrants&#x2019; rights, including refugees as well as the capacity of AU/RECs to reach political accord and implement commitments in the areas of migration and asylum. 

AUC and the proposed implementing partners (ILO&amp;IOM) are very much known to Sida regarding their prior experience, capacity in delivering and joint working relationship. Sida&apos;s central assessment on IOM&#x2019;s capacity show that it has acceptable standards (same as with other UN) and have adequate capacity to manage the project as well as the funds. In addition, the capacity of IOM&apos;s Special Liaison Office to AUC in Addis Ababa is also checked and found satisfactory.  On the other hand, AUC is continuously receiving fund from Sida for direct project implementation and core support to the different directorate and unit under institutional strengthening which is usually called pillar five. However, under this project there is no funds to be transferred to AUC. IOM will facilitate the financial managment aspect for activities to be implemented by AUC &amp;RECs in this project.

This contribution is planned to be implemented by multi-organizations through consortium approach, where IOM will be the lead agency who will sign agreement with Sida. In this case, IOM will forward funds to ILO for the implementation of activities under ILO&apos;s responsibility.   In addition, there is also merit of working in consortium which gives opportunity for cooperating partners to share expertise, experience and skills during project implementation.

The major assumption considered for this project is that the two UN implementing partners IOM &amp;ILO have operational presence in all regions of the continent and in most of the MS as well. In addition, it is also taken in to account that AU, as the owner of the initiative will have strong leverage points to influence the RECs and S during implementation. 

AUC&#x2019;s inadequate capacity of coordinating and communicating with RECs, lack of political will at MS and RECs level, insufficient coordination between the RECs and MS and ongoing AU reform process are some of the risk factors affecting this contribution that needs to be taken care off during the implementation phase of the project.</narrative>
