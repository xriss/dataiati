    <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Institute for Security Studies (ISS) works by partnering to build knowledge and skills to secure Africa&#x2019;s future, with the goal to enhance human security in Africa to ultimately achieve sustainable peace and prosperity. They draw upon their network and influence to provide timely and credible analysis as well as technical assistance and practical training to governments and civil society to promote better policy and practice. This way, senior officials can make informed decisions on how to handle Africa&#x2019;s human security challenges.
Overall, the program is believed to have contributed positively to human security. However, due to ISS&#x2019; work largely being process-oriented, it is difficult to firmly attribute change to specific interventions. Nonetheless, some examples of contribution impact can be identified and summarized as follows:
Over the course of the strategy period, ISS has held trainings for South African parliamentarians and civil society on how to make sense of the national budget; trained gender commissioners from several sub-Saharan countries on how to identify, address, monitor and evaluate gender issues in a comprehensive manner, including gender mainstreaming of government planning and strategies; established an African civil society network on corruption, aiming to increase awareness among state and non-state actors about issues threatening good governance, as well as improving the capacity and adherence to principles of good governance; provided and operated the Siyazana Financial Mapping Database, providing capacity to governmental anti-corruption agencies, political party integrity structures, media and citizens to hold public representatives to account.
In addition, ISS has conducted several researches to help inform relevant authorities and actors. ISS conducted research on religious radicalism in C&#xF4;te d&#x2019;Ivoire, the role of women in violent extremism in the areas of Kenya that are most affected by Al-Shabaab, in addition to African women in the military which informed a global review of the UNSCR1325; produced regional briefs on Central, Southern and East Africa to actors such as the African Development Bank, briefs on human security issues to South Africa&#x2019;s Department of International Relations and Cooperation, entered an information sharing agreement with the AU Continental Early Warning System; published the monthly Peace and Security Council (PSC) report of the AU, providing independent analysis of developments and decisions at the AU PSC, as well as issues ISS believe deserve the attention from the PSC. In addition, ISS held Early Warning Capacity Training for officials from institutions with Early Warning Systems in place, including the AU, ECOWAS and IGAD, as well as officials from the Lake Chad Basin Commission who intend to set up a similar system.
Moreover, ISS conducted trainings for police officers from 14 different African countries deployed to peacekeeping missions, on the prevention of and response to sexual and gender-based violence, gender equality analysis and mainstreaming; held training of trainers (ToT) for Gender, Child and Vulnerable Persons Protection (GCVPP) officers in the UN Mission in South Sudan; worked together with ECOWAS and IGAD on drafting and implementing their respective Integrated Maritime Strategy as well as addressing the strategy&#x2019;s implications for member states; played a key role in the AU&#x2019;s endorsement of the AU Policy for Policing in Peace Support Operations by providing multifaceted support to the Police Strategic Support Group (PSSG) who prepared the policy; and provided analytical and technical support to the AU&#x2019;s post-conflict reconstruction and development unit, including two studies on peacebuilding planning in Mozambique and the Central African Republic.
Furthermore, ISS have worked extensively with judicial systems and prosecutors on terrorism and international crime. For example, ISS launched the world&#x2019;s first counter terrorism prosecutors&#x2019; network, aiming to help states to collaborate in the prosecution of terrorism cases; established, together with REDRESS, a network of legal practitioners to enhance the investigation and prosecution of international crime on the continent; conducted training workshops for the heads of prosecuting agencies in 9 sub-Saharan countries on counter-terrorism prosecution; helped ECOWAS develop their regional counter-terrorism strategy and implementation plan; held a rare high-level training workshop for police leaders from all ECOWAS member states and Mauritania with a focus on experience-sharing and development of better strategies for responding to terrorism, facilitating cooperation between West African and Central African police chiefs committees which is of importance as central African states are also on the frontlines against terrorism in West Africa; provided training and technical support to 9 African governments in efforts to sign, ratify or implement the Arms Trade Treaty (ATT) in its work with arms control and disarmament.
Finally, ISS has published the South Africa Crime Quarterly, the only open access journal in South Africa on violence prevention, crime reduction and criminal justice; provided the Crimehub, making South African crime statistics more accessible to the public and enabled ISS to provide analysis to and form a chapter of the updated Johannesburg City Safety Strategy as well as its implementation plan; written a report upon request of the South African Minister of Police on demilitarization of the police service in both national and international contexts, assisted in assessments of the police oversight system and ability, resulting in improved legislation; developed, together with South Africa&#x2019;s Western Cape provincial government and University of Cape Town, an implementation strategy and budget for providing parental support in the province, based on research showing how parental support lowers the risk of violent behaviour in children; and played a key role in establishing the AU Police Strategic Support Group who champions improved police representation in AU Peace and Security Council decisions.
An important gain for ISS was the South African government&#x2019;s announcement that crime statistics will be released quarterly as well as annually, contrary to previously when statistics were only released annually. ISS has called for more regular releases in both public and closed discussions with the police during several years.</narrative>
