   <narrative xml:lang="EN">35 Government, NGO/CBO and private nurseries supported; 100 small scale community and private nurseries (youth and women) supported; Two bamboo tissue culture protocol and three tissue culture units producing bamboo plants; Taxonomic classification of highland bamboo and SNP marker for germplasm management, breeding and utilisation; 4 million bamboo plants produced and 1000 beneficiaries (250 M/750F).

The programme strengthened 36 nurseries against the overall programme of 35 nurseries. Moreover, 25 women and youth nurseries were established achieving 25 percent of the target. The programme procured around 1310.5 Kilogram of bamboo seeds from China, India and Ethiopia. The seeds procured from China(Dendrocalamus asper, D yunnanensis, andBambusalonginternode)and India (Bambusatulda, Bambusapolymorpha and D strictus) belong to the sympodial bamboo species. The indigenous bamboo species: Yushaniaalpina or Oldeaniaalpina(Highland bamboo) and Oxytenantheraabyssinica(low land bamboo) were collected from Ethiopia. These seeds were distributed to the nurseries and portion of the indigenous bamboo species are stored in cold storage for further distribution. The large and small scale nurseries produced a total of 1,606,006 bamboo plant against the overall target of 4 million plants. Taxonomic classification study and DNA SNP marker identification study and tissue culture protocol development works are ongoing and the publication will be done in 2021.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Continuous support in place for 37 large and medium scale nurseries (including one private nursery in Uganda) in Ethiopia (10 Nos), Kenya (20 nurseries), and Uganda(7 nurseries) to produce quality planting materials. Moreover, 8 small nurseries were supported. Overall progress 75 small-scale nurseries supported against the target indicators of 100 small nurseries. Two TC labs provided support; Taxonomic study and two tissue culture protocol research in progress and produced 2Mn planting materials.</narrative>
