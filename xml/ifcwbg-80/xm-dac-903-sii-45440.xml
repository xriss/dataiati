   <narrative xml:lang="EN">IFC is proposing to invest: (i) up to US$160 million in equity, consisting of (a) up to US$80 million from IFCs own account and (b) up to US$80 million from IFCs Emerging Asia Fund (EAF); and (ii) up to US$300 million in the form of a debt facility (including IFC A loans and debt mobilization) to support the LOGOS Green Data Center Venture (the Venture), a regional venture sponsored by LOGOS Group (LOGOS). The Venture is being established to develop, own and lease green certified data center (DC) assets to address an accelerating demand in DC capacity arising from the region.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The most significant expected Project-level outcomes are derived from increased access to data hosting services through construction of DCs in facilities in emerging countries in Asia and Pacific region, which will benefit global digital platforms, including hyperscalers and DC operators that serve businesses seeking to introduce their IT equipment, and therefore, could result in improved business productivity and increased availability of digital services for individuals. The Project seeks to introduce a business model that facilitates access to land and energy, two critical inputs that typically delay market entry for DC operators. Furthermore, the Project will adopt several sustainability standards, including designing DC assets that are more resource efficient compared to traditional DCs, and seeking to power the facilities with renewable energy that have a lower carbon footprint. Beyond the Project, IFC anticipates that, depending on the target country, a successful introduction of this business model could accelerate entry of new hyperscalers seeking to catch up with the Venture&apos;s clients, or the expansion of DC operators taking advantage of greater demand for data hosting services stimulated by the Project.</narrative>
