  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Since its establishment as a private U.S.-based not-for-profit organization in 1998, the Marine Aquarium Counsel (MAC or the company) has spearheaded development of a comprehensive set of performance standards and a third party certification system in order to ensure that the marine ornamentals trade is conducted in a responsible, sustainable manner.  MAC has now partnered with two other nongovernmental organizations  the Conservation and Community Investment Forum and Reef Check  to provide a strategic combination of supply-side and demand-side interventions aimed at accelerating the adoption of MAC standards in the Philippines and Indonesia.  The purpose of this project is to convert a substantial portion of the marine aquarium industry into a trade based on marine conservation, sustainable use, and sustainable livelihoods that contribute to poverty alleviation and food security.  The project will achieve this market transformation process by:   -  building the capacity of community stakeholders to develop certified ecosystem management,  -  ensuring there is scientific assessment and monitoring of coral reefs and marine ornamentals stocks for management,  -  establishing no-take zones and reef and stock restoration,  -  building the capacity of marine ornamentals collectors to become certified,  -  increasing the financial resources and business skills for collectors to participate in a sustainable trade,  -  increasing the participation of exporters, importers, and retailers in certification, and  -  raising the awareness of, and demand for, certified marine ornamentals among consumers.</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project will be implemented at 48 coastal sites in the Philippines and 30 coastal sites in Indonesia over a 5 year period.  In the Philippines, the initial sites include the fishing communities of Batasan and Clarin (in the province of Bohol) and Camotes (in the province of Cebu).  In Indonesia, the initial sites include the fishing communities of Tejakula and Gerokgak on the northern coast of Bali.  The remaining project sites will be selected from among the specific places where the marine aquarium trade is occurring in the Philippines and Indonesia.</narrative>
