   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Strengthening Civil Courage &#x2013; Sahel</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Sahel has been the scene of large-scale armed conflict since 2012. Jihadist groups, state security forces, international military actors, and community militias and bandits are involved in these armed conflict. The conflict is exacerbated due to conflict between communities and weak state presence. There is economic underdevelopment, clientelism and corruption among elites. The programme in the Sahel will work with civil society actors to address these issues, common security and human rights problems.</narrative>
  </description>
  <description type="4">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The activity is part of a larger programme implemented by the Strengthening Civil Courage Alliance, consisting of ABAAD &#x2013; Resource Center for Gender Equality, Amnesty International The Netherlands, DefendDefenders, PAX and their partner networks.</narrative>
  </description>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The main objective of the Sahel programme is for CSOs and human rights defenders, working in the tri-border region of Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger, to contribute to greater accountability and more inclusive conflict-sensitive policies through effective monitoring and documentation of human rights violations, advocacy, and inclusive dialogue for peace and justice. More specifically, the aim is for CSOs, female and young human rights defenders and activists to claim their civic space; that state actors increasingly respond to the pressure of citizens to build inclusive communities; and, for national governments and international military actors to adhere to international norms and human rights standards.</narrative>
  </description>
  <description type="3">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The main target groups are human rights defenders that work at national level on civic space, good governance and rule of law; human rights defenders involved in monitoring and reporting conflict-related human rights violations; civilian populations and communities in the Liptako Gourma border region; and, CSO partners from the three sides of the border.</narrative>

      <narrative xml:lang="EN">Local civil society has a stronger role to play in stimulating an inclusive public debate on the effects of the use of (selected) controversial weapons on the human rights and security situation of civilians in the Sahel. This finding resulted from an exploratory mission to Niger was carried out by PAX in October 2021 to measure the level of engagement of CSOs on issues surrounding the use of controversial weapons. A follow-up will determine the feasibility of developing joint actions on the issue in collaboration with local CSOs.</narrative>

      <narrative xml:lang="EN">The persistence of armed violence in conflict areas across the Sahel is sustained by the absence (or harmful nature) of legal and policy frameworks. For example, the government of Burkina Faso passed legislation in January 2021 that enables local authorities to form groups of armed civilians to support state security forces. These have been responsible for civilian deaths and frequent abuses and thus risk exacerbating conflict dynamics.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">A study was conducted on the unintended consequences of recent legislation enabling the arming of civilians. The study found worrying trends with regards to recruitment patterns, a shifting balance of power in favour of vigilantes, use of illegally procured firearms under the auspices of the government, and cases of abuse of civilians. The study will inform L&amp;A initiatives to demand changes to existing legislation.</narrative>
