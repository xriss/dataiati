  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Programme activities intend to support civil society organisations, (women) human rights defenders and other activists to claim the necessary civic space that enables them to operate freely and express their legitimate demands. Interventions include strengthening of protection mechanisms and solidarity networks, and enhancing skills in assembling evidence-based reports to influence the policies at regional, national and international levels. The second line of work ultimately aspires that Kenyan authorities acknowledge the violation of rights of Muslim people and their communities, and take adequate measures for redress of victims and non-repetition of such violations. To that end, civil society organisations and rights holders will be supported in documenting and reporting on human rights violations, and to use that evidence in advocacy and dialogue with relevant duty bearers at local or national level.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The programme focuses on Kenya&#x2019;s restricted civic space as well as human rights violations in the context of State security sector operations (counter-terrorism operations). At national level, crackdowns on demonstrations violated the freedoms of expression and assembly. Journalists and human rights defenders, youth and targeted populations have been subject to harassment, intimidation, sexual and gender-based violence (SGBV), negative profiling and extrajudicial killings when investigating and speaking out on corruption and extrajudicial executions as well as on issues like reproductive health and gender-based violence. Kenya&#x2019;s military involvement in Somalia in 2011, as well as its geographic location has made the country vulnerable to acts of (international) terrorism. To counter this vulnerability, Kenya developed and implements counter terrorism measures. In practice, security operations have been negatively impacting the enjoyment of basic human rights of Muslim communities in the Coast and North-eastern regions. These communities have faced widespread discrimination, lack of economic opportunities, marginalization and ethnic or religious profiling by security forces.</narrative>
