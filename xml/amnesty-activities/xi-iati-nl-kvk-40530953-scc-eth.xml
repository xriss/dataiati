  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">After a period of heavy repression of human rights defenders, Ethiopian authorities allowed more freedom to them in recent years. Legal frameworks developed positively. However, in practice the newly gained freedom is fragile and civic space is curtailed. Repressive actions still threaten the safety and security of journalists and others defending or using their rights to freely express themselves, to assemble or to associate. In particular in conflict situations, widely spread in the country, human rights defenders and activists are at risk of violent actions, both from government agencies and from various political, ethnic armed groups. Violence includes arbitrary arrests and detention, enforced disappearances, rape and other sexual and gender-based violence.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The activity is part of a larger programme implemented by the Strengthening Civil Courage Alliance, consisting of ABAAD &#x2013; Resource Center for Gender Equality, Amnesty International The Netherlands, DefendDefenders, PAX and their partner networks.</narrative>

  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The programme aims to support Ethiopian civil society and human rights defenders, including journalists, to strengthen their resilience and capacity to counter civic space constraints and to speak out on human rights issues in safe and secure ways. Trainings and other interventions will e.g focus on physically and digitally safe ways of working, self-care, gender-sensitive reporting and developing strong networks that engage in effective advocacy or dialogues with relevant authorities in Ethiopia or internationally. A second line of work will specifically focus on conflict related human rights violations in the Oromia Region. Applying a community-based approach, the Alliance will work with local civil society to enhance capacities in monitoring, documenting and balanced reporting on human rights violations. Partners will be supported to develop effective ways in using the documented evidence in advocacy for accountability mechanisms and effective actions by government authorities as well as opposition groups to address human rights violations.</narrative>

  <description type="3">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The programme will mainly work with (women) human rights defenders, journalists and their networks. In the Oromia region it will focus on cooperation with conflict affected communities and their leaders, women&#x2019;s and youth groups in particular.</narrative>
