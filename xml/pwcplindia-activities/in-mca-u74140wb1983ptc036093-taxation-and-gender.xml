   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Taxation and Gender &#x2013; Impacts and Outcomes in South and South East Asia</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">To prepare a research piece that should address the following questions:

1. Is there evidence that governments in South and South-east Asia which promote gender equality through national plans/ policies (for example, through a national gender action plan or strategy, or by having a quota for female parliamentarians/ representatives at other relevant levels of government), also take actions to reduce gender discrimination in their tax systems, or promote gender equality through tax systems?
2. Is there evidence that various pathways of gendered impact of tax policy and administration (such as those mentioned above, but not limited to these) work in practice to improve relevant gender outcomes and indicators?
3. What are the key policy and administrative reform messages for national governments, bilateral/ multilateral agencies and donor organisations towards tax system reform as they relate to gender outcomes?</narrative>
