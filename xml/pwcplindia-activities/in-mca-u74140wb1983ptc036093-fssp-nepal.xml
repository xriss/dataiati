   <narrative xml:lang="EN">With an aim of increasing investment in large scale and growth enhancing infrastructure; streamlining economic policies for growth promotion and enhancing subnational growth through a combination of economic policies and infrastructure delivered locally, DFID Nepal has initiated the Accelerating Investment and Infrastructure (AiiN) Programme. Lot 3 of the programme i.e. the Financial Sector Stability Component (or FSSP), is one of the components whose major goal is to deliver the results of AiiN. FSSP aims at securing stability and robustness of Nepal&#x2019;s financial sector by reducing systemic risks. It seeks to work on Nepal&#x2019;s financial sector which is subject to significant vulnerabilities including weak financial reporting standards, insufficient regulatory oversight of the banking and cooperatives sectors and incomplete mechanisms for safeguarding the assets of financial services consumers amongst others.</narrative>
