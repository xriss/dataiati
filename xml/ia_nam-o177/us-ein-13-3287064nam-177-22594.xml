   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In partnership with the U.S. State Department&#x2019;s Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration (PRM), AVSI Foundation, with sub-grantees Cooperazione Internazionale (COOPI), implements the project &#x201C;INTEGRADOS: Integration of Venezuelan Migrants and Refugees in Ecuador: Ongoing support to provide information on protection services, job opportunities and access to decent living conditions to Venezuelan refugees and migrants.&#x201D; The project will run for two years, starting in September 2020, in the Ecuadorian states of Pichincha, Manabi, and El Oro.

AVSI works to improve the well-being and integration of the most vulnerable persons in Ecuador, including Venezuelan migrants and refugees, for the benefit of all.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project&#x2019;s main goal is to provide shelter to Venezuelan migrants. AVSI identifies and / or renovates safe spaces for permanent housing in each of the three locations. As an initial step, project staff will work with temporary shelters to improve systems for transitioning migrants out of short-term shelters and into long-term solutions. To increase access to long-term shelter options, AVSI has a two-pronged approach. 1) Identify appropriate, secure spaces and negotiate with the owners/landlords, and 2) Improve multifamily housing units that are currently being rented to Venezuelans but are not in adequate condition. Project staff will also deliver non-food housing kits to each beneficiary family, with items corresponding to their specific needs. 

Project staff will also work to strengthen existing inter-institutional human rights protection networks by creating and distributing informational materials on access to rights and services and the migration regularization processes. Another critical protection action is a conditional cash transfer. A monthly cash-transfer will be provided to each family participating in the program for the first three months to enable them to benefit fully from the program while ensuring that their basic needs are being met. This short-term support allows beneficiaries to take a step forward and begin to build a more solid foundation for a life of dignity in their new community. 

Finally, COOPI leads the livelihood response. The main activities include mapping the most vital productive sectors in the local economy, establishing alliances with private companies and local business associations to integrate Venezuelan migrants, creating a database of beneficiaries&#x2019; skills and professional training and offering them new technical training opportunities, and offering an integrated path to develop business ideas and plans through seed funding grants and accompaniment throughout the business development process.</narrative>
