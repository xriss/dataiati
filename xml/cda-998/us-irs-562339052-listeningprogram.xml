   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Listening Program (LP) believes that the people best situated to evaluate the impacts and effectiveness of international aid are those who receive it. Yet, despite the best intentions of international actors, the voices of aid recipients too often remained unheard when aid decisions are made that affect their lives.  

From late 2005 through 2009, LP organized 21 Listening Exercises across 20 countries to ask international aid recipients: &#x201C;What has been your personal experience with international assistance?&#x201D; &#x201C;What approaches did you find useful or effective&#x2014;and which not?&#x201D; Through these Listening Exercises, we gathered the thoughts, opinions and ideas of nearly 6,000 people around the world who have received assistance or observed its effects. This evidence was compiled and distilled into the book, Time to Listen: Hearing People on the Receiving End of International Aid. This book describes why the cumulative impacts of international aid efforts have not met expectations. It describes a way forward to make changes that, according to those on the receiving end, will lead to more effective and lasting results. (Available in pdf format on www.cdacollaborative.org )

The LP is continuing its efforts to improve the practice and effectiveness of international aid efforts by engaging with donors, aid agencies, and others through other projects that also focus on gathering, listening to, and responding to the feedback and priorities of the people we seek to support.</narrative>
