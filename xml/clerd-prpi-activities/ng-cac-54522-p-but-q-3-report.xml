  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">CLERD continued implementation of activities under the P-BUT project during this quarter. We developed the capacity of 235 Civil Society Organizations (CSOs)/leaders and state actors including women and community leaders on the budget process, tracking implementation, monitoring and evaluation, and advocacy. The first round of trainings, which held in each of five of the six project locations, were part of the process leading to a transparent and accountable public budgeting system in the project locations. The participating CSOs/representatives improved their knowledge base and skills on budget process, tracking, monitoring and evaluation, and advocacy and thus became more confident to engage with policy makers on budget issues. Many of the participants testified that the training they received was deeper and has broaden their horizons on budget advocacy work in their respective states.</narrative>
