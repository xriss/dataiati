   <narrative xml:lang="EN">First emergency response: providing protective, inclusive and quality education for conflict affected Children in NE Nigeria</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The goal of Plan International&#x2019;s ECW-funded project is to increase access of 3,000 children in the Konduga LFA to protective, inclusive and quality education by 31 July 2019. The project will particularly target 1,650 female and 1,350 male children in the Djimichilo, Kofa, Tungufse, Abakashumeri, Awuno Thabbol, Jakana, and Kaleri Abdulle wards in the Konduga LGA. 
To this end, Plan International has planned to&amp;#58; 

&#x2022;	Construct and/or rehabilitate 21 temporary classrooms in schools found in 4 particularly disadvantaged communities in Konduga, namely Djimichilo, Kofa, Abakashumeri, and Kaleri Abdulle. This will provide classrooms to children formerly studying under trees and in open fields with sever difficulties in the rainy season and to decongest over-crowded classrooms in these areas.   
&#x2022;	Construct and/or improve WASH facilities in schools in the Konduga LFAs&amp;#58; the lack of latrines and WASH facilities has been identified as one of the major hinderances to quality and access to education as well as a significant challenge for the protection of girls in schools as detailed above. Plan International will therefore construct 18 gender-segregated toilets and conduct hygiene promotion campaigns in Konduga. This is a particularly timely intervention during the rainy season, where sever outbreaks of cholera are a common occurrence, forcing schools to be closed.  
&#x2022;	Provide in-service mentorship training to teachers and peer-to-peer education for students in the targeted schools&amp;#58; the quality of education is extremely poor in the targeted areas in Konduga. To strengthen the capacity of teachers to provide quality, learner-centred education, positive discipline, protection and psyschosocial support to the traumatized children that come to their school, Plan International will facilitated in-service mentorship training for 75 teachers (60% male and 40% female due to shortage of female teachers in the area) in the targeted schools. Furthermore, Plan will work with students, teachers and SBMS to set up children clubs in each of the schools that will be supported by this project to facilitate peer-to-peer learning and to enhance the voice of students in the teaching and learning process.  
&#x2022;	 Conduct gender-sensitive back-to-school campaigns&amp;#58; in addition to improving facilities and the quality of education through the activities detailed above, Plan International will conduct back to school campaigns to increase school enrolment in the LGA, particularly of girls. A significant number of children are still out of school due to insecurity, poverty and lack of community awareness and prioritisation of education and this project will improve access to education for children by targeting out of school children and encouraging them to come back to school. 

In addition to the above activities, Plan International will distribute seating materials in schools that lack them and provide incentives to volunteer teachers. Plan will also mainstream psychosocial support in all of the activities that will be undertaken under this project, enabling traumatized chidren to access education in a supportive and a protective envionvment.  All of these measures will improve the access of 3,000 children in the Konduga LFA to protective, inclusive and quality education. This project will be implemented from 01 August 2018 to 31 July 2019.

This ECW-funded project was designed and will be implemented, monitored and evaluated in close collaboration with targeted children, their teachers and community (particularly School Based Management Committee members) and key stakeholders within existing education management structures (government and the UN). Plan International will work closely with the State Ministry of Women Affairs and Social Development, State Ministry of Education including its subsidiary bodies (State Universal Basic Education Board, State Agency for Mass Education) and partners within the Education in Emergencies Cluster to ensure the success and sustainability of this project.</narrative>
