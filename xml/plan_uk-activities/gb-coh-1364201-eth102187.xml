   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The programme will be implemented directly by Plan International Ethiopia in
collaboration with relevant response actors and government agencies to contribute towards the national and humanitarian cluster response strategies.
WASH and livelihoods will be the key sectors of intervention, looking to provide immediate life-saving needs of the most vulnerable drought affected
households. Protection and gender sensitivity will be mainstreamed throughout, particularly looking towards building community capacity for
managing protection risks which have increased from the impacts of prolonged drought including early marriage and child labour. Child Protection Committees and Protection actors will therefore be trained on child protection, prevention of SGBV and referral mechanisms.  
WASH - A water supply scheme will be rehabilitated and water storage capacity will be increased with the provision of tanks at the community level
to support the water trucking being delivered by government. This will be done in consultation with communities including women, boys and girls to
ensure that water supplies are safely accessible for them and do not pose greater risks to women and girls when collecting water. This will improve the
quality of the water supply and ease of access given that in many communities water is being stored in plastic sheeting. Community WASH committees ensuring the participation of women will be trained so that water points can be managed, maintained and repaired by communities and decision-making considers the perspectives of different vulnerable groups.
  
WASH kits will be distributed to vulnerable families to enable safe water management and observing improved hygiene practices, including for women and girls to have sanitary items for menstrual hygiene. Distribution days will be
used to promote hygiene messaging while community champions will be trained
to cascade this further. Particular messaging will be done on safe water management and personal hygiene to prevent outbreaks of Acute Watery diarrhoea.  
Livelihoods - Inputs will be provided to vulnerable families to safeguard their livelihood assets and maintain nutrition sources following the recommendations of the Strategic Advisory Group of the Agriculture Task Force. Due to the deteriorating state of herds, concentrated animal feed will be provided for key animals and a voucher system set up for families to access specific veterinary services. Vaccination campaigns will also be carried out against the most common diseases being observed. Emergency de-stocking led by the government will also be completed both to dispose of
animals that will not survive while providing immediate food sources for families without decreasing the value of their assets. This will help ensure
the survival of the most productive animals throughout the dry months and hence safeguard livelihoods.</narrative>
