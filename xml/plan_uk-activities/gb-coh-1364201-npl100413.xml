  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Following continuous heavy monsoon rainfall from 11 to 13 August, floods and landslides
have seriously affected 28 districts in Nepal, impacting 336,695 households and 1.7million people (IFRC, IRA Report, August 20th, 2017). This is said to be the worst rains Nepal has experienced in 15 years and several of the impacted districts are still to recover from the 2015 earthquake and 2014
flooding. Currently the rainfall has stopped and water levels are receding, however many lands are locked by flooded water and there are significant concerns about the possibility of disease outbreaks. The IRA reported that 141 people have died and 24 are missing.
Plan International has worked in Nepal since 1978 and is present in 7 of the affected districts. The Emergency Response Team has been activated and deployed to the affected areas and a Rapid Needs Assessment (RNA) was conducted from August 13th to 15th in Banke, Bardiya, Sunsari, Morang and
Rautahat districts. As immediate response, Plan International has distributed food and non-food items such as tarpaulin, mattress, blanket and mosquito nets to the affected families.
Nepal&#x2019;s 2017 Monsoon Floods Response Plan focuses on Immediate Response and
Early Recovery, in four programme areas of work&amp;#58; WASH, Shelter, Protection and Education.</narrative>
