   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Access and Safe Learning Environment&amp;#58; The project will focus on ensuring that 1) occupied schools are safely and appropriately vacated so that learning can resume in these spaces (in coordination with education authorities); 2) damaged schools are rehabilitated to ensure they are safe for children to (re)attend; and 3) Temporary Learning Spaces (TLS) are provided in safe areas (either as new learning spaces or additional to existing schools). Once learning spaces are (re)established, the project will ensure that all children are able to access education by providing learning materials, Menstrual Hygiene Management (MHM) items, and other forms of support.
Schools/TLSs will also collaborate closely with Child Protection (CP) services and ensure that safeguarding policies, and the implementation of safeguarding policy, is strengthened to adapt and support the emerging CP needs in the emergency.
The project will also support the wellbeing of students to make sure they are in the right place to continue with their academic learning in the future. It is thought that, due to the severity of the emergency and the (relatively short) time students have spent out of education, students will initially require high levels of support with their wellbeing before re-engaging with the national core curriculum.
Teaching &amp;amp; Learning and Teachers &amp;amp; Other Education Personnel&amp;#58; Qualified teachers will be recruited, and communities will help identify non-qualified teachers to facilitate learning in the classrooms. All teachers will be provided with basic training tailored to the needs created through the crisis. Furthermore, Continuous Professional Development mechanisms will be set-up in each learning space to create reflective cultures within schools and improve teaching.
With the support in professional development, teaching staff will be trusted to gauge the proportion of activities within the classroom dedicated to SEL. Teachers will initially focus on developing students&#x2019; knowledge (e.g. language and understanding of emotions and feelings), skills (e.g. coping strategies), and attributes (e.g. resilience, self-confidence, and open mindset) related to wellbeing to support academic learning towards the end of and after the project.
Education Policy&amp;#58; The project will ensure that all learning spaces are in-line with national education policies &#x2013; including adapted policies for the current crisis. Plan International will also work alongside education authorities to support schools and support education authorities with their overall role of coordinating and responding to education in the emergency.</narrative>
