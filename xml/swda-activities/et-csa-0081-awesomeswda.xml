      <narrative xml:lang="EN">Our baseline survey result revealed that the main sources of information on workplace SGBV in the area are TV (47.4%) and Radio (22.2%). Media plays a great role in informing the wider community and awareness creation, for example, currently there is a popular program on TV and weekly radio program &#x201C;from police files&#x201D; in which crime cases are dramatically presented and has wider audience.
Our survey also found that 48% of respondents do not received any information related to SGBV and Gender equality promotion, so there is need for significant awareness raising to create space for CSO demands around SGBV and women&apos;s rights.  Factory managers reported that there is no gender equally promotion media outlet in their respective factories except they heard from mainstreaming media. The key informant interviews explained the importance of community-led awareness raising, which we are addressing through other AWESOME indicators.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">&quot;In the Ethiopian context, SWDA does not control the media. Hence, we will approach this indicator in two directions.
1.	SWDA will prepare media pieces to be published on news, as we have already got invitation from the Ethiopian Press Afan Oromo division to sign a contract and use page weekly for the entire year. Hence, we are reviewing it.
2.	We can invite WROs to publish media pieces on selected topics pertaining to the proposal.
3.	We will also count the media pieces produced by media personnel after the training. 

For the changes we are seeking, we want to see these demands raised through media spaces:
i.	Community awareness on SGBV is enhanced and GBV incidents reduced
ii.	Law enforcement in action
iii.	GBV case reporting become culture of the community 
iv.	Stronger women movement in place
v.	Platforms are created to enhance networks among elected and women in the leadership position
vi.	50% ratio for women in the leadership position at the lower administration exercised &quot;</narrative>

      <narrative xml:lang="EN">&quot;According to the survey result, Kii and FGD discussants pointed that different organizations have organized different events pertaining to the subject matter.

Various discussion platforms were conducted with different community groups, elected women, representatives of different sector offices on GBV and women participation. The planned and implemented activities were to support mobilization, networking and enhance women&#x2019;s participation. The accomplished activities have created a safe space for different community groups to discuss freely in Year 1.&quot;</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">The public debates and national events focused on the core issue of SGBVs and increasing women&#x2019;s participation in leadership positions at all level. Online TV discussion organized on Oromia regional television with key Oromia Region offices and the case of the Sulfuric Acid victim who was released after 5 years from 25 years imprisonment created a big debate and became subject for investigation and action.   The policy gap will be clearly identified and reported to the policy makers through the government representatives (Women leaders and regional councils). These all events and promotional roles will highly influence the behavioural change among the communities.</narrative>
