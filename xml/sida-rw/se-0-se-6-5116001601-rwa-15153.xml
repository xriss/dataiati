Projektet kommer att st&#xF6;dja reformprocessen i alla dess delar.

Insatsen best&#xE5;r av fem olika komponenter: (i) st&#xF6;d till oberoende institutioner f&#xF6;r sj&#xE4;lvreglering av media; ii) st&#xF6;d till fyra oberoende lokalradiostationer; (iii) st&#xF6;d till professionalisering av Rwandas public service-radio; (iv) ett program avsett att skapa en oberoende kreativ mediasektor samt (v) st&#xF6;d till ledning, koordinering och uppf&#xF6;ljning av reformagendan. M&#xE5;let &#xE4;r att projektet ska bidra till att skapa: ett regelsystem f&#xF6;r media i Rwanda, professionell public service, en oberoende och lyssnarorienterad lokalradio och en v&#xE4;xande privat mediasektor.</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">Background&#xA0;
The&#xA0;Genocide against the Tutsi in 1994&#xA0;killed a million women, men and children. Among the dead were experienced journalists, other journalists fled Rwanda as refugees. Some journalists perpetrated Genocide and some media houses were used as a platform of hate. After the Genocide, Rwanda was widely praised for its success in moving beyond the 1994 genocide, winning credit for economic and social advances. However, Rwanda was equally widely criticised for its tough control of media freedoms.
Rwanda initiated media reforms in 2011 and in 2013, the government begun implementing the following six media reform areas : 1) The former state run Office Rwandais d&apos;Information (ORINFOR, that owned the national radio-Radio Rwanda); the then Kinyarwanda state owned newspaper-IMVAHO NSHYA; the French sister newspaper La Nouvelle Releve and national Television was reformed into a public broadcaster and renamed Rwanda Broadcaster Agency (RBA). 2) Rwanda Media Commission (RMC)-the media self-regulatory body was established to play the role of media self-regulation. 3) The state media regulator Media High Council (MHC) was relieved of the regulatory role and took the role of capacity building of media. 4) Rwanda Utilities and Regulatory Agency (RURA) was also given the new mandate as statutory media regulator. 5) The New Law on access to information was also enacted. 6) The closure of the Ministry of Information was another area of media reforms.&#xA0;
During these media reforms, Institute for War and Peace Reporting (IWPR) built&#xA0;connections with the Rwandan leadership, central media and related personalities to provide extensive and comprehensive support and build Government of Rwanda (GoR) buyin for the implementation of the reforms. The IWPR experience and visibility as one of the few NGOs that could support the implementation of the media reforms in such a sensitive environment was key when considering a support on media reforms.
Introduction
The Embassy of Sweden in Kigali decided on a planning grant with IWPR in 2014. The agreement,&#xA0;signed on 2014-02-03,&#xA0;was running from January 1 to March 30 the same year,&#xA0;and amounted to MSEK 1,5. The aim was for IWPR to prepare for a full project proposal. Activities of the planning grant included study tours of partners to Sweden&#xA0;amongst others.
Following the initial phase, the Embassy entered into an agreement with IWPR on the full project in July 2014. The program, entitled &quot;Rwanda Media Initiative: transforming the information landscape&quot; with&#xA0;a total budget of MSEK 42,5,&#xA0;was originally planned to end in June 2016,&#xA0;but due to a number of reasons, pre-terminated on January 6, 2016.
On September 3, 2015, the GoR de-registered IWPR as a company in Rwanda, since IWPR was doing NGO work while registered as a company. IWPR therefore applied for registration as an International Non-Governmental Organisation (INGO), but the application was rejected by GoR/MINALOC on 12th October 2015, regardless the&#xA0;dialogue support from the Embassy. The Embassy&#x2019;s assessment at the time was, that registration as a company limited by guarantee should not have limited IWPR to perform development cooperation considering&#xA0;that this was accepted in other areas. IWPR is registered as a charity in the UK, and this is the office with which the Embassy has signed the agreement, not the local office.
In a letter from Ministry of Local Government (MINALOC) on 20th October 2015, the Minister alleged that IWPR was channeling donor funds to UK, which could tantamount to money laundering. The Embassy found no grounds for the accusations, and, knowing the accuracy of the financial systems used by of IWPR in the project, did not agree to the allegations.
Further on, IWPR was accused by the same minister of breaking procurement rules and of corrupting a government official. As this was verified by the Embassy, IWPR was requested to terminate lease contract of cars for government officials who were coordinating media in Rwanda.
On 2016-01-06, following a series of consultations with Sida HQ and dialogue with the GoR that yielded no positive results, the Embassy decided to finalize the project. The same date the Embassy communicated in writing to IWPR the intention to terminate the agreement and the reasons why; due to the de-registration of IWPR as a company and the failed attempts to register as an INGO it was impossible to implement the programme. Also, the dialogue on possibilities for continuation was rejected by the government.
The only official reason stated in the RDB&#x2019;s letter of de-registration was that IWPR Rwanda failed to submit its financial reports. Even if the fact with the report was correct, circumstances lead the Embassy to suspect other reasons behind the de-registration.
The termination of the agreement was done in accordance with the grant agreement and Sida rules, however the termination process was lengthy. First because IWPR rejected the proposal to terminate; hoping to finally be able to register as an INGO, or working through a local intermediary, IWPR wanted to continue.
Also, it took an extended amount of time for the Embassy to receive and approve the final reports. Initially, the Embassy questioned expenditures in the final financial report, as those occurred after the halt of the project. After motivating costs in relation to closure of the project, especially staff salaries and travels, the report could be accepted and amounts to be repaid to Sida agreed upon.
The final audited financial reports covering both the planning grant and the first year of implementation were received on 2017-08-23. On 2017-09-26, the Embassy received the final narrative report.&#xA0;
IWPR forwarded a significant amount of funds to Swedish Radio, RMC and grantees under the creative hub. Following the termination of the agreement, assets were handled according to agreement stipulations, and transferred to the local partners of IWPR.&#xA0;
Despite the early termination of the agreement, the implementation of the programme reached some results. During the phase of the planning grant, Swedish Radio as sub-grantee&#xA0;implemented the following activities:
- Media Self-Regulation Systems were assessed;
- IWPR established a Project Management Framework for tracking media reforms;
- The feasibility of digitizing the broadcast archives (TV and Radio) of the former ORINFOR was assessed;
- Technical and journalistic assessments of the regional Rwanda Broadcasting Agency radio stations were conducted;
- Some staff of Rwandan media Self-Regulation did a study tour to Sweden for inspiration on self-regulation, responsibility of editors and the role of media in democracy and freedom of expression;
- Support to IWPR in the process of writing proposal, budget and implementation plan for the full project.
During the main contribution period, the following achievements were earned:
- The programme strengthened the newly established Independent Regulatory Institutions including Rwanda Media Commission (RMC) in charge of media self-regulation. The project paid salaries of relevant staff of RMC, supported study tours and trainings, media monitoring and adjudication as well as other parts of the mandate of RMC.
- The programme strengthened capacities of 4 independent Community Radio Stations (Izuba, Ishingiro, Isangano and Huguka) through Rwanda Community Radio Network (RCRN). The support provided equipment, trainings, networking and other support.
- Through IWPR&apos;s sub-contractor Swedish Radio Media Development Organisation (SR MDO), the Public Service Broadcaster Rwanda Broadcasting Agency (RBA) was professionalised through provision of trainings of staff, mentoring, writing and assessing business plans for the regional radios, buying broadcast equipment as well as furnishing the television studios of RBA.
- Support to the Independent Creative Sector through grants to business start-ups around creative communication.</narrative>
