    <narrative xml:lang="EN">General question: Results related to the intended outcome 2016Question: Summarise results related to the intended outcome (this information will be sent to Open Aid)Answer: In terms of outputs, RPEP has during its three years successfully achieved all outputs and activities scheduled at the start of the programme. 

For Educators, this included an outreach education programme delivered in 19 communities; on-site programming at Kigali Genocide Memorial where at least 6,189 students were trained; at least 302 teachers from Kamonyi, Bugesera, Rwamagana, Rulindo, Nyarugenge &amp; Kicukiro were trained during a one-day teacher training and a three-day teacher training starting from 2015; 38 teachers were trained in peace education; different sessions of peace education (6) and participatory approaches (2) organised during school holidays from December 2013; 38 teachers (facilitators) from 12 different schools trained in sustained capacity-building, in participatory methods and peace education; and 17 facilitators from three universities trained in debate techniques (World School Debate and Policy Debate) and participatory methods.  

For Youth, this included three phases of &#x201C;Youth Champion Leadership&#x201D;, which brought together 536 youth from all walks of life in Rwanda; Ubumuntu International Youth Conference, which had 120 participants, organised to allow Rwandan Youth Champions to share their experience with young people from around the region and the world, and learn from them; debates in schools and communities (took place on a monthly basis to benefit 5 youth organisations), which continued to be a vehicle through which to foster critical thinking, active bystandership, conflict management, active listening and respect for diversity.  

Regarding Audiences &amp; Visitors, Musekeweya&#x2019;s popularity remained high throughout RPEP as the radio drama marked its tenth year of broadcast in 2014 - 60 % of those surveyed in the Musekeweya popularity survey 2015 said they listened to Musekeweya on a weekly basis. Also, the upgraded Genocide Archive Rwanda website was launched and has recorded more than 150,000 visitors who are mostly scholars, students and researchers. Testimonies were collected from before, during and after genocide and stories of reconciliation were also collected. Testimonies were given by survivors, perpetrators, rescuers and elders who can trace back &#x201C;the root to evil&#x201D;. 

Finally, for Decision Makers this included two Decision makers&#x2019; forums took place which brought together teachers, government representatives, sister &amp; partner organisations and donors. 

All these outputs were achieved at high levels and the programme was particularly successful in terms of outcomes for Educators, Youth and Decision Makers. Educators that participated are now better able to tackle sensitive issues around genocide and have a methodology and understanding of what it means to be peace educators. Both youth and teachers have started peace clubs and peace-related activities, and demonstrated empathy and personal responsibility in the way they have responded to the needs of their communities after interacting with the programme. Youth have also demonstrated nascent leadership abilities and have interacted with Decision Makers in their communities. Decision makers have accepted and actively embraced the need for peace education.

The notable exception is that Audiences &amp; Visitors turned out to be both too vague and broad as a category. This because it can encompass all other boundary partners and because it was too hard for the organisations to follow up on one-time visitors to an exhibition or museum (Kigali Genocide Memorial) or radio drama (Musekeweya). However, Audiences &amp; Visitors were undoubtedly greatly impacted by the delivery of outputs that were fully delivered for this boundary partner which is reflected in the achievement of the first four progress markers. 

By far the most significant outcome of RPEP is that during 2015, the Rwanda Education Board (boundary partner Decision Makers) conducted a review of the school curriculum and incorporated peace and values education into a revised national curriculum which became operational in 2016. This was a direct result of RPEP - specifically the work of the RPEP Pedagogical Committee, led by IRDP and to which Aegis Trust&#x2019;s Director of Education (a former Director General of Education Planning in Rwanda&#x2019;s Ministry of Education, MINEDUC) contributed notably. It should also be noted that this is a global first: Rwanda is the first country to officially incorporate &#x2018;peace and values education&#x2019; as a theme in its school curriculum.</narrative>
