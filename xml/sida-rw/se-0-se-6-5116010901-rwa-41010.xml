   <narrative xml:lang="SV">98% av befolkningen p&#xE5; Rwandas landsbygd saknar tillg&#xE5;ng till elektricitet, vilket &#xE4;r ett stort hinder f&#xF6;r m&#xE4;nniskor som lever i fattigdom att f&#xE5; ett b&#xE4;ttre liv. Det &#xF6;vergripande m&#xE5;let med programmet &#xE4;r att st&#xF6;dja och utveckla marknaden av f&#xF6;rnybar energi, fr&#xE4;mst producerad utanf&#xF6;r det etablerade eln&#xE4;tet genom att 1) st&#xF6;dja privata sektorn att genom sm&#xE5;skaliga produktionssystem leverera elektricitet till ca 77 500 personer p&#xE5; landsbygden samt bidra till jobbskapande och ekonomisk utveckling 2) bidra till att minska koldioxidutsl&#xE4;ppen och f&#xF6;rb&#xE4;ttra milj&#xF6;n genom att minska beroendet av fossilbaserad energi som bidrar till f&#xF6;roreningar och milj&#xF6;f&#xF6;rst&#xF6;ring. Projektet best&#xE5;r av tre komponenter: 1) Renewable Energy Small Projects (RESP) facility 2) Pico Hydro project development samt 3) Energy and Farming.  Det b&#xF6;r noteras att projektet endast inkluderar en planeringsfas av komponent 3, och att p&#xE5;f&#xF6;ljande pilotverksamhet kr&#xE4;ver separat beslut baserat p&#xE5; resultaten av f&#xF6;reg&#xE5;ende arbete. 

GVEP International kommer att genomf&#xF6;ra programmet genom samarbeten med tredje part och avtal kommer att uppr&#xE4;ttas mellan GVEP och dess samarbetsparter.

Den totala programbudgeten &#xE4;r SEK 31 500 000 med Sverige som enda bidragsgivare.</narrative>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">GVEP has applied Sida  funds to carry out the &quot;Scaling up Off-Grid Energy in Rwanda (SOGER) Programme&quot; during the period 2016-2019. 

The overall objective of the programme is to contribute to the growth of a sustained market for off-grid renewable energy in Rwanda by 1) supporting private sector to deliver access to modern energy to about 77,500 people in rural areas, in a way that is inclusive of people living in poverty and as a means to drive economic development by creating nearly 7,000 jobs; 2) work towards reducing carbon emissions, thus contributing to better environment, limited climate impacts and greater resilience to environmental impact, and climate change by reducing dependency on unsustainable energy sources that contribute to pollution, and environmental degradation. In relation to the Energy and Farming, introduction of solar powered pumps irrigation systems technology will improve resilience of small farmers to withstand the climate changes in a more climate friendly and cost effective way by allowing farmers to access predictable and adequate water at the place and time when crops need it. Improved resilience to climate change will be ensured through making irrigation systems hydraulic feasible (water availability), well designed (storage capacity; conveyance capacities and control structures) as well as operated (water allocation). The technology will also contribute to protecting the field environment against degradation in the long term and to ensure water and land resources are utilised efficiently and in a sustainable manner. However, the system should be properly designed and managed, because if it is not well managed, the irrigation systems can waste water and energy, deplete or pollute water resources, and fail to produce good crops and cause soil degradation. GVEP International will implement the programme through third parties. An agreement would be signed between the third parties and GVEP while routine of disbursement will be established as well.   

The Scaling up Off grid energy in Rwanda Project total budget is SEK 31,500,000 and all of which shall be contributed only by Sida.  The additional SEK 500,000 has been made to cater for procurement audit and for assessing capacity of GVEP International Rwanda Office. This amount is set out of the budget with Cooperating Partner (GVEP International). The disbursement to GVEP are allocated as follows:1) the first disbursement, which caters the inception period, is allocated SEK 5 100 000; where as the subsequent disbursements, for simplicity reason, are described on yearly basis because where disbursement is required twice a year have been merged, but in the grant agreement the disbursements are based on specific period which they fund. Thus, the subsequent disbursements are reported as follows: the disbursement in the first year of implementation is SEK 11,700,000; where as the disbursement in the second year of implementation is SEK 10,700,000; and lastly the disbursement in the third year of implementation is 3,500,000.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The overall objective of SOGER is to contribute to the growth of a sustained market for off-grid renewable energy in Rwanda by supporting the private sector to deliver access to energy to 77,500 people in rural areas, in a way that is inclusive of people living in poverty and as a means to drive economic development by creating 7,000 jobs. The intervention also seeks to develop an enabling environment for the mini-grid sector through creation of knowledge reports and toolkits, through interactions and capacity building with stakeholders, and the development of projects to show proof of concept.
&#xA0;The specific objectives of SOGER are expressed under the two componenents of the programme and these are:&#xA0; 1) Renewable Energy Small projects(RESP) and; 2) Small Project or Pico-hydro projects (SHP).
The specific objective of RESP is to accelerate the development of Renewable Energy Small Projects (RESPs) to deliver access to energy in rural Rwanda. This facility targets to provide at least 7 RESPs with a package of technical and transactional advisory support services targeting to deliver energy to 11,000 households.
The design of this facility focuses on creating a sustainable market for the development of Small Hydro Power (SHP) and Renewable Energy (RE) mini-grids and a &#x201C;launch-pad&#x201D; for scale up of the sector.&#xA0;Projects to be supported under the RESP development facility range from 50kW to 3MW. It could either be a greenfield isolated RE mini-grids (using RE such as solar, small hydro etc.), which install new connections; grid-connected RE mini-grids which create new access and sell to grid; or grid-extension projects that extend the distribution network from the existing generation facilities provided there is a possibility of reaching out to the communities with no electricity access.
The objective of Pico-hydro facility is to accelerate the development of the pico-hydro sector by supporting the development of 30 micro-utilities with a total capacity of 450kW, providing reliable and clean electricity to 22,500 people and at least 35 public institutions as well as to numerous commercial enterprises.
This facility targets to work with local, private enterprises/project developers who develops and owns the micro-utilities whilst involving the communities. In addition, the facility provides support to private enterprises/project developers to become commercially sustainable businesses, and to create direct and indirect income opportunities in the communities they serve. The targeted pico-hydro projects are small scale with an average capacity of 41 kW while the major purpose of this component remains to lay the foundation for further expansion of the pico-hydro sector through creating an enabling environment and by demonstration effects of the 30 established micro-utilities.</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">The programme was initially designed to support up to 17 projects to become operational during the implementation phase. The 17 projects consist of 7 Renewable Small Project projects from RESP Facility and 10 Sida grant funded Pico-hydro projects from the Pico-hydro Facility respectively. Unfortunately these targets were not achieved in totality due to the regulatory uncertainty. Majority of projects and associated activities were put on hold during this period. Overall, the programme has made good progress against activities performed but with limited results due to delays to reach the construction phase of projects in which major activities were expected to be performed such as producing and distribution of electricity that would be connected to the households and public and commercial institutions. However, the programme was characterized with a long delay and affected the performance of major activities. The delay was mainly caused by external factors, which are out of control of E4I and the programme. The registered programme achievements during this reporting period mainly constitute the project preparatory activities, which include project development activities, regulatory advice and productive use (PU) support. Others relate to activities supporting construction phase of the ongoing four projects still under construction. These activities include investor facilitation; capital raising; system design and equipment procurement as well as support in developing operational and maintenance guidelines. Despite the challenges, the programme supported four projects to become operational during the implementation phase. Two RESP projects and two hydro projects have been supported by the programme. The summary of the achievements under both RESP and PH projects facilities are presented as follows: Mesh Power-Solar (4Kw); Absolute Energy-Solar (50kW); Kabrud-Hydro (13kW) and Mudasomwa mini-grid-Hydro (34kW). The objective of this programme was partially achieved due to that the performance was mainly characterized by regulatory uncertainty. The few projects described above demonstrate that majority of the planned outputs/results achieved are limited and mainly attributed to the delay of approving projects sites by the EDCL in the form of permit. Without the EDCL Permit, it would not be possible to construct and operate a mini-grid in Rwanda since a developer must have approval from EDCL in the form of a permit. Therefore, this factor negatively affected progress with respect to projects construction to be able to generate electricity, which would connect the targeted households. Overall, this has seriously affected the ability of SOGER programme to achieve its objectives in its entirety.</narrative>
