  <description type="4">
   <narrative xml:lang="NL">Background - The manifestation of religious intolerance in both countries are different and all activities are adapted to the local situation in order to make them most effective. However, there are common issues as well. First of all, both countries deal with increasing religious intolerance due to the influence of religious fundamentalist groups. In Gujarat, these are Hindu groups, while in Indonesia these are Muslim fundamentalists. Secondly, in both situations (local) authorities are co-opted by these fundamentalist forces, which results in discriminatory practices and legislation against religious minorities. This also influences the attitude towards religious minorities of the broader public: people from the majority religion, youth, students, etc. And thirdly, local actors lack the capacity to effectively promote and protect the freedom of religion.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In India, the state of Gujarat has long been an area where interreligious conflict, intimidation, discrimination and marginalization characterize daily life for the Muslim minority. The well-documented 2002 riots marked a low point, but incidents of violence against Muslims by right-wing Hindu nationalist groups are not uncommon, and Muslims continue to live largely as second-class citizens. Gujarat is one of the economically most advanced states in India. But even though there is economic growth, certain groups &#x2013; mainly religious minorities but also the tribals and Dalits &#x2013; have benefited only minimally from the economic success. In many cases have been adversely affected by some of its consequences, such as discrimination, marginalization, growing inequality and exclusion.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Indonesia has long been proud of its diverse ethnicity, cultures and spiritual beliefs. However, recent attacks on minority groups such as the Ahmadiyah community and on Christian churches show that religious tolerance is on the decline. Religious minorities in Indonesia, including moderate Muslims, increasingly face religious intolerance, persecution, and violence, owing largely to the influence of Islamic militant forces such as the FPI and their efforts to radicalize majority communities in places like Java and Sulawesi. This has led to the destruction of places of worship, incidents of violence against the Ahmadiyah community, and an escalation of the Muslim-Christian conflict in Poso district.</narrative>
