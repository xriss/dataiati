   <narrative xml:lang="EN">APJ - The Alliance for Peace &amp; Justice (APJ) originated from a network of six partners of Mensen met een Missie in Gujarat, India. These partners &#x2013; SAFAR, Darshan, SXSSS, CfD, Utthan and IPSCR &#x2013; have all been working on conflict transformation, justice and freedom of religion after the 2002 Gujarat riots. To work more effectively on state-wide issues, they decided to combine forces. As such, it is a unique secular platform of NGOs in Gujarat working with a common agenda on peace, conflict transformation, gender and justice.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In theory, India&#x2019;s laws and policies give room for religious minorities, but practice proves differently. India &#x2013; together with Pakistan &#x2013; is rated as the country with most social hostilities regarding religion. This project focuses on the state of Gujarat in western India. The state is one of the economically most advanced states in India. But even though there is economic growth, certain groups &#x2013; mainly religious minorities but also the tribals and Dalits &#x2013; have benefited only minimally from the economic success. In many cases have been adversely affected by some of its consequences, such as discrimination, marginalization, growing inequality and exclusion. In 2002, Gujarat was the scene of brutal violence between Hindus and Muslims. This incident sparked violence throughout the state, which was fuelled by hate speech of local politicians and Hindu activists. Mobs of angry Hindus &#x2013; led by these politicians and activists, as well as police men &#x2013; attacked Muslim neighbourhoods. Houses were looted and burned, and people were mutilated and killed. The riots left over 2,000 people dead, saw gruesome incidents of sexual violence, and huge property destruction. Now, eleven years later, hardly any of the perpetrators and responsible politicians have been prosecuted. This has contributed to an environment of long-lasting conflict in the area and a climate of distrust and discrimination.</narrative>
