   <narrative xml:lang="EN">1.) Local cross-border solutions to climate change and food security This 3-year, Oxfam-led project aims to: The main purpose of this project is to improve food security for the most disadvantaged communities on both sides of the Dominican-Haitian northern border, while helping the communities to prepare for and recover from the effects of climate change related events. Building on an integrated approach of climate change adaption and food security, the project aims at empowering directly 7,000 disadvantaged persons to reduce their vulnerability and increase their resilience, tackling indirectly the causes of poverty of 35,000 of the most excluded people in the border region. This will be done through skills and knowledge transfer on sustainable agro-ecological production, diversification and commercialisation of products through smallholder farmers organisations, combined with restoration of degraded soils and protection of water resources and biodiversity. Progressio will place 2 Development Workers (a rural development specialist and a rural economic development specialist) in Solidarite Fwontalye and Solidaridad Fronteriza. The DWs will enhance skills and knowledge in agro ecology, climate change adaptation, nutrition, marketing and business development for the two partners to assist poor communities to improve their livelihoods and increase their resilience. Start date 01/07/2014 End date 30/06/2017 2.) For a binational environmental partnership and sustainable local development This is a huge program called &quot;PASCAL&quot; linked to the process of reforming the public administration, which has different dimensions: On institutional level in relation to the State structures involved in the reform process on national and local level, on international level through an external consulting support for this process and on civil society level, represented by the consortium, in order to guarantee the participation of the CS in this reform process and its role in a transparent and effective local governance. The long-term partner organisation FEDOMU (Federation of Dominican Municipalities) is not part of the consortium but has a special role and another contract with the EC that will facilitate the link between CS involvement and openness of the local governments. The project will be delivered in 40 pilot municipalities. The specific role of Progressio is foreseen in relation to the existing Observatories for Monitoring Public Policies and Accountability created by 4 organisations of the consortium. The idea is to strengthen the observatories, to articulate them, to improve and standardize their methodologies and to extend their scopes. The Observatories are the key element of the M&amp;E system of the project, as well as production, analysis and systematization of the information and data collected in the processes of social monitoring/accountability. So the DW will be in charge of supporting the process of strengthening the Observatories and the general monitoring of the project. He/she will be based in Santo Domingo in &quot;Ciudad Alternativa&quot;, a partner organisation we were looking to start collaborating with for some time.
