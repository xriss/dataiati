  <description>Climate change and sustainable agriculture (1)
The project&#x2019;s objective is to promote sustainable agricultural practice and environmental protection to mitigate the effects of climate change in order to guarantee food security and risk adaptation. The main axes of work are food security, environmental protection, natural resource management (in particular water resources), and institutional strengthening of partner and community-based organisations. Two development workers are supporting the local partner organisation through (i) sustainable agricultural production and use of natural resources through agro-forestry and (ii) crop diversification and introduction of small livestock emphasising a balanced diet and proper use of food products in terms of food and nutrition security. The project is reaching 1,800 direct and 9,000 indirect beneficiaries in the northern border region of the Dominican Republic. 
Food Security: Rehabilitation of agricultural productivity of watersheds in central and north-eastern Haiti in support of gardening and fruit production(2)
This project focuses on strengthening of the capacities of community-based organisations and farmers&#x2019; associations of the departments of central and north-east Haiti, contributing to the fight against poverty and food and nutrition insecurity. The project also aims to improve environmental protection and management of natural resources, in order to enhance the productivity and sustainable development of the target communities. The empowerment of women and farmers is also a key part of the project as well as advocacy to increase investment in Haitian agriculture and production. The expected immediate effects of the project include: i) environmental, with an increase in hectares of agricultural land protected or saved from erosion and degradation, and volume of water retained and controlled for agricultural use; ii) production, with an expected increase of agricultural assets and productive units through more efficient management oriented towards local consumption and income generation; iii) marketing and trade, to increase the income level of families through processing activities and joint commercial initiatives; iv) organisational, through improved internal operating conditions of farmers&#x2019; associations and community-based organisations, and more effective participation in processes and strategies to promote local food security. The project is reaching 500 direct and 2,500 indirect beneficiaries in the communities of Gens de Nantes, Lamine and Ouanaminthe (north-east Haiti).
Strengthening the disaster risk management capacities of Caritas Haiti(3)
The project aims to strengthen the coordination, the technical and the organisational capacities of the Disaster Risk Management Unit of Caritas Haiti National Office and to mainstream disaster risk reduction institutionally and on all levels. It is expected that at the end of the project, Caritas Haiti National Office has been institutionally strengthened in development, planning, monitoring and evaluation of disaster risk reduction programmes and projects at the national, regional and local level, in order to better address the problems and needs of their beneficiaries. This will lead to improved coordination of disaster mitigation programmes in particular at the community level, and in general a raised profile at the national and international level in terms of disaster risk management. Key components of institutional strengthening include the definition and structuring of rapid response mechanisms for emergency response, design of contingency plans for all three levels, the establishment of an emergency fund through development of projects linked to sustainable and resilient livelihood and the pre-positioning of emergency supplies and storage of non-food products as part of a preparedness strategy. 
Strengthening the management capacity of agricultural producers in the border communities of the province of El&#xED;as Pi&#xF1;a (Dominican Republic) and the department of Plateau Central (Haiti)(4)
This project will contribute to the improvement of living conditions of the population in the province of El&#xED;as Pi&#xF1;a and the department Plateau Central, through improved conditions and coverage for exchange and collaboration between non-state actors and local authorities of El&#xED;as Pi&#xF1;a and Plateau Central in issues of common cross-border interest, such as agricultural production and trade, culture and environment. The expected results are: i) the creation and management of an office for marketing of agricultural production in the Municipality of Comendador (province El&#xED;as Pi&#xF1;a), in order to reinforce the structure and channels of local and bi-national trade and marketing; ii) creation and management of a cross-border Museum for Culture and Environment, to promote the development of environmental and cultural services within the framework of a cross-border plan for sustainable eco-tourism; iii) promotion of a process of strengthening capacities for governance and local management of municipal authorities, in order to enhance and construct a bi-national dialogue. The project is reaching out to 555 direct and 28,700 indirect beneficiaries in the communities of El&#xED;as Pi&#xF1;a and Plateau Central in the southern Dominican-Haitian border.
Building citizenship(5)
This project will strengthen the capacity of non-state actors and local authorities in the provinces of Independencia and El&#xED;as Pi&#xF1;a. The overall goal is to strengthen the coordination between local authorities and civil society organisations regarding the planning of local development and the development of municipal policies that respond to the needs of the population of 23 municipalities of the southern border provinces of DR and Haiti. Specifically, it seeks greater coordination between Dominican and Haitian border municipalities, and increased participation and coordination between civil society and local authorities for inclusive and sustainable local development. The project is supporting about 2,300 direct beneficiaries and approximately 26,000 indirect beneficiaries.
Building together local governance based on participation and planning(6)
This project aims to contribute to the strengthening of local governance in both the Dominican Republic and Haiti through the implementation of citizen participation spaces established within the framework of the Municipal Law 176-07 in the Dominican Republic and promoting partnerships between municipalities on the Haitian side and cross-border. The specific objective is to strengthen the capacity of non-state actors and local authorities in terms of the implementation of public policies, particularly the mechanisms of citizen participation, gender equity and planning established in the Law 176-07, in favour of local development. It also aims to strengthen the Haitian Federation of Municipalities as an ideal space to promote governance and reconstruction of Haiti and further strengthening the ties between the two nations. Regarding civil society, with which Progressio assume a key role in the implementation of the action, it is foreseen to strengthen public participation, enhancing the knowledge of citizens about their rights, duties and participation mechanisms, especially the Municipal Law 176-07 and promoting advocacy for its compliance. In addition, the project will strengthen the knowledge and resources of local authorities to fulfil their duties and thus create the conditions to plan and reach a consensus for municipal actions and policies that are inclusive for the welfare of all. 
Handicrafts of the Border: promoting employment and social cohesion in El&#xED;as Pi&#xF1;a (Dominican Republic) and Plateau Central (Haiti)(7)
The overall objective of this project is to increase social cohesion between local authorities and Dominican and Haitian civil society in the border towns of Elias Pi&#xF1;a (Dominican Republic) and Plateau Central (Haiti) by implementing joint local development actions that lead to a public-private partnership for job creation in the local and bi-national handicrafts sector. The project represents a set of solutions in technical, economic, social and cultural terms intended to promote the development of the handicraft sector on both sides of the border. The expected outcomes are: i) artisans of the municipalities of El&#xED;as Pi&#xF1;a and Plateau Central improve technical and business management skills through the implementation of municipal spaces for technical training and craft production; ii) the Municipal Association of Artisans and its network on provincial level interact with local authorities and bi-national coordination and consultation bodies, in order to constitute territorial agreements for the sector; iii) the provincial network of the Municipal Association of Artisans, in coordination with public and private stakeholders, is engaged in support and promotion of handicrafts. 
Strengthening the capacity of the state and civil society to promote, manage and coordinate actions to prevent, detect, address and penalise violence against women(8)
The aim of this project is to accompany local actors from the border area to prevent violence against women. This is a follow-up project that monitors the processes that began in May 2011 with the project &quot;Gender-based violence prevention and response to the needs of women in the border between Haiti and Dominican Republic&#x201D; and the project &#x201C;Prevention and attention of violence against women in the border provinces&#x201D; implemented during 2012 by Progressio and co-funded by UNFPA and UN Women. The project &#x201C;Prevention and attention of violence against women&#x201D; seeks to ensure that local organizations and authorities (municipalities, prosecutors, medical centres etc) in the provinces of Dajab&#xF3;n, El&#xED;as Pi&#xF1;a, Independencia, Pedernales, Santiago and Monte Cristi coordinate with each other to carry out action plans that are viable and specific for the prevention and attention of violence against women in their provinces. In the current phase, Progressio&#x2019;s development worker is accompanying and monitoring these organisations and institutions in order to consolidate joint initiatives of action plans for each province, to consolidate and strengthen the Management Committees formed in 2012 and to support awareness-raising and advocacy activities.
Rebuilding a new and all-inclusive Haiti: strengthening Haitian civil society in rebuilding their country(9)
The overall project goal is to strengthen Haitian civil society in their efforts to build a new Haiti which is socially inclusive and transparent. This project responds to the demands of civil society after the Haitian earthquake in January 2010, particularly over the lack of transparency and accountability on reconstruction plans and policies and aid distribution, and the lack of effective civil society participation in policy-making on reconstruction and development of Haiti. This new Haiti aims to break with the past where decisions were made without citizen participation and coordination, and where centralisation still limits regional and local development and rights are poorly respected. The specific objective of the project is to track and analyse the actions taken in the framework of the country&#x2019;s reconstruction through the Observatory of Public Policy and International Cooperation and divulge objective and reliable data on international cooperation, public policies and the situation of Haitians, especially the most vulnerable sectors of the population, to Haitian civil society, national and international stakeholders. Added to this, internationally, Progressio works to influence decision-makers in the UK and Europe on the reconstruction of Haiti and raise public awareness of the  problems facing the country.
Advocacy and communication, with an emphasis on public policy related to the strengthening of the Dominican-Haitian relations(10)
This project aims to strengthen the capacities in advocacy and communication of the local partner Centro Bon&#xF3; and the processes of national and bi-national platforms created between networks and coalitions working with the institution, in order to contribute to the fight against poverty and social exclusion. This includes strengthening communication and media strategies, which include production of press notes and audiovisual broadcasting material for different media and digital networks and monitoring and media analysis. The development worker will also support the different processes led by Centro Bon&#xF3; to strengthen Dominican-Haitian relations, both on the political and institutional level as well as on the grassroots level.
Institutional strengthening, with emphasis on design and project management, of Funcar-Centro Puente in Dajab&#xF3;n(11)
This project aims to strengthen the capacities of the staff of the local organization Funcar-Centro Puente on both sides of the northern border, and local grassroots organizations they work with, in particular women&#x2019;s associations, in design, planning and implementation of sustainable initiatives, with special emphasis on empowerment and income-generating activities for rural women. The development worker will also provide support on gender equality issues, communication and advocacy. It is expected that at the end of the project the organisation has been supported in the development of methodological guidelines and tools for assessment, monitoring and evaluation, allowing a better systematisation of results, impacts and lessons learned within implemented projects. The development worker will also contribute to the intercultural and bi-national approach promoted within the partner organisation and beneficiary grassroots organisations on both sides of the border.
Institutional strengthening and capacity building for the identification and implementation of an agroforestry school at the Centre Jes&#xFA;s Peregrino in San Pedro de Macoris, Dominican Republic(12)
This project will assist the Centre Jes&#xFA;s Peregrino to set up an agroforestry school as part of the institutional strategy of the Centre. The development worker will develop in collaboration with the local staff the necessary tools for soil studies, organisational assessments directed to the beneficiary grassroots organisations, as well as monitoring and evaluation of activities. The development worker will also provide capacity building for the technical team of the Centre in the implementation of an agroforestry training school and strengthening of their skills in agroforestry and agro-ecological production.</description>
