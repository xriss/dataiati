       <narrative xml:lang="EN">4 Target not met baseline studies have been 10 achieved at the end of year 1 Two baseline studies have been initiated one concerning water demand in the domestic sector and one concerning energy demand The water demand study is expected to be completed at the end of September 2015 the energy baseline will be completed in May 2016 Baseline reports will thus not be ready until the end of year 2


5 Target not met setup of the EERE unit 25 achieved at the end of year 1 The second draft plan for the setup of the RE  EE Unit prepared by the project ITE was submitted to SEC in May 2015 The first staff of the unit Principal Officer joined SEC in June 2015 and will work with the project to fully establish the Unit by the end of 2015


6 First target not met but on track to achieve second target The recruitment process for a consultancy to draft a Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Strategy and Action Plan was not completed during year 1 The consultant was identified in May 2015 and will commence work shortly The work is delayed somewhat by a review of the energy policy by the project ITE as there was a need for the elaboration of an amendment to the policy dedicated to EE and with defined targets for EE both in terms of setting time limits for the initiation of national energy management programmes and for the application of specific energy targets when it is possible to define them  ie whenever baseline information is available This policy amendment was submitted to SEC in April 2015 It will guide the implementation of the consultancy to develop the EE Strategy and Action Plan which is expected to be completed by late 2015


7 Target 10 met Opportunities have been identified for revision of the VAT Act to widen the range of products that should receive VAT exemption However the reformulation of the VAT and Customs Act needs to be preceded by development agreement and putting into place a technical validation procedure to validate the eligibility of products This technical validation procedure could be a complete Efficiency and Labeling Standards Programme but could also be started up as a simpler process that will grow in complexity in a progressive manner to allow for stakeholders to become progressively more familiar with the process and its objectives


8 Target not met preliminary work is underway but there is a serious risk that this target will also not be reached by the end of year 2 as the process is complicated An integrated framework to develop the MEPS and the compliance facilitation processes and procedures was initiated in MarchApril 2015 but paused subsequent to a study visit of project staff and partners to Mauritius to interact with counterparts there that raised the possibility of simply adopting the framework applied there This needs to be followed up but meanwhile the ITE has developed an improved technical validation procedure that could replace the existing one characterised as being limited and not very objective and which could be the departing point to develop a complete Efficiency and Labeling Standards Programme This alternative was submitted to the SEC in June 2015 and a decision on the way to proceed will be made shortly


9 Target 10 met A consultant was recruited to undertake a review of the SEEREP recommend revisions and provide an action plan to implement the recommendations The initial review was completed and a report submitted in June 2015 The Ministry of Finance which implements the scheme did not yet express its views on the report It is not known if SEEREP will continue or not


Note To measure the impact of the project energy and water savings there is the need to develop a tool that is more encompassing than just monitoring the SEEREP This had not been planned in year 1 and the activity to elaborate such a tool will start during year 2 The tool will be developed and maintained at the RE  EE Unit at SEC</narrative>

10 Target 10 met The SEECS is being reviewed through a consultancy initiated in early June 2015 This is expected to be finalised in September 2015  The revised SEECS will be for the period 20152018 encompass aspects of water efficiency and will provide an action plan for implementation


11 Target not met The baseline for this indicator is being defined as part of the contracted baseline studies to be reported in the next PIR A market survey was done in March 2015 encompassing 9 retail outlets to determine retailer awareness Consumer awareness is being assessed through a  number of activities as follows


	The energy baseline study in the residential sector which will encompass 1000 households 35 of the households in Seychelles stratified by income group and will include explanation about RE the benefits of adopting EE appliances and responsible use of energy

	One trade fair was carried out in April 2015 in Mah&#xE9; The trade fair congregated about 15 suppliers of resource efficient technologies and was open to the public During the trade fair 100 visitors were assessed concerning their knowledge of EE appliances

	The consultancy to revise SEEREP included a survey where 80 consumers on Praslin and La Digue were asked about their knowledge of EE appliances


All this information will be used to define the baseline for this indicator


12 Target 10 achieved A demo project has been initiated in La Digue school with additional support from the SEC and the CCI La Digue is the primary focus of Government to pilot processes leading to a carbonneutral footprint The project has been designed and the work will start soon Another demo project is expected to be implemented at SIT 1 monitored solar water heater and 1 monitored rain water harvesting system under a consultancy already planned and agreed with SIT under Component 32 The other demonstration projects will be defined in the next reporting period


13 Little progress towards the target as yet The establishment of the EL Standards Programme is still at an embryonic stage


14 Little progress towards the target as yet During the next reporting period a proposal will be made to engage an international consultant to provide the required input


Outcome 22

15 Target not yet met Three surveys have been conducted so far to assess the level of knowledge of the public concerning the existence and objectives of SEEREP The surveys have reached 100 persons on Mah&#xE9; 50 persons on Praslin and 30 persons on La Digue The information resulting from these surveys and the information resulting from the baseline studies and revision of SEEREP will be used to establish the baseline for this indicator which will be defined during the next reporting period</narrative>

Contact with the University of Seychelles was made in order to establish a training platform for shortterm courses that would focus more on energy management maintenance management and other technical topics eg thermal simulation of buildings and planning of green buildings that require specific knowledge but do not require long periods of time to be delivered A first set of courses is proposed to be delivered in February 2016

20 Target less than 1 met The review of the SEEREP financing mechanism put into place preproject by MoFBE submitted an initial report in June The uptake of SEEREP is very low  fewer than 20 successful applications However it is realised that the scheme was implemented without having important structuring and flanking measures in place


The consultant concluded that there are opportunities for improving the publicity operation and monitoring of SEEREP In particular the monitoring of the number of households receiving the support of SEEREP is not recorded in a computer database and thus figures may not be entirely accurate


The position of the MoFBE regarding the continuation or revamp of SEEREP is not yet known The consultancy underway to review SEEREP will also put forward alternative financial mechanisms to be developed to complement SEEREP


The consultant also proposed a new reduction in the target of SEEREP  from 8500 to 5600 noting that the target of 8500 is the Governments target which has been transposed as a project target This has not yet been discussed by the SEC and partners


21 Target 100 met preproject 7 banks have signed the MoU and 4 banks have already approved at least one loan through SEEREP


22 No progress towards the target Watersaving devices are not currently within the scope of SEEREP If the MoFBE decides to continue with SEEREP the action plan to reformulate it will need to increase its overall scope to add these devices especially rain water harvesting systems
