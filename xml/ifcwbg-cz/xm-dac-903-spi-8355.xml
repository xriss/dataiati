(DCR), the third largest credit rating agency in the US.  DCRC will be established along with Ekonomia, the largest publisher of business newspapers and magazines in the Czech and Slovak Republics and PlanEcon, a consulting company specializing in economic and industrial analysis in Central-Eastern Europe and in the republics of the former Soviet Union.  DCRH  will be established along with HVG Kiadoi Rt. (HVG), an independently owned publisher of the leading Hungarian economic news magazine, Heti Vilaggazdasag, and PlanEcon.    Project Cost Including proposed IFC investment    	The project cost of each agencies will be US$0.5 million.  IFC would acquire a 15% equity interest in DCRC (US$75,000) and a 20% equity interest in DCRH (US$100,000) for a total investment of US$175,000.    Location of project and Description of site    	DCRC: Prague, Czech Republic; DCRH: Budapest, Hungary    Description of Company and Purpose of Project   (include IFCs Role and Development Impact)    	The project is to establish two credit rating agencies, DCRC in the Czech Republic  and DCRH in Hungary.  These would be the first such institutions in both countries.  It is envisaged that the two companies would be part of a regional network, including IFCs recent investment in a similar company in Turkey.                                                                                                                     Capital markets in both Hungary and the Czech Republic have reached a level where the lack of the existence of a credit rating agency may hinder the process of further development.  The establishment of credit rating agencies in these countries is expected to provide investors with an objective risk evaluation of debt securities and lead to greater transparency and investor protection.  The comfort imparted by the credit rating agencies should contribute to a greater willingness by savers to invest in corporate debt instruments, a relatively lower cost for the more credit-worthy borrowers, and the development of a healthy corporate debt market.                                                                                                                            Environmental Category and Issues    	This is an environmental review category C project.  No further environmental review is required.
