Location of project and Description of site    	The Project will be located in the TPI Industrial Park at Muang Rayong District, Rayong Province, on Thailands Eastern Seaboard.    Description of Company and Purpose of Project    	The Projects objectives are to expand and diversify TPIs petrochemical production capacity in response to growing domestic and regional needs, as well as to integrate backwards to reduce production costs and assure the Company a reliable source of feedstock. The Project will establish a fully-integrated petrochemical complex consisting of a condensate splitter and feedstock preparation unit with a combined feedstock throughput of 65,000 barrels per day, a 330,000 metric tons per year (tpy) lube base oil plant, a 360,000 tpy steam cracker, and downstream polymer facilities including:  a 200,000 tpy styrene monomer plant and a 100,000 tpy polystyrene plant, as well as the expansion of TPIs existing high density polyethylene plant from 140,000 tpy to 280,000 tpy, the expansion of the acrylonitrile butadiene styrene plant from 48,000 tpy to 84,000 tpy, and the expansion of the polypropylene plant from 220,000 tpy to 250,000 tpy.  The Project will also include an investment in petroleum products distribution facilities.  The Project will employ commercially proven technologies purchased from major international suppliers.  All the Project components are expected to be completed by mid-1998.  The Project will enable TPI, a locally owned and managed company, to become an internationally competitive, integrated producer of petrochemicals/polymers.  Asia is expected to have the worlds highest growth of polymer consumption over the next decade and will remain an importer of most products.  TPIs expansion project will help satisfy a part of the regions requirements.  In addition to its direct exports, the Company will be a significant indirect exporter via the local fabricating industry which is a major employer in Thailand.  IFCs financing would be TPIs initial entry in the international syndicated loan market and is seen by the Company as a critical step to broaden its sources of long-term finance to fund its continued development.
