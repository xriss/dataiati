  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">IFC is considering providing US$150 million Sustainable Loan to RH International (Singapore) Corporation (Singapore) Pte. Ltd. (RHIS), a wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of RATCH Group Public Company Limited (RATCH or the Company).  RATCH is the largest private sector power generating company in Thailand, contributing 13% of total installed generation. The Company owns and operates power generation assets of 7,053 MW and has another 1,237 MW projects in pipeline. RATCH has power generation assets across Thailand, Australia, Lao, Vietnam and Indonesia and investments in other infrastructure businesses, such as  transport, telecom, water, and healthcare in Thailand. RHIS is the investment holding company for all of RATCHs international operations.  As part of their corporate mission, RATCH has set clearly defined Sustainability goals, one of which is increasing the Companys renewable energy portfolio to 25% of total capacity by 2025 (from 15.6% at present). RATCH will use the Sustainable Loan to: (a) increase their equity stake in Fareast Renewable Development Pte Ltd (Fareast) and refinance equity invested in the past; (b) take a minority shareholding in Principal Capital Public Company Limited (Princ); and (c) other greenfield or existing&#xA0; renewable energy projects in emerging markets, including Vietnam, Indonesia, Thailand and Lao (the Project).</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Project is expected to lead to positive stakeholder effects arising from supporting several green and social projects through the Sustainable Loan. As public awareness of climate change and social disparities continue to grow, more infrastructure companies are seeking to shift their businesses towards more sustainable models which support the achievement of NDCs and meet investor demand for investments that are both profitable and contribute positive environmental and social impacts. The Project is expected to demonstrate to other infrastructure companies in Thailand the application of a sustainable finance framework which adopts international principles on project evaluation and selection, management of proceeds, and reporting. This is expected to help the Company effectively utilize relatively new financing instruments such as sustainable loans which would provide flexibility to fund a combination of eligible green and social projects.</narrative>
