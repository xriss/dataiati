   <narrative xml:lang="EN">1.	Climate change: The Project involves the manufacturing of high pressure pumps, a key component of the Piezo common rail system. Continental is a pioneer of diesel technology and is the market leader for Piezo Common Rail Technology, which will promote adherence to EURO 6 emission standards, which will be mandatory from 2014. This new technology will lower carbon dioxide emissions by over 15% relative to regional standards, and by 5% relative to world-class standards. Assuming that half of the CO2 savings are attributable to the injection system , the Industry Specialist calculates CO2 emissions reduction of 17 g/km per vehicle attributable to the use of the Piezo common rail technology. With an annual mileage of 30,000 km, a lifetime of 10 years per vehicle and a production of 145,030 vehicles in 2011, total estimated CO2 savings is 739,650 tons in 2011.
2.	Technology transfer and enhancing Thailand&apos;s competitiveness: The Project will increase the competitiveness of the Thai automotive sector through the transfer of best practices and managerial and technological know-how. Innovation and high-tech manufacturing processes will support Thailand&apos;s transition to a developed country status. Historically, the development of the auto sector, including the export of high-value components, has played a significant role in the economic transformation, as exemplified by Japan, Korea and Taiwan.
3.	Generation of highly skilled labor: The Project will generate approximately 780 jobs. Continental is committed to developing and strengthening its employees&apos; technical expertise. All newly recruited engineers from Thailand attend a one year training program at its headquarters in Germany. 
4.	Support of local suppliers: This Project will require local suppliers to improve their quality and will generate around EUR40 million of local purchases annually by 2014. We estimate that over 1,000 employment opportunities could also be created within the local supply chain. Continental is situated close to its supply base and provides regular inputs to improve quality through internal audits and supplier evaluation.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Project (Continental Automotive Thailand Ltd) is a green field manufacturing facility in Thailand, with a production capacity of 500,000 high pressure pumps and 2,500,000 injectors per year. These pumps and injectors are used in Continentals high-precision Piezo common rail systems, which in turn are used in its diesel-based Powertrain engine systems. Continental sells the complete system, which consists of the Piezo injector, the pump, the fuel rail, and the engine control unit, to Original Equipment Manufacturers. 

Diesel engines consume about 30% less fuel than gasoline engines do. Further, Piezo technology produces fuel savings of up to 5% relative to other diesel engines, reduces particulate and nitrogen emissions and makes engines quieter without any loss of performance. These components fulfill EURO 6 emission standards which will apply in Europe from 2014 onwards. The Project aims at supplying injectors for passenger with diesel engines. The Project is an important step taken by the Sponsor to expand its manufacturing base in Asia in order to support the growth of its clients fuel efficient vehicle sales in the region.</narrative>
