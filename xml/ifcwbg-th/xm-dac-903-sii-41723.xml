   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Project Outcomes: 
Stakeholder impacts - improved access to finance for green projects and improved quality of financing products: the Project would promote the Bank&apos;s climate finance lending and enable funding of an additional portfolio of up to US$389 million, with the proposed IFC investment estimated to result in GHG emissions reduction of 23,794 tCO2e/year. End-borrowers would be able to access green finance products that are not available in the market such as green building finance and low carbon mobility finance. 

Contribution to Market Creation: 
Integration: the Project will promote the integration of the financial markets in Thailand, by supporting the Bank to introduce an instrument with substantially bigger growth potential than green bonds while maintaining high standards of information disclosure as part of the implementation of the GLPs, resulting in creating data linkages and common taxonomy for the market. As the first green loan aligned with the GLPs in Thailand, the Project would also have a strong demonstration effect to other Thai banks and enhance awareness of the importance and benefits of sustainable finance.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The proposed investment entails an IFC senior USD denominated 7-year green loan of up to US$100 million, together with a joint IFC Climate Advisory Service (AS) engagement, to support Kiatnakin Bank Public Co., Ltd. (KKP or the Bank) to develop and scale up its climate finance business in line with international best practices (Project). The Project will be the first green loan in Thailand aligned with the Green Loan Principles (GLPs) published in March 2018 by the Loan Market Association and the Asia Pacific Loan Market Association. The entirety of the loan proceeds would be dedicated to funding assets that meet IFCs climate finance criteria. The loan will be committed in two US$50 million tranches, in total US$100 million.   KKP is the 10th largest Thai commercial bank by assets in 2019. As of December 30, 2019, its total assets were US$10.5 billion and equity was US$1.5 billion. It is listed on the Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET) and included in SET50.</narrative>
