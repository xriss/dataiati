       <narrative xml:lang="EN">Target met. The PU! project in India works with women forest dwellers. Forest dweller groups are at varied stages of advancement with respect to their capacities to organize for collective and individual rights under the Forest Rights Act. The level of organization is also vastly variant among participants, from nascent groups that have just been initiated in Chattisgarh and Uttarakhand to groups that have evolved over two decades and have a clear structure, vision and strategy such as in Kurkheda Maharashtra, or in Rajasthan Sirohi District.  The challenge in the states where the older groups exist is to bring in a new generation of leadership and integrate their needs and perspectives into the process as well as to work towards influencing local and state governance to incorporate women&#x2019;s rights and recognize their knowledge in forest claim, governance and regeneration processes. Our efforts were primarily focussed on strengthening women within communities to enable them to have a better understanding of the law and of the need to claim rights and assert rights for recognition, create pathways for greater engagement to sharpen their analysis of issues. It is necessary for them to be able to represent their issues effectively with men in their societies as well as with actors in other forums and platforms and in negotiating and dialogue with state and its agencies.
The results reported relate to activities on forest rights capacity development and women&apos;s leadership meetings  in which young rural and indigenous women participated from four states of Uttarakhand, Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh and Maharashtra.  In Maharashtra this first phase have been focussed on building women&#x2019;s leadership to participate in discussions and meetings for decision making in these forums in Garhchiroli. The first step in this direction was to deepen the understanding of women and community forest rights governance, so that women could collectively influence agenda and intervene to place their priority issues on forest governance in their Maha-gram-Sabha federation and at local and cluster levels. Further training was focussed towards an understanding of community forest governance in the post claim process, once rights are conferred, and to strengthen their roles in forest products value chains and in conservation efforts. 174 Women from 20 Gram Sabhas were provided leadership training inputs on the forest rights act and forest rights claim processes, and 128 Women were trained on  ownership (i.e. access, use and disposal)of non-timber forest produce (NTFP). In Raigardh the efforts to build women&#x2019;s leadership  and to understand their concerns have enabled women to gradually form groups for collective action through the leadership development processes underway. 33 Women have been trained and are now leading the group discussions and representing their issues at various levels of governance by attending community meetings and participating in other public events. In Rajasthan our work has been concentrated towards building leadership among forest dweller women in southern District of Sirohi District. Through these efforts 35 women from 11 villages were enabled to understand the nuances of forest rights Act and related legislation and were encouraged to represent their issues before the district level  government. SImilar capacity building activities and trainings were held in Uttarakhand and Chhattisgarh. Data are not available on numbers of particpants in these activities. However project reporting notes that rigid social norms and patriarchal attitudes are discussed and efforts will gradually need to be made to ensure that practices of gender-based violence and discriminatory practices as well as denial of rights including land and resource rights are addressed. The project has been raising these issues and through the training programs and interactions with women leaders&#x2019; awareness via storytelling and experience sharing by women from other villages and districts during the leadership training programs it is envisaged that there will be greater mobilization and confidence among women and young people to change the social conditions of women&#x2019;s status as well as to strengthen their rights in forest regimes. In Uttarkhand, training programs in UDS and Champawat brought women together to learn from the struggles of women in Sania Basti, where women had challenged the denial of their forest rights by the state government and had filed a court case to activate the process for recognition of their rights. Women leaders were able to interact and seek clarifications through the trainings where interactions with layers and awareness on forest rights laws were discussed. Discussions were also held on issues of gender-based violence and status of women and associated legal provisions. Simultaneously village level meetings have been held with community members and the women leaders here and elsewhere so that women can organize into groups to raise their issues and gain knowledge and support each other in claiming their rights and resisting gender discrimination.  In sum, the trainings and capacity building activities supported in India have reached hundreds of women in the reporting period. Due to data gaps we can only report that 150 women have increased confidence and knowledge and skills to organize  and act in support of their rights as forest dwellers. This number is an estimate based on a review of the project narrative report which included a summary of concrete actions that women were taking as result of their participation in trainings. In future, the project will improve methods in India for collecting data on this indicator.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">The AAAS PU! initiative focuses on building women&apos;s leadership to address forest rights and forest governance. Earlier, women were not aware of the forest rights committees in their villages, nor was their membership accepted in the forest rights committees. Through AAAS&#x2019;s efforts, processes of awareness building and democratic governance systems were discussed during training programmes and follow up meetings, giving examples of other regions where such committees have been formed and their success. As a result, women and men in communities recognised the significance of women in FRCs and reconstituted their committees to ensure that women were represented equally. Now, seven of the 15 members are women.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project in India is working primarily to support and strengthen the capacities of women who are members of forest dwellers organizations to strengthen their organizations and enable women to assert their voices to claim the spaces within decision making and governance processes in forest rights and governance as well as citizens and producers in the economy. Numerous women&apos;s committees and groups within forest dwellers organizations  were strengthened during the period, though it has been difficult in Year 1 to track numbers since the project in India is working with a variety of forest dweller organizations (and then with women&apos;s committees within these). The project however can report that it has supported the establishment and capacity strengthening of 7 organizatons. In the state of Uttarakhand (Champawat), one forest rights committee as people&#x2019;s organization was established to implement forest rights law with new women leaders where they have put in their application for community forest rights in 3 villages. In the state of Chhattisgarh- one seed bank has been established along with 5 other organizations with women&#x2019;s leadership in 5 villages. Although the target has likely been surpassed for Year 1 we are reporting 0 since the data was not collected to capture the number of women&apos;s committees/bodies strengthened. We will be revising our data collection instruments for Year 2.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">The target was not met. The project will be working closely with the partner in India to revisit this indicator and to understand either how data can 1) be better collected or 2) how the project partner is understanding and reporting on alliance building in the context of the PU! project. It is possible that other alliances were created that have not been captured in the annual reports.  In Year 1, two  alliances were made to strengthen the local self-governance- SR Abhiyaan (people led campaign) in Rajasthan, where the project is now working with more than 30 members of Local Self-Governance Abhiyaan as a strategic alliance to increase the visibility of forest dwellers rights. 
We will be revisiting the target this year.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">We had not intended to report on this indicator and no target had been set. However, the results reported included two solidarity/urgent actions by the partner in India. Two memorandums have gone to the Ministry of Tribal Affairs (Government of India) addressing the issues around violence against women in forest dwelling community and policies through campaign and jointly with other women&#x2019;s organizations and forest rights networks in Uttarakhand. An increasing spate of violence against women and girls as they go about their forest foraging activities has meant that women have had to strengthen their voices to petition state agencies to act against perpetrators of such incidents of violence. Petitions have been placed at local district and state as well as at national levels in collaboration with other networks organizing for women&#x2019;s rights and gender equality.</narrative>
