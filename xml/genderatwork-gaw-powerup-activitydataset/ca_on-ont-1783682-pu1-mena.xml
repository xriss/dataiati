   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Power Up! is a consortium of four women&#x2019;s rights organisations: Just Associates (JASS, lead organisation), a feminist movement support organisation rooted in the Global South; Coalition of African Lesbians (CAL), a queer, Pan-African, feminist organisation; Yayasan Pemberdayaan Perempuan Kepala Keluarga (PEKKA), a national women-headed family empowerment network in Indonesia; and Gender at Work (G@W), an international feminist knowledge network. 
Power Up! will engage with women human rights defenders (WHRD) and their organisations and networks, particularly those that represent constituencies that have been marginalised in their communities and social movements (LBQ3 women, HIV+ women, sex workers, women workers and rural and indigenous women). Together, we will be building, organising, mobilising and transforming power on three strategic agendas of &#x2018;bodies, voices and resources&#x2019;.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">Although we had originally planned to report on this indicator, during first year implementation it became apparent that there were results worth reporting. Rural women in Lebanon are among the most vulnerable groups of the population, marked by an increased incidence of poverty. Rural women still face a number of constraints (legal, cultural, socio-economic) and challenges to benefit from rural development, emphasized by persisting gender bias in the delivery of rural services.  The agrifood cooperatives/associations comprise smallholder farmers, pastoralists, fisherfolks and small-scale food transformation units. Rural women mostly organize themselves and prove leadership positions in agro-processing and marketing and rural artisanal produce organizations. They come together for processing and marketing of agrifood products that include crop-based products (i.e. jams, pickles, olive oil, grape molasses, concentrated juice and distillates, water of roses, etc.), aromatic and medicinal herb-based products (e.g. thyme), dairy products (i.e. labneh, yogurt, kishik, shanklish, cheese, etc.) and local/traditional breads (e.g. bourghol and frikei). As such women&#x2019;s-only cooperatives, face numerous challenges because of their lack of access to land and credit, which translates to their dependence on male farmers and sponsors, and as such yielding their enterprises unsustainable. Furthermore, women have very rare opportunities to develop their agricultural marketing knowledge and skills and do not benefit from partnerships with the private sector or suitable legal and institutional frameworks. As such, the power up project has launched a support package aiming at equipping women cooperative with relevant equipment to advance, ease, and support their engagement  and voice within the value chain thus enhancing food security and livelihoods. The project is working with 3 women&apos;s cooperatives to build their capacity to engage directly with suppliers: 1-   Ain Lawz Cooperative (15 members) , Bekaa Governorate - West Bekaa area &#x2013; Ain Ata village 2-  Jana Al Basateen cooperative (14 members) : Mount Lebanon governorate &#x2013; Chouf Area - Batir Village; and 3-   Kawkaba cooperative (12 members): South Governorate &#x2013; Marjioun area &#x2013; Kawkaba village. In the last quarter of the year,  feedback from the  women cooperatives suggest that they are satisfied of the participatory approach adopted by the project and indicated that this is the first time where a project has shared the procurement process details and engaged them in a consultative and collaborative discussions during the procurement process initiation, detailing, and offer soliciting. The women have created new linkages and communication pathways with the available suppliers, and have more information on equipment due to their discussions with suppliers and field visits. These communications, links and meetings facilitated by the project are essential for women cooperatives and have strengthened their capacities on manufacturing and operating details of the new equipment,</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">Target exceeded. The power up project  in Lebanon has launched a support package aiming at equipping women cooperative with relevant equipment to advance, ease, and support their engagement within the value chain thus enhancing food security and livelihoods. Three Women cooperatives were strengthened technically and politically:Ain Lawz Cooperative; Jana Al Basateen cooperative; and Kawkaba cooperative .They were actively participating in the process of prioritizing their needs, solicitation of the quotation, negotiating with suppliers &#x2013; which usually is not the case with the rural women in Lebanon.  For example, partners were supported through a participatory process of developing criteria for procurement that both allowed them to prioritize procurement from local manufacturer and to determine the machines&#x2019; appropriateness to the cooperatives, specifications, prices, usage, capabilities and reliability. Opportunites were also facilitated to ensure that women cooperatives were able to communicate to share common goals and concerns. In follow up interviews, women cooperatives reported being extremely satisfied of the participatory approach adopted by the project and indicated that this is the first time where a project has shared the procurement process details and engaged them in a consultative and collaborative discussions during the procurement process initiation, detailing, and offer soliciting. The women have created new linkages and communication pathways with the available suppliers, and have more information on equipment due to their discussions with suppliers and field visits. These communications, links and meetings facilitated by the project are essential for women cooperatives and have strengthened their capacities on manufacturing and operating details of the new equipment as well as the pre-owned equipment.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">The capacity building program targeted 20 women representatives  from a diverse background and various districts of Lebanon representing different CSOs and have meaningful impact on their local societies.The training adopted interactive and participatory methods: working groups, role plays, case studies, etc. A variety of learning methods such as brainstorming and utilization of the participants&#x2019; personal experience were employed to stimulate interest and meet the different questions of the participants. The first day with trainer Alia Awada, a feminist activist and managing editor of Sharikawalaken feminist website, showed that the participants have very basic knowledge on gender concepts and intersectionality. After the general introduction and brainstorming, they began to identify the different forms of violence that can be economic, legal and social, not just sexual, physical and psychological.   Working in groups, they prepared to conduct a TV and press interview, and most importantly learned how to present their demands to relevant authorities. Preparations were made for role-playing to highlight the characteristics of leadership, such as communication skills, persuasion, listening. A role play was done and the group were divided into small group to observe the attitudes of the members of the role play. The sessions provided practical and technical guidance on how to best prepare for a lobbying meeting with stakeholders and other types of interviews. The last day of training focused on the concept of advocacy, its impact on decision-makers and individual lives, and how to use it to change people&apos;s actions and views. Due to the participants&apos; lack of awareness regarding advocacy in general, the trainer discussed its concepts and techniques, as well as how to use them in contemporary environments and public spaces. Photos and videos of the capacity building program here.

The results of the workshop evaluations showed enhanced knowledge on gender concepts, gender division of labor and a better understanding on advocacy tools. For the purposes of this project, these outcomes are taken as a proxy for increased confidence, political skills and consciousness. These new skills, tools and confidence will be key to enabling participants to articulate, strategize and to advocacy work for their specific areas of engagement.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project in Lebanon built one strategic alliance with OXFAM for its 16 days of activism campaign. 
OXFAM&#x2019;s suggested to have CRTDA as its MENA strategic partner and post the &#x2018;16 days of activism campaign&#x2019; social media material on OXFAM&apos;s social media platforms. In line with Power Up &#x2013; MENA strategic objectives, the Social Media Campaign was designed to raise awareness of the general audience on economic gender-based violence EGBV with direct messages aiming towards combating and ending EGBV against women and girls and increase the outreach of CRTD.A.A Facebook page and increase the visibility of Power Up project through posts highlighting its main activities and empowerment processes. The target of 8 new/diverse alliances was not met in year 1, although this one new alliance was a big win for the project in that it greatly expands the visibility of the project and creates opportunitiies for further leveraging influence and support.  In  2022 the project will place greater emphasis on building and documenting new/diverse alliances. OXFAM have contacted CRTD.A to collaborate for 2022&apos;s global campaign on inequality and how it interacts with gender-based violence, and would like to talk about using some of the media material produced or all of it to create unbranded materials to run a campaign that will highlight how women, girls, trans and non-binary people had been robbed by the rigged economic system prior to the World Economic Forum (WEF) 2022.</narrative>
