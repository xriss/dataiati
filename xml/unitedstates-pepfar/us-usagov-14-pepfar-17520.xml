&#x2022; Objective 2: Gender norms transformed to prevent SV and support survivors (Enabling environment);


&#x2022; Objective 3

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The objective of the RESPOND activity is to improve sexual violence (SV) prevention and response efforts in Burundi. The proposed activities will be articulated around 3 specifics objectives which are: 


&#x2022; Objective 1: Health sector response for SV survivors strengthened (Supply);


&#x2022; Objective 2: Gender norms transformed to prevent SV and support survivors (Enabling environment);


&#x2022; Objective 3: Capacity of communities and civil society to prevent SV Increased (Demand).


The RESPOND activity will be implemented in two of the four provinces currently supported by PEPFAR: Muyinga and Kayanza. The selection of these provinces is based on the need of building upon the relationships existing between the MCH and the PEPFAR programs. The target population is around 1.5 million. The plan is to expand these activities in additional provinces, budget permitting.
To implement specific SV activities, RESPOND will identify and partner with local NGOs. With the technical assistance from RESPOND, the identified NGOs will train Health providers in medical response, counseling of survivors, and the ethical management of survivors&#x2019; information. They will also coordinate community mobilization interventions and link with local authorities.
RESPOND will track the number of people trained as well changes in the knowledge, attitudes, and skills based pre and post-tests and follow-up visits three to six months after the training. It will also track the number of survivors assisted.</narrative>
