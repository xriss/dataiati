   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Foundation for Professional Development (FPD), in partnership with Society for Family Health, FHI360 and Humana People to People South Africa, will contribute to reduced HIV incidence by linking key populations and high incident communities to HIV and TB prevention &amp; care.  The goal of the program is to expand high-quality community-based HIV Counseling and Testing (CBCT) models supported with effective referral systems.  Objectives are to: 1) implement locally sustainable linkage and referral systems from CBCT to prevention, care and treatment services; 2) provide CBCT for key populations; and, 3) build human and systems capacity to QA HCT. This program will contribute to goals of SAG NSP, PHC re-engineering strategy, PEPFAR/SA HIV Prevention Strategy, PEPFAR Blue Print for an AIDS-free Generation, and PFIP.  Geographic coverage includes 14 priority districts with the highest HIV incidence and ANC prevalence rates and highest population density.  To be cost effective, FPD will build capacity of SAG Community Health Workers to expand home based CT and strengthen SAG-owned and financed referral and tracing systems with planned scale-back in 2017 upon evidence of significant QI of CBCT.  FPD will ensure successful transition to SAG by involving District Health Management Teams (DHMT) and District AIDS Councils (DACs) in the conceptualization, planning and implementation of CBCT and negotiating roles and responsibilities regarding program milestones, sustainability and timelines. FPD will use SAG information systems, FPD M&amp;E systems (including an CBCT App) and HSS evaluation strategy to assess progress, measure change and QI. Key outcomes include increased knowledge of HIV status and increased access to effective HIV and TB prevention, care and treatment services.</narrative>
