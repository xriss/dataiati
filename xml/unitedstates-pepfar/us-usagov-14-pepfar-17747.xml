   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Henry Jackson Foundation and its local body, HJFMRI, partners with NMOD-EPIC  to strengthen HIV services in 46 military health facilities serving both military personnel and civilians in 19 states and the FCT.  To enhance efficiency, HJF will institute results-based program management (RBM) strategy in COP 14/15 to reduce the cost per achievement. It will also identify and exploit areas of synergy between the different technical areas through joint site supportive supervisory visits and use of mentors based at nearby sites. Efforts will be stepped up to strengthen the Hub and Spoke model. In FY13, HJF and EPIC implemented joint program planning, execution and monitoring of activities at the sites, which helped to increase NMOD&#x2019;s technical capacity, continuing to transition responsibility and ownership of the program. This joint program management will be further strengthened in COP 14/15. In addition, the NMOD currently provides approximately 30 - 50% of all the funds used to run the program. In COP 14/15, progressively more financial responsibility for the program will be transitioned to the NMOD. Activities in COP 14 and 15, as in the previous years, will be monitored through periodic site visits. In addition, process and outcome evaluations will be built into every activity. Implementation science will be scaled up in COP 14 and 15 with a clearly outlined mechanism of feeding back into the program. All of these will be facilitated through the effective implementation of the RBM strategy. With improved effectiveness in implementation as a result of the introduction of RBM, we anticipate being able to do more within a static budget envelope.</narrative>
