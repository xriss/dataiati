   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Capacity Bridging Mechanism is a new mechanism that will be a follow-on project to the Capacity Kenya Project that ends in April 2014. The project is currently in its solicitation stage and the expected date of award is April 15th, 2014.  It will be an 18 month Associate Award to the Leader with Associate Capacity Plus Project.  The Capacity Bridge mechanism is expected to achieve the following objectives: 
1) Health workforce contracting,
2) Strengthening national government HRH functions,
3) Support to county HRH management systems and 
4) Support the continued roll out and implementation of HRHIS and its integration with the integrated Health Management Information System (HMIS).  
The design of this mechanism has taken into account the fact that the management of HRH functions has been devolved in to the 47 county governments under the current Kenya Constitution. Therefore, more effort will be focused on supporting the county governments to better manage their HRH in terms of forecasting, attraction, recruitment, distribution, motivation and retention. The project will continue to support contract health workers who serve in the resource poor setups and further negotiate with the county government to transition them to their payrolls. The project will support the roll out of the Human Resources for Health Information System (HRIS) to the county level for better decision making on HRH.
The program will develop a Performance Monitoring Plan (PMP) on a yearly basis which will be reviewed with the partner during quarterly meetings to ensure that targets are being met.</narrative>
