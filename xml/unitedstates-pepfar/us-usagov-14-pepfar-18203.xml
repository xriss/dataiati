   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The awardee for the funding opportunity announcement &#x201C;Implementation and Expansion of High Quality, Sustainable and Comprehensive HIV Prevention, Care and Treatment Programs in the Western Region and Turkana County&#x201D; will support implementation of accelerated quality comprehensive HIV prevention, care and treatment services in Homabay, Kisumu, Siaya, Migori, Kisii and Turkana Counties. This will include: the identification and enrollment of People Living with HIV (PLHIV, including children); Key Populations (FSWs, MSM, PWID): Priority Populations (adolescent girls and young women, older men, fisher folk); the provision of HIV care and treatment; prevention and treatment of TB; provision of HAART to HIV infected pregnant and breastfeeding women, and follow-up of HIV-exposed infants; provision of comprehensive VMMC services; strengthening of laboratory systems for HIV-related tests; and strengthening data management in line with the National HIV/AIDS Monitoring and Evaluation Framework and PEPFAR MER reporting requirements.
