   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The HRSA Quality Improvement Capacity for Impact Project (QICIP) supports evidenced-based approaches to improving quality on a sufficient scale and pace to produce significant impact.  The focus of this mechanism is on process improvement as opposed to limiting improvement to compliance with guidelines.  Also, management and administrative processes need more focus including redesigning the flow of patients to improve efficiency or increase productivity.  Challenges associated with areas such as patient access and stigma might also be pursued. 
 In Kenya a Quality Improvement Collaborative will be undertaken to address a set of priority issues in priority counties.  The model involves forming improvement teams from up to 50 different clinics and hospitals and from different levels of the health system, and supporting them in working together on common aims to improve particular aspects of the system.  These facilities share their experiences as they test changes for improvement.  A change package emerges, often in as little as nine months, and this change package can be adapted for each unique context.  High-level health authorities can then spread the successful changes on a wider scale.

HRSA was awarded central funds for the QICIP, and Kenya was among the countries for which these central funds are available.  These funds will be used to support rapid start of COP16 activities and knowledge management and other activities to spread successful interventions across Kenya as well as to other PEPFAR OUs.</narrative>
