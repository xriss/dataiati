Wits RHI targets adolescents (ages 10-19) living with HIV (ALHIV) in Region F of Johannesburg and Matlosana sub-district of North West Province. In collaboration with Departments of Health and Basic Education (DOH and DBE), the goal is to develop, pilot, evaluate and support the scale-up of a replicable model of targeted and linked interventions across clinics, schools and communities (i.e. the 3

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Wits RHI targets adolescents (ages 10-19) living with HIV (ALHIV) in Region F of Johannesburg and Matlosana sub-district of North West Province. In collaboration with Departments of Health and Basic Education (DOH and DBE), the goal is to develop, pilot, evaluate and support the scale-up of a replicable model of targeted and linked interventions across clinics, schools and communities (i.e. the 3 streams of PHC re-engineering) to improve the screening, diagnosis, treatment, adherence, retention in care, and psychosocial and mental health of ALHIV. 

The project is closely aligned with the NSP, the National Youth Policy 2009-2014, the Draft Adolescent Youth Health Policy and the Integrated Schools Health Policy. The project is also closely aligned with DOH Regional Training Centers to ensure best practices and capacity-building are institutionalized as well as facilitate smooth transition and sustainability. 

Wits RHI will implement this project and leverage other  PEPFAR-funded district support activities, and m-Health PPP to increase impact and cost efficiencies.
 
M&amp;E is project-specific as DHIS does not capture adolescent age groups; however, Wits RHI is advocating for inclusion of adolescent data points in the National Indicator Data Set through expert TA to the National Health Data Advisory Coordination Committee. 

Wits RHI is developing a Tier.net -based mobile data platform to monitor the project, manage data, and support communications on referrals and retention in care across services. Baseline and monitoring data are collected using operations research, including file reviews. 

Project documentation follows principles of implementation science to ensure replicability of the model in other settings, and will include cost, coverage and yield analyse</narrative>
