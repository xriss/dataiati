PASADA is a local faith-based organization with a goal to strategically and sustainably optimize access to comprehensive and cost-effective HIV and AIDS prevention, care, and treatment services.  PASADA receives support from foundations, such as Stephen Lewis Foundation and Comic Relief.  With PEPFAR funding, PASADA provides HIV services in 19 health facilities within the Archdiocese of the Roman Catholic Church (RCC) network in the Dar es Salaam and Pwani regions along with communities surrounding these facilities.  The program is aligned with the first goal of the PF focusing on service maintenance and scale up.  People living with HIV/AIDS (PLHIV), adults, children, and OVC are beneficiaries.  Services provided are based on national standards and guidelines.  PASADA emphasizes country ownership and sustainability by engaging community members to identify and implement solutions to problems facing PLHIV and OVC.  PLHIV participate actively in the planning and provision of services through PLHIV forums and the participation of PLHIV volunteers in all service areas.  The program incorporates gender and supports abused children (especially girls) and provides medical and legal support to widows.  Prevention activities are mainstreamed through all services and at all levels.  Since the program began in October 2011, it has become more efficient by decentralizing its services from initially 11 to 19 lower level health facilities and bringing services closer to the people who need it.  PASADA&#x2019;s monitoring and evaluation framework is aligned with that of MOHSW, which includes monthly program data aggregation and analysis.  The national HIV monitoring system will continuously be reviewed and improved to ensure efficient and evidence-based programming.
