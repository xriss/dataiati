The best way to meet the needs of vulnerable children is to keep their parents alive.  The Community Grants Program also provides care and support for people living with HIV/AIDS, enabling parents to resume their role as caretakers and thus allowing children to reclaim their childhood. The Community Grants Program recognizes the critical contribution played by grassroots organizations in providing care to these target populations, often in rural underserved areas. Many of these organizations do not qualify for the million-dollar grants awarded by USAID and CDC and are unable to access the services provided by USG Implementing Partners. Grants are awarded for a one-year period to groups working in direct service delivery in one of the nine priority intervention areas that are essential to the well being of OVC: socio-economic security, food security/nutrition, care/support, mitigation of the impact of conflict, education, psychosocial support, health, child protection and legal support. Comprehensive care given by strengthening household income generation is the preferred approach. Adult Care and Support funds are used to directly serve PHAs in ways that reduce their vulnerability to opportunistic infections, improve nutritional status, provide home based care support, including social/psychological mentoring.  Projects that provide economic strengthening via training, animal husbandry, or garden projects are also useful in sustaining health status of PHAs and their families.   Community education and mobilization to VCT resources are the gateway to identifying PHA within the communities.</narrative>
