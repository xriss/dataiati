   <narrative xml:lang="EN">CDC Namibia has a clear and well defined vision for its role in transitioning PEPFAR to a TA program, and is working actively to provide innovative ways to address both policy and programmatic challenges. CDC Namibia is deeply committed to helping the country achieve the goal of an AIDS-free generation, as well as attaining PEPFAR global targets. The University of Namibia (UNAM) is a vital part of those efforts, as one of two pre-service institutions training health care workers in Namibia.

The Partnership Framework (PF) for Namibia and the Global Health Initiative (GHI) strategy strive to improve access to quality of health services in Namibia. This mechanism will help the country achieve those goals, as well as increase country ownership and sustainability. UNAM&#x2019;s geographic coverage is national, and the target population is faculty and students with the Faculty of Health Sciences and related programs. This mechanism promotes cost-effective approaches by investing in local Namibian institutions, and will allow for a viable transition of key inputs to UNAM, including equipment for clinical instruction and human resources. HR costs are projected to transition to UNAM over the next few years and will strengthen key country systems for faculty recruitment, management and retention. Key M&amp;E activities include student assessment, as measured by pre- and post- testing and external assessments. Monthly meetings are held with UNAM to assess progress towards outputs and objectives within the work plan. This is mechanism is currently in its first year so budget execution is only available for 1 quarter and expenditure analysis is not yet available. The outcome and impact will be an increase in the quality and quantity of graduates and a more robust, capable health workforce.</narrative>
