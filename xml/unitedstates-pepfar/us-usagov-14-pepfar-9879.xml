STAR-E&apos;s goal is to empower communities to respond effectively to the challenges posed by the HIV/AIDS and TB epidemics through increased access to, coverage of, and utilization of quality, comprehensive HIV/TB prevention, care and treatment services within district health facilities and their communities. Project coverage is in 12 districts: Budaka, Bududa, Bukwa, Busia, Butaleja, Kapchorwa, Pallisa, Mbale, Sironko, Kibuku, Bulambuli and Kween. Comprehensive HIV/TB services are provided in the region in partnership with district local governments and the Ministry of Health (MoH) to attain five results: 1) Increased uptake of comprehensive HIV/TB services within supported districts; 2) Decentralized service delivery systems strengthened for improved uptake of quality HIV/TB services; 2a) Lot Quality Assurance Sampling (LQAS) institutionalized at national level to support and coordinate district-level implementation; 3) Quality HIV/TB services delivered in all supported health facilities and communities; 4) Networks, linkages, and referral systems strengthened within and between health facilities and communities; and 5) Increased demand for comprehensive HIV/TB prevention, care, and treatment services. The prevention service package includes: Prevention of Mother-to-Child Transmission (PMTCT), HIV Testing and Counseling (HTC), condom distribution, voluntary medical male circumcision (VMMC), Positive Health, Dignity and Prevention (PHDP), Key Populations (KP) services, and sexual prevention. The care and treatment service package includes: adult/pediatric care and support, TB/HIV, nutrition through linkages, and adult/pediatric treatment. The project also provides CB TB DOTS services with the goal of attaining the national TB identification and treatment success rates.
