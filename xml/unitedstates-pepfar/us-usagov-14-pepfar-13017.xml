   <narrative xml:lang="EN">1. The major goal of this activity is local organizational and human capacity development in quality assurance and quality improvement of laboratory testing. The objectives are for ASM to develop training programs provided to Congolese laboratorians working in clinical health care facilities for improved diagnosis of HIV and TB. ASM will also improve the infrastructure of laboratories where these individuals currently work. Key expected intermediate outcomes include increased skills required to carry out quality-assured diagnosis of HIV and TB.

2. ASM will continue to explore partnership opportunities, both public-private and other kinds that help leverage funds, and the strategy, which involves transferring knowledge through onsite mentorship, is a cost-efficient manner to effect major changes.

3. ASM will continue to work with Congolese laboratory technical working groups at the central level to adapt training materials for DRC&#x2019;s particular circumstances, so as to ensure country ownership. Furthermore, ASM will work directly with the Ministry of Health&#x2019;s national reference laboratories for HIV and TB and national HIV and TB control programs to transfer proper management expertise via onsite mentorship and training programs.

4. ASM has an in-house M&amp;E Specialist whose sole responsibility is to develop indicators to measure program activities. As part of the M&amp;E strategy, the M&amp;E Specialist will offer technical assistance to the Congolese stakeholders in defining an M&amp;E plan that is manageable and most appropriate for measuring program progress.

5. N/A &#x2013; No vehicle will be purchased.</narrative>
