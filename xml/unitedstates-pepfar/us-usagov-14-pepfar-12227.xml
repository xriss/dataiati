TSMP&#x2019;s objectives are to scale up access to socially marketed male and female condoms and water purification products, improve understanding of public health issues and correct product use; and measurably increase the sales and use of health products.  TSMP operates nationwide, targeting higher-risk populations, including young urban men, vulnerable women who engage in transactional sex, and PLHIV.  Behavioral outcomes that will be measured include changes in the percentage of the target population reporting condom use at last sex; and the percentage of target population that has ever tried a female condom.  Gender considerations are taken into consideration as a central concept in the planning and delivery of all interventions.  For sustainability, TSMP has focused on strengthening the capacity of local Tanzanian organizations to implement social marketing programs.  TSMP has also established substantive partnerships with civil, public and commercial sectors and donors to promote social marketing and contribute to wider public health impact.  The project supports PEPFAR/T and GHI strategies by increasing the uptake of preventive health services and product use.  TSMP maximizes cost efficiencies through cost-share and collaboration with activities funded under the Global Fund.  TSMP has a comprehensive M&amp;E plan with baselines, indicators and means of verification for all activities.  To become more cost efficient over time, since its inception, TSMP has been facilitating adjustments to how distributors buy, distribute and sell condoms - no longer subsidizing the process, but encouraging the market to undertake condom distribution as part of their normal business practices.  There has also been a reduction of cost per unit for condoms over time.
