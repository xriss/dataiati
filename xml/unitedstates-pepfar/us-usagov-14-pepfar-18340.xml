This is a TBD follow-on to IM 12313, with the Network of Networks of HIV Positives, and is scheduled to be awarded in April 2017.  Case management serves to ensure the optimal delivery of the full continuum of care services to PLHIV and will play an increasing role as Ethiopia adopts alternative service delivery models for stable patients who can receive ongoing ART through peer support groups with less frequent monitoring at facility level. Case management strengthens patients&#x2019; adherence to prescribed regimens, maximizing the benefit of their treatment for improved individual health outcomes and preventing further transmission of HIV, fosters positive living and reduces attrition of patients from care and treatment services. It promotes the identification and engagement of PLHIV by facilitating linkage of HIV patients to comprehensive HIV services and proactively supports disclosure, notification and linkage of PLHIV contacts and HIV-exposed children to HIV testing and counseling services within health facilities and in the community. Case management contributes to the 90-90-90 targets by enhancing anti-retroviral treatment (ART) coverage and optimal virologic outcomes, and plays a significant role in preventing the transmission of HIV.  Case managers (CMs) and adherence supporter (ASs) will provide ongoing disclosure support and linkage of all index cases during follow up visits until the disclosure and partner HIV testing and linkage for positive cases happens.  This IM will target geographic areas with the highest burden of diseas</narrative>
