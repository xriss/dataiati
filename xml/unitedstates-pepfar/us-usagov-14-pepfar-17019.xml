   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Anova Health Institute (Anova) leads HIV interventions for MSM through its Health4Men project, which aligns with the NSP and PEPFAR MSM strategies. The project institutionalizes MSM competence into public health systems in Gauteng, North West, Mpumalanga, Western Cape and Limpopo. It includes managing two MSM Centers of Excellence (COE) and a network of satellite sites. Anova works with the Department of Health (DOH) to sensitize, train and mentor public health workers at selected DOH sites, transferring knowledge and skills developed at the COEs. Regional leadership sites (RLS) serve as provincial hubs in Limpopo, Mpumalanga and North West. Optimal access to MSM competent care, support and treatment will produce better health outcomes. Anova&#x2019;s experience in MSM-community engagement addresses prevention and both linkage to, and retention in care. Anova&#x2019;s wide range of MSM-specific media products cover combination prevention, treatment and care, adherence, STIs and substance abuse. Anova utilizes mHealth for MSM to access information on cell phones and to post anonymous questions to doctors. CEOs and RLSs are embedded within DOH sites to limit costs, with a favorable cost share ratio. M&amp;E includes ongoing assessment of health workers&#x2019; competence by mentors, feedback from MSM groups, and an impact study according to DHIS standards. Sustainability is ensured by alignment to the NSP and active involvement of, and project integration within, all levels of DOH. The plan includes a 2-year period for complete transition with ongoing TA to DOH. Anova is partnered with PEPFAR supported projects (including DOH, UCSF and SWEAT) and is a member of the LGBTI sector of SANAC. A public-private partnership agreement is also being explored with the Elton John Aids Foundation.</narrative>
