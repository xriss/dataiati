The commodity management system is a weak link in the Ghanaian health sector, resulting in stock-outs or wastage of critical drugs that impedes performance of key programs including malaria, HIV/AIDs, and family planning. Building the capacity and performance of the Ghanaian Ministry of Health is a key priority within the Ghana Global Health Initiative Strategy and also one of the goals of Ghana&apos;s Partnership Framework which is to increase anti-retroviral treatment (ART) coverage from 30% to 60%. The USG is a major advocate for procurement and supply chain streamlining. The GOG and other development partners recognize and appreciate the USG role in this effort.  There is new interest of the GOG in making major changes in its system to improve performance, so the USG will continue to engage strongly in this effort, including using lessons from the private sector to encourage the implementation of a national plan to reform the structures and modalities of the procurement and supply system.

Through DELIVER, the USG provides long term, in-country technical assistance to the different agencies in supply chain management, with specific components funded by PEPFAR leveraging other investments from population, malaria and nutrition funding streams.  The TA is designed to strengthen national capacity in forecasting, managing, monitoring and reporting on use of program commodities.  Beyond these key functions, the USG-provided TA also is a trusted GOG partner in advocacy, strategic planning and coordination efforts across the different agencies involved in the system.  DELIVER embarks on quarterly commodity stock monitoring to ensure product availability and update supply plans (pipeline databases) for key health commodities to partners.
