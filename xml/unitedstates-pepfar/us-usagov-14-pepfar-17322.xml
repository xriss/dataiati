The FY 2014 COP will support a district level, integrated and multi-sectoral approach to GBV prevention and response that leverages the existing HIV platforms. This approach will engage a broad range of sectors and entities including NGOs, community-based organizations and GoB partners and the response to GBV will cut across health, education, legal, psychosocial, policy, child protection, and soc

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The FY 2014 COP will support a district level, integrated and multi-sectoral approach to GBV prevention and response that leverages the existing HIV platforms. This approach will engage a broad range of sectors and entities including NGOs, community-based organizations and GoB partners and the response to GBV will cut across health, education, legal, psychosocial, policy, child protection, and social welfare issues. The focus districts are Mochudi and Ngamiland where partners will be engaged in supporting a comprehensive GBV approach and will coordinate and establish linkages that facilitate dialogue among all partners. An operations research study is planned to capture lessons learned during implementation that will inform the adaptation, strengthening and scale-up to other districts across the country in 2015 and 2016. Currently, GBV experts from MEASURE Evaluation III are working with the Gender Affairs Department (GAD) to develop an M&amp;E plan to track implementation of the referral system in the two pilot districts. As continuation, FY 2014 COP funds will provide technical assistance (TA) to GAD, the Department of Social Protection, the MOH, NACA and other district-level stakeholders to refine and improve data collection and reporting related to GBV. TA will support data coordination among GBV key players. In addition, TA will be provided to the PEPFAR team for interagency data quality assessments. There are no plans to fund this activity beyond the FY 2014 COP as sustainability measures already have been set, i.e., MOH officials are able to carry out the activity on their own and, where needed, TA will be provided by USG Program Managers. Standard operating procedures and manuals will be developed to help orientate all new Program Managers.</narrative>
