   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The goal of this follow-on implementing mechanism (IM) is to strengthen the human and organizational capacity of local institutions in the field of adult and pediatric emergency medicine, OB-GYN residency program, and biomedical engineering and technology as important components for health systems strengthening. The objectives of include the following activities:
1)	Continue twinning partnerships with medical and/or health science universities abroad to build local institutional capacity
2)Mobilize highly skilled Diaspora and in-country professionals to join the pool of faculty for the New Medical Education Initiative (NMEI) to strengthen the capacity of numerous new medical institutions to deliver high quality pre- and in-service medical and health science education. Work both nationally and regionally to target medical schools, healthcare service providers, and pre-service medical and health science education graduates.
Note this IM includes a Green Light Incentive Fund proposal for the biomedical engineering portion of the IM, which has been included as a Supplemental Document. The Incentive Fund would provide $250,000; GE, the private sector partner, would contribute $450,000 in-kind 
These are core PEPFAR activities that directly contribute to saving lives and preventing new infections. This follow-on IM&#x2019;s program supports the goals of the GOE&apos;s National Strategic Plan II (SPMII) and is closely aligns with the goals of USG HIV/AIDS Partnership Framework and Global Health Initiative. This follow-on IM will monitor each individual partner through their own established work and M&amp;E plan, will track outcomes across partnerships working in similar technical areas, and will conduct regular evaluations measuring the overall outcomes related to its goal.</narrative>
