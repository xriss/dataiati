   <narrative xml:lang="EN">USAID has supported Human Resources for Health (HRH) in Uganda via the Uganda Capacity Program since September 2009. The proposed mechanism &#x2018;Strengthening HRH&#x2019; will build on the current project and continue interventions shown to produce results, with full support to pre-service training at a total estimated cost of $23 million over 5 years from July 1, 2014. This activity will strengthen capacities of central ministries, district local governments, professional councils, faith-based medical bureaus and health training institutions to effectively and efficiently plan and manage the health work force for improved HIV/AIDS services. Expected outcomes include: 1) National policies and strategic plans developed and implemented to support recruitment, equitable deployment and retention of health workers (HW); 2) Country capacity strengthened for effective management of HW performance at all levels; and 3) Improved quality of pre-service training in health training institutions. This mechanism is key to improving HRH in Uganda and will provide Government of Uganda (GoU) entities and health stakeholders with technical support to ensure implementation of a standard HRH package in all districts. The project will coordinate ongoing PEPFAR recruitment and secondment of 1200 HW and work towards increased GoU/Ministry of Health (MoH) ownership of and responsibility for key HRH interventions. A midterm performance evaluation for potential course correction and an end term evaluation to measure impact will be carried out by independent evaluators. This mechanism anticipates leveraging $1 million per year from other USAID health funds and collaborates with donor projects, notably the World Bank Health Sector Strengthening Project, Global Fund HSS grant for Uganda and other donors.</narrative>
