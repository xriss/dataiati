   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Global Health Supply Chain Project (GHSCP) was established to ensure a secure, reliable, cost-effective and sustainable supply chain to meet the care and treatment of PLHAs or those affected by HIV/AIDS. In Uganda, GHSCP provides procurement services to serve sites supported by USAID IPs, and working in close coordination with MOH, National Medical Stores and Global Fund Principal Recipients. In COP16 USG aims to ensure that all private and public sector sites providing HIV/AIDS services have sufficient HIV commodities. GHSCP contributes to GHI principles 3 and 4: &#x201C;Build sustainability through health systems strengthening&#x201D; and &#x201C;Strengthen and leverage key multilateral organizations, global health partnerships and private sector engagement&#x201D;. With FY16 budget of $118.3M, GHSCP will procure ARVs for private-not-for-profit health facilities supported by USAID and public sector gap fill of ARVs and Cotrimoxazole, lab commodities for CD4 and VL, HIV test kits. GHSCP products, quantities and delivery schedules will be based on supply plans developed for the private and public sectors with MOH. USG is supports and works closely with the Commodity Security group for information sharing and supply monitoring. Joint Medical Store will warehouse and distribute the commodities to USAID-designated private sector sites and National Medical Stores will warehouse and distribute directly to public sector sites. USG will continue to support the Central Public Health Laboratory with both reagents and technical assistance as they move to their new premises. In FY16 GHSCP will establish their presence in the country as SCMS transitions out. Cost efficiency measures already in place include procurement of generics, transport by sea and land wherever possible. No vehicle will be purchased.</narrative>
