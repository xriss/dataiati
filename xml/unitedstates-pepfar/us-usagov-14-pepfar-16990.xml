   <narrative xml:lang="EN">CINDI aims to improve the lives of OVC by providing a comprehensive range of services in 42 high schools in high prevalence districts in KwaZulu-Natal Province including school-based HIV education and HIV Counseling and Testing (HCT) and intensive household-level attention for children who are most vulnerable. Additionally,  teachers develop key skills and schools develop systems to address vulnerability in their communities as a result of the program. Intensive household-level attention through home visits by a trained child care worker will be provided for children that require this support. Their needs and those of their caregivers are assessed and then support, referral and follow-up services ensure that the child has greater access to services. This program is implemented by three sub-partnersCCP; Lifeline; and, YFC.  CCP focuses on household-based services, psychosocial and livelihood support services; Lifeline provides HCT at schools that includes sexuality and HIV education in individual counseling sessions and provides professional psychological counseling, as needed; YFC delivers HIV education at schools and focuses on household-based support to OVC.  All sub-partners use a standardized referral system using a standard tracking procedure.  This innovative evidence-based program also addresses GBV issues and shift traditional gender roles. Future Families has a database that is utilized to collate and aggregate data for analysis, helping to track progress and improve programming as necessary. Internal data quality audits are performed on a quarterly basis.  CINDI will develop a transition and sustainability plan in the next month.</narrative>
