   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The goal of the cooperative agreement with the NODH is to implement evidence-based public health programs, surveillance and disease control, and prevention activities. PEPFAR funds will support the NDOH to incorporate results of program evaluations into operational disease prevention and control programs, ensure the sharing of expertise and lessons learned nationally, regionally and internationally, and use the results to develop science-based health policies and guidelines. Funds will be used to pay for staff to implement the vision of the PFIP. CDC activities will be integrated within NDOH operational plans for HIV and TB prevention, care, treatment, strategic information, laboratory systems strengthening, and health systems strengthening. PEPFAR-funded activities include staff, pre-service and in-service training, development of guidelines and tools, and surveys (e.g. TB and DHS). Geographic coverage is national, supporting activities in all nine provinces. Target population varies across activities, but largely focuses on DOH staff from facility level to national. Since the activities supported through the coag are not service delivery as such, the question on cost-efficiency is not relevant as such. As PEPFAR funding decreases, the NDOH will have to budget for ongoing costs. Many of the activities are once off and would not require ongoing funding. M&amp;E of NDOH supported activities has been a challenge. The NDOH will be hiring staff to specifically support programs in strengthening their M&amp;E plans for supported activities. Several activities do have plans such as the progress in the roll out of the Tier ART. NDOH has significant pipeline, which is why little FY 14 funds have been budgeted.</narrative>
