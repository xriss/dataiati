   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The main goal of the Targeted HIV/AIDS Lab Services (THALAS) program is to increase access to, coverage of, and utilization of quality comprehensive HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis care and treatment services; provide advanced HIV/AIDS care and treatment services for complicated cases referred from other HIV/AIDS care and treatment providers; and provide HIV diagnosis and monitoring services including viral load (VL) testing and DNA PCR for early infant diagnosis (EID). The EID service has been fully transitioned to Central Public Health Laboratories (CPHL). THALAS provides clinical care and adult and pediatric ART services. The project also provides HIV/AIDS routine laboratory monitoring and VL testing for patients. THALAS trains lab staff in manual and automated testing techniques and resident mentors at regional referral and general hospitals enhance delivery of quality services. THALAS supports resident mentors through THALAS preceptor mentors and laboratory quality improvement (QI) teams. THALAS supports capacity building and provides technical assistance for Ministry of Health (MoH) laboratories that enhance quality of lab services. THALAS will continue to scale up HIV/AIDS care and treatment services, implement the revised MoH treatment guidelines, support national laboratory QI practices, and support MoH/CPHL in scaling up lab quality management practices through SLMTA/SLIPTA approaches. The mechanism&apos;s current end date is June 2015, but it will be extended until June 2016.</narrative>
