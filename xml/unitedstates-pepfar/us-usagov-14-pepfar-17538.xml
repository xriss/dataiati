   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Community Response supports the objectives of the National Strategic Plan (NSP), namely, addressing social and structural drivers of HIV and preventing new HIV infections.  The development hypothesis underlying the design of the program is that the objectives will be achieved if: communities are strengthened to lead and sustain HIV prevention and SGBV responses relevant to their specific, local context.  Such interventions should reduce risky sexual behaviors and increase use of proven, high-impact prevention interventions.  Ultimately, the adoption of HIV prevention practices and behaviors is expected to contribute to a sustained reduction in new infections in targeted areas. The program will support local communities in assuming ownership and scaling-up HIV prevention responses adapted to their own unique situations.   The program will integrate community responses to SGBV into HIV prevention efforts, while also addressing links with SGBV servicesEnhancing HIV and SGBV prevention will build on linkages and referrals to services and support organizations as well as integrating local HIV and SGBV leadership structures into the response.  Priority focal areas include: delay of sexual debut; intergenerational sex; alcohol and drug abuse ;dual protection; HIV counseling and testing; maternal and child health; and, VMMC.  Target audiences are males and females aged 13-34.The coverage is identified districts based on priority geographic areas yet to be finalized with the SAG.  Implementing partners will be responsible for monthly, quarterly and annual monitoring and reporting.  It is anticipated that as community leaders are capacitated to own the programs, they can be transitioned to communities.</narrative>
