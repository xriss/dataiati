   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The BroadReach Healthcare (BRHC) program seeks to achieve the following objectives in support of SAG: 1) improve HIV and TB-related patient outcomes; 2) build capacity of facility, sub-district &amp; district mgmt teams in coordination with provinces to strengthen health systems in support of HIV interventions; and, 3) support development &amp; implementation of SAG policies for HIV-related interventions. These objectives and all TA delivered will be aligned to the USG-SAG PFIP, NSP, NSDA, PHC Re-engineering, NCS and NHI objectives. The BRHC Team supports the following districts: Joe Gqabi &amp; Alfred Nzo (EC), Sedibeng (GP), Ugu &amp; uThungulu (KZN), and Gert Sibande (MP), covering a total target population of 4,817,250.
BRHC&#x2019;s implementation approach capacitates SAG to strengthen &amp; expand leadership in the delivery of HIV/TB-related services, thus reducing program costs over the life of the project. The targeted mentorship, TA &amp; supportive supervision provided by BRHC will transition rapidly to SAG staff and this transition will be monitored through the use of jointly agreed implementation and monitoring plans. This approach leverages the BRHC Team&#x2019;s technical expertise across 6 districts to deliver scalability and sustainability while ensuring cost efficiencies. TA is focused at the district level but extends to province &amp; national levels to support advancement of key national initiatives.
BRHC&#x2019;s M&amp;E strategy will track results achieved at all levels providing the basis for: monitoring patient &amp; district outcomes; monitoring performance &amp; program quality; data quality management, reporting, dissemination and use; strengthening M&amp;E capacity at district, sub-district and facility levels; and, measuring program effects in the achievement of program, USAID &amp; SAG objectives.</narrative>
