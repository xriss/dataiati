   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The objective of this award is to increase the availability and use of high quality data so as to inform community health and social service policy, planning and decision-making.  This goal directly supports the GOT priority to improve its capacity to monitor and use appropriate information for planning and decision-making.  It also directly aligns with the Partnership Framework/GHI Strategy objective to strengthen the delivery of healthcare services.

At the national level, the program will focus its efforts to build the monitoring and evaluation (M&amp;E) capacity of the national ministries, departments, and agencies (MDAs) that guide delivery of community social services.  Program beneficiaries may include the Departments of Social Welfare (Mainland and Zanzibar), Ministry of Community Development, Gender and Children, and the National AIDS Control Programme.  The majority of the work will, however, focus on strengthening sub-national institutions (i.e. region and below) to ensure that stakeholders at service delivery points progressively improve planning and increase evidence-based decision making to adequately respond to local health needs. The program will achieve this objective through: 1) Increased M&amp;E capacity of ministries, departments, and agencies that guide community health and social service programs; 2) Increased M&amp;E capacity of local government and civil society health providers; and 3) Increased community care and support evidence base through health research conducted by researchers associated with Tanzanian institutions.

This mechanism is focused on technical assistance, and will become more cost efficient over time by undertaking self-assessment and revising its activities where necessary.</narrative>
