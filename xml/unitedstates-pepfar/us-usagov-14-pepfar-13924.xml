The goal of the Production for Improved Nutrition (PIN) 5-year project is to reduce the burden of under-nutrition in Uganda by strengthening the capacity of a local company to become a sustainable certified manufacturer and distributor of therapeutic and supplementary foods to meet national and/or regional standards and demands. The specific project objectives include: provide technical support to an indigenous, private food manufacturing organization to improve its financial management systems, marketing, food production quality control, human resource management, and supply chain management for the distribution of therapeutic and supplementary foods; provide livelihood empowerment for at least 80,000-150,000 small scale farmers located in rural districts, who will supply the raw materials for the production of therapeutic and supplementary foods; and support households with malnourished, critical and moderately vulnerable children in 4 selected districts. Through the PIN Project, Ready-to-Use Therapeutic Food (RUTF) and fortified blended flours (FBF) will be provided through 130 health facilities spread throughout the country, targeting moderate and acutely malnourished individuals with a particular focus on children, pregnant and lactating women and people living with HIV/AIDS that are moderately and severely malnourished. RUTF is now included on the essential medicines list of the Government of Uganda (GoU). Transitioning the distribution of RUTF and FBF to existing supply chain mechanisms, technical support and mentoring of health service providers will ensure sustainability.
