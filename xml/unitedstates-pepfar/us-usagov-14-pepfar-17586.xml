   <narrative xml:lang="EN">PQM will help assure to the quality and safety of priority essential medicines in Indonesia by strengthening the capacity of the MOH&#x2019;s Food and Drug Administration to test and monitor the quality of post-production medicines, and better manage the growing challenge posed by substandard and counterfeit medicines.  As the MOH implements a policy for Strategic Use of ARV  (SUFA) for a selected 75 districts over the next three years, it is crucial to ensure that the medicines for HIV and Opportunistic Infections, from the central warehouse (national level) to district level health facilities, maintain a consistent high quality that is verified throughout the supply chain.  This effort builds on similar work funded by USAID&#x2019;s TB program.

US Pharmacopeia will work with health facilities and warehouses at selected districts in Jakarta, East Java, North Sumatra, Papua and West Papua to ensure the medicines stored at their facilities are of high quality.  PQM will convene routine multi-stakeholder meetings and continue to foster public-private partnerships. 

Activities to improve the drug quality in Indonesia will, in turn, help to improve health system strengthening at the National, Provincial and District levels through support to strengthen surveillance systems and monitoring tools and utilization of evidence collected from these systems to positively impact GOI programming and policies.  PQM will support Indonesia to participate in ASEAN efforts to strengthen and harmonize pharmaceutical technical requirements for registration, GMP audits and bioavailability and bioequivalence testing.  PQM will work closely with by JSI DELIVER, which provides complimentary support to the health care system through efficient shipment of essential medicines and prevention of stock-outs.</narrative>
