   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Established in 2008, the Community Grants Program aims to better meet the needs of small, grassroots organizations in Kenya seeking support for HIV/AIDS affected communities. These grants are designed to provide one-year assistance to grassroots, community-run projects that work toward HIV prevention and provide care and support to adults and children affected by HIV &amp; AIDS.  The program aims to strengthen community level responses to HIV and contributes to broadening support for basic health care and support in HBHC and OVC program areas. CGP provides opportunity to develop local organizational capacity to handle future funding from USG and other donors, and transfers more responsibility to manage resources and project activities to local organizations, most of which are led by women. The program aims at enhancing the quality of life of OVC and to reach as many people as possible with HIV prevention or effective home and community-based care through local organizations and rural communities that can sustain these projects after the grant period.  
In 2014, PCGP will continue to focus on projects that seek to improve and expand community awareness about, and referrals to health facilities and that focus on reduction of barriers that prevent communities from accessing health care and living healthy lives through education, improved food security, economic empowerment and information.  The program will specifically support community-level interventions that support PMTCT as well as HIV testing and referral to treatment of HIV+ children.  PCGP will enhance linkages with relevant host government departments from national to community level and other players in the area of care and support in order to identify the best organizations.</narrative>
