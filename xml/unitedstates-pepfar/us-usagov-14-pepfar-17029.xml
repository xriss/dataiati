   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Witkoppen Health and Welfare Centre (WHWC) is an integrated health and welfare facility in the northern suburbs of Johannesburg, which offers a variety of programs in response to the needs of our beneficiaries, most of whom live in informal settlements. 
The HIV/AIDS program at WHWC started in 1996 in response to a need of our beneficiaries who were very ill and dying in the communities. USAID funding for this program was first received in 2004, through Right to Care. This program, entitled: &#x201C;Innovative Approaches to Integrated Primary Health Care for Marginalized, At-Risk Populations in Informal Settlements in Urban South Africa,&#x201D; has two goals: to build capacity and support for scale-up of effective and efficient models for HIV-related services in line with SAG priorities; and, to develop, evaluate, scale-up, and institutionalize innovations to inform SAG strategies for improving treatment outcomes among key populations such as pregnant women, infants, children, adolescents, people residing in informal settlements, and those who are HIV/TB co-infected. The objectives of the program are: to provide interim primary care, support, and referral services to residents of informal settlements, targeting an under-serviced population; to increase DOH service-delivery capacity in the WHWC catchment area; to implement effective cost efficient innovative approaches to integrate primary care for HIV and TB/HIV; to inform DOH on the evaluation findings; and, to inform SAG policy to facilitate the introduction of National Health Insurance. WHWC conducts operational research to inform the health sector nationally and internationally on effective and cost efficient innovations and institutionalizes such strategies.</narrative>
