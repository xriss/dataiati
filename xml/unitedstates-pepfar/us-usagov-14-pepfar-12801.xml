Strengthening Decentralization for Sustainability (SDS) is now in its fourth year of implementation. Following the PEPFAR pivots in COP12, the scope of some of SDS&apos;s support increased to cover over 61 districts, up from 35. SDS focuses on strengthening local government capacity in districts for improved delivery of HIV services, as well as other non-PEPFAR related services including maternal, neonatal, &amp; child health (MNCH). The project provides technical assistance on health systems strengthening (HSS), and supports service delivery for HIV care, treatment, other prevention and orphans and other vulnerable children (OVC) programming. HSS interventions focus on leadership and governance; recruitment, secondment and management of health workers and other systems issues for human resources for health (HRH); strategic information; and financial management systems. In addition, SDS provides performance-based grants for service delivery to 35 districts annually. In the past Fiscal Year (FY), SDS awarded grants to support district capacity building &amp; operational costs linked to Option B+, adult &amp; pediatric care &amp; treatment services, TB/HIV and waste management. SDS is designed to work directly with United States Government (USG) implementing partners that provide support for direct service delivery, including the STAR programs in 3 regions, to complement their services using catalytic grant funds to districts. The program also works with line ministries including health &amp; local government, gender, social development &amp; education to ensure alignment and harmonization of activities to national policies and guidelines within the districts where they operate. In the last FY, SDS&#x2019; engagement with civil society &amp; private sector were initiated; this is expected to continue in COP14.
