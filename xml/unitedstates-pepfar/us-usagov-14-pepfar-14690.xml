Selian Lutheran Hospital is a local faith-based organization that provides comprehensive integrated HIV/AIDS services to PLHIV within the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Tanzania (ELCT) health facilities network in the Northern Diocese of Arusha and Manyara regions.  The PEPFAR-supported program covers 42 wards in four districts.  This program is aligned with the first Partnership Framework goal of focusing on service maintenance and scale up and with the GHI Strategy objective to build capacity of local actors for sustainable country ownership.  Selian will continue to provide high quality comprehensive and sustainable clinical and community based HIV/AIDS services.  The program will increase client access to ART treatment, care and support, PMTCT option B+, counseling and testing services, home based care (HBC), care for orphans and vulnerable children (OVC), TB/HIV services, cervical cancer screening, and family planning, and reproductive health services.  The full array of services will be offered at Selian&#x2019;s four largest facilities and by collaborating with other PEPFAR/T partners, local organizations and government systems in their regions program linkages and efficiencies will be achieved.  Selian will improve the technical and managerial capacity of facilities and community-based programs in its network.  The Selian M&amp;E system is aligned with the National AIDS Control Programme&#x2019;s M&amp;E Framework, which includes monthly and quarterly data aggregation and analysis.
