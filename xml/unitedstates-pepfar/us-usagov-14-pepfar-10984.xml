PCI will strengthen the capacity of six ZDF facilities to provide life-long triple Antiretroviral Therapy (ART) regardless of CD4 count and clinical staging to all HIV positive pregnant women, HIV positive partners in serodicordant couples, children and adolescents below 15 years of age.   PCI will foster strategic local partnerships and will leverage local resources to strengthen DFMS&#x2019; commodity management, laboratory, quality assurance, and community systems, and human resource capacity to enable the delivery of quality and sustainable services.   PCI will support ZDF to engage health and community cadres and integrate mobile technology to increase access to early HIV testing and treatment and retention in care among infants, adolescents, men, and pregnant women.  PCI will support ZDF to build a robust system to track clients&#x2019; retention in care overtime.  PCI will continue to support ZDF to implement behavioral and gender based violence (GBV) prevention interventions targeted at the military personnel, youths and the civilian populations in and around ZDF units and will strengthen linkages between behavioral and biomedical interventions.  PCI will support ZDF to implement economic empowerment and social protection programs for communities and families to strengthen their capacity to care for OVC.  PCI will continue to promote ownership of the program by ZDF, by strengthening and mentoring the ZDF HIV/AIDS Secretariat to take a lead in program implementation.</narrative>
