   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Association Public Health Laboratories (APHL) has diverse expertise to support HHS/CDC including strategic planning for national laboratory networks, implementing laboratory information management systems (LIMS), and providing US-based and in-country advanced training for laboratory professionals. 
In PEPFAR supported countries, the three-year strategic plan for APHL activities include core training initiatives that support laboratory strengthening, and country-specific action plans. APHL activities build sustainable capacity through training of trainers and developing indigenous capacity at ministries of health to manage laboratory projects.
