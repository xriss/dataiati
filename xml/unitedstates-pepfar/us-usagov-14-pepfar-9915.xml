The American Society of Microbiology (ASM) is a life science society composed of over 42,000 scientists and health professionals. ASM&apos;s mission is to promote research and training in microbiological sciences and to assist communication between scientists, policy makers and the public to improve health, economic well-being and the environment. ASM goals are to develop and package training tools usi
Funds allocated for Program Element HL.1.12: Laboratory Infrastructure. Development and strengthening of laboratory systems and facilities to support HIV/AIDSrelated activities including purchase of equipment and commodities and provision of quality assurance, staff training and other technical assistance.
Funds allocated for Program Element HL.1.7: TB/HIV. Includes exams, clinical monitoring, related laboratory services, treatment and prevention of tuberculosis (including medication), as well as screening and referral of TB clinic clients for HIV testing and clinical care.

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The American Society of Microbiology (ASM) is a life science society composed of over 42,000 scientists and health professionals. ASM&apos;s mission is to promote research and training in microbiological sciences and to assist communication between scientists, policy makers and the public to improve health, economic well-being and the environment. ASM goals are to develop and package training tools using new and existing resources through a consensus approach; monitor and evaluate progress and impact to identify best practices and create sustainability at national levels through quality assured programs and work with in-country partners. ASM has worked with Ministry of Health (MOH) to strengthen the microbiology network and establish an external quality assurance (EQA) program for acid fast bacilli (AFB) microscopy. ASM mentors staff at different facilities and enables them to run the program themselves by training trainers in different microbiology disciplines. This ensures sustainability once PEPFAR funding ends. ASM&apos;s approach to strengthening lab capacity includes insuring countries have ownership of the programs they develop, as they are ultimately responsible for implementing them; establishing South-to-South collaborations involving sharing of evaluated, culturally appropriate, highly effective strategies and programs and encouraging South-to-North collaborations to strengthen the cadre of highly competent microbiologist mentors. 
ASM work covers all laboratories that are doing microbiology and TB in the country. TB/HIV is a priority for GoB, as outlined in the TB and Laboratory Strategic Plans. ASM submits annual reports to CDC and also conducts periodic visits to monitor implementation.</narrative>
