   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The goal is to build capacity of MOH to effectively coordinate HIV/AIDS prevention, care and treatment programs.  The objective is to strengthen the capacity within the MOH to support activities such as laboratory diagnostic and monitoring support to scale up TB and HIV care and treatment services and continuous quality improvement of services.  Implementation covers national and facility based services to enable MOH to provide continuous guidance, monitor scale-up, and meet targets.  
This mechanism is Government-to-Government support to increase overall effectiveness and efficiency for the MOH to deliver grants for sustainable development and improve its compliance.  These activities are aligned with the PFIP and GHI principles and with the National HIV/AIDS strategic plan.  Increased capacity of MOH will enable it to meet the ambitious goals set by the Government of Lesotho such as reduction of new HIV infections by 50% by 2015, eMTCT, reduction of TB/HIV mortality, and improvement in the efficiency and effectiveness of service delivery.  

 In FY15 and FY16, most of the funding allocated in this project will be primarily supplement the procurement of HIV/TB diagnostics and monitoring supplies, minor equipment and related logistic support to ensure laboratory monitoring services are provided to TB and HIV/AIDS care and treatment programs. 
 
This is a TBD mechanism, which is a follow up the current cooperative agreement project. The emphasis in the project included lab monitoring commodities, strengthening the national laboratory system, referral networking and increasing access to quality services.  The outlays and pipelines will not be available prior to the award of COP14 budget.</narrative>
