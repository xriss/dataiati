   <narrative xml:lang="EN">UNICEF is an international organization that has been working with the MOHSW to scale up the &#x201C;mother-to-mother support group&#x201D; model for HIV+ pregnant women.  The model uses the Maternal and Newborn Child Health (MNCH) services platform to increase enrollment, adherence and retention.  In previous COPs the focus was in the high burden regions of Njombe, Iringa, Ruvuma, and Dar es Salaam.  Under 2014-15 COPs, UNICEF will focus on national technical assistance, shifting from service delivery to provision of strategic direction and technical guidance and support in the following areas: PMTCT, EID, pediatric HIV care and treatment, and reduction of and response to violence against children.  

In line with the GHI and PEPFAR Blueprint, UNICEF will focus on development, review, and adaptation of national HIV policies and guidelines.  UNICEF will provide technical guidance to MOHSW and its Pediatric Care and Treatment and PMTCT programs to develop and ensure implementation of program-specific regional strategic plans.  Additionally, UNICEF will coordinate with other organizations to provide TA on improving the national M&amp;E system.  
Recognizing that coordination and skill sharing among HCWs and experts in pediatric HIV and PMTCT is critical to achieve eMTCT goals, UNICEF will collaborate with MOHSW to facilitate PMTCT and pediatric HIV stakeholders&#x2019; meetings and to disseminate program updates and best practices.  This IM will monitor proposed activities through quarterly reviews, coordination of stakeholder meetings, and review of progress with UNICEF.

UNICEF&#x2019;s FY 2013 EA DSP UEs were reviewed and found comparable to similar partners; expenditures reported were in line with programmatic priorities and approved budgets.</narrative>
