   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Ambassadors Small Grants Fund for HIV/AIDS (ASGF) run by State serves as an opportunity to engage small indigenous organizations the Malawi PEPFAR program may miss through other USG programs. The ASGF serves to address pressing interventions particularly for HIV/AIDS prevention and care and support to People with Disabilities (PWDs), including Children with Disabilities and their parents who are affected by HIV or who live in the high HIV prevalence area. Malawi has approximately 500,000 People with Disabilities and their access in HIV services is low. The projects should (1) Guarantee disabled people&#x2019;s equitable access to HIV prevention, treatment and care services; or (2) Increase disabled people&#x2019;s access to and control of strategic and protective health, social and economic assets which assist in preventing and mitigating the effect of HIV/AIDS.  Under oversight of Ambassador, the PEPFAR office at State manages the ASGF, through annual new solicitation, selection and awarding of the grant recipients, monitoring and reporting during the SAPR and APR. Grant recipients will be selected through competitive process using predefined criteria. Eventhough PWDs are spread throughout the country, applicants from rural areas will be prioritized. Grants will be one-time contribution of $10,000 for their community program, not for the staff salary or major admin cost. Grant recipients submit quarterly financial and technical reports, which will be supplemented by semi-annual visits by PEPFAR office. As the projects are on one year cycle, any pipelines will be used for the following grants cycle.</narrative>
