   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Muhimbili University College of Health and Allied Sciences (MUHAS) is a leading parastatal partner that focuses on delivering pre-service training in universities and public health institutions.  MUHAS provides advanced public health education at SPHSS by enhancing curricula in Master&#x2019;s degree programs and continuing education, recruiting and training faculty, developing and strengthening key partnerships, and creating a realistic sustainability plan to support SPHSS public health education and research goals.  Priorities and focused activities are aligned with the National HIV/AIDS Strategic Plan, GHI and the PEPFAR Blueprint.  

With PEPFAR support, MUHAS has increased student enrollment and has expanded their master&#x2019;s program to offer 10 public health program tracks and enhanced curriculum development for faculty.  MUHAS will continue to implement health system strengthening strategies to support a local and sustainable response to HIV and other critical public health issues in Tanzania.  These efforts are aimed at improving the capacity to train public health specialists, conduct locally relevant research, and play a leadership role in training and research.

The improvements in public health education, research, and evaluation, through the combination of the expertise and resources of the MUHAS SPHSS, will support PEPFAR/T efforts to improve and increase the public health workforce in Tanzania to meet health care priorities, particularly in the areas of HIV and AIDS prevention and care.  MUHAS SPH activities are not measured with FY 2013 EA DSP UEs; however, expenditures reported were in line with programmatic priorities and approved budgets.</narrative>
