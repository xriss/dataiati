It will Develop clear messages on the role of IS &amp; HCWM in developing strong health systems including primary health care. This has been included in HSS components of GAVI and GF, and under the HSS strategic direction of the WHO/PEPFAR collaborative agreement. In FY14 &amp; 15 IS TBD will intervene in Benue, Cross River, Kaduna, Akwa Ibom, Lagos, Rivers, Nasarawa &amp; Federal Capital Territory as focus states while supporting USG treatment IPs across the country. IS TBD will collaborate with NPHCDA to support the decentralization efforts of PMTCT and ART in priority states. IS TBD will conduct TOT, to cascade capacity to all cadre of HCW, including messaging to promote greater male involvement in health as a strategy to improve PMTCT uptake. IS TBD will provide policy support to focal states. IS TBD will provide technical support to other PEPFAR treatment IPs on IS &amp; HCWM. The implementation of the National HCWM Policy will be prioritized. IS TBD will support formative research in focus states to characterize waste generation &amp; use the data to develop &amp; implement sustainable HCWM systems, which have a robust private sector component. IS TBD will use this avenue to grow the industry around HCWM as a means of attracting investment from the private sector.  Intervention planning, implementation and monitoring are coordinated with GON and other stakeholders to ensure sustainability of interventions &amp; cost effectiveness. IS TBD will work closely with GON at all levels of the health system to ensure sustainability and ownership. Support supervision will be a corner stone of the program as a strategy to enhance M&amp;E.</narrative>
