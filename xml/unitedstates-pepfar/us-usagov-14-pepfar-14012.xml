   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Academic Model Providing Access To Healthcare (AMPATH), with funding from USAID (AMPATHplus), is a collaboration between the Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital (Prime), Moi University, and a consortium of North American Academic Medical Centers led by Indiana University that supports the Ministry of Health (MoH) in providing comprehensive care services in eight counties in Western Kenya Region, to a catchment population of 3.5 million people.  The activities planned for year three will build on the achievements of the first two years of the program.  More emphasis will be put into recruiting patients and linking them to care.  AMPATHplus will devolve its functions more to the county level as the primary operational unit.  The program will strive to improve data collection and data ownership by having M&amp;E Officers work at the county level to do data quality at the facility Level.  A particular emphasis will be reducing the number of patients lost to follow up.  The AMRS, which is AMPATHplus&#x2019;s EMR, will be strengthened to be able to better provide higher quality data.  A yearly project monitoring plan will be developed and reviewed on a quarterly basis to ensure that targets are being met.  Expenditure analysis and programmatic data were used to determine unit costs for this program.</narrative>
