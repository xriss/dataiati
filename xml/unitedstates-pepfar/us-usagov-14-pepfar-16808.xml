   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This new cooperative agreement is intended to support the South African Department of Health (DOH) to provide effective clinical management for adult and pediatric patients with complicated HIV and HIV/TB treatment. 

The treatment management includes providing 2nd/3rd line and alternative antiretroviral treatment (ART) through funding; capacitating regional Centers for Advanced Clinical Management of HIV/AIDS; providing high quality referral or tertiary-level HIV and HIV/TB services; and supporting the development of sustainable capacity for effective management of patients with such needs at district level DOH facilities. While the cooperative agreement will support Regional Centers for Advanced Management of HIV/AIDS as referral facilities for more complicated cases, it will also support capacity building for the management of complicated patients at district level and strengthening of up/down referral systems. PEPFAR considers most of the need in this area to be for greater access to expert outpatient clinical management services for patients with complicated ART requirements. 

The costs of inpatient services are expected to be covered largely by the public sector. The costs of antiretroviral drugs for patients with complicated ART requirements are also not expected to be covered under this cooperative agreement. Support through this new cooperative agreement will be limited to three provinces (KwaZulu-Natal, Free State, and Eastern Cape) for the first two years of the program, but may subsequently be expanded to additional provinces based on identified need and availability of funding.</narrative>
