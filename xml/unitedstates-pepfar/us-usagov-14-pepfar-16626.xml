   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The USAID/Uganda Private Health Support Program (UPHS), awarded in June 2013, aims to strengthen, organize and mobilize the private sector to provide Ugandans with the option of obtaining high-quality health services from private for profit (PFP) providers. The program&apos;s goal is to improve the credibility and cohesiveness of the private sector and expand the capacity of private sector providers. The objectives are: a) Expand availability of health services by private providers; b) Increase affordability of private health services and products; and c) Improve quality of private health sector facilities and services. The program supports 120 private providers in approximately 44 districts of Uganda targeting clients of PFP facilities as well as workplace sites. To become more cost-effective and efficient over time, the program will conduct operational research throughout the life of the project to form the basis for continued learning. For example, UPHS will conduct a cost and pricing study to examine the cost drivers for providing health care in the private sector and help identify cost-reduction strategies that are market-based/contribute to reducing structural barriers. The program also supports a partnership model based on a 1:1 cost sharing basis with a gradual reduction of USAID input but sustaining quality service provision. Supported sites will be linked to Joint Medical Stores (JMS) and other suppliers for continued provision of medical supplies. Monitoring and evaluation activities include support to all antiretroviral therapy (ART) clinics to routinely manage data through Health Management Information System (HMIS) tool and integration of care and support information into the DHIS-II.</narrative>
