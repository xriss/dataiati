   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Foundation for Professional Development (FPD) is implementing a comprehensive Systems Strengthening TA model at the district and facility level.  The goal of FPD&#x2019;s Systems Strengthening (SS) TA model is to foster a public sector management culture that is based on effective leadership by professional managers committed to: providing integrated quality services based on SAG policy; using strategic information to guide decision making; and improving service quality and outcomes.  FPD&#x2019;s objectives are to: i) develop and inform strategies to help Districts realize the 10 Point Plan, NSP on HIV/AIDS, PHC Re-Engineering Strategy, NHI and the Minister of Health&#x2019;s NSDA in line with the PFIP; ii) support district management to draft, implement and monitor progress against District Health Plans, related plans and expenditure reviews; iii) support districts to achieve and maintain targeted levels of performance for PEPFAR&#x2019;s priority areas, in particular TB/HIV and MCH.  Geographic coverage includes Tshwane (GP), Nkangala (MP), Capricorn and Vhembe (LP).   The target population includes district management teams (DMT), facility managers, HCW, and the uninsured public (est. 5,122,683). Primary investment will be mentoring and strengthening management systems with scale-back of TA once processes are adopted and ingrained.  FPD will ensure successful transition to SAG by: involving DMT in the conceptualization, planning and implementation of SS TA in the districts and negotiating roles and responsibilities regarding program milestones, sustainability measures and transition timelines. Key outcomes include: increased DMT capacity; improved health expenditure in line with approved budget; increased health systems efficiency; and improved program performance and health outcomes.</narrative>
