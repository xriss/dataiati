   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Ambassador&apos;s HIV/AIDS Relief Fund (AHRF) funds small projects that provide care and support to assist individuals and communities affected by HIV and AIDS, especially orphans and vulnerable children, and people living with HIV and AIDS. As such, the AHRF makes immediate contributions to Goal 1 of the Partnership Framework to improve the quality of life for PLHIV and those affected by HIV and AIDS. The longer term effects of these projects go toward GHI IR 2.4 for improved health support systems and IR 3.3 for strengthened social norms and structural environment for the empowerment of women and girls. To support these goals, small grants ranging from $5,000 to $30,000 can fund the gamut of projects, such as the procurement of materials and goods, infrastructural development, and start-up capital for income generating activities. Project details such as geographic coverage are not available at this time, since review, approval, and selection of projects take place during the COP implementation period. The Grants Coordinator convenes a selection committee once or twice a year made up of members from throughout the USG mission. The committee assesses applications based on their relevance to the overall objectives of the AHRF, in addition to considerations of budget reasonableness and price efficiencies, community contribution and sustainability, applicant references, and project location in regions of Tanzania that are underserved by other USG or other foreign assistance programs. Grantees, all of whom are local organizations, are required to submit regular progress reports to the  Grants Coordinator. In addition, the Grants Coordinator, as well as other members of the USG Mission, make site visits to evaluate project implementation and completion.</narrative>
