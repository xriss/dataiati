   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Mekele University (MU) is a GOE partner providing higher education in Tigray region. Urban HIV prevalence in the Tigray region is 3.1%. MU has opened confidential STI/HIV clinic for sex workers in Mekele and Adigrat towns. The goal of this program is to provide regular STI screening, promotion and dissemination of condoms and HCT services, linkages with the continuum of care including ART to sex workers. This follow-on IM will continue to support the two confidential sex workers STI clinics. The goal of this follow-on implementing mechanism (IM) is to provide training and technical assistance to improve HIV service delivery. The objectives are:
1) Strengthen medical pre-service training.
2) Collaborate with Tigray Regional Health Bureau (TRHB) to conduct the in-service training.
3) Collaborate with TRHB to provide technical support to MU Hospital in the area of HIV care and treatment. 
4) Support and expand the confidential sex workers clinics.

This is a core PEPFAR activity. It strengthens, promotes, and enables long-term sustainability of Ethiopia&#x2019;s academic institutions&#x2019; contributions as they relate to HIV/AIDS service delivery. It supports the goals of the GOE&apos;s National Strategic Plan II, and aligns with the goals of the GOE and USG HIV/AIDS Partnership Framework and the Global Health Initiative. 
	
This follow-on IM will have a system in place for routine performance monitoring and reporting. It will document best practices and analyze its performance data which will contribute to sustainability, and cost effectiveness.</narrative>
