   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Oxfam will support existing community structures, or establish a community -based social committee, composed of members from Internally Displaced Person (IDP) and host communities, where these committees should represent most vulnerable people &amp; groups such as (minority groups, internally displaced persons, women, marginalized groups and people with disabilities). In addition, 600 the most vulnerable people/House -Holds (HHs) and groups who will be targeted in Sadah  include the following: Women headed household, people living with disabilities, single heads of household, child -headed household and marginalized groups &#x2018;&apos;Muhamasheen&apos;&apos;, old people, IDPs and persons with chronic illness including mental health disorders: those groups are severely impacted by the ongoing conflict and they are at disproportionate risk during pandemics, as they suffer from hindered access to services and accurate information, often aggravated by stigmatization and arbitrary targeting as showed in needs assessment, and the findings of secondary sources and the primary sources.  Emergency Food security Livelihood (EFSVL): Oxfam will target 780 most vulnerable households in Majz district which are at high protection risk to reduce their vulnerability and increase their protection capacities by providing them with sustainable and safer livelihoods and income opportunities. The priority targets include Persons With Disabilities (PWD), minority groups &#x2018;&apos;Muhamasheen&apos;&apos;, persons with specific needs, female -headed households, vulnerable children exposed to neglect, abuse, violence and exploitation, or women and girls at risk, including child marriage</narrative>
