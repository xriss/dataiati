  <description>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Fair, Green and Global Alliance (FGG) aims to increase the power and decision-making influence of organised, mobilised and informed civil society, especially women, to advance fair and green trade and value chains. FGG believes that poverty, inequality and exclusion are caused by power asymmetries. We see the unprecedented power of capital over people and planet as the primary obstacle impeding realisation of fair and green trade and value chains. The FGG programme focuses on recalibrating power within the global architecture of trade and value chains by amplifying the voices of targeted rights-holders &#x2013;  small producers and traders, workers, fishers, rural and Indigenous peoples, religious and ethnic minorities, and migrants, especially the women and youth among them &#x2013; who are practising, claiming or defending human rights and fair and green economic practices, and/or whose rights are being ignored, threatened or violated by corporations and/or governments. We aim to transform social relations so that these rights-holders&#x2019; voices are heard and heeded. FGG&#x2019;s eight members (ActionAid, Both ENDS, Clean Clothes Campaign, IT for Change, Milieudefensie/Friends of the Earth International/Friends of the Earth Europe, Samdhana Institute, SOMO and the Transnational Institute) cooperate with some 1000+ partners and allies in our many worldwide networks to strengthen collective capacities to advance a common vision of fair and green trade and value chains.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">(3) Three big electronics companies (Apple, HP, Dell) committed to stop using nine priority hazardous chemicals in their supply chain. This commitment gives some leverage to civil society, trade unions and workers if they find out that the chemicals are still being used. This commitment followed work by the GoodElectronics network, which is hosted by SOMO.
The GoodElectronics (GE) network continued its lobby and advocacy at the Clean Electronics Production Network (CEPN). CEPN is a multi-stakeholder network (dominated by tech industry giants) working on protecting workers from exposure to toxic chemicals. GE has ongoing dialogue with CEPN and participates in periodic calls and working groups to bring in the perspective of civil society and trade unions.

(4) Following the publication of the Action Aid and SOMO report, &#x2018;Manganese matters; A metal of consequence for women and communities in South Africa affected by mining and the global energy transition&#x2019;, a three  companies from the renewable energy (Orsted, Vattengal, Eneco) and one from the steel (Tata) sector have recognised the negative impacts of manganese mining. They have made plans to do additional research and are exploring setting up a pilot project to address the social and environmental impacts of manganese mining. Conditions are still to be agreed but would likely involve local development and due diligence activities. 

(2) Following publication of SOMO&#x2019;s report &#x2018;Responsible disengagement from coal as part of a just transition&#x2019;, which focused on coal mining in Colombia, two mining companies (Drummond and Prodeco/Glencore) proposed to establish and fund a project to help approximately 5,000 local workers find new economic activities.
In addition to research SOMO worked with local and international trade unions to pressure the coal mining companies to take action. This work led to their proposal of starting and funding a project  The project will also consider gender issues and build on SOMO&#x2019;s recommendation to undertake a study on the implications of coal mine closures on women and indigenous people.

(1) Global Organic Textile Standard (GOTS) (1), an international standard setting body, asked relevant associated certification bodies to respond to the findings of SOMO&apos;s Tamil Nadu report. Investigations at the particular sites took place, including unannounced audits. After the report&#x2019;s publication, GOTS contacted SOMO and Arisa to discuss the findings. The key issue that emerged during the meeting between GOTS, SOMO and Arisa was the need for GOTS to improve its policy and practice with regard to engaging with local civil society stakeholders. GOTS has now announced that it is working on improving its stakeholder engagement policy and practice.</narrative>

Of the above at least the recommendation on fair pay will contribute to gender equality by focusing on fair pay for women in the garment industry.  
For reasons mentioned above, our targets here are a bit lower as we don&#x2019;t expect the private sector to take action voluntarily.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">(1) In July 2021, the Independent Complaints Mechanism (ICM) associated with EU Development Finance Institutions (DFIs), found a complaint involving a Financial Intermediary (FI) eligible. This is a ground-breaking change in practice by this non-judicial grievance mechanism.
Development banks are increasingly outsourcing their lending to commercial banks and other financial institutions, which then invest it onward, often with little oversight. The eligibility decision set an important precedent for communities affected by other EU DFI funding via FIs to seek accountability before the ICM upon the fulfilment of certain technical conditions.
The case complaint that led to the decision alleges that EU DFIs failed to ensure that FirstRand Bank, an FI, had adequate Environmental and Social risk management systems in place to monitor its own high-risk clients and, specifically, the performances of the New Liberty Gold Mine that FirstRand financed.
SOMO supported capacity building of two NGOs involved in the case to enable them to file a complaint to the ICM.

(13) OECD Watch&apos;s second evaluation of NCPs helped prompt 13 of them to improve their rules of procedure or structure to better facilitate access to remedy and civil society input. Specifically: two more NCPs (17 in total now) have committed to undertaking follow-up on agreements made and recommendations given; two more NCPs (38 total) have published rules of procedure in national languages and English; six NCPs redrafted their rules of procedure, often improving language such as by clarifying their commitment to accepting plausible claims (18 total) or their openness to accepting claims filed by civil society organisations rather than only directly-impacted people (20 total); and three more NCPs (13 total) now involve non-governmental stakeholders in the processing of complaints.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">(1) For the first time, the Dutch NCP (1) has declared admissible a complaint that not only addresses the behavior of multinationals with regard to the environment and human rights, but also the use of the Dutch system that allows corporates to avoid paying taxes. 
SOMO convinced the Dutch NCP to investigate the complaint against PlusPetrol, a multinational oil firm headquartered in an Amsterdam mailbox. The decision gives Indigenous communities in the oil fields of the Peruvian Amazon a path for seeking remediation from Pluspetrol for the polluted soil and waterways that have harmed the communities&#x2019; health and way of life.

(1) In her 2021 State of the Union Address on 25 September 2021, EU President von der Leyen (1) said the EU will propose a ban on products made by forced labour.
This commitment reflects years of work by civil society groups including SOMO. Reports about forced labour, including the report by Arisa and SOMO on forced labour in the textile and garment industry in Tamil Nadu, have demonstrated that voluntary initiatives and corporate self-regulation are insufficient in eliminating forced labour from global supply chains and that robust regulation at the EU level is essential.

(1) The UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) (1) issued a letter confirming OECD Watch and BankTrack&apos;s view that nominee shareholding creates a business relationship, making financial institutions responsible for adverse impacts of the company for which it provides such services (i.e., nominee shareholders). 
The initiative to see an OHCHR statement on this matter followed a statement by the Swiss NCP (the complaints mechanism linked to the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises) that nominee shareholding services of a financial institution do not create a business relationship that would the financial institution responsible for adverse impacts of the company for which it provides those services. OECD Watch and SOMO disagreed, and joined partner BankTrack in asking OHCHR to provide a view. 
This OHCHR statement helps pave the way for NCP complaints, and possibly judicial complaints, against financial institutions for their connection to adverse impacts via nominee shareholding services.


(2) Two NCPs issued final statements in NCP complaints confirming that companies breached the OECD Guidelines, thereby allowing victims some element of remedy, and clarifying responsible business conduct standards for MNEs. These findings help teach companies the meaning of the correct application of the Guidelines, and provide a form of recognition and remedy to impacted people. OECD Watch, hosted by SOMO, advised and supported the complainants.

(1) The coalition agreement between D66, CDA and VVD, which was published on 15 December 2021, included the introduction of Dutch due diligence legislation. This means that the Dutch government (1) will no longer tolerate abuses in the global value chains of companies, e.g. labour rights abuses, environmental pollution and child labour. 
The MVO Platform, hosted by SOMO, along with other Dutch civil society groups including SOMO, has been working towards this for years, and engaged in strategic advocacy in 2021 to promote action at the Dutch and EU levels on due diligence.

(1) In June 2021, FMO issued its Position Statement on Phasing Out Fossil Fuels for Direct Investments (Fossil Fuel Statement). This follows extensive advocacy by SOMO, Both ENDS and others. 
Following on its 2016 policy commitment on coal mining and power generation, this Position Statement partially complements the bank&#x2019;s approach to climate change issues by committing to reduce its direct exposure to the oil and gas industries. For example, the Statement restricts FMO&#x2019;s direct financing of fossil fuels&#x2019; exploration, extraction, and transportation, as well as oil-based power generation and transmission lines, amongst others. The final version of the Fossil Fuels Statement contains explicit reference to align FMO&#x2019;s portfolio to the 1.5-degree Celsius pathway of the Paris Agreement and recognition that gas-based energy operations are not sustainable solutions in the face of climate change &#x2013; two issues that the NGO coalition strongly advocated for during the review of the first draft. 
While acknowledging the progress made, SOMO maintains that the Position Statement on Fossil Fuels contains significant gaps, first and foremost because these commitments do not apply to indirect investments through financial intermediaries (FIs), which represent over 40% of FMO&#x2019;s current portfolio.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">(1) Together with many other CSOs across Europe, SOMO has contributed to raising public awareness about the negative impact of the Energy Charter Treaty (ECT) and its investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS) mechanism on energy transition and climate action. In February 2021, the European Commission published its proposal to phase out fossil fuel protection under the ECT. Current ECT reform negotiations are advancing very slowly, with some non-EU countries (1) objecting to the EU proposal. In response, Spain, France, Poland, Luxembourg, Greece, Latvia, Hungary and Cyprus are all demanding a legal assessment of a coordinated EU withdrawal from the ECT in absence of a consensus on the ECT reform. The European Commission has set June 2022 as a deadline before which a meaningful reform should be delivered. Meanwhile, in September 2021 the European Court of Justice found in the landmark Komstroy ruling that intra-EU arbitration under the ECT is incompatible with EU law, meaning that the ECT should no longer be available for disputes involving an EU investor and an EU member state. This puts even more pressure on the European Commission and EU member states to either negotiate a waiver for intra-EU disputes (unlikely to receive support from non-EU countries) or withdraw from the ECT.

(1) In June 2021, recommendations made by SOMO and other civil society groups in relation to a complaint mechanism to address non-compliance with sustainable development provisions under EU free trade agreements were taken up by the Dutch government (1) in its official position. This was the result of successful coordinated advocacy. 
Between February and April 2021, SOMO participated in three meetings organised by the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Social Economic Council (SER) on the newly created Single Entry Point as an internal complaint mechanism for CSOs to address non-compliance with sustainable development provisions under EU free trade agreements. Together with CNV, FNV, Milieudefensie, VCP and Handel Anders, SOMO made recommendations, including on: pre-notification support when filing a complaint; type of information required to substantiate a complaint; establishing transparency and concrete timelines; and clarifying the relationship between the Domestic Advisory Group established under EU  Free Trade Agreements and the SEP. 

(1) On 15 October 2021, the tribunal at the International Centre for Settlement of investment disputes (ICSID) (1) in the RWE (a German multinational energy company) vs Netherlands case agreed to apply the UNCITRAL Transparency Rules. This means that both the Dutch state, even though the Netherlands has not formally ratified those rules, and RWE commit - in principle - to open hearings, access to documents and to allow third parties to submit an amicus curiae brief. This decision has been informed by SOMO, FGG partners TNI and Milieudefensie, and others, calling for transparency in this case and to allow the public scrutiny and participation, particularly in parliamentary questions in February 2021, and sets an important precedent for future climate policy-related arbitration cases.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">(1) Based on a report published by SOMO and Arisa, supermarket giant Tesco (1) initiated an investigation with regard a spinning mill implicated in forced labour in Tamil Nadu. The company detected several &#x2018;critical issues&#x2019; in relation to wages and benefits, and verbal intimidation. Tesco is now working with the mill on a set of corrective actions, including back-pay of wages.
After receiving Arisa and SOMO&#x2019;s draft research report &#x2018;Spinning Around Workers Rights&#x2019; Tesco had contacted SOMO and Arisa to discuss the issues.

(1) Based on the findings of the SOMO and Arisa report &#x2018;Spinning Around Workers Rights&#x2019; and follow up conversations, Zeeman accepted it has a responsibility to address labour rights issues in deeper tiers of the supply chain. Zeeman undertook actions towards various actors in its supply chain and the company joined a multistakeholder improvement programme.</narrative>

We expect at least one EU policy actor to support alternative models for production of medicines, for instance by adopting and implementing stronger conditionality on public funding   for development of medicines, but also the use of waivers for patents or a patent pool.

Our target is low in 2022 because energy transition work is likely to focus on research and advocacy will only happen later in the year. As such, adoption and implementation is more realistic for 2023 and beyond.</narrative>

Throughout 2022, we aim for 6 civil society actors to lobby and advocate for improvements and revisions to trade and investment agreements.   This includes: work with CSOs in North Africa on trade deals with the EU which undermine communities&#x2019; rights to land; work with Indonesian CSOs on labour rights and trade; and work with CSOs in Latin America and sub-Saharan Africa on transition mineral supply chains.  The focus will be on joint re-search and analysis, joint strategizing on advocacy across value chains and training.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">(1) SOMO led a team of NGOs to build the Community Resource Exchange (CRE), a platform where civil society actors working with victims of corporate abuse can find resources and information to help them get access to remedies. The CRE was launched in 2021, established three international focal points (in Latin America, Africa, and Eastern Europe respectively). CRE was able , in its first year, to support tens of civil society groups and communities around the world with micro-grants and partnerships aims at securing justice. The initial seed funding for the CRE platform came from Wellspring, but SOMO has developed the CRE work under the Power of Voices program. The platform promotes mutual capacity building between different CSOs and from community to community.
 
(2) In early 2021, SOMO helped to build the capacity of two West African CSOs on how to file complaints to the ICM, which the EU Development Finance Institutions (DFIs) had established to resolve grievances related to alleged breaches of the EU DFIs&#x2019; own social and environmental policy safeguards. Following a series of workshops that local NGO partners conducted with the affected villagers, communities made the informed decision to file a dispute-resolution complaint to the ICM in February 2021. Throughout the second quarter of 2021, SOMO and NGO partners engaged extensively with the ICM to influence their eligibility assessment on this case. The case represents the first ever complaint before the ICM that, rather than alleging the use of banks&#x2019; funds in specific harmful projects, focuses on the responsibilities that EU DFIs bear when investing in financial intermediaries (FIs). 


(5) SOMO collaborated with five South American and international trade unions, whose capacities were strengthened through the development of the report &#x2018;Responsible disengagement from coal as part of a just transition&#x2019; written by SOMO. The report helped the trade unions in their lobby and advocacy towards the coal mining companies and put pressure on them to take responsibility towards workers. SOMO also benefited from the input provided by the unions on the particular concerns of workers and unions, which led to a stronger and more focused report. The report also takes account of gender issues and calls for deeper analysis on the implications of mine closure on women and indigenous peoples. 

(2) SOMO successfully built the capacity of a Soutch Asian partner NGO, and a grass-root organization, representing the affected communities in South Asia to navigate the World Bank&#x2019;s Inspection Panel system. The case involves people adversely affected by the construction of a dry port in the region, a key component of a World Bank-funded Trade and Transport Project. In 2020, SOMO supported the affected people to file a complaint to the World Bank&#x2019;s Inspection Panel, raising instances of non-compliance with the World Bank&#x2019;s Safeguard Policies on indigenous peoples&#x2019; rights, the consultation process, and cultural rights amongst others. When the Inspection Panel process failed to move forward in a timely manner SOMO&#x2019;s helped local partners to identify relevant pressure points within the World Bank&#x2019;s management structure. Following the delivery of letters to all the executive directors, community representatives were able to ensure direct lines of communication with key constituencies of the Bank&#x2019;s board and to elaborate convincing arguments that led these constituencies to commit to use their leverage in trying to resume the complaint process. In October the Inspection Panel finally informed the complainants about their plan to travel to Nepal in order to finalize the complaint&#x2019;s admissibility phase. We are awaiting further developments on the complaint in 2022.

(1) OECD Watch members successfully influenced the OECD&#x2019;s stocktaking exercise on the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises. Many civil society issues and recommendations were reflected in the process. This work is a critical milestone in our efforts to secure important reform of the Guidelines.OECD Watch successfully encouraged the OECD to hold a public consultation for the stocktaking. OECD Watch then supported civil society to participate extensively in the public consultation and provided numerous updates, and a template letter to encourage and support CSOs&apos; submissions to the consultation. This was fruitful: more than half of all submissions received were from civil society. The stocktaking reports were then updated by the OECD, following input from OECD Watch and (via OECD Watch&apos;s support) other civil society, to reflect detailed analysis on gaps relating to corporate standards, as well as  access to remedy via National Contact Points (NCP) for the OECD Guidelines, and suggesting need to improve both the corporate standards and NCPs. 
SOMO is the host of OECD Watch, whose members are diverse and include and/or represent civil society from LLMUMICs.

(2) Throughout 2021, SOMO built capacities of a South American CSO and grass root organisation to engage with the FMO staff and grievance redress mechanism. In April 2021, FMO, the lead project financier, unexpectedly announced the anticipated repayment of their multimillion loan meaning that the bank&#x2019;s involvement in the project in question would terminate by the end of 2021. Affected communities raised concerns about this unexpected development, particularly about the lack of clarity on how the bank&#x2019;s exit would affect the long-standing ICM-led compliance review process through which they expected to obtain accountability for the harms suffered.
Throughout the second and third quarter of 2021, SOMO and Both Ends supported community representatives in their quest for clarifications. After FMO made clear that the decision to discontinue relationships with the project is irreversible, we helped local communities to develop and implement a strategy plan reflecting their expectations for the banks for responsible divestment.

(1) Throughout the year, SOMO continued to support CCC members by responding to various requests for access to and analysis of data. This supply chain information helped CCC to identify brands/retailers buying from factories where labour rights violations had been detected. As a result CCC and its members were able to reach out to implicated brands/ retailers in Urgent Appeal cases.</narrative>

Throughout 2022, we aim for 6 civil society actors to lobby and advocate for improvements and revisions to trade and investment agreements.   This includes: work with CSOs in North Africa on trade deals with the EU which undermine communities&#x2019; rights to land; work with Indonesian CSOs on labour rights and trade; and work with CSOs in Latin America and sub-Saharan Africa on transition mineral supply chains.  The focus will be on joint re-search and analysis, joint strategizing on advocacy across value chains and training.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">(1) During 2021, SOMO helped to build the capacity of members of the Clean Clothes Campaign (CCC) network on how to access specialised data relevant for supply chain analysis. We organised a well-attended workshop to demonstrate key databases (Panjiva, Orbis) and explain which information can be found in these database.  
Throughout the year, SOMO continued to support CCC members by responding to various requests for access to and analysis of data. This supply chain information helped CCC to identify brands/retailers buying from factories where labour rights violations had been detected. As a result CCC and its members were able to reach out to implicated brands/ retailers in Urgent Appeal cases. 

(2) SOMO, and two CSOs from Latin America and South East Asia strengthened their capacities to work on different legal aspects of cases involving corporations.
On 21 May, SOMO co-organised a webinar with one on the organisations and Erasmus Law School on the Chevron v Ecuador investor-state dispute resolution (ISDS) case. The workshop allowed participants to explore the implications of ISDS on human rights, access to remedies, rule of law and environmental justice. It brought together examples and experiences from the Global South and Global North and explored avenues for re-conceptualizing investor rights in light of climate and environmental justice. SOMO participated as one of the speakers, sharing our expertise with others and learning from their experiences. This learning has influenced to SOMO&#x2019;s further development of work on ISDS and the extractive sector.
Between October and December, the other CSO organised three webinars on the EU-Indonesia negotiations on the CEPA agreement. The webinars were co-hosted by a range of European and Indonesian NGOs, including FGG partners SOMO, Both Ends, TNI and Friends of the Earth Europe. SOMO participated in the second webinar as one of the speakers. The webinars brought together different critical perspectives on the content on the proposed CEPA agreement as well as its broader potential impact on sustainable development. The first webinar included high-ranked officials from the European Commission and the Indonesian government as speakers. 

(3) The GoodElectronics network, which is hosted by SOMO, continued to provide a platform for its members to network, shared knowledge and agree on joint lobby and advocacy. In 2021 the network was able to advance strategic thinking on electric batteries and climate justice. This is enabling the network to strengthen the strategic thinking of members and set up a strong strategic approach to move forward. GoodElectronics provided sub-grants to three of its member CSOs in South East Asia and Latin America, which they used for research and capacity strengthening activities. 

(2) In early 2021, SOMO supported awareness and technical capacity building of two NGOs in West Africa on filing a complaint before the independent complaint mechanism (ICM) of the EU Development Finance Institutions (DFI). 
Since the New Liberty Gold Project in Western Liberia, funded by FirstRand Bank, a financial intermediary of the Dutch bank, FMO, started, communities have been exposed to relocation, pollution and police violence. Security risks coupled with the weakness of Liberia&#x2019;s legal framework in protecting villagers&#x2019; rights from corporate abuses led local CSOs to seek assistance of international NGOs, including SOMO, to investigate accountability opportunities across the project&#x2019;s supply chain. 

(5) SOMO collaborated with 5 South American and international trade unions, whose capacities were strengthened through knowledge exchange during the jointdevelopment of the report &#x2018;Responsible disengagement from coal as part of a just transition&#x2019;.

(2) Throughout 2021, SOMO&#x2019;s support to a Central American grass-roots movement defending the rights of an indigenous people impacted by FMO and DEG-funded hydroelectric projects in Central America, and another CSO from the region focused on building capacities to engage with the FMO staff and grievance redress mechanism, the ICM, due to a major case development.

(50) The capacity of 50 NGOs to evaluate gender due diligence by companies was improved.  OECD Watch organised a workshop which allowed participants to develop their skills in using an OECD Watch tool to evaluate a company&apos;s gender due diligence. Participants also gained capacity on the OECD Guidelines and complaint system.</narrative>

These CSOs, from Africa and Latin America, will strengthened their ability to carry out research using a gender lens, in particular in remedy cases where SOMO will support the CSOs to identify gender-differentiated impacts of corporate activity and to advocate for equality in access to remedy.  

When communities suffer harm as a result of corporate activity, often efforts to secure a remedy fail to take account of gender and other facets of identity. Consequently, remedial action (such as paying compensation to male leaders or male heads of house-holds) can reinforce pre-existing inequality.</narrative>

We expect that 10 key actors will put FGG recommendations on their agendas. This includes: 

&#x2022;	At least one international organisation &#x2013; most likely OECD - will include recommendations on access to medicines and on transition minerals on their agenda
&#x2022;	National governments in Europe (incl. NL) will include recommendations on access to medication on their agenda 
&#x2022;	Government actors in EU, Latin America and African Union regions will put policy recommendations on transition minerals on their agenda
&#x2022;	Government actors in EU will include recommendations on curbing monopoly power of Big Tech

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">(1) NGO pressure, supported by SOMO and Both Ends, led FMO (1) to commit to a last ICM-led compliance review monitoring report on a case around a hydroelectric dam project. Community-led initiatives pressured FMO to formally re-purpose the main objective of their visit to affected communities from the initial proposal to extract lessons, to the intention of starting a dialogue with communities about reparations. While there is still a significant gap between FMO&#x2019;s approach and meaningful reparations, the support of SOMO and Both Ends on this case has opened up more space for improving accountability of the financial sector.

(1) Following the publication of a report by Arisa and SOMO about forced labour and other rights issues in the textile industry of a South Asian country (&apos;Spinning around workers&apos; rights&apos;), a Dutch bank (1) confronted one of its clients (a garment brand) with the findings and urged the company to improve its human rights due diligence policies and practices. 

(3) Based on research by SOMO and partner Arisa, &apos;Spinning around workers&apos; rights&apos; three companies that source yarn from a spinning mill where there are indications of forced labour are cooperating with each other in order to address those issues. After receiving the SOMO / Arisa draft research report &#x2018;Spinning Around Workers Rights&#x2019;, Tesco (1) contacted the two organisations to discuss the findings. SOMO and Arisa facilitated contact between Tesco and two other companies (Next (1) and Marc &#x2018;O Polo (1)) that sourced yarn from this particular spinning unit. Individually, these companies lack sufficient leverage to address conditions at their third-tier supplier. 

(2) As a result of Arisa and SOMO&#x2019;s &#x2018;Spinning around Workers&#x2019; Rights&#x2019; report, a Dutch member of parliament (1) (Socialist Party) tabled questions in parliament for outgoing Minister of Foreign Affairs. Answering these questions last week, the Minister acknowledged the existence of major abuses in the garment industry in the country discussed in the report. The Minister (1) acknowledged that abuses in the garment industry have been exacerbated by the Corona pandemic, and stated that there is a lack of transparency in the garment and textile industry. She also stated that companies and governments, along with trade unions and NGOs must be vigilant on this issue. The acknowledgement of the garment sector issues and the lack of transparency can be leveraged in future work by SOMO and Arisa to increase transparency and due diligence in the supply chain.

(1) The open-ended intergovernmental working group on transnational corporations and other business enterprises (IGWG), mandated by the UN to elaborate an international legally binding instrument UN Treaty) and the permanent representation of the Netherlands to the UN put SOMO&apos;s recommendations for the UN treaty on prevention, access to remedy and legal liabilities on their agenda. Together with other NGOs, SOMO provided textual input for the draft treaty, responding to the third revised draft.

(1) In 2021, SOMO supported rural communities in a West African country affected by the country&apos;s first and largest commercial gold mining project, which is funded by FirstRand Bank, a financial intermediary (FI) of FMO (1), in their search for justice. SOMO engaged with FMO&#x2019;s environmental and social risk management staff on the case. FMO confirmed that the case complaint significantly influenced FMO&#x2019;s plan to review its approach to FI investments. In the third quarter of 2021, SOMO and NGO partners started to implement a strategy aimed at convincing the gold mine to accept the dispute resolution services offered by the ICM.

(1) In 2021, SOMO, together with FGG partners Both Ends and Oxfam Novib, continued to engage in the structured Quarterly Dialogues with FMO (1) aimed at improving environmental and social safeguard policies and practices of the Dutch development bank. FMO sent a draft Position Statement on environmental, social and governance (ESG) for Financial Intermediaries (FIs) to SOMO and other CSOs for review. The CSOs gave joint input on the draft, addressing significant policy gaps and shortcomings. In follow-up meetings and parallel conversations, FMO reported that the engagements had influenced renewed internal discussions about the bank&#x2019;s FI approach. FMO added that it plans to release a second reviewed draft of the FIs Position Statement for public consultation by the first half of 2022..

(1) As a result of OECD Watch&apos;s input, the OECD (1) reflected key civil society concerns and recommendations in a stocktaking report. The stocktaking exercises related to gaps and issues in the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and the associated NCP complaints mechanism. The report included detailed analysis on gaps relating to corporate standards around gender and impacts on women &amp; LGBTQ+ people, and access to remedy via NCPs (the complaints mechanism linked to the OECD Guidelines) for women and LGBTQ+ people. (g)
It also included concerns about the capacity of the OECD&#x2019;s NCP complaints process to prevent and respond to threats or attacks to defenders who use the complaint system or connected to complaints. (x)
OECD Watch participated extensively in the OECD&apos;s stocktaking process and supported its members to do so. OECD Watch made numerous written and oral submissions, including detailed analysis of gaps in the Guidelines and the NCP process.
SOMO is the host of OECD Watch, whose members are diverse and include and/or represent civil society from LLMUMICs.

(2) The Dutch Agreement for Garment and Textiles (AGT) (1) reached out to companies that are linked to spinning mills that were investigated in Arisa and SOMO&#x2019;s report &#x2018;Spinning Around Workers Rights&#x2019; which found indications of forced labour. The AGT secretariat encouraged these companies to contact SOMO and Arisa. All of these companies got into touch with SOMO and Arisa and conversations have taken place towards improvements in policy and/or practice. 
FairWearFoundation (FWF) (1) also reached out to a number of members that may have links to one or more of the investigated units. As a result, contact was established with one FWF brand (Marc O&apos;Polo). The exchange with this company resulted in this company teaming up with two other companies that were identified by SOMO and Arisa as having links with the same spinning mill to address the issues.

(1) The US government agency, USAID (1), will use civil society guidance when it creates a new Independent Accountability Mechanism (IAM). The guidance was published by a group of NGOs, including SOMO, which took the lead in drafting the paper. The paper identified 69 best practice policies that can make the mechanisms more accessible and accountable to victims of adverse business impacts. It also identified policies on ensuring the IAM addresses potential gender barriers for applicants. The paper, which is the only paper analysing the rules of procedure of IAMs, received extensive praise and thanks from several IAMs.

(1) An ActionAid and SOMO report &#x2018;Manganese matters; A metal of consequence for women and communities in South Africa affected by mining and the global energy transition&#x2019;, put the negative impacts of manganese mining on the political agenda in the Netherlands. Based on the report questions were raised by GroenLinks (1) and answered by the Drutch Minister of Foreign Trade and Development Cooperation in parliament. 
The research had a specific focus on the gendered aspects of mining. The minister in parliament acknowledged the gender inequality issues. 

(1) The Drive Sustainability Initiative (1) (a partnership of automotive companies aimed at improving supply chain sustainability in the automotive industry) has added manganese to their Raw Material Outlook Platform, a tool that provides information on the issues and risks in the supply chain of several minerals and that car companies rely on for their due diligence. This move was based on the Action Aid and SOMO&#x2019;s report &#x2018;Manganese matters; A metal of consequence for women and communities in South Africa affected by mining and the global energy transition&#x2019;, published in 2021.

(1) Based on the conclusions of SOMO&#x2019;s paper &#x2018;Responsible disengagement from coal as part of a just transition&#x2019;, the Colombian Truth Commission (1) (intergovernmental body that is investigating the armed conflict) has decided to focus their investigation on the role of coal mining companies and European power companies in the civil war. SOMO&#x2019;s report concludes that not only the mining companies but also the European power companies were complicit in the abuses in the Colombian mine and that they have a role in reparations. The paper has put the issue of involved companies not taking their responsibilities on the agenda of the Colombian Truth Commission and of mining and energy companies.

(1) SOMO successfully engaged other civil society actors and helped to put merger control on the civil society advocacy agenda in relation to the EU&#x2019;s Digital Markets Act (DMA), a legislative proposal aimed at ensuring fair and contestable digital markets in the EU (1). SOMO developed its strategy and policy positions on Big Tech and supported European civil society advocacy efforts in relation to the power and impact of Big Tech platforms.In 2020, SOMO published a report on the financialisation of Big Tech. Building on this, in 2021 SOMO developed a strategy &#x2018;From Big Tech to &#x2018;Tech For All&#x2019;&#x2019;, focusing in particular on the Big Tech strategy of mergers and acquisitions, and the risks this approach poses to holding the companies accountable. Based on the new strategy, during 2021 SOMO worked with different coalitions of civil society groups to advocate for a strong Digital Service Act (DSA) and Digital Markets Act (DMA), two critical pieces of EU legislation. SOMO also carried out preliminary research on the Fintech sector and analysis of Big Tech corporate due diligence issues. These foundational work in 2021 will allow SOMO to substantially grow its work on Big Tech in 2022 and beyond.</narrative>
