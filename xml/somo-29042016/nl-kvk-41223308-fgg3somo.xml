  <description>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Fair, Green and Global Alliance (FGG) aims to increase the power and decision-making influence of organised, mobilised and informed civil society, especially women, to advance fair and green trade and value chains. FGG believes that poverty, inequality and exclusion are caused by power asymmetries. We see the unprecedented power of capital over people and planet as the primary obstacle impeding realisation of fair and green trade and value chains. The FGG programme focuses on recalibrating power within the global architecture of trade and value chains by amplifying the voices of targeted rights-holders &#x2013;  small producers and traders, workers, fishers, rural and Indigenous peoples, religious and ethnic minorities, and migrants, especially the women and youth among them &#x2013; who are practising, claiming or defending human rights and fair and green economic practices, and/or whose rights are being ignored, threatened or violated by corporations and/or governments. We aim to transform social relations so that these rights-holders&#x2019; voices are heard and heeded. FGG&#x2019;s eight members (ActionAid, Both ENDS, Clean Clothes Campaign, IT for Change, Milieudefensie/Friends of the Earth International/Friends of the Earth Europe, Samdhana Institute, SOMO and the Transnational Institute) cooperate with some 1000+ partners and allies in our many worldwide networks to strengthen collective capacities to advance a common vision of fair and green trade and value chains.</narrative>

We expect 1 European garment brand to implement recommendations on fair pay.
We expect 1 European fossil fuel company to disclose information on transition plans and costs.

Our targets here are low because, given the focus areas of our work, we do not expect the private sector to take the needed actions voluntarily. Our focus is on securing legal and regulatory action to hold corporations to account. However, in some individual case work we expect companies to take action to remedy harms, including cases where we support partners to take action via non-judicial remedy processes.</narrative>

Again, a lot of the work will be in the research phase in first part of 2022. We would expect some areas of work (some of the ISDS and ECT work specifically) to be implemented, but other areas of work will require a longer time horizon for implementation.

In 2022:

&#x2022;	We expect 1 key government actor in EU to commit to adopt recommendations on the Energy Charter Treaty.
&#x2022;	We also expect that CETA will not be adopted   by the NL

Again, a lot of the work will be in the research phase in first part of 2022. We would expect some areas of work (some of the ISDS and ECT work specifically) to be implemented, but other areas of work will require a longer time horizon for implementation.

In 2022:

&#x2022;	We expect 1 key government actor in EU to commit to adopt recommendations on the Energy Charter Treaty.
&#x2022;	We also expect that CETA will not be adopted   by the NL
&#x2022;	We expect EU customs data relevant to supply chains to be disclosed based on our longstanding recommendations.</narrative>

We expect at least one EU policy actor to support alternative models for production of medicines, for instance by adopting and implementing stronger conditionality on public funding   for development of medicines, but also the use of waivers for patents or a patent pool.

Our target is low in 2022 because energy transition work is likely to focus on research and advocacy will only happen later in the year. As such, adoption and implementation is more realistic for 2023 and beyond.</narrative>

Of these 10 CSOs, 2 will strengthen capacities that are relevant for their advocacy for gender justice. These CSOs, from Africa and Latin America, will strengthened their ability to carry out research using a gender lens, in particular in remedy cases where SOMO will support the CSOs to identify gender-differentiated impacts of corporate activity and to advocate for equality in access to remedy.  

When communities suffer harm as a result of corporate activity, often efforts to secure a remedy fail to take account of gender and other facets of identity. Consequently, remedial action (such as paying compensation to male leaders or male heads of house-holds) can reinforce pre-existing inequality.</narrative>

&#x2022;	National governments in Europe (incl. NL) will include recommendations on access to medication on their agenda 
&#x2022;	Government actors in EU, Latin America and African Union regions will put policy recommendations on transition minerals on their agenda
&#x2022;	Government actors in EU will include recommendations on curbing monopoly power of Big Tech
&#x2022;	Government actors in EU will put our recommendation our supply chain transparency on their agendas</narrative>
