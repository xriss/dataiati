   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Provision of Non Food Items for IDPs (New Arrivals) in Camps and Host Communities in Maiduguri Metropolis, Borno State</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Following the recent and alarming surge in insecurity in northern and eastern Borno State and parts of Northeast, many persons have been displaced and push to find refuge in Maiduguri Metropolitan Council (MMC). Many are since arrival in MMC and other part of Borno have been staying without any form of NFIs.
This project aims to meet the immediate life-saving humanitarian needs of an estimated newly
displaced people from other part of Borno into MMC, most of whom are living in deplorable
Conditions and urgently require humanitarian assistance especially NFIs. 
The proposed project is targeting new arrivals who have fled inaccessible areas and are in dire need of aid.
This project will be focusing only on the provision of improved NFI kits to the most vulnerable in MMC and the activities will include, community social mobilization, need assessment, beneficiary registration, procurement, warehousing, transportation, distribution of NFIs and post distribution monitoring every two weeks after distribution as the distribution will be done on a rolling-on-going bases according the the needs and sector directives.
In implementing this project GREENCODE will work closely with the Sector and the nationally approved guidelines and standard as uploaded in the Humanitarian Response Info will be used. 
Given the NFI needs for the new arrivals in the MMC and considering the important of providing lifesaving assistance, the project will procure, transport and distribute improved NFIs kits to the most vulnerable 700 households such as female and child headed HHs among IDPs (new arrival) in MMC based on needs of the gaps jointly identified/agreed by GREENCODE and Shelter/NFIs sector in Borno state. 
The distribution will be on a rolling/on-going basis as GREENCODE team will continue to assess, verify, and deliver assistance according to identified needs to affected populations wherever they are in MMC, and most likely in some in locations with gaps as directed and agreed with the Shelter/NFIs sector. 
In all stages of the project protection issues such as SGBV and child protection will be closely monitored and referred to appropriate partners for counselled and refer, also during distribution of NFIs.
GREENCODE will work with IOM, SEMA, UNHRC and Protection sector to ensure gender and age awareness including in the dis-aggregation of data and the targeting of female&#xAC; headed households, incorporating gender dynamics and the specific needs of different groups into needs assessments and response recommendations. Further, GREENCODE will pay special attention recognising the different needs of women and children as well as men and boys of different ages, we will ensure targeting criteria are taking into consideration specific vulnerabilities and needs. Also, in procuring NFIs and ensure that kit contents procured for this project are gender sensitive as well as easy to use by women in performing daily tasks.</narrative>
