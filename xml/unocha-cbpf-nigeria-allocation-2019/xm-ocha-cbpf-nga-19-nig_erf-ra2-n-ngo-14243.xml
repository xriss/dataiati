   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Tackling Child Malnutrition in Emergency (TACME- Project) Among New Arrival, IDPs in Kaga, Konduga  and Mafa LGAs in Borno State</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Tackling of Acute Malnutrition in Emergency (TACME) project is conceived by GREENCODE to contribute to tackling the child malnutrition among new arrivals, IDPs and host communities in Kaga, Konduga and Mafa LGA  using the community mobilisation in IYCF-E approach as the rate of malnutrition is increasing among children of under 5 years. The increasing rise in severe acute malnutrition is a as result of increasing insurgent attacks that has destroyed the health care facilities and make food insecure in the past 3 and 4 months.
The recent SMART survey of conducted by Save the Children International (SCI) in Kaga, Konduga and Magumeri in July, 2019 and validated by the Nutrition Sector in November, 2019 indicates high prevalence of global acute malnutrition as 21.1% (17.6-25.2, 95% C.I), with a severe acute malnutrition prevalence of 5.5% (3.6-8.2, 95% C.I). The GAM prevalence was well above the emergency threshold of 15% and increased significantly (plt0.05) compared to 15.7% (12.2-20.0, 95% C.I) in 2018.  Further, more the report disaggregated analysis by LGA which acute malnutrition was highest, which may be classified as &#x201C;hot spots&#x201D;. were Magumeri, followed by Konduga, then Kaga.
GREENCODE with the funding support from NHF under the 2nd reserve allocation is a 9 month project window will support the capacity strengthening of community structures to support acute malnutrition treatment by organizing community level training for community nutrition mobilizers, mass MUAC screening,  conduct counselling and referral to other INGO&#x2019;s OTPs/stabilization centers, set-up mother-to-mother support groups, father to father support group, training of community nutrition mobilisers, Hygiene/Sanitation, training of lead mothers, cooking demonstration, training of religious leaders, training of religious leaders on the involvement of IYCF/CMAM. Under this project GREENCODE will be reaching and improving nutrition for 6,000.
Green Concern for Development (GREENCODE) with the support of OCHA- NHF will be working with community structures in the 3 LGAs in Borno state in improving local capacity in the management of moderate/severe acute malnutrition among under five (lt5 (0-59 months)) children of new arrivals, IDPs and host community&#x2019;s households affected by the insurgency in Borno state. Population arriving from the inaccessible areas have particularity high prevalence of acute malnutrition, a SMART survey conducted for under 5 children and some adults. In addition, adult beneficiaries will receive IYCF&#xAC;E interventions through IYCF messages, training and mother to mother group sessions and hygiene education to help prevent diseases and acute malnutrition among children 0 to 23 months. BSFP will also be implemented in both locations for children 6 to 59 months to help prevent children who are malnourished from deteriorating further and also prevent the others from acute malnutrition, especially those who are malnourished as a result of inadequate dietary intake. The community outreach component, which entails the recruitment of Community Nutrition Mobilisers (CNMs), GREENCODE will adopt and introduce Mother&apos;s MUAC as innovation to to the mass MUAC screening, will be implemented on a large scale within the communities in order to identify children with acute malnutrition on time and refer them to the nutrition OTP and stabilization centres. Also, cooking demonstration using local recipes will be conducted and popularise in the project location as well as implementation of cash for caregivers in critical conditions to empower them and sustain tackling the malnutrition in project location.
In implementing this project, GREENCODE is anticipating a complementary funding from CBM/BMZ of Germany/Nigeria for a WASH project to cover for some percentage of Admin in the budget, while some percentage of the National Coordinator cost will be cover from anticipated NHF -Shelter/NFI Project and private consultancy.</narrative>
