   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Emergency CCCM, Shelter and NFI assistance targeting critical risks faced by IDP populations in Borno, and information management services for improved evidence-based humanitarian interventions in Borno, Yobe, and Adamawa States</narrative>

  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">ACTED&#x2019;s proposed 12-month intervention aims to deliver critical CCCM assistance and emergency S/NFI response, directly benefitting 22,927 displaced and conflict-affected persons in Borno State, and critical evidence-based multi-sectoral information to at least 50 organizations active in NE Nigeria through its REACH Initiative. The Action will build on ACTED&#x2019;s previous experience in the target sites, offering uninterrupted critical assistance to IDPs through CCCM in Dikwa, as well as urgently needed S/NFI provisions in Dikwa and Mafa LGAs. It will build on the extensive coordination work already conducted by the REACH Initiative with OCHA, sectors and other relevant stakeholders in NE Nigeria. ACTED will offer critical CCCM assistance to 8 IDP camp in Dikwa, ensuring unhindered access to critical services, strengthened coordination, and camp maintenance for safe and dignified living conditions. ACTED will catalyze on strong experience delivering CCCM in Dikwa, and on existing robust relationships with beneficiary communities and relevant humanitarian stakeholders. ACTED&#x2019;s proposed CCCM intervention is designed from two core pillars &#x2013; community ownership of, and participation in, camp governance structures, and strong accountability to affected population mechanisms &#x2013; ensuring inclusion of beneficiary voice in intervention activities. Additionally, ACTED will continue to liaise closely with humanitarian partners, and conduct strong advocacy to relevant sectors, based on monitoring assessments and beneficiary identified needs and gaps, in order to ensure targeted and evidence-based response at camp-level. Strong coordination mechanisms will be combined with site maintenance and risk mitigation strategies, addressing critical risks facing IDPs, including fire, flooding, and disease outbreak.The CCCM Component aims to protect IDPs&#x2019; rights to safe and dignified living conditions within camp settings. Additionally, the intervention will offer conflict-affected households in Mafa and Dikwa emergency S/NFI assistance through the provision of 500 Bama-type shelters, 115 emergency shelter repair kits, and 760 NFI kits. ACTED&#x2019;s S/NFI Action aims to relieve critical and immediate S/NFI needs, targeting vulnerable IDP households that have received no prior assistance, or that are living in damaged and vulnerable shelters as a result of the 2019 rainy season. An expected 3,800 IDPs will benefit directly from S/NFI distributions.ACTED anticipates that the project will directly benefit all IDP residents in the 8 target sites in Dikwa, plus 500 beneficiaries in Mafa through the Shelter component (calculated at 5 persons per household), thereby to ensure double counting is avoided, ACTED expects to assist 22,927 direct beneficiaries.
As part of their joint initiative, REACH, ACTED and IMPACT Initiatives will provide critical, evidence-based multi-sectoral information to the humanitarian community, with a specific focus on coordination with OCHA, sectors and other relevant coordination structures. REACH will build on the experience of the previous 2 years to conduct a Multi-Sector Needs Assessment (MSNA) in the BAY States in view to inform the 2021 HPC cycle. The common work between OCHA and REACH has improved information sharing and coordination on assessments, whereby both have worked together to develop a Secondary data review (SDR) involving the sectors and sub-sectors, and have reliance on MSNA household-level data to inform the 2020 Humanitarian Needs Overview (HNO) analysis.Under the proposed Action, and in order to bring coordination efforts to new heights, REACH also proposes to work together with OCHA to establish and co-chair an Assessment and Analysis Working Group (AAWG) reporting to the Inter-Sector Working Group (ISWG). This WG will allow for OCHA, sectors, and external actors from INGOs, NNGOs, IOs, and other relevant stakeholders to come together to improve coordination on assessments and information sharing throughout the year.</narrative>
