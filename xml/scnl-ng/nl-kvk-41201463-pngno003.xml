   <narrative xml:lang="EN">NGA Nigeria Joint Response 2 - Coordination</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Due to the significantly higher number of people displaced inside Nigeria (1,9 million) compared to fleeing to neighbouring countries (209.000) the geographical focus of the NJR 2 programme will be on Nigeria. Particularly, the response will focus on the North Eastern states only, prioritizing the LGAs with more than 150.000 IDPs. Based on the analysis of UNOCHAs HRP, humanitarian funding tracker data and FEWSNET information of the humanitarian needs, and also the financial requirements, the level of funding in 2015 and funding commitments for 2016, the sectors FSL, WASH and Health have been prioritized, followed by the sector Protection. Like the NJR1 programme, and in line with priorities identified by the UNOCHA HRP, this programme attributes special focus on humanitarian capacity building and lobby and advocacy efforts. As with all joint responses joint learning and added value creation is a central aspect of this joint response.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">With this intervention we aim to reach 176.302 people: 60.962 with FSL, 118.443 with WASH, 34.179 with Protection and 57.990 with Health activities. All activities within this joint response are focused on IDP&#x2019;s, returnees and their host communities. Vulnerable groups that have been identified in the target locations are children, particularly UASC; women, particularly widows, pregnant or lactating women and woman-headed households; people with disabilities and elderly. All members of this joint response prioritize the most vulnerable people. Criteria to select the most vulnerable vary per sector, but include IDP households with acutely or moderately malnourished children, female-headed households, child-headed households, elderly, people living with disability, pregnant or lactating mothers, families with more than two children under 5, children exposed to abuse, children affected by gender-based violence, children associated with armed forces and armed group.</narrative>

     <actual value="The monthly good basket e-wallet costs were harmonized with those of other partners and the amount has been adjusted to 46USd per e-wallet for all. The 70% of caloric needs per person per day, and even including an addition food item, is still maintained under this harmonization. &#xF0B7; The NJR2 partner Tearfund and its sub-grantee CRUDAN engaged PAGs established by the IRC in Pakka, Maiha LGA. The PAG members are functioning as volunteers, mobilizing other community members for Tearfund and CRUDAN&#x2019;s WASH and Food Security activities as well as for the IRC&#x2019;s protection outreach activities. Coordination between NJR2 consortium partners has thus allowed partners to avoid duplication of community-based structures and any waste of resources. &#xF0B7; The IRC and Tearfund/CRUDAN have been collaborating in Maiha LGA for identifying IDPs with medical complications and emergencies in host communities. This has enabled an expansion of the medical referral pathway with direct referrals to the General Hospital in Mubi and the Federal Medical Centre in Yola. &#xF0B7; IRC&#x2019;s close collaboration with the ASPHCDA, the Ministry of Health and the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) has proved essential as attending coordination meetings and sector working groups has allowed partners to avoid duplication of activities and better complement and strengthen existing services. &#xF0B7; Oxfam organized World Humanitarian Day together with NEMA. With the NJR support Oxfam contributed the photo gallery for this day and brought the sector together."></actual>
