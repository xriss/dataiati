   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The proposed investment is an early-stage investment preceding a commercial resource discovery. Generally, exploration projects have limited development impact but even at this early stage, the proposed investment has shown tangible benefits for the surrounding communities. The Project provides some direct employment to rural communities in an IFC Frontier Region, where formal employment opportunities are scarce and poverty levels are high. The majority of employees are Dominican nationals, most of which are members of the community of Restauracion or members of other communities located in the area surrounding the project.   Should exploration lead to mine development and production, the developmental impacts from this Project would include revenues to the government, rural development through the creation of direct and indirect employment, continuing economic diversification into a new sector, and an important demonstration effect of how large-scale commercial mining may be developed in accordance with good international industry practice.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Unigold Inc. (Unigold) is a TSX Venture Exchange listed Canadian junior mining exploration company with a large and prospective land package in the northwestern part of the Dominican Republic near the border with Haiti along the volcanic belt that hosts Pueblo Viejo, one of the largest gold deposits in the world today (with defined gold reserves of over 25 million ounces). Unigold&apos;&apos;s focus lies within its wholly owned Neita Concession (Neita or the Project), which covers 22,600 ha.  The Company acquired 100% interest in the Fiscal Reserve for Neita in July 2002, which was converted into an exploratory concession in 2006 via an application to the government.  The exploration concession was renewed in 2012 and is valid until 2015 with two one-year extensions.  Unigold started drilling the Neita property in 2004 and has to date drilled more than 60,000 meters. Multiple targets have been identified, including Los Candelones and its Extension Zone Lomita Pi&#xF1;a, MGN, Noisey and Corozo.  Geologically, this area is highly prospective with significant widths and grades of gold mineralization and continuity. Unigold is currently pursuing a 40,000m drilling program, which started last year and will be completed in 2013. Approximately 30,000m of the total program will be focused on Los Candelones and its Extension Zone, the remaining 10,000m to discover other targets outside of Candelones. In addition, Unigold is conducting metallurgical studies and other exploration works in order to produce its first NI 43-101 mineral resource estimate for the Candelones target area, followed by a Preliminary Economic Assessment (PEA).</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Neita property is located in the northwestern part of the Dominican Republic near the border with Haiti along the Cretaceous Age Volcanic Belt.  It is located approximately 200 linear kilometers northwest of the capital city of Santo Domingo. Santiago de los Caballeros, the second largest city in the Dominican Republic, is about 100 kilometers northeast of the project. The western limit of the Neita property is defined by the Haitian border.  The Companys flagship project covers an area of 22,600 ha located at an elevation of ~1,000 meters above sea level.    The project site is accessible by paved road and the product may be transported by truck to a port on the north coast and ultimately sold to a smelter for recovery.  There is access to a national power grid with 24hr electricity that reaches the nearby town of Restauraci&#xF3;n (approximately 1.5km away from the project site).</narrative>
