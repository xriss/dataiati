   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Summary Of Project Information (SPI)       Project Name    Dominican Republic - Pasteurizadora Rica S.A.      RegionLatin America and Caribbean   Sector   Project No009084     Projected Board Date    November 8, 1999              Company Name    Psteurizadora Rica S.A. and its subsidiaries Pasteurizadora del Cibao, Consorcio Citiricos Dominicanos and Lecheria San Antonio      Technical Partner and/or Major Shareholders    	Pasteurizadora Rica S.A. (Rica) is owned by two reputable Dominican Republic families: Brache and Caceras.    Project Cost Including proposed IFC investment    	The project cost is estimated at US$36.5 million of which IFC will provide a US$12 million senior A loan and a US$3 million subordinated C loan.    Location of project and Description of site    	Pasteurizadora Rica, the dairy and juice processing facility, is located on a 5 hectare site in the Dominican Republic capital Santo Domingo. The Lecheria San Antonio dairy farm is located on a 500 hectare site in Barahona on the southeast coast of the Dominican Republic. Consorcio citrus plantations are located in Central Dominican republic about 60 km to the northwest of Santo Domingo.    Description of Company and Purpose of Project    	Pasteurizadora Rica S.A. (Rica) is one of the Dominican Republic&apos;&apos;s foremost agribusiness companies in the processing of dairy and fruit juice industries. The company, which owns and operates two milk processing plants in Santo Domingo and Santiago and a citrus juice extraction plant in Villa Altagracia, employs modern processing technology. Rica sells over 75 product items, which may be grouped into seven categories: pasteurized and UHT milk, pasteurized and UHT juice, butter, cheese and yoghurt.   The project has five components which will support Rica&apos;&apos;s investment program (1999-2003): (i) expansion and de-bottlenecking of its milk and juice processing facilities; (ii) expansion of its distribution network; (iii) establishment of a modern dairy farm under a majority-owned joint venture with know-how from one of Florida&apos;&apos;s largest dairy operations; (iv) expansion of its existing orange groves by developing 600 hectares of new orange tree plantations; and (v) refinancing US$5 million of expensive local debt.   Through its involvement in the project IFC will assist Rica to improve its production efficiency and competitiveness and enable it to provide high quality dairy and fruit juice products to the Dominican Republic consumers at affordable prices. IFC will provide long term finance in a market where such funds are scarce.    Environmental Category and Issues    	This is a category B project and the following potential environmental, social, health and safety impacts of the project were analyzed: details of any land acquisition; air emissions; water use and waste water treatment; solid waste management; agrochemical use and Integrated Pest Management; hazardous materials use; relationship with dairy out-growers; and occupational health and safety.   Land to be developed at both the orange orchards and the Lecheria farm was formerly used for agriculture and development will not affect natural habitats. The use of these sites is via acquisition through private sale or long term lease, and there has been no economic displacement.   There are no significant air emissions from boilers at any of Rica&apos;&apos;s sites. Refrigeration systems are either ammonia (Consorcio site) or CFC-based. The sponsor will develop an emergency plan for the Consorcio site and has confirmed that use and disposal of CFCs at other sites conforms with Dominican Republic standards and the requirements of the Montreal Protocol.    Water supplies for the project are sustainable and appropriate permits have been obtained. Waste water treatment is not adequate at the Santo Domingo site and the sponsor will install a new waste water treatment works during the project. Waste water discharge arrangements for Lecheria and Consorcio are acceptable.    Solid waste is either applied to fields as fertilizer (manure from Lecheria), fed to cattle (citrus waste and whey) or disposed of to landfill. Agrochemical use at both the Consorcio and Lecheria sites will conform with local and international norms, and Integrated Pest Management approaches are being used at Consorcio. Hazardous material use and management conforms to WBG requirements. Rica obtains milk from approximately 70 out-grower dairy farmers in the Santiago and Santo Domingo areas and provides extension support to all suppliers. The sponsor will provide more advice and guidance on waste water/solid waste and other environmental management issues as part of the project.    Standard occupational health and safety measures are in place and appropriate training will be undertaken. The company currently does not have an HACCP (Hazard Awareness and Critical Control Point) but will develop one over the course of the project.       The  is from the InfoShop.
