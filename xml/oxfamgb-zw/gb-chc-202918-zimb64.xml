   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Initially, reducing the drudgery of certain care tasks and the time and labour required to complete tasks like laundry, fuel collection and cooking requires research and investment into the design of innovative technical solutions. In order to ensure that time per task is reduced and also that the time women, and girls in particular, spend on tasks, requires further shifts in attitudes and norms around gender roles thus enabling men and boys and women and girls to share care work more equitably. This can be achieved by targeting households directly through local training and outreach, but also by shaping wider public and popular opinion through broader awareness raising work with leaders, with the media and through commercial advertising.  Changing the debate about care, especially with decision -makers and policy makers require recognition and evidence of why care work is a significant issue for development, and why heavy and unequal care is problematic for Women&apos;s Economic Empowerment. It also requires practical guidance on &#x2018;how&apos; infrastructure and services can be tailored to address heavy and unequal care and to build wider alliances and capacity of organisations to generate large scale political will and commitments.  At the heart of the programme is innovation, and the opportunity to build a critical mass in practice (e.g. what&apos;s the latest technologies on low -cost, low -tech laundry facilities; who has tried to shift attitudes and gender roles about household work/men doing laundry) and to communicate &#x2018;our&apos; innovations &#x2018;out&apos; &#x2013; so that good practice is replicated beyond the immediate programme.   The diagram above outlines the top level summary of how the programme is structured. The project in Zimbabwe  will work across first three outcomes.  This is complimented by the four outcome which is reflected in PSIA60 in relation to cross -country and global learning within wider WE -Care programming, as well broader women&apos;s rights and WASH programming.
