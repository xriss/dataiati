   <narrative xml:lang="EN">CAFOD has no institutional presence in Burundi and Rwanda since March 2013 where he implemented a psycho-social and livelihoods program. However, CAFOD continues to support and implement a Peace-building program in the Great Lakes region in both countries including the DRC. For this reason and because of its contribution in socio economic activities in Burundi, CAFOD participated in CARITAS Burundi Country forum to mark her Golden Jubilee in December 2013. One of recommendations from the forum was to jointly implement common project  symbolizing fellowship between CARITAS from North and CARITAS Burundi. Agreed project was the construction of a specialized medical Center. Caritas Burundi project aims implementing construction of the administrative block and lavatory as well as sensitization, preventive education and diagnostics activities for gynecological and breast tumors lesions.  The project falls under the National Program for Health Development, and contributes to the reduction of morbidity and mortality; it is clear throughout his objectives that it contributes to improving the health of women and her development and we know that women is the pillar of sustainable development in Africa and in Burundi.
The project to be implemented will have as target group women in general, especially women who have already given birth and who have breastfed because tumors are usually observed among the women who have already given birth and women have breastfed babies. 
The project will be implemented in Gitega in the center of the country 110 km from the capital Bujumbura, more precisely in Mushasha neighborhood in the town of Gitega, near Cathedral of Gitega and in the province of Gitega.</narrative>
