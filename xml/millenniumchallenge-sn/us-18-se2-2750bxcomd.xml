  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In December 2018, MCC signed a compact to partner with the Government of Senegal to strengthen the power sector to meet the growing demand for reliable electricity for citizens and businesses. The Senegal Power Compact will support three projects focused on improving the transmission network in and around the capital of Dakar, increasing electricity access in agricultural areas of the south and central regions, and improving the overall governance of the sector. The compact also aims to increase private sector participation and help ensure that Senegal maximizes benefits from existing and future private investment. The Government of Senegal will contribute an additional $50 million to the compact to drive economic growth and progress.</narrative>
