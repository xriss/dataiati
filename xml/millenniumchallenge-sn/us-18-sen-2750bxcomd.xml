  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In September 2009, the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) signed a five-year, $540 million compact with the Republic of Senegal designed to reduce poverty and invest in economic growth by unlocking the country&apos;s agricultural productivity and expanding access to markets and services. This goal will be achieved through the rehabilitation of major national roads and strategic investments in irrigation and water resource management infrastructure. The Government of Senegal has identified two national-level strategies: to reduce poverty in Senegal through economic growth and to increase the country&apos;s food security. Both of these priorities will be facilitated through MCC&apos;s $540 million compact. For the most up-to-date information on implementation progress, please read the Quarterly Status Report.</narrative>
