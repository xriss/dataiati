   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project will target Nigerian police deployed to the target areas, community members (ensuring representation of the various demographic groups), local government authorities and other security actors. Though the focus of the project remains on the Nigerian Police, a preliminary desk review has identified key formal and informal security stakeholders who will need to be engaged. These include the military and civil defense corps, semi-formal vigilante groups like the Civilian Joint Task Force (CJTF), informal vigilante groups like the ?Yan Banga?, and various community groups affiliated with certain associations or religious groups and who conduct security functions (such as the ?Yan Agagi?- boy?s brigade who provide security during religious gatherings).</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The specific objectives are:

1.	Support community-based inclusive safety and security platforms for analysing, preventing and addressing violent conflict. 
2.	Enhance social cohesion within communities affected by violence

The project?s theory of change is that if community-based security stakeholders, particularly the police and civilians, are better coordinated, more inclusive and more accountable in their decision-making, then communities will be better able to manage security and conflict threats, thereby contributing to improved resilience, stabilisation and social cohesion.</narrative>
