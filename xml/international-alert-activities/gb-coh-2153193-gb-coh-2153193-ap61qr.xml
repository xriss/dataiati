   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The programme aims to contribute to sustainable peace and stability in North East Nigeria through increasing the resilience of communities affected by violent conflict. 

If stigma-reduction activities and awareness-raising efforts are increased AND social cohesion activities are provided to community members THEN reintegration of women and girls associated with Boko Haram and children born of sexual violence by Boko Haram will be improved and communities will be prepared to accept women, girls and their children into the social fabric THEREBY making individuals and communities more resilient to the negative impacts of protracted violent conflict. 

The focus of the programme is to build resilience in the girls and women, their families and communities, and religious leaders and community leaders as well as promote tolerance and acceptance of returnees to ensure a protective environment and safe supported return.</narrative>
