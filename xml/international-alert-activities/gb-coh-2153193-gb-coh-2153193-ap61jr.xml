   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Facilitating the Reintegration of women and girls as survivors of sexual violence by Boko Haram and Reconciliation of communities affected by Boko Haram in Northeast Nigeria</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">As a result of the insurgency in North East Nigeria, communities have suffered loss, trauma and divisions. Communities have been divided along religious, ethnic, linguistic, geographic lines and these divisions have also split families, with several cases of siblings from the same household joining conflicting groups including the army, the Civilian Joint Task Force (CJTF) and Boko Haram. 

The programme aims to contribute to sustainable peace and stability in North East Nigeria through increasing the resilience of communities affected by violent conflict. There is one overall project Theory of Change: If stigma-reduction activities and awareness-raising efforts are increased AND social cohesion activities are provided to community members THEN reintegration of women and girls associated with Boko Haram and children born of sexual violence by Boko Haram will be improved and communities will be prepared to accept women, girls and their children into the social fabric THEREBY making individuals and communities more resilient to the negative impacts of protracted violent conflict. 

The objectives of this Programme Cooperation Agreement (PCA) are in line with Federal Government of Nigeria and UNICEF&#xE2;&#x20AC;&#x2122;s Rolling Work Plan for Child Protection 2015-2016 &#xE2;&#x20AC;&#x201C; Enhance Protection and Response for Children Affected by Armed Conflict under Output 36 - and will contribute to the current UNICEF Nigeria Country Programme (2014-2017) child protection outcome.</narrative>
