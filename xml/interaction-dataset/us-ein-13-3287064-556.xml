  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In the coming 12 months, InterAction will design a Results-Based Protection Learning Network as a platform for operational humanitarian NGOs and interested donors (donor governments and private foundations) to invest in putting results-based methods for protection outcomes into practice and to share and document learning that arises from these efforts. This involves research of other models of communities of practice and innovation networks as well as consultations with key stakeholders to establish an agreed learning agenda and to develop the structure and membership criteria of the
Learning Network. 

Efforts to systematise results-based methods will be further reinforced through InterAction support for the implementation of the forthcoming IASC Protection Policy expected to be adopted in mid-2016, in particular to catalyze early momentum for NGO engagement in its roll out and implementation in key country contexts. The expectation is that this will set the tone, expectations and impetus for rigorous policy implementation in the medium to longer term.

Lastly, InterAction seeks to enhance the U.S. policy discourse on the protection of civilians by convening key policy stakeholders on critical protection concerns faced  in current crises. The roundtables and the outcome reports from each roundtable  are expected to help ensure that the specific protection issues selected are addressed by policy makers and humanitarian actors in an informed manner and with a view to maximising measures to mitigate civilian harm.</narrative>
