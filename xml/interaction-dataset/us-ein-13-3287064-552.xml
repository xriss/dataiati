   <narrative xml:lang="EN">An Independent Assessment of USAID&apos;s Partner Vetting System Pilot</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">On July 27th 2015 USAID released the final rule for the pilot Partner Vetting System program in five pilot countries. The rule requires U.S. NGOs receiving funding from USAID to collect personal information from key employees in their own organization as well as partners who are sub-recipients, sub-sub-recipients of USAID grants and in some cases even beneficiaries. This information is then compared to information found in the U.S. government&apos;s classified national intelligence databases. Any positive match requires the intelligence databases to be updated with this information. 

At its core, PVS is meant to ensure that U.S. government funds are not diverted to organizations or individuals deemed to be a threat to U.S. national security. InterAction members agree with this sentiment and also strongly believe that funds (government and private alike) should be effectively delivered to people in need and not diverted to terrorists or other bad actors. In fact, InterAction members practice due diligence to ensure the appropriate use of funds and maintain our reputation as legitimate actors in many dangerous parts of the world. However, the major concern of U.S. NGOs is how PVS is formulated and implemented. 

After one year of the pilot PVS program, on August 2016, InterAction will deliver an independent assessment of how PVS affects NGO operations in the pilot countries in relation to the security of NGO staff, local partners, and vendors; the ability of NGOs to build and maintain trust and positive relationships among partners; and the ability for NGOs to efficiently and effectively deliver assistance. The report will use qualitative and quantitative data to display that PVS is harmful and unnecessary with the ultimate goal of preventing PVS from being implemented globally outside of the pilot countries. If USAID does implement PVS globally, NGOs aim to ensure that their major concerns are adequately addressed.</narrative>
