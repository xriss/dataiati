    <narrative xml:lang="EN">More than 1400 people (young women and girls, community members, government officials) participated in public events (football matches, community theatre, meettosleep)&#xA0;organised by partner organisations in India. The football matches enabled the young girls and women to challenge the restrictive norms that prevent them from accessing public spaces and resources.&#xA0; 45 Public events using sports, arts and performances were organised in India to challenge the criminalization of identities, oppressive norms of gender and sexuality, sexualities and bodily autonomy that lead to exclusion and violence in public spaces. Led by girls, women and other marginalised groups, these events (meet to sleep, school and college events- debates and poster making, theatre performances on gender roles, sexuality and identity and violence and discrimination against all women) brought artists and activists together to challenge discriminatory attitudes and practices that make public spaces unsafe and inaccessible for all people. Around 2000 people (women, girls, community members, leaders, EWR&#x2019;s, Health service providers, government officials) participated in public events in India. During small and large scale events such as rallies, theatre performances, football tournaments, there were discussions around patriarchy, violence against women (in consonance with the recent cases in India), child marriage, limited accessibility and mobility to public spaces and equal opportunities for all people</narrative>
