    <narrative xml:lang="EN">Due to COVID 19, one of the key impacts has been in the health sector where health services have come under increasing pressure to treat COVID clients. As a result, many of the ongoing and much-needed services related to SRHR and SGBV have become unavailable for many people particularly women and young people. There has also been an increase in SGBV and women and others facing violence are unable to seek help and health care needs that arise as a result of violence. In response to this CREA partnering with Gram Vaani with support from the Family Planning Association of India (FPAI), one of the largest NGO providers of SRHR and SGBV services in India, took up and resolved cases on SRHR and SGBV. The additional feature being added to the KAB platform - Case Manager &#x2013; and was a collaborative process of assessment, planning, facilitation, care coordination, and services to meet an individual&#x2019;s SRHR and SGBV need.</narrative>

     <narrative xml:lang="EN">The case manager is grounded on core principles of client safety, privacy, and confidentiality, quality of care, and ensuring cost-effective outcomes. The case manager includes options for users to leave their questions/queries/grievances related to SRHR or SGBV and to be able to connect to one of FPAI&#x2019;s counselors or doctors for online consultation and quick and safe resolution of the problem faced by them. The case manager has a system through which a client query will be assigned to an appropriate counselor or doctor who will reply to the query and if needed also provide in-person consultation.</narrative>
