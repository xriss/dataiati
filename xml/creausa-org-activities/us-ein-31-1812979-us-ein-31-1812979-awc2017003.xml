    <narrative xml:lang="EN">The online campaign which highlighted locally driven initiatives to address gender-based violence. Using graphic narratives, &quot;Drawing Resistance and Resilience&quot; aimed to depict how marginalized communities have organized, intervened and resisted issues of violence along with highlighting powerful stories of change and learnings especially in the current COVID-19 context. We worked with six illustrators from the global South to depict these stories of resilience. The illustrated stories explored broad themes of gender-based violence, queer mental health issues, sex workers&#x2019; rights, access to essentials and justice and more.</narrative>

     <narrative xml:lang="EN">As AWC sees great value in community driven efforts to address challenges in their community and has been doing capacity building for the same over the consortium period, this campaign highlighted and depicted through art how communities have organized, intervened and resisted issues of violence on-ground; bringing out some very powerful learning and recommendations of leading change during crisis situations like the current COVID pandemic. AWC collected 9 stories to capture these stories and learning, which was graphically presented by illustrators and shared through social media and print editions.
The campaign on social media saw activists, artists, community led organizations getting engaged and resonating stories with their lives.</narrative>

     <narrative xml:lang="EN">The campaign highlighted learnings:
&#x2022;	Need and availability of digital platforms to provide info on violence and redressal mechanisms during crisis times like this pandemic and working quickly to adapt it to address the need of the hour.
&#x2022;	To make available transport services to increase the community&#x2019;s access to emergency medical services, seek justice and public spaces for essential needs.
&#x2022;	Safe space creation and support services to address homeslesness and protection from violence.
&#x2022;	Making online mental health support available so that it is accessible in crisis times like the current pandemic.
&#x2022;	The pandemic has led to exacerbated impacts on queer people increasing their vulnerablity to violence, finacial, psychologial and health risks. There is a lack of data and research on documenting these stories on marginalisation and GBV. Initiatives to record, archive and research to create data, conversations and guide interventions to address the issues
&#x2022;	A major impact of the pandemic leading to increased vulnerability to violence, rape, HIV and other infections for sex workers due to the nature of their work and its criminalization in countries. Making them further vulnerable to police brutalities and arbitrary arrests. Working to sensitize and support government authorities and law enforcement agencies was helpful.</narrative>
