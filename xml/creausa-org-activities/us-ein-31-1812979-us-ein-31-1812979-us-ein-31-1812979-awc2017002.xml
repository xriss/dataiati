    <narrative xml:lang="EN">5 issue/theme based animated videos were created under thes eries title name &apos;SELF expression&apos;. The theme on which vides have been developed are on: Safe spaces, access to public spaces, negotiating life choices, Girls and tech and girls and sports. Each of these videos capture complex nuances of the girls&apos; experiences through the SELF academy journey and what they shared about their experience. The videos are made using the girls&apos; voices from interviews and the comics they created as part of the academy. Hence, these videos tell the girls&apos; stories in their own voices. The videos give valuable insight into the various topics the girls discussed during the academies, what information they gained, conversations and debates had for the first time, tabboo topics that were spoken about openly, how they took back some of these learnings to negotiate in their everyday lives, a safe space of sharing and non-judgemental learning along with fun and sports! The videos showcase strong narratives of how the participants became aware of their rights and how gender based role expectations restrict and influence their lives, how they worked through these in the academy, often taking the process back home with them and creating ripple effects at home/community spaces. Girls have pushed back against power structures of family and community and negotiated access to technology, spoken out against violence, right to their sexual identity, mobility, bodily intergrity and well-being.</narrative>

     <narrative xml:lang="EN">Due to Covid-19 restrictions the academy could not be organised in-person and could not be conducted virtually due to lack of digital access and literacy. CREA then adapted this to create resources and knoweldge products developed by using resources from past SELF Academies. The reources used in making those videos were: comics made by girls in the acdemy, recorded audio monologues of girls in their own voice. The videos were created on the most crucial themes in girls&apos; lives that were addressed in-depth in the academy. These have helped capture the girl&apos;s learnings, negotiations and experience vis-a-vis the different themesduring their journey of the SELF Academy.These will also be valuable resources for work and advocacy with adolescent girls, going forward.</narrative>
