   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Our Voices Our Futures (OVOF) has seen the results of working with artists, media and cultural workers. It helps shift  mental models around gender and sexuality, and disrupts stigma steeped in bias and  prejudice. OVOF partners have (effectively) used art and arts-based public campaigns (for  example, film festivals) to change the way people think about highly stigmatised topics such  as sex work, both within feminist movements and in society. Art has the power to reach  people beyond activist circles and across country borders. Shifting social norms around  gender and sexuality (both within and outside movements) is critical to OVOF and its work with artists.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">1) In India, partnership between Jamia Millia Islamia and CREA to generate content for a weekly radio (hence, in audio format) program slot for Radio Jamia 90.4 FM was launched on August 3rd, 2021 and has since been airing episodes on a weekly basis. The thematic focus of the content is gender equality and women&#x2019;s empowerment and rights. The primary audience for this programming is the community (students, faculty and support staff on campus) as well as women and other members of the community outside the campus. In each episode members of the community and/or experts are invited to engage with the theme in question. A total of 8 episodes were aired during this reporting period. Content was centered on themes such as sports and gender, disability and accessibility and body image issues.

2) In India, CREA partner Chambal Media has produced &#x2018;Bolenge Bulwayenge Haskar Sab Keh Jayenge&#x2019; (We&#x2019;ll make you open your mouths and say it, in good humour!), a first-of-its-kind feminist show and a path-breaker for rural Uttar Pradesh that was launched under OVOF in October 2020. Anchored by KL Senior Reporter Nazni Rizvi, this is a vox-pop-format fortnightly show that sees Nazni hit the streets of rural and small town U.P., asking men and women &#x201C;uncomfortable&#x201D; questions that are stemmed in the entrenched patriarchal structures and behaviours of culture, reflected in rituals and practices that are our lived realities.

3) In Bangladesh, BRAC JPGSPH organized one capacity building workshop for the LGBTIQ+ artists. The objective of these workshops is to develop the capacity of the LGBTIQ+ artists on how to use art as an advocacy tool to document the lived realities and struggle of the LBTQ women Living in Bangladesh. LGBTIQ+ people are criminalized in Bangladesh under the penal code 377 and in addition to that the conservative sociopolitical context of Bangladesh does not approve any visible activism on LGBTIQ+ rights. The community faced brutal murder in 2016 and still facing violence and death threat from extremists. Government also doesn&#x2019;t allow any visible activity from the LGBTIQ+ platforms to avoid any kind of protest from the extremist groups. In this situation, art can be a safest medium for the activists to express their existence to the bigger audience in a safer manner. For this activity, artists from the LGBTIQ+ was recruited from an open call in different LGBTIQ+ Facebook groups. After reviewing the application and an interview process, we have recruited 12 LGBTIQ+ artists who are being trained on telling the challenges and lived realities of LBTQ women through their artwork. In these capacity building workshops, Bangladesh and South Asia based queer artists are taking several sessions with our participants, to give them hand on orientation on how art can be used as an advocacy tool to create the LGBTIQ+ movement in this region. This capacity building workshops will open the avenue for our participants to use their skill for the LGBTIQ+ activism and this cohort of &#x201C;Advocacy Through Art&#x201D; program will be working as a creative workforce in the field of Bangladeshi LGBTIQ+ movement.</narrative>
