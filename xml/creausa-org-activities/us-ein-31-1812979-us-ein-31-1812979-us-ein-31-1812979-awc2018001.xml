     <narrative xml:lang="EN">52 Public events using sports, arts and performances were organised in India to make atrocities against marginalised community (women, girls, LBTQ, Sex workers, PWD, ST and SCs categories) visual. COVID-19 came with increase in Gender based violence, the whole of 16 days activism campaign was planned and challenged the social norms like- access to technology is meant only for men, SRHR must be ensured always, criminalization of identities, oppressive norms of gender and sexuality, sexualities and bodily autonomy that lead to exclusion and violence during Pandemic. Led by girls, women and other marginalised groups, these events  brought grassroot, community based organisations, artists and activists together to challenge discriminatory attitudes and practices that made Pandemic unsafe and inaccessible for all people and which also shrunk the safe, peasurable, collective, cathartic space</narrative>
     <narrative xml:lang="EN">Around 3600 people (women, girls, community members, leaders, EWR&#x2019;s, Health service providers, government officials, Sex workers, LBTQ, PWD) participated in the campaign events in India. During small and large scale events such as street plays, football tournaments, seminars, small group meetings in the community focused on GBV during Pandemic, there were discussions around patriarchy, violence against women (in consonance with the Pandemic), child marriage, limited accessibility and mobility to public spaces and equal opportunities for all people.</narrative>
