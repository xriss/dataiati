   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Emergency Response to Conflict and Drought Affected IDPs and Host Communities in Kunduz Province - ES/NFI</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Due to an escalation of conflict norther east region, many people are arriving in Kunduz city and surrounding areas, seeking safety from the conflict and other threats. Authorities initially reported around 35,000 people had been displaced due to armed conflict in Khanabad and Aliabad districts in Kunduz province since 22 May. Between 22 May and 16 June, 35,000 people were assessed, and some 22,000 people have been verified as needing humanitarian assistance. Food, water, non-food items, hygiene kits and WASH assistance are the most urgent needs for the affected people. Distributions of humanitarian assistance are underway, reaching over 7,000 people so far.
Fleeing with nothing more than personal possessions, many of these IDPs remain vulnerable. The situation is more pronounced for people staying outside in open spaces who are at risk of additional health and protection concerns. (Reference: UNOCHA Flash Update No.2 dated 16 June 2021)
Affected IDPs and host communities from Conflict and Natural disaster in the Kunduz as mentioned in the need assessment survey report are living in open spaces and damaged shelters expose to protection hazards and upcoming harsh winter. In the said targeted area there are the high vulnerability level in the targeted areas and need support in order to increase the coping mechanism and reduce suffering in the upcoming winter 2021 - 2022. An estimated huge number of HHs were internally and externally displaced due to recent conflict and natural disaster (Drought) within/from the districts. Some of them have already returned back to their place of origin but due to the shrinkage of the existing resources they face critical issues and are severely vulnerable to the upcoming winter especially children, women, and people with disability and people with poor economic condition. Due to the limited resources, remoteness and accessibility, most people live in dire poverty. 
This project focuses on three key elements of OCHR&#x2019;s emergency shelter program that are aligned with and included in the 2018-2021 Humanitarian Response Plan, including, (1) Cash for up-grading shelters for 205 HHs, integrated with (2) Cash for Rent (CfR) for 100 households in the north east region complimentary to shelter up-grading and also (3) Distribution of 900 ES/NFI Cluster standard winter assistance packages (blankets and winter clothing) to increase the coping mechanism and reduce suffering in the upcoming winter 2021 &#x2013; 2022. This project will reach to 1205 HHs affected by conflict and natural disaster including IDPs returned to the place of origin as well as affected non-displaced HHs in Kunduz city, Char Dara and Qala-e-Zal districts of Kunduz province. The cash for shelter up-grading assistance will be provided to IDPs returned to the place of origin and non-displaced affected HHs, the CfR assistance will be provided to IDP HHs only, and Standard winter assistance packages will be provided to most vulnerable affected HHs expose to upcoming harsh winter. 
OCHR will select the target beneficiaries in a transparent manner to ensure that the most affected receive the assistance. The selection will be done in the presence of the community elders, local authorities and UNOCHA office based in Kunduz. OCHA is a coordinating body at regional there and OCHR experiences reveals that coordination with OCHA specifically help in avoiding duplication of the response. The project duration will be 6 months.
OCHR&#x2019;s goal is to empower people to live with dignity, able to respond successfully to disasters, risks, and opportunities. the experience of implementing various emergency response projects in the region, and knowledge in technical and managerial issues will give an extra advantage to OCHR in implementing this project. OCHR rolled out a similar ongoing project from START-FUND UK in Kunduz province providing ES/NFI items, Food, Nutrition and WASH assistance to 500 IDPs HHs. The project is recently completed on 20 Aug 2021.</narrative>
