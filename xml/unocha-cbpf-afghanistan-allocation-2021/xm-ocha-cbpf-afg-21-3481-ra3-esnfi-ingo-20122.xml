   <narrative xml:lang="EN">ESNFI assistance for conflict affected people in Kunduz and Nangarhar</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The full impact of the recent takeover of power by the Taliban on humanitarian needs is not yet clear. However, because of the high level of conflict during the past months, civilian casualties, and displacement reported until date have been considerably higher than previously, humanitarian needs including ESNFI needs are likely to have increased significantly. Assessments in Kunduz in July and Nangarhar in June and July, conducted prior to the Taliban take-over, confirm the gaps and needs mentioned in the ESNFI 3rd reserve allocation and are in line with the HRP 2021 and ESNFI cluster allocation priorities. Needs are multi-sectoral and exacerbated by the escalating conflict and COVID-19, driving up prices and increasing food insecurity. In the selected provinces, the conflict has caused wide-scale loss of lives and livelihoods, including abandoned fields, destroyed houses and infrastructure. Because of the conflict people were also unable to harvest. In Kunduz 95.5% of HH have a LCS &#x2018;emergency&#x2019;, lack NFIs as none of the HH reportedly had sufficient NFIs. Most of the interviewed people were living in make-shift shelters, increasing protection and health risks. In Nangarhar, there is a high need for shelter upgrades and NFIs as 93% and 76% of the people respectively still require shelter and NFI assistance. People lack jobs and there are limited livelihood opportunities and cannot afford to meet their daily basic needs. Previous assessments showed there were no HH NFIs. 
The take-over by the Taliban will reduce the conflict and some people will return to their place of origin. However, people&#x2019;s reserves have been depleted long before and those returning tot their damaged shelter will not be able to afford repairs. With many people still living in makeshift shelters, and unable to return need urgent assistance. The lean season and winter are arriving in 3 months, and temperatures will drop well below zero in Kunduz in particular, making people even more vulnerable, especially women (incl. PLW), children, PWD and people with (chronical) illness. People need assistance now, enabling them to overcome the shock or return to their place of origin when possible, and get prepared for winter. In line with the AHF 3rd RA Strategy, HRP 2018-2021 SO1 and SO3, Cordaid together with partners RRAA and OWH propose to provide cash for shelter repair/ upgrade and cash for NFIs in priority areas Kunduz and Nangarhar. In Kunduz (Kunduz City, Khan Abad, Ali Abad) Cordaid and OHW will target with cash for repair 330 HH with category B damaged houses, and 240 HH with category C damaged houses. 660 HH will receive cash for NFIs. In Nangarhar (Achin, Speen Ghar, Nazyan), 220 HH with category B and 160 HH with category C damaged houses will be targeted by Cordaid and RRAA. And 440 HH will receive cash for NFIs. Following the ESNFI cluster recommended standard modalities, HH with category B damaged houses will receive $500 in 2 instalments and HH with category C damaged houses will receive $300 in 2 instalments as well. The level of damage is assessed by using a shelter score card. Selected cash for NFI HH will receive $105 in one transfer. The cash will be delivered in local currency through a FSP in the form of cash in envelop delivery mechanism (if banks and FSP are operational). 
The project is designed based on recent assessments and presence in both areas, showing clear needs and gaps for the proposed assistance. Cordaid and partners have been providing assistance in both areas already and are in coordination with other organisations. To avoid overlap and duplication, Cordaid and partners will coordinate the proposed response with other organisations on the ground, through its participation with ECHO ERM and UNOCHA including the clusters. This will also ensure complementarity of activities as people have multiple needs. Cordaid and partners will follow the Joint Operating Principles (annex 10) in the delivery of the assistance.</narrative>
