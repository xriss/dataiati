   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Emergency WASH Response in Kandahar, Zabul and Hilmand provinces</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The proposed project will provide WASH response with elements of immediate and durable solutions in Arghandab, Panjwayi, Zheray of Kanddahar, Shah Joi, Qalat amp Tarnak Wa Jaldak of Zabul and Lashkargah, Nowa-e-Barakzai and Grishk(Nahr-e-Saraj) of Helmand provinces. These 9 districts are among the 32 districts identified by the WASH Cluster that have the most need for this support. The project is mainly providing facilities for WASH practice among the most vulnerable, disaster affected and suffering communities from high cases of water and vector borne diseases. Gender, protection and safe programming is mainstreamed in this project design, implementation, monitoring amp evaluation phases across all activities. 

The project will directly support (12985 household ) 90990 people (11357men	23927 women	27398 boys 	28308 girls), in the targeted 9 districts by providing access to safe water for drinking amp domestic use, sanitary latrine to those who need the most and finally by motivating them to change their behavior regarding hygiene at personal, family amp community level. The proposed project will enable the population to reduce health risks from water amp vector borne diseases, reduce the treatment cost and loss of earning/employment due to illnesses, decrease time spent fetching water amp most critically it will reduce challenges to the health amp dignity of women and girls&#x2019; due to lack of sanitation facilities. 
The project will be implemented in close collaboration with other stakeholders including the WASH cluster, MRRD, local government, community leaders, other NGOs and most importantly women amp men in the target communities. 
Besides hygiene awareness, women and men in the target communities will be provided with awareness raising on their human rights, especially in context of gender based violence, the ways of reducing GBV and ways of asking for support in case of any protection concerns (referral). In coordination with WASH and Health clusters, HAPA will integrate community, school, household level messages in its Hygiene promotion sessions for increased awareness about COVID19 and preventative measures to prevent the communities from spread of the virus. 

HAPA will integrate conflict sensitivity into the action, by conducting context and conflict analysis of the target areas. This is especially important as the location of water sources and selection of households for sanitary latrines can create potential new conflict or exacerbating existing tensions. Field based project teams will monitor community responses, changes to the context during the project period and adapt activities to ensure conflict sensitivity where necessary. This will be done via tried and tested transparency, communication amp accountability mechanisms .HAPA will also disseminate and share COVID19 message with beneficiary for raising awareness in all the target location. The standard messages developed by WHO amp MoPH will be used in local languages.
The project will be directly implemented by HAPA in Kandahar, Zabul and Helmand provinces and Project Manager and Monitoring Officer from Kandahar as well as Programme, MEAL, Finance, Logistics amp Security department staff will visit them regularly and on need. All the components of the project in Kandahar, Zabul and Helmand provinces will be implemented by HAPA based on its cross root level access to targeted provinces and its districts. HAPA based on its professional experience in the field of WASH and received number of trainings in the field of WASH and other sectors by WASH Cluster technical staff in the past. HAPA has years of presence in Kandahar, Zabul and Helmand provinces and gained good community acceptance. Through this project HAPA will improve localization of aid, building the capacity of local WASH committees, amp early capacitating under this project. In this HAPA will reach more number of beneficiaries in previous hard to access areas.</narrative>
