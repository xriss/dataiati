   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Deployment of Mobile Health and Nutrition Teams (MHNTs) in Parwan and Panjshir Provinces</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">CAF-OPHA deploys MHNTs to expand humanitarian access and response in underserved and hardest-to-reach locations for Nutrition in Charikar, Jabalussaraj, Bagram, and Surkh-e-Parsa districts of Parwan and in Bazarak and Abshar districts of Panjshir provinces to successfully achieve the project&apos;s intended objectives and target indicators. The project mainly focuses on children under five years and pregnant and lactating women (PLW) through six mobile health and nutrition teams (MHNTs), two in Panjshir and four in Parwan provinces. These MHNTs will provide nutrition screening, growth monitoring, IYCF counseling to PLWs, treatment of SAM (MUAC less than 11.5 or WHZ less than -3SD) and MAM (MUAC between 11.5 and 12.5 cm or WHZ between -3SD and -2SD) cases, micronutrient supplementation, and referral of severely acute malnutrition to a comprehensive nutrition center. Also, the MHNTs provide ANC, PNC, promotion of institutional delivery, IMCI, and immunization services by the trained midwife, nurse, and vaccinator in the catchment areas of each service delivery point. The MHT structure consists of a Male doctor/nurse, a nutrition counselor, a midwife, and a vaccinator to cover all the services provides by the MHNTs. The project management team (project officer, supervisor, and operation officer) can efficiently and transparently manage the project with the support and liaison of CAF-OPHA&apos;s management team. Required equipment, medical and non -medical supply, ambulance, IEC, and health/nutrition promotion materials will be provided to the project. Simultaneously, we will further support the referral of severely ill cases from the community to the nearest health facilities. Also, CAF-OPHA builds and maintains close coordination with the public health directorate of the two provinces by signing MOUs. As per the comments of AHF review committee, we coordinated with OCCD for deployment of MHNTs in Panjshir districts to prevent the overlaps. Also, we revised the scope of services (removed psychosocial counselor) at the MHNTs based on MHNT guideline and committee comments. We will hire vehicles to provide mobile services for the teams. As a cross-cutting matter in this assignment, CAF-OPHA will consider the minimum gender marker code within the proposed projects. We will ensure that gender equality and gender awareness activities are mainstreamed within the scope of the project. CAF-OPHA conducts regular supervision, monitoring, coaching, and mentoring of the MHNTs to ensure the quality of services as per the standards and project requirements. Accordingly, women, men, boys, and girls of all ages including the people with disability will benefit equally from the proposed interventions. A total of 129,718 individuals in the host communities of Parwan and Panjshir provinces will directly benefit from the project. This figure consists of 53129 males over five and 51574 females over five for OPD services, 2617 boys and girls under one years for vaccination, 7069 caregivers of children 0-23 for IYCF, 3211 children 6-59 months for SAM, 4279 children 6-59 for MAM, 2185 PLWs for acute malnutrition, and 5654 children 6-59 for MMNPs. One of the project&apos;s sustainability aspects is capacity building of the local staff on health and nutrition interventions within the provinces.</narrative>
