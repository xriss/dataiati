   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Provision of Emergency Lifesaving Nutrition Services in the drought at risk provinces</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The proposed project aims at ensuring delivery of adequate lifesaving nutrition and health services, including the malnutrition treatment in the drought at risk districts in Herat, Ghor and Badghis provinces. The disruption of nutrition service provision due overburdened health facilities is expected to deteriorate the nutrition status of children. In addition, the poor access to health facilities deprived a large number of population and exposed them to the risk of disease and malnutrition. World Vision (WV) Intends to deliver the required nutrition services through the establishment of 3 Mobile Health and Nutrition teams in the drought at risk districts Injil in Herat, Firozkoh and Charsdah in Ghor and Ghormach in Badghis provinces. Health care providers under these MHNTs will receive proper IMAM training (Integrated Management of Acute Malnutrition) to ensure high quality nutrition serviced delivered to the clients.The community health structure will be used on active case detection of malnourished cases and active referral to the MHNTs. Frontline Health Providers will receive the Mental Health and Psychosocial (MHPSS) training based on the mhGAP and Afghanistan MoPH MHPSS guideline and ensure the clients received proper MHPSS curative and counseling services. World Vision will also focus on Health Shura, CHWs, Family Health action Groups and orient them about the project scope of work as well as to learn key Maternal Infant and Young Child Feeding and nutrition (MIYCN) to increase community awareness on key respective practices. Furthermore, the proposed project will work to strengthen the capacity of Family Health Action Groups, female volunteers and CHWs in Infant and Young Child Feeding to promote key IYCF practices and counselling based on the WHO guideline under the COVID-19 circumstances. These groups will be trained to respond to the question of key community members and women in childbearing ages in relation on promotion of breastfeeding and to be able to respond to any questions that may be asked by each member of the community. The project will focus on early action to avoid severe malnutrition so the project will cover the, borderline&#x2019; cases of acute malnutrition through prevention-oriented services such as counselling on optimal care practices to mothers of children who are borderline in terms of their Mid-Upper Arm Circumference (MUAC). This approach has potential to reduce the risk of rapid deterioration of the nutritional status of children with a MUAC result of 12.5-13.5 cm. This will be done at the MHNTs level by nutrition nurse and at the community level by community nutrition promoters. The adaptation mechanism will be taken into consideration during any capacity building efforts, IYCF promotion session based on the WHO/MOPH and WV Standard Operating Procedure for training, public gatherings, IEC distribution under the COVID-19 circumstances. The project will focus on the provision of lifesaving referral for those cases that require inpatient services and will ensure that a transportation and treatment facility are provided for them. 

WV attends the EPR meetings on a weekly basis and will update the key actors including DoPH, OCHA and WHO on the project progress the project report will be shared on a weekly and monthly basis to the key nutrition cluster focal points and DEWS surveillance focal points. In the EPR meetings, various issues are discussed such as places where the new MHNTs should operate and take proper measures to avoid overlap of same interventions. The project will use the community health promoter and nutrition nurses to record all the children with disabilities as well as disabled PLWs in a separate registration book and ensure they receive proper medical assessment and receive curative and counseling health and nutrition services. Through GIK WV will distribute the wheel-chair to them and ensure MHNT are friendly enough for the children and PLWs with disability.</narrative>
