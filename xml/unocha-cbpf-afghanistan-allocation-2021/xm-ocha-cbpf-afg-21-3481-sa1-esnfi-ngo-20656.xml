  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">According to the AHF 1st Standard Allocation for winterization emergency assistance, for the affected people by drought, natural disasters, COVID-19 is the main factor causing vulnerabilities during the winter season. CAHPO&#x2019;s proposed intervention is an emergency delivery intended to ensure a timely and effective winterization response to needy people in priority areas in the mentioned provinces. The intervention will focus to meet the urgent humanitarian needs of IDPs and host vulnerable populations as well as those who return back and seeking to receive ESNFI assistance in provinces. 
Through the intervention, CAHPO intended to support 1050 affected families to save their lives through the provision of immediate delivery assistance with the provision of in-kind heating items, winter clothing, and blankets (Theme 1 amp 2 in this allocation). The project supports 7350 most vulnerable beneficiaries (4384 in Zabul districts Arghandab amp Tarnak va Jeldak, 2966 in Ghazni of Gelan). The number of beneficiaries for each type of activity will be determined based on the initial assessment in these two provinces, briefly mentioned under &#x201C;needs assessment section below and for detail Annex 01 the assessment report. 
Providing support in kind is more favorable for many vulnerable families who will be targeted such as PWD, female/child-headed families, and elderly headed in the target areas, at least 32% of the total beneficiaries will prioritize Pregnant and Lactating Women in this intervention. CAHPO will distribute the project items at the nearest possible location to selected families and will coordinate with the nutrition partner agency about Pregnant and Lactating women. 
CAHPO will select and identify the beneficiary with the proper selection using the vulnerability Cluster Criteria. CAHPO male and female staff members will be involved to ensure the engagement of population in the selection process that the most vulnerable people in need are prioritized for the winterization, including female-headed household child-headed household disabled headed household elderly headed household very large family (9 members or more) very poor families families with chronically- ill members or having other pressing vulnerability. The project items will be procured under the supervision of the committee and will be delivered to identified beneficiaries by the distribution committee. CAHPO will properly coordinate the implementation process with all actors in the area as it was coordinated in the planning stage. Post-distribution monitoring will be conducted with a sample of beneficiary households. CAHPO integrates the CHS commitments to ensure that any negative impact that the project could have on women, men, and children will be timely identified and addressed by the project team. Complaints and feedback handling mechanism of CAHPO will give chance to all the people claim for their rights and benefit from the intervention. 
Coordination about the proposed activities and locations took place through relevant ESNFI and AHF partners during the proposal development to avoid duplication of services. CAHPO has been present in the targeted provinces since 2013, familiar in the areas through active communication among the community for humanitarian and development purposes which will contribute to the effective implementation of the project. 
COVID-19 pandemic is still a threatening phenomenon, all measures according to WHO and Health sector guidance will be considered during the implementation and awareness will be provided to beneficiaries. The project has mainstreamed themes related to the COVID pandemic and protection-related issues. The COVID-19 and Protection sessions will take place at the distribution site according to WHO and Protection Cluster standards.</narrative>
