   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Provide cash for protection to address immediate needs of displaced vulnerable Afghan returnees, IDPs, and host communities facing drought and other emergencies</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">With the support of this AHF funding, UNHCR will disburse cash assistance amounting to AFN 15,500 (approximately USD 201.2987 per family) to 1,550 protection-vulnerable households among IDPs, returnees and host communities most adversely impacted (by virtue of their profile) by a potential drought, continued conflict, and ongoing COVID-19 pandemic which exacerbate existing difficult socio-economic conditions in the country.
UNHCR will utilize two approaches to identify the most in-need. Recipients will be identified through validation of existing data and in-person assessments. Over the past years, UNHCR has conducted in-person vulnerability/needs assessments for populations of concern across the country for different cash-based and in-kind programmes including shelter, support to persons with specific needs and winterization, among others. The vulnerability profiles of these former cash recipients are consolidated, updated and maintained by UNHCR. Remote (phone-based) interviews will be conducted to validate the profiles of those for whom UNHCR has data, while in-person assessments will be conducted for households with the targeted profiles residing in the most impacted areas that have not been previously assessed or assisted by UNHCR. Data from Community-Based Protection Monitoring conducted through UNHCR regular programs to monitor protection risks and concerns at the individual and community level, will enable UNHCR to identify such areas. Upon identification of most impacted areas, a dedicated tool will be used to validate, identify, and assess these targeted households. 
Community elders are included for verification of selected recipients. Beneficiary Advisory Committee (BAC) are usually established for CfS. AWAAZ and UNHCR hotline numbers are provided are provided for recipients to raise concerns. Also, where possible, UNHCR also receives a primary/initial list from community leaders in some locations the lists are verified and included in the potential list for assessment based on the vulnerability and score card.
All households with the targeted specific profiles will be scored as per the categorical selection criteria. Households will be assigned a score of ten (10) for each risk/vulnerability profile at the household representative level and a score of five (5) for each risk occurrence within the household. Each household&#x2019;s score will then be aggregated and ranked in order of priority. Three levels of prioritization are envisaged: 1st, 2nd, and 3rd. Assistance will be disbursed to households according to their prioritization category. 
UNHCR will cover partner costs for in-person assessments and remote validation interviews, including Reconstruction, Health and Humanitarian Assistance (HEWAD), Coordination of Humanitarian Assistance (CHA), HRDA and BEST, all of whom have existing partnership agreements with UNHCR. The cash assistance will be delivered by a Financial Service Provider (FSP). UNHCR has ongoing cash-based programmes targeted for a cross-section of populations-in-need and existing distribution sites across the country will be utilized. Efforts to limit transmission of COVID-19 include organizing distribution into smaller distributions over several days, provision of facilities for handwashing and wearing PPE. 
UNHCR is responsible for disseminating information on the amounts, frequency, distribution points, dates and times for payments through phone calls and existing community leadership structures. During the distribution, the recipient will receive a brief awareness session including information regarding the complaints and feedback mechanism. Moreover, UNHCR staff and/or partner staff conduct KOBO based MSP performance monitoring per distribution exercise. The performance evaluations serve UNHCR and MSP&#x2019;s quarterly evaluation, in which issues are discussed and follow up plan are scheduled including strategies on prevention of abuse of power by FSP staff around the country.</narrative>
