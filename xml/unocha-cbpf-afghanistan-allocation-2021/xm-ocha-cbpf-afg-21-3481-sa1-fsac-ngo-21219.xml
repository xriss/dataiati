  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The 2021 update3 to the Afghanistan HRP 2018 - 2021 seeks USD 1.3 billion to reach 15.7 million people with emergency life-saving humanitarian and protection assistance across the country. The strategic objectives of the HRP focus on &quot;lives are saved in the areas of highest needs.&quot; The multiple challenges facing the people of Afghanistan in spring 2021, including La Ni&#xF1;a-induced climatic anomalies, intensifying conflict, new and protracted internal displacement, and the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, are exacerbating the pre-existing needs and vulnerabilities of millions of Afghans already dealing with the consequences of 40 years of war.

The main purpose of the AHF 1st Standard Allocation 2021 is to provide urgently needed funds for strictly prioritized life-saving humanitarian assistance in Afghanistan. The initially approved total value of this allocation is US$105 million including a specific allocation to national non-governmental organizations (NGO) of US$5 million. As of September, and October 2021, 19 million people are facing a crisis or emergency levels of food insecurity (IPC 3 and 4). Assessments denote that even after harvest, 57 percent of households do not have food reserves that would last for 3 months. In urban areas, income loss (driven by economic shocks) has contributed to the rapid deterioration in food insecurity. 10 out of 11 most densely populated urban areas are anticipated to be in IPC 4. Additionally, the higher food prices are negatively impacting the purchasing power of lower-income groups across the country, reducing their access to food.

ORD intends to provide Livestock Protection Package (animal feed and deworming) and Vegetable Kit in the Daykundi province (Nili), which is in the 25 priority provinces for 2021. ORD has had a strong presence and has delivered emergency responses. Currently, ORD is delivering cash for food assistance in the partnership of NCA. The AHF 1st Standard Allocation 2021 fund will scale up and fill the ORD&apos;s current response gap, be holistic, and become a multi-cluster response to the vulnerable population due to the aftermath of conflict and the current drought.

ORD will ensure that the most vulnerable people (whose vulnerability score is greater than six, the criteria for both Livestock Protection Package and Vegetable Kit is incorporated in FSAC standard profile survey tool) in need are among the affected population groups prioritized for this action and 2,430  HHs (17,010 individuals) following FSAC cluster standards for drought and conflict-affected people to respond to their livestock and livelihood support to vulnerable farmers. ORD will closely coordinate with the regional FSAC cluster, UNOCHA/AHF, and other partners for the identification of target communities and groups to avoid duplication. ORD project team will establish Beneficiary Selection Committees (BSCs) that will conduct a door-to-door assessment using the vulnerability assessment tool.

In addition, ORD will provide this response in kind due to Livestock Package (animal feed and deworming) and Vegetable Kit Standard item unavailability and market dysfunctionality. The beneficiary selection will be carried out using certain structured questionnaire/scorecard tools, which are usually being shared by the FSAC for each modality. in case it is not available, ORD will develop a questionnaire and will coordinate it with the cluster and after their approval, we will use that tool for assessment and beneficiary selection. For the distribution of the Livestock and Vegetable Kit, ORD will provide a unique identification card to each eligible recipient, and in order to prevent any delay or problem in distribution, we will authorize an alternative person to receive the assistance. Furthermore, the project team will carry out PDM, and ORD MEAL will perform additional verification by phone and as well share the beneficiary profile with AWAAZ Afghanistan for further accountability.</narrative>
