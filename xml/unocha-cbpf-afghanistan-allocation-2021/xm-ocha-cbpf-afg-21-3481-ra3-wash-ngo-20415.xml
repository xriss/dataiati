   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Forty years of war, recurrent natural disasters, chronic poverty, drought and the COVID-19 pandemic have devastated the people of Afghanistan. The recent escalation in conflict and resulting upheaval has only exacerbated needs and further complicated an extremely challenging operational context. Even prior to the events of 15 August, the humanitarian situation in Afghanistan was one of the worst in the world. By the mid-year mark, nearly half of the population &#x2013; some 18.4 million people &#x2013; were already in need of humanitarian and protection assistance in 2021. 
Water scarcity further exacerbated due to diminished precipitation during the La Nina period. The government of Afghanistan officially declared a drought on June 22, 2021, where it was indicated that 30% of the country is exposed to drought, stating 50% to serious drought while 20% to moderate drought. So, it has become much difficult and challenging situation for conflict and drought affected communities to get access to safe water for drinking, washing and hygiene. 
In addition, poor hygiene conditions have much contributed to communicable diseases throughout the country, and the covid-19 outbreak has further deteriorated preexisting WASH needs since 2020. Lack of access to basic hygiene supplies and sanitation has placed communities at heightened risk of acute respiratory infections and diarrheal diseases specifically for children under five. If this situation is not addresses, then it is much likely to exacerbate not only the spread of COVID-19 but also putting affected population at risk of other waterborne diseases.
To respond to this worse situation, as part of this proposed project, AABRAR will provide lifesaving WASH support to total of 19,210 affected people (5763 women, 5763 men, 3842 girls and 3842 boys) in the targeted communities of districts of Farah, Bakwa and Bala Buluk of Farah Province. The major activities under this intervention will be as following.
1) provision of safe water for drinking, washing and personal hygiene through construction of 10 boreholes fitted with hand-pumps, construction of 2 boreholes with solar operating system and emergency trucking of water as a last resort to the communities much impacted by conflict and drought. 
2) Procurement and distribution of 1,700 hygiene kits to most vulnerable people with the aim to promote good hygiene practices including encouraging handwashing with soap.
3) Along with distribution of hygiene kits distribution, hygiene education will be provided to the targeted affected communities, which will cover key topics including covid-19, personal hygiene, safe water transport and storage as well as handwashing with antiseptic soap and waste management. 

Moreover, throughout the project implementation period, AABRAR will coordinate activities of the project with all concerned stakeholders including WASH Cluster, MRRD, PRRD, UNOCHA, district and provincial government and concerned local communities in Farah Province in order to ensure effective delivery of service and on-time completion.</narrative>
