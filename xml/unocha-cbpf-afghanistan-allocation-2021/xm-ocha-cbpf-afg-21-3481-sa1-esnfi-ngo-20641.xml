   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Winterization Response to Most Vulnerable Communities in Kunduz Province - ES/NFI</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Following an escalation of conflict in Northeast region, many people had already been arrived in Kunduz city and surrounding areas, seeking safety from the conflict and other threats. According to Conflict Induced Displacement (as of 15 November 2021), the actual displacement between 1 Jan to 18 Oct 2021 is 100,156 individuals in Kunduz including 96,901 displaced to Kunduz city. 
Fleeing with nothing more than personal possessions, many of these IDPs remain vulnerable. The situation is more pronounced for people staying outside in open spaces who are at risk of additional health and protection concerns. 
Affected IDPs and host communities from Conflict and Natural disaster in the Kunduz as mentioned in the need assessment survey report are living in open spaces and damaged shelters expose to protection hazards and upcoming harsh winter (expose to -5 and below in coming months). In the said targeted area there are the high vulnerability level in the targeted areas and need support in order to increase the coping mechanism and reduce suffering in the upcoming winter 2021-22. An estimated huge number of HHs were internally and externally displaced due to recent conflict and natural disaster (Drought) within/from the districts. Some of them have already returned to their place of origin but due to the shrinkage of the existing resources they face critical issues and are severely vulnerable to the upcoming winter especially children, Pregnant and Lactating Women-PLWs, and people with disability and people with poor economic condition. Due to the limited resources, remoteness and accessibility, most people live in dire poverty. 
This project focuses on Theme 2: Winter support to address the needs of people most at risk from the harsh condition including the following interventions OCHR&apos;s proposes to support 625 households (4375 individuals, including 32% of PLWs) between December 2021 and Feb 2022 with winter clothes and blanket packages as well as heating/fuel packages with the aim to support of Kunduz population who will suffer through a harsh winter. The winter clothes and blanket packages will be distributed in kind and the fuel support will be distributed using cash through Hawala to project participants identified in Kunduz center, Qala-e-Zal and Chardara districts of Kunduz province in the north east region complimentary to or scaled up the current project interventions (2021 3rd Reserved Allocation) including (1) Cash for upgrading shelters for 205 HHs (2) Cash for Rent (CfR) for 100 HHs (3) Distribution of 900 ES/NFI Cluster standard winter assistance packages (blankets and winter clothing) to increase the coping mechanism and reduce suffering in the upcoming winter 2021&#x2013;2022. This project will reach to 625 HHs (including 32% PLWs) affected by conflict and natural disaster including IDPs returned to the place of origin as well as affected non-displaced HHs in Kunduz city, Char Dara and Qala-e-Zal districts of Kunduz province. These standard winter assistance packages will be provided to most vulnerable affected HHs expose to upcoming harsh winter. 
As per the (2021 3rd Reserved Allocation) and to scale up our current interventions, OCHR has planned to upgrade its current activities and will select the targeted beneficiaries in a transparent manner as we have already visualized the most at risk/venerable HHs recently. And to ensure that the most affected receive the assistance. The selection will be done in the presence of the community elders, local authorities and UNOCHA office based in Kunduz. The project duration will be 6 months.
OCHR rolled out a similar ongoing project from START-FUND UK in Kunduz province providing ES/NFI items, Food, Nutrition and WASH assistance to 500 IDPs HHs recently completed on 20 Aug 2021. And OCHR is currently implementing two similar ongoing projects in Kunduz funded by UNOCHA providing ES/NFI and WASH emergency responses to 1205 amp 1373 HHs in the targeted areas respectively.</narrative>
