   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Increased access to quality primary education for the displacement affected children in Badghis and Kunduz provinces.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project aims to ensure that 17018 (8509 F) returnees, Internally Displaced People (IDP), and the hosting community children receive opportunities to enrol in school. It will enable out of schoolchildren, those learners already registered can continue their schooling, and that children are protected from physical and psychological abuse while in school. The strategy adopted by this project includes the provision of 95 Community Based Education (CBE) and support to 45 formal primary schools (hub schools). The project will target 55 CBE classes and 27 hub schools in Ab-Kamari, Qadis and Moqur districts of Badghis province and 40 CBE classes and 18 hub-schools in Emam Sahib, Char Dara, Ali Aabad and Qala Zal districts of Kunduz province. NRC will reach 1925 (50%F) CBE learners, 55 (50%F) CBE teachers, 8186 (50%F) hub school learners and 90 (50%F) hub schoolteachers in Badghis province. Additionally, the project will reach 1200 (50%F) CBE learners, 40(50%F) CBE teachers, 5707 (50%F) hub school learners and 80 (50%F) hub schoolteachers in Kunduz province. On average, each CBE class will accommodate 32 learners. Other project beneficiaries include Shura members in Badghis and Kunduz provinces. Accumulatively, the project will reach 17884 beneficiaries (434 men, 432 women, 8509 boys and 8509 girls).

Together with school management committees/Shuras (SMCs) and school leadership, the project will conduct campaigns to bring back children. The project will sensitise community members in the targeted provinces on the importance of enrolling both boys and girls in schools. This will involve setting out back to school campaigns through culturally acceptable means. During sensitisations meetings, the stakeholders will educate children, staff and community members on care and prevention from COVID 19.

Through direct support and coordination of the provincial education directorate (PED), district education directorate (DED) and the Education Cluster, NRC will provide CBE classes/Temporary Learning Spaces (TLSs) with separate WASH facilities for girls and boys and provide School Improvement Plans (SIP) to rehabilitate partially destroyed WASH facilities and classrooms. The project will work with communities to clear designated areas of harmful objects and debris and renovate the destroyed classrooms. The renovations of classes will follow the Ministry of Education, Education Cluster and INEE standards. The intervention will prioritise local materials to support the local economy. Community leaders and the school community will have a significant role in this activity in line with the &apos;whole school&apos; approach.

The high cost of providing teaching and learning materials for children also limits enrolment and completion, resulting in early dropout. In the targeted provinces, parents cannot afford to buy reading and writing materials for their children. The project will provide teaching and learning materials, including teachers, classroom, learners, hygiene and Better Learning Programme (BLP) Kits. In cold climatic areas, the project will provide CBE classes with winterisation materials.  

At every point in their career, teachers need to have or be able to acquire the full range of subject knowledge, attitudes, and pedagogic skills to help young people reach their full potential. To realise this, NRC will train teachers on psychosocial skills, intensive pedagogy and child-centred methodology. Regarding providing psychosocial support to learners, NRC will implement its classroom-based psychosocial package called BLP. 

The NRC will implement the project for one year to complete the CBE academic year cycle and renovations of schools, which is time-intensive. The time will also enable NRC to document and share the project&apos;s learning, and mobilize resources for the transition of CBE grade 1 completers to grade 2.</narrative>
