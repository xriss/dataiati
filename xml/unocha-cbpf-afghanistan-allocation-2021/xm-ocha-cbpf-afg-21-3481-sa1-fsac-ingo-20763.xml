   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The overall objective of this intervention is to ensure 2458 households (17,206 people &#x2013; 4129 men, 3957 women, 4646 boys and 4474 girls) receive food security support as per the AHF 1st Standard Allocation Strategy in Herat Province and as per the suggestion of the FSAC to only focus on one Province and Activity 1 of the Allocation Strategy (Food assistance for IPC Phase 3 amp 4 people &#x2013; cash or in-kind). As per the Cluster Outcome 1.2, the project aims for shock-affected people to have minimum household food consumption of above 42.5. Based on the latest IPC report, a priority intervention is to support at-risk women and children in IPC Phase 4. Therefore, we will prioritise these target beneficiaries, as well as people living with disabilities, in accordance to principles of inclusivity. 

In Herat, the project will target two Districts &#x2013; 1458 households in Shindand and 1000 households in Kushk-e-Kuhna. These districts were prioritized based on need and FSAC cluster recommendation to further coordinate with WFP on which specific districts to be covered since they are applying for the same province and activity. As suggested, WFP and ActionAid, Afghanistan (AAA) have divided the Herat province in order to reach the highest number of beneficiaries with food distributions. During the project implementation ActionAid  will coordinate with WFP and other FSAC partners  to ensure that duplication is avoided and complementarity promoted. 

AAA, with support from local volunteers, will be distributing food baskets to the targeted households based on cluster recommended amounts. In case adequate number of IDPs and returnees are not available, AAA will cover host communities who are equally vulnerable. To support a household of 7 people for one month, a food basket will contain Wheat flour 62 kg, Rice 24 Kg, Vegetable oil 9 Kg, Pulses 15 kg, Salt 1 kg. This is in accordance with the Afghanistan Minimum Expenditure Basket, recommended by the FSAC cluster. There will be 2 rounds of distributions, to ensure that each household will receive emergency food baskets for two months. Food will be locally sourced where possible. As per the IPC October 2021 Response priorities, in-kind food assistance will be pre-positioned at the on-site of the project, to ensure it will be delivered to IPC Phase 4 population who might be cut off by winter weather by local volunteers and staff. 

To ensure we are mainstreaming protection concerns, the project will aim to increase knowledge amongst the targeted vulnerable households on existing referral pathways and protection services for survivors of SGBV, unaccompanied children and people living with disabilities in the two districts in Herat Province. 

Operational, security, safety and financial risk and the corresponding mitigating measures will be in place risk registers will be regularly updated and communicated a detailed monitoring and evaluation plan will be implemented measuring indicators, applying lessons learnt and documenting recommendations and sustainability or handover strategies will be explored for the project&#x2019;s duration.</narrative>
