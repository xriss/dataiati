   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Conflict coupled with sporadic floods continues to prompt significant population displacement and loss of essential livelihoods and damaged shelters (IPC Analysis, April 2021). Concern With over two decades of strong physical operational presence in the Northeast Region of Takhar, Badakhshan and Kunduz provinces aims to address immediate shelter and NFI needs of the affected population &#x2212; in an effort to save lives, improve people&#x2019;s wellbeing, and reduce the use of negative coping mechanisms. The Department of Refugees and Repatriation (DoRR) has provided preliminary data on the unmet needs in the province that guided Concern&#x2019;s response to emergency shelter and NFI needs, Afghanistan Humanitarian Response Plan (HRP) 2018-2021 and Concern&#x2019;s Standard HEAT Assessment (October 2020 has pointed out continued need of emergency shelter and NFI assistance.
Concern is prioritizing the multi-cluster assistance of NFI items for 2,500 displaced and acutely vulnerable families living in Yaftal-e-Sufla, Shahr-e-Buzurg, Kohistan and Jorm, Warduj districts of Badakhshan and potential expansion to Takhar, which has been listed as a highly-impacted priority province for the spring disaster response. Concern Worldwide is prepared to scale up its existing NFI and shelter capacity to assist more conflict- and flood-affected households through the provision of in-kind household NFI ($105) for displaced families who will be identified through the joint inter-agency assessment. Through this funding, Concern will able to reach 200 most vulnerable host and returnee households- identified by DoRR and ANDMA in Jorm, Warduj and Yaftal-e-Sufla districts of Badakhshan through the provision of in-kind Emergency shelter toolkits ($50 value) alongside with shelter upgrade or repair support via two conditional cash instalments (USD 150 per instalment totaling $300). In consideration with the recommendation from Concern&#x2019;s mitigating risks of Gender-Based Violence in Cash Based Intervention assessment, the proposed project will consider the specific needs of female, people with disability and elder headed households through contracting skill and unskilled labor works To address protection concerns resulting from exacerbated existing needs of vulnerable women, Concern Worldwide will provide dignity kits (in-kind, valued at $28) consisting of female hygiene and sanitary items to 200 female-headed host, displaced and returnee households and acutely vulnerable women receiving ESNFI support.
Concern Worldwide will provide a combined package of in-kind emergency Shelter Toolkits alongside with conditional cash assistance to respond to urgent shelter needs of conflict-affected households residing in partially damaged shelters. The materials of shelters whose houses are partially damaged or destroyed are from mud and other locally available materials that most households could not repair due to insufficient financial resources. The modality of cash assistance for emergency shelter materials were determined based on the cash feasibility assessment conducted with the community representative and traders of the targeted districts. In the targeted four districts, the construction materials are available in the village where female-headed households and people with disability could easily and safely access. Based on the rapid market assessment conducted on availability, access and functionality of the shelter repair construction materials, the cash-based assistance is more feasible while providing in-kind shelter toolkits to ensure access to quality materials.</narrative>
