   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Cash for food assistance to IPC phase 3 and 4 vulnerable, drought affected communities living in IPC phase 3 and 4 urban areas</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In September and October 2021 (the post-harvest season), nearly 19 million people in Afghanistan experienced high levels of acute food insecurity (IPC Phase 3 or above), an almost 30% increase from the same season last year (14.5 million people). The main drivers of acute food insecurity include drought and its impacts on crops and livestock, the collapse of public services, a severe economic crisis and increasing food prices. An estimated 6.8 million people in Emergency (IPC Phase 4) and 11.9 million people in Crisis (IPC Phase 3) require urgent action to save their lives, reduce food gaps and protect their livelihoods.

In the current period, corresponding to the 2021 post-harvest season in the country, 18.8 million people (47% of the population) are estimated to be experiencing high levels of food insecurity in IPC Phase 3 (Crisis) and Phase 4 (Emergency). This includes 6.8 million (17% of the total population) classified in Emergency nationwide and 11.9 million (30%) in Crisis. Of the 45 geographical areas analysed (34 rural and 11 urban analytical domains), 16 rural areas (Badakshan, Badghis, Balkh, Bamyan, Daikundi, Faryab, Ghazni, Ghor, Hirat, Jawzjan, Kabul, Laghman, Nuristan, Samangan, Sar-i-Pul and Uruzgan) and five urban areas (Baghlan, Balkh, Faryab, Hirat and Kunduz) were classified in Emergency (IPC Phase 4), 24 areas in Crisis (IPC Phase 3), and none of the areas were classified in Stressed (Phase 2) or Minimal (Phase 1).

Apart from that Bamyan province is one of the most remote and central highland in Afghanistan where there are high needs of the food, in IPC Phase 3 and 4 30% of the populations are in high needs of acute food.

In line with Food Security Agriculture Cluster (FSAC) priorities, OHW and its well organized and professional team will provide 1,128 HHs (7,896 individuals) in Bamyan Province with in-cash assistance (value of 180 USD distributed for the equivalent local currency in AFN at project start) aimed at meeting household food needs for a duration of 4 months, as per cluster standards. The cash assistance will be distributed in two installments along a period of 4 months.

Cash assistance has been envisaged as unconditional and unrestricted. The decision has been based on results from needs assessment and identification of food as the main household priority. Moreover, cash has been identified by target populations as the preferred assistance modality and markets have been assessed as accessible and safe for both male and female. Findings from winterization assistance PDM among the same communities point out how distribution in installments is the preferred modality, allowing households to plan for their expenditures. Furthermore, cash assistance will be carried out through the Hawala system, identified as the most viable and widely spread solution by OHWs&#x2019; Feasibility Study.

The present response priorities are in line with OHW past experience and capability, and represent a scale up of relief and winterization emergency activities in the target area. OHWs&#x2019; recent interventions put an emphasis on livelihood enhancement with a focus on natural resources utilization, youth mobilization, WASH and shelter repairs and women empowerment fostering income generating activities. Thus, the action aims at enlarging OHWs&#x2019; reach by supporting vulnerable households in dire food insecurity with cash assistance.</narrative>
