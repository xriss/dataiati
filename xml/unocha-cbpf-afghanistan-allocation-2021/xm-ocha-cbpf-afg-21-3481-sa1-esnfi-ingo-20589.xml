  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Due to the increase in climate change related environment changes, Afghanistan is now considered to be one of the most vulnerable countries in the world in terms of natural disasters according to the World Bank&apos;s Disaster Risk Profile. Compounded with harsh winter conditions, the effects of disasters are increasingly catastrophic across the country. Bamiyan, one of AHP and AHF&#x2019;s top priority locations, is one of the most severely affected provinces in Afghanistan with communities having to endure extremely harsh winter conditions. 
As per AKAH-A&#x2019;s 2021 HVRA report, latest rapid needs assessment and community interactions, Bamiyan Center and Shiber districts in Bamiyan province have been identified as among the most vulnerable areas of Afghanistan, with temperatures often dropping to -20 degrees Centigrade. With mountains covering nearly 90% of the province&#x2019;s terrain, road blockages as a result of heavy snowfall on already poor-quality infrastructure within these districts are very common and can last up to 6 months every year. As a result, populations living outside of district centers are cut off from essential services such as markets, health facilities, schools and employment opportunities.

Although the security situation has settled and normalized in Bamiyan since the change in government in August 2021, the population has suffered from aggravated vulnerabilities due to drought, the erosion of livelihoods and household reserves, as well as conflict-induced damage and destruction to people&#x2019;s homes. Proneness to natural hazards and an increase in Internally Displaced People (IDPs) due to the recent political upheaval are current realities in the two targeted districts of this project. Limited access to markets and other basic services such as health, WASH and educational facilities as well as limited humanitarian actor access to the area are further issues faced by the population of Bamiyan province. Bamiyan province, including Bamiyan Center and Shiber districts, has been identified as IPC phase 4, Emergency Situation. In the latest September 2021-March 2022 report, 50% of the population of Bamiyan or 318,992 individuals are currently in Phase 3+, projected to rise to 60% (395,251 individuals) between November 2021 and March 2022.

AKAH-A&apos;s proposes to support 945 households (6,615 individuals, including 32% of PLWs) between January and May 2022 with winter clothes and blanket packages as well as heating/fuel packages with the aim of diminishing the proportion of the Bamiyan population who will suffer through a harsh winter. The winter clothes and blanket packages will be distributed in kind and the fuel support will be distributed using cash through Hawala to project participants identified in Shiber as well as to those residing in remote areas of Bamiyan Center, and vouchers to project participants that have access to the district center market in Bamiyan Center. This project will directly benefit 945 households in total, with 550 households in Bamiyan Center and 395 in Shiber district.</narrative>
