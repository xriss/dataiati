   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Provision of Life-Saving Shelter and Winter Support Assistance to conflict affected IDPs, Non-displaced Population, and Host Communities in Ghazni, Paktia and Paktika Provinces.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The proposed project will deliver life-saving shelter and winter support assistance to most vulnerable conflict affected IDPs (70%) and non-displaced affected population (20%) as well as 10% of host community households in target districts of Ghazni, Paktia and Paktika provinces. Before the winter season starts, 350 households in Gardez district of Paktia (250) and Sharana district of Paktika province (100) will receive USD75 x 3 months as &#x201C;Conditional Cash for Rental Support&#x201D; per household in one installment. While 600 households will receive USD200 per HH as &#x201C;Cash for Gas Cylinder and Fuel Assistance&#x201D; and in-kind blanket package (Equivalent to 40 USD) as one time assistance in Ghazni amp Jaghori districts of Ghazni province, Gardez district of Paktia province, and Sharana amp Orgun districts of Paktika province, where 120 HHs will be targeted in each target district. Considering the actual needs on the ground and the assumptions in place, the project will seek to target 90% of conflict affected population including IDPs and non-displaced, and 10% of host community households. As an active member of OCTs and other coordination forums in target locations, WSTA will closely coordinate the assessment/beneficiary selection, distribution and other activities of the project with new government, UN agencies, INGOs, NNGOs and other stakeholders to avoid duplication in response, and to address transparency and accountability within the overall process. The cluster recommended tools will be used for data collection, analysis and reporting while we will put additional tools to collect more segregated data as per Age, Gender and Diversity (AGD) approach. Women headed households, child headed households, elderly headed households, survivors of GBV and other protection incidents will be prioritized for the assistance if the needs were higher than the available resources. We will closely work with government line departments, beneficiary representatives and other stakeholders to identify and select our distribution points in target provinces, which shall be safe and accessible for men, women, children, elderly and persons with disability with enough facilitation in place. The COVID-19 protocols will be strictly applied throughout the implementation process to ensure safety of our staff, beneficiaries and stakeholders. Project visibility, reporting to cluster, AHF and government will be properly managed as per the requirements of each organization. We will use the services of AWAAZ Afghanistan and our internal hotline number to register the complaints and will ensure that the target communities receive our complaint leaflets during the assessments and distribution. We will also position a help desk at community level during the distribution processes to ensure the beneficiaries/affected population of concern can register their complaints and raise their concerns in real-time. With the support of OCT members and other winterization service providers at provincial level, we will form a distribution committee to avoid duplication and to further address transparency and accountability within the distribution process. The cash assistance will be delivered to the beneficiaries by contracted Financial Service Provider (FSP) in the presence of joint distribution committee members while the in-kind assistance will be distributed by our field team through selected distribution points. Our MampE and Project Control units will regularly monitor, evaluate and verify the project activities to improve the quality of our work, exercising a comprehensive lessons learned, and to address compliance. As thousands of families are on the move due to recent crisis in the country, the cash for rental support is considered conditional and unrestricted to ensure they have flexibility in their movements especially concerning their protection.</narrative>
