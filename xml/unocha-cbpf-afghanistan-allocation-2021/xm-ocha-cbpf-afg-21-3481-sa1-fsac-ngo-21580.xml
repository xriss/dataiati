   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Afghanistan is facing its second drought in four years, according to Food Security and Agriculture Cluster (FSAC) analysis. The IPC report published in November 2021 indicates that an estimated 22.8 million people, or 55 per cent of the population, are expected to be in crisis or emergency levels of food insecurity between November 2021 and March 2022, a nearly 35 per cent increase from the same season last year (16.9 million). Situated in a seismic zone, mountainous terrain, harsh arid climate with freezing winters, abundant snowfall and heavy spring rains makes Afghanistan highly vulnerable to several natural hazards. Earthquakes, floods, flash floods, drought, landslides and snow avalanches frequently affect vulnerable people across the country. Nearly four decades of conflict and a low level of socio-economic development, combined with climate change and natural resource mismanagement, have resulted in widespread degradation of Afghanistan&#x2019;s natural resource base. This has made a greater number of people further vulnerable. 

SOUND technical team along with representatives from PRRD has conducted project assessment in Khan Char Bagh and Khoja Sab Posh districts. The overall understanding from the joint assessment is that the percentage of poverties are very high and the communities are severely affected due to the harsh natural disasters (drought and floods) and conflict. Furthermore, in most of the areas the communities need for food assistance in terms of food security, and the severity is exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. The proposed project will virtually safeguard and protect the residents from natural disaster, save lives and improve the food security in the areas.

Considering the high level of need, SOUND will provide 870 HHs (6,090 individuals) in Khan Char Bagh and 800 HHs (5,600 individuals)  in Khoja Sabz Posh with cash for food assistance for two months full ration. The distribution will happen in two rounds/installments and beneficiaries will receive $80 (AFN equivalent) in each round of distribution as per the FSAC guideline. The proposed cash basket provides 2,100 Kcal energy for one month for a household of 7 members.

SOUND intended cash assistance to be provided unconditionally to most vulnerable and HHs. The decision was made based on the findings of a needs assessment done in both Khan Char Bagh and Khoja Sabz Posh districts in November, which identified food as the most pressing need. Furthermore, cash was selected as the preferred aid modality by 72% of respondents, and marketplaces were rated as accessible and safe. According to the conclusions of SOUND&apos;s market evaluation, markets in both Khan Char Bagh and Khoja Sabz Posh districts are accessible to both men and women, and food items are available in sufficient amounts. Given the current state of banking institutions and the constraints they face in terms of cash transfers and withdrawals, monetary assistance will be provided through the Hawala system, which has been selected as the most feasible and extensively used method. SOUND assessment focused more on the availability/ capacity of the local market, in addition to the WFP and REACH/JMMI assessments findings.</narrative>
