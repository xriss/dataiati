  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project will support 25,550 shock affected individuals in 3,650 households , including of IDPs, IDP returnees and host communities in Badakhshan. These households are affected by recent conflict, drought, economic crises and the approaching winter. The recent figures and assessments of clusters and of ME show that the identifies HHs are affected by high vulnerability and required urgent humanitarian assistance particularly under food security and livelihood. Under this call ME will provide in-kind livelihood assistance including livestock support and home gardening to 25,550 individuals . As per plan the project will start on  20 December 2021 and with in the first one and half month all the targeted population will receive livestock support as it is highly required during the winter period and in the following one and a half month they will received home gardening package so they could start growing vegetables as soon as the spring season approaches.  

The assumption behind the intervention is that the livestock support will allow HHs to navigate through the next three months providing food for their livestock and ensure that they will be out of the emergency phase followed by home gardening in the early spring season ensuring their food consumption rate during the three months of winter season. Households in Badakhshan process and store harvested hays and straws to feed their animals during the winter season and use the cultivated cereal and beans and dried vegetables, which they were not able to store this year. Therefore Mission East consider providing feed for their animals plus de-wormer as well as take this opportunity to introduce home gardening as alternative to the stored food which will increase the food consumption score as well as improve resilience of the local population to face recurrent food crisis during the winter season. The project will be run through professional staff who will provide technical guide on their animals&#x2019; health as well as growing vegetables during various seasons. This will boost their food consumption score sustainability particularly targeting children, elders, women and  girls with low immune system.

The further sustainability of the intervention through a post emergency set up will be ensured through the nexus approach with the development programming that Mission East is carrying out in the same districts of the intervention.  

This project will be directly implemented by Mission East through professional Mission East Staff, after the detailed assessment through which vulnerable HH will be identified.</narrative>
