   <narrative xml:lang="EN">CARE will provide life-saving Primary Health Care, Sexual and Reproductive Health, child health, Psychosocial, GBV and Nutrition services to conflict affected population mainly in the hard to reach districts of Ghazni, Parwan and Balkh provinces. The focus will be on most vulnerable population, mainly women and children, in 6 districts in Ghazni (Abe-Band and Qarabagh Districts), Parwan (Siagerd and Bagram Districts) and Balkh (Sholgrara Districts and PD-5 and P-9 of Mazar-e-sharif City) identified in coordination with cluster representatives, Provincial Public Health Directorates, BPHS implementers and the assessment conducted by CARE. The three provinces are in the list of priority idetitied by the 1st Standard Allocation Strategy 2021.
CARE has long presence in all the three provinces. The organization is currently providing health, psychosocial and nutrition services to the conflict affected population, IDPs and vulnerable groups. Beside health and nutrition CARE is providing livelihood, Multipurpose cash and education services, which make CARE more familiar with the local context and other essential needs of these communities. In all these three provinces, CARE has presence for more than a decade and has developed a very strong community TRUST and thus the access will not be a challenge for implementation. 
CARE conducted extensive coordination exercise and rapid needs assessments involving key stakeholders such as cluster/WHO representatives, the provincial public health directorates, the BPHS implementers, the district health officers and fixed health facilities and local communities. As a result, the most vulnerable communities and groups were identified in the high priority conflict and drought-affected white and hard to reach areas targeted by this project. From the needs assessment, lack of access to basic health and nutrition services was prioritized by communities assessed. The preparation phase will include closer coordination with community and provincial authorities and identifying the service delivery points (SDPs). This will be achieved during the first month of the project, by provincial team and project manager and other staff from central office of CARE.
The purpose of the project is To improve health, psycho-social, GBV and nutrition wellbeing of targeted population (women, girls, men and boys) in selected districts of Ghazni ((Qarabagh.and Abe-Band), Balkh (Sholgara District and District # 5 amp9 of Mazar-e-sharif City) and Parwan Siagard and Bagram) provinces 
CARE will use two-prong approach to provide life-saving health and nutrition services in the targeted locations including the establishment of the 6 mobile health teams and supporting 6 fixed health facilities to which the MHTs will be making referral. Each mobile health team will be comprised of a team of professionals, including a medical doctor, a midwife, a nutrition counselor, a psychosocial counselor and a vaccinator. CARE will train the mobile health team staff with a package of life-saving primary health care and nutrition services in the humanitarian situation. Moreover, community focal points will be trained in each SDP (one male and one female) for community based intervention such as health and nutrition education, nutrition screening and referral. The mobile teams will be located in the districts ideally and will function from there. 

CARE has coordinated the selection of the new geographic coverage for this intervention with PPHD, BPHS partner to avoid duplication of activities and geographic coverage. In addition, CARE conducted a rapid needs assessment in the areas proposed by PPHD which confirmed the continued needs of the communities for an integrated nutrition and health services. Additionally, a very robust and practical data management, compilation, and reporting system with an effective monitoring mechanism will be implemented at both national and provincial levels.</narrative>
