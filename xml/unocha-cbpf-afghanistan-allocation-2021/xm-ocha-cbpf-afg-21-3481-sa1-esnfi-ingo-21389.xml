   <narrative xml:lang="EN">IRC&#x2019;s proposed intervention will focus on the provision of a conditional cash-based shelter response, which has been identified by the Emergency Shelter/Non-Food Item (ES/NFI) Cluster as the primary need for current and anticipated populations displaced by conflict and natural disasters with the highest needs reported in the eastern region in Khogyani District in the Chamtala area of Nangarhar Province. IRC will leverage its current operational presence and ongoing humanitarian response activities to mobilize an immediate scale-up of assistance and reduce the current needs for conflict and natural disaster-affected and displaced populations.

The intervention will provide cash for shelter repairs and upgrades as well as new shelter construction to affected households to address their emergency shelter needs from conflict and natural disasters and to be able to live in safe and dignified housing. The proposed intervention will address emergency response gaps with the assistance benefiting 1070 households (7490 individuals) through conditional cash for shelters in accordance with Emergency Shelter/Non-Food Item (ES/NFI) Cluster standards.

Post distribution monitoring (PDM) findings from previous Afghanistan Humanitarian Funds (AHF) reserve allocations for similar types of assistance show a strong acceptance of cash as a means of shelter assistance. Given a functional market and construction materials being available in the local market, cash is the right response to addressing shelter needs. IRC has the requisite operational capacity to deliver cash safely and effectively to beneficiaries According to the Rapid Market Assessment (RMA) conducted by IRC, there are three markets available, and they are easily accessible by the beneficiaries. These markets are Khogyani district market, Surkhrud district market and the provincial capital city Jalalabad. 

This project will have a direct impact on reducing protection risks associated with harmful coping mechanisms, including child protection risks, in internally displaced population (IDP) settlements, and displacement areas. IRC will mainstream protection throughout project implementation to prioritize safety and dignity, avoid causing harm, and ensure meaningful access and accountability to affected populations.

Shelter remains a key priority need of households after displacement, especially for women and girls. Lack of access to shelter can be particularly harmful to women who often face elevated protection risks during displacement. The proposed shelter intervention is targeted to the most vulnerable crisis-affected households, in which women and girls are often disproportionately affected. 

IRC will offer two shelter options for affected populations lacking access to adequate shelter, are living in overcrowded conditions, are displaced and being hosted or in rental accommodation but facing eviction, or living in informal settlements with inadequate shelter conditions. IRC will provide cluster-standard transitional shelters and support for households to repair their partially damaged shelters where applicable. IRC will assess affected households using the Household Emergency Assessment Tool (HEAT) to determine shelter needs and the most appropriate shelter response. 

Through the proposed shelter response, IRC plans to target 30  households approximately (210  individuals) through the construction of large size transitional shelters, 50  households approximately (350  individuals) through construction of small size transitional shelters, 890 households approximately (6230 individuals) through minor shelter repair, and 100  households approximately (700  individuals) through Major shelter repair in the Chamtala area of Khogyani District of Nangarhar Province.</narrative>
