   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Cash for food assistance to IPC phase 3 and 4 vulnerable, prolonged and new IDPs in Jalalabad city of Nangarhar province.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">According to 2021 FSAC pre-lean season assessment key findings and ICCT spring disaster plan shows that total of 12,000 IDPs have been assessed in Nangarhar province with 5,000 verified as needing assistance. The data sheet is attached. According to CAHPO assessment reports dated July 2021 &#x201C;annex under doc&#x201D;, in Nangarhar province, most of the newly displaced people are coming from Achin, Pachieagam, Dehbala and Surkhrod districts and are now primarily staying in Jalalabad, Behsud, Mommand Dara, Khogyani and Surhrod districts. Though the recent change of power and tangible reduction of conflict, the people stay displaced. As per MoRR they still have insufficient income due to several reasons (prolonged conflict in the past, COVID-19, drought, and unemployment) and impacts on livelihood activities, the majority of poor both urban and rural households are expected to be unable to meet all essential food needs The combination of past conflict, drought as well as Covid-19, has led to 35% of the population in urban Nangarhar being classified as IPC 3 or above. As mentioned by most people they can return after rehabilitation of the infrastructures. Through the proposed project CAHPO will provide unconditional cash assistance to 1,316 households (9,211individuals) in Jalalabad city to buy food items/commodities. Based on the FSAC cluster standards and the allocation strategy paper, every eligible HH will receive USD 180 full food packages of assistance. The intervention will be through unrestricted and unconditional cash distribution. Cash will be distributed in 2 installments of each USD 90 to cover 100% of the minimum food basket for 4 months. 1st installment after the beneficiary selection in the end of first month and 2nd installment on the 3rd month. The guideline of FSAC is attached. 
As per the FSAC cluster division, 1316 HHs with a total of 9211 beneficiaries in Jalalabad to cover to food basic needs will receive two full food package distributions through cash for food packages, for detail see annex. The provision will be in two installments in order to be most cost-effective and to avoid the distributions barriers. Money Service Provider(MSP) or Hawala that will be contracted by CAHPO to facilitate the distribution at CAHPO office. The usual distribution point will have proven access to work well for all beneficiaries to be able to travel easily. The distribution will be done based on the signed lists and tokens issued to the selected beneficiaries by the Beneficiary Selection Committee (BSC) through the Hawala system detail annex. Because of new administrative change in the Government, it has decided to distribute cash through MSP because we are sure that banking system will not work as normal as before for some months due to recent change. The project staff will collect the phone numbers of the beneficiaries to contact them for cash distribution. Beneficiaries should have NIDs or other certifications to check their identity correctly. Beneficiaries who have no NID will distribute verification card by BSC. Information will be shared with stakeholders regarding the required food items to be purchased.
CAHPO team has experience to conduct awareness training on COVID-19. Awareness-raising will take place in all communities in separate male/female groups, as per CAHPO experience, the same female beneficiaries will receive the hygiene kit, who know the best use of it. Information leaflets will be distributed to ensure ongoing access to information will distribute. 
The project have mainstreamed themes related to the COVID pandemic and protection related issues. The COVID-19 and Protection sessions will take place at the distribution site according to WHO standards.  
Jalalabad has a big market area that makes it easy for people to supply their required food items. The communities are stable hence social cohesion is reasonably strong through which community members support each other, in particular the most vulnerable person</narrative>
