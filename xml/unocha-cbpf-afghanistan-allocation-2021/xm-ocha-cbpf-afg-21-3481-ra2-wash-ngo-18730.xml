   <narrative xml:lang="EN">WASH Emergency Response to the Drought in Districts Farah and Anar Dara of Farah Province.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The 2021 humanitarian context has significantly worsened since 2020. Multiple factors have caused it: increased violence across Afghanistan, fallout of the Covid-19 pandemic, the highest registered number of returnees from Iran, scarce rain and snow precipitation that are leading the country towards a drought. The number of people in need has reached the shocking amount of 18.4 million. Specifically, the WASH Cluster has identified 8.8 million of people in need for 2021 and the situation can become more fragile if the intra-Afghan peace talks will not achieve tangible results and with the announced of withdrawal of all international armed forces by the 11th of September 2021.
With the support of UNOCHA&#x2019;s 2nd Reserve Allocation (2RA) and in line with Target set out by WASH Cluster and the Humanitarian Response Plan, AABRAR will respond to the WASH needs in our two targeted districts of Farah Province through construction of bore-wells, water supply providing by trucks as a last resort, distribute of hygiene kits and provision of hygiene education covering topics as Covid-19, personal hygiene, safe water transport and storage, handwashing and waste management. AABRAR will make sure that all the activities shall address WASH needs of the targeted conflict and drought affected communities including returnees, IDPs and host communities with the main aim to protect their lives, increase resilience and the living standards of the most disadvantaged communities. Also, activities of this project are designed to decrease and avoid the spread of water-borne diseases and support beneficiaries including women to maintain their health and dignity.

In addition, AABRAR shall construct 30 bore-wells fitted with hand pumps with the objective to deliver safe water to 450 families so that they could use for drinking, personal hygiene and cooking. Also, AABRAR will make sure the supply of safe drinking water free of contamination through trucks (water trucking) to hard-to-reach areas during emergency to 500 families as last resort. Similarly, AABRAR will also make sure the supply and distribution of hygiene kits and education to 2600 conflict and drought affected families in the targeted two districts of Farah province with the objective to reduce the risk of water-borne diseases and building awareness of safe hygiene. The targeted families shall also get education of safe drinking water, safe food handling and proper hygiene as well as adequate sanitation.
Moreover, throughout the project implementation period, AABRAR will coordinate activities of the project with all concerned stakeholders including WASH Cluster, DoRR, UNOCHA, district and provincial government and concerned local communities in Farah Province.</narrative>
