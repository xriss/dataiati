   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Clearance of Abandoned Improvised Mines and Provision of Explosive Ordnance Risk Education in Kandahar and Hilmand provinces</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Under this project a total area 239,666 sqm Abandoned Improvised Mines (AIM) contaminated planned in Kandahar and Hilmand provinces for clearance with 25,000 direct beneficiaries identified in the area where we intend to consider 24,000 or delivery of Explosive Ordnance Risk Education (EORE) in Khakrez and Maywand districts of Kandahar and Garmser and Sangin districts of Hilmand province.
 
DAFA will address the high priority hazards under this project, as per its accredited AIM SOP and release clear/hand over the land as cleared/safe to the communities for their immediate productive use.
This proposed project aims to reduce AIM and ERW related deaths and disabilities enhancing socio-economic situation of the communities by: 
	Releasing contaminated land using methods such as NTS, TS and Clearance,
	Raising awareness regarding Mine/ERW risks among 24000 individuals,
	Training community volunteers to continue spreading risk awareness across other communities during project and in future (when/where needed),
	Collecting Victim Data, 
Clearance of the AIM hazards will allow and enable the communities around to productively use the land for social, economic and rehabilitation purposes and it will pave the way for the development projects to come into effect. 
The clearance of AIM hazards will include: 
- Non-technical survey: The survey will ensure new hazards are identified through the standard NTS procedure and reported/record in order to be addressed in line with the prioritization system. Besides, NTS of the existing known hazards will help to identify the real boundaries of the hazards and reduce the waste of efforts covering no-hazard areas within the polygon. 
Clearance of AIM hazards: DAFA has distinct trained personnel trained and certified and AIM standard operating procedures accredited, able to address the AIM hazards expertly and efficiently. The AIM steps and planning is described throughout this proposal indicate our commitment and capacity of being able to address the AIM hazards and help the community people recover to a safe and conducive living environment and economic growth. 
- Explosive Ordnance Risk Education: DAFA couple teams will conduct EORE sessions in various communities in consultation with the UN regional offices and both tasked and ad hoc (as advised). The EORE teams will reach the vulnerable community people including women, girls, boys and men to help prevent AIM/ERW accidents. Female EORE trainer will mainly focus to reach the community women and girls and provide them risk awareness in order for them to remain safe and keep their children safe from the danger of AIM in their surroundings. 

Implementation of this demining/EORE project promises facilitation of enhanced yield of communities&#x2019; cultivation and traditional agribusiness Besides, this project will facilitate the returnees and humanitarian actors to donate for the ruined school reconstruction and un-sealed road rehabilitation and will pave the way for other reconstruction activities in the project areas and as well as the clear area will be utilized for firewood collecting and herding their animals.</narrative>
