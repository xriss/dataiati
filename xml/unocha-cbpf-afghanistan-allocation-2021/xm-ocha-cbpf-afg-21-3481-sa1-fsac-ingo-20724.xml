   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Provision of emergency food for acutely food-insecure households in rural Badakhshan province.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In 2021 the humanitarian situation in Afghanistan deteriorated precipitously due to multiple intersecting crises and levels of food insecurity have risen to emergency levels. 
In 2021 the country suffered its second major drought in three years) and low winter rainfall and high temperatures coupled with the La Nina weather phenomenon reduced water access, and it is believed that the continuation of the La Nina will bring below-average rainfall for a second consecutive year.  In total, crop production fell by 40%. (WFP August 2021). 
Additionally, the change in regime over the summer brought about serious economic disruption. The banking sector introduced strict limits on cash withdrawals which caused a serious liquidity crisis, job losses have been widespread and even before the change in administration, many civil servants hadn&#x2019;t been paid in months. Inflation become rampant and the price of wheat flour rose by 31% (WFP November 2021). 
Furthermore, food imports have declined due to trade sanctions placed on the new regime, further increasing prices. The wheat deficit alone is estimated to be 3MMT.
As a result, Afghanistan is seeing the highest numbers of acutely food insecure people in its history.  It is predicted that over this winter 22.8 million people, which is equal to 55% of the population, will face acute levels of hunger, including the 8.7 million people in IPC phase four acute food insecurity. This is a 30% increase from the same season last year (IPC analysis October 2021). In Badakhshan in particular, 30% of the population are already in IPC phase 3, and 25 % are in IPC phase 4, and it is forecasted that over the winter this will rise to be 35% in phase 3 and 30% in phase four. (IPC analysis October 2021).
Given the worsening crisis, and in line with strategic objective 1 of the Humanitarian response plan and theme 1 of the allocation strategy, Concern is proposing an intervention to support food security in Badhakshan, in line with the cluster priorities and specifically responding to Activity two of the FSAC cluster response strategy. Our intervention would build on two decades of experience in the region, a strong operational presence (including a field office in the province), and technical expertise as well as the needs and gaps outlined in up-to-date assessments. 
Specifically, we intend to distribute 2-month food baskets in the form of cash to the value of $90 each, in line with all cluster standards, to  2771 extremely food-insecure households (19397 individuals),  i.e. those in IPC phase 4, in the districts of Arghanj kwah, Khash, Yamgan and Kuran wa Monjan in Badakhshan Province. Cash assistance will provide the flexibility for each household to choose the food items as per their households and accessibility to the district market, and avoids current supply chain issues (specifically with the procurement of wheat in large volumes). Since Concern is targeting remote and hard to reach districts we will also be supporting beneficiaries with transport costs to be able to access the market.
The project will be guided by a cash and voucher assessment conducted by Concern. Selection and distribution will take into account all protection and gender guidelines to ensure it is consistent with human dignity. Post distribution monitoring will be conducted at an appropriate time after distribution. Concern is incredibly well-positioned to provide trusted, rapid humanitarian assistance that will address immediate food needs in efforts to save lives, improve people&#x2019;s wellbeing, and reduce the use of negative coping mechanisms.</narrative>
