   <narrative xml:lang="EN">WASH Emergency Response to the Drought and conflict affected communities in Farah and Ghor Provinces.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Forty years of war, recurrent natural disasters, chronic poverty, drought and the COVID-19 pandemic have devastated the people of Afghanistan. The recent escalation in conflict and resulting upheaval has only exacerbated needs and further complicated an extremely challenging operational context. Even prior to the events of 15 August, the humanitarian situation in Afghanistan was one of the worst in the world. By the mid-year mark, nearly half of the population &#x2013; some 18.4 million people &#x2013; were already in need of humanitarian and protection assistance in 2021. 
Water scarcity further exacerbated due to diminished precipitation during the La Nina period. The government of Afghanistan officially declared a drought on June 22, 2021, where it was indicated that 30% of the country is exposed to drought, stating 50% to serious drought while 20% to moderate drought. So, it has become much difficult and challenging situation for conflict and drought affected communities to get access to safe water for drinking, washing and hygiene. 
In addition, poor hygiene conditions have much contributed to communicable diseases throughout the country, and the covid-19 outbreak has further deteriorated preexisting WASH needs since 2020. Lack of access to basic hygiene supplies and sanitation has placed communities at heightened risk of acute respiratory infections and diarrheal diseases specifically for children under five. If this situation is not addresses, it is much likely to exacerbate not only the spread of COVID-19 but also putting affected population at risk of other waterborne diseases.
To respond to the worse WASH situation, AABRAR recently conducted a rapid assessment to know the living condition of vulnerable HHs in the targeted conflict and drought affected communities of Farah and Ghor. The assessment has used FGDs approach for collection of data and has completed in depth analysis of WASH needs. 540 participants (87% male, 13% female) and key informants have participated in the assessment among the key informants, 8% were persons with disabilities. The assessment findings show, that situation of WASH needs further deteriorated since beginning of 2021, several communities in the targeted hard-to-reach areas are in dire needs of WASH services, they don&#x2019;t have enough soft water for drinking, their existing water facilities either damaged, broken or dried. Hygiene is also a challenge, targeted population do not observe hygiene practice due to their weak financial position and poor hygiene education.
To respond to this worse situation, as part of this proposed project, AABRAR will provide lifesaving WASH support to total of 62,650 affected people (18,795 women, 18,795 men, 12,530 girls, 12,530 boys) in the targeted communities of districts Anar-Dara, Pushtrud and Pasaband of Farah and Ghor provinces. The major activities under this intervention will be as following.
1) provision of safe water for drinking, washing and personal hygiene through construction of 25 boreholes fitted with hand-pumps, construction of 8 boreholes with solar operating system and repair of 40 broken and non-functional water-wells in the targeted locations.
2) Procurement and distribution of 6,600 hygiene kits to most vulnerable people with the aim to promote good hygiene practices.
3) Along with distribution of hygiene kits distribution, hygiene education will be provided to the targeted affected communities, which will cover key topics including covid-19, personal hygiene, safe water transport and storage as well as handwashing with antiseptic soap. 

AABRAR coordinated with all key stakeholders including UNICEF, RI, WVI, PRRD and other organizations working in the region through the Sub-National Regional WASH Cluster with the aim to improve collaboration and to prevent the risk of overlaps in the targeted districts of Farah and Ghor provinces. AABRAR will continue coordination with the mentioned stakeholders throughout the project implementation period.</narrative>
