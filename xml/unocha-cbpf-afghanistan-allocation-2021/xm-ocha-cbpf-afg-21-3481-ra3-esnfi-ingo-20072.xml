   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Winterization support for vulnerable households in Ghor and Daykundi</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Allocation Strategy Paper for the 3rd Reserve Allocation of 2021 details a complex set of needs among vulnerable populations. Intensifying conflict, drought in various parts of the country, and the Covid-19 pandemic have led to widespread illness and mortality, a deep economic recession, and starkly reduced income opportunities in these provinces, which in turn has depleted productive assets and reduced communities&#x2019; capacity to cope with shocks. Afghanaid&#x2019;s recent needs assessment (attached as an annex) found that the vast majority of households in Ghor and Daykundi are unable to cover their basic needs and require urgent assistance to cover their shelter and heating needs over the winter season, which is especially long and harsh in these provinces.

In line with ESNFI cluster priorities communicated to cluster partners, Afghanaid proposes to provide crucial shelter and heating assistance to 1062 vulnerable households (800 HHs cash for heating, 262 HHs cash for rent) in Ferozkoh, Ghor, and 450 households (350 HHs cash for heating, 100 HHs cash for rent) in Nili, Daykundi, which the cluster has selected as priority locations for this allocation. Based on communities&#x2019; preferences and a recent market assessment, Afghanaid proposes cash as the modality for this response.

In Ghor, the intervention will provide 800 households in Ferozkoh with a ESNFI cluster standard cash for heating kit with a value of US$200 per household, and an additional 262 households with cash for shelter rent totaling US$225 per household covering at least three months of rent. In Nili, Afghanaid will provide 350 households in Nili with cash for heating (at US$200 per household) and an additional 100 households with cash for rent (at US$225 per household) which will cover at least three months of rent.

Afghanaid will establish participant selection and distribution committees including representatives from local communities, such as the leaders of Community Development Councils (CDCs) and District Development Assemblies (DDAs), representatives of the Afghanistan National Disaster Management Authority (ANDMA) and the Deportment of Refugees and Repatriations (DoRR), and Afghanaid. Participants will be selected according to ESNFI vulnerability criteria to ensure the vulnerable households most acutely in need are targeted, including displaced households, women-headed households and households with a large number of dependent children.

The project team will work with Etisalat&#x2019;s established mHawala service in both provinces to distribute the cash assistance from central distribution points in two tranches. Participants with limited mobility will be brought to the distribution point or receive the assistance at home. 

Afghanaid is well placed to implement this project, with over 19 years of continuous presence in Ghor and several years in Daykundi, current operations in both target districts and excellent access and strong relationships with communities as well as district and provincial authorities. Afghanaid has extensive experience in humanitarian programming, with current and recent humanitarian assistance projects in multiple provinces including Ghor and Daykundi, funded by AHF, WFP, and FAO. These projects include emergency food, livelihoods, winterization, and shelter assistance, using both in-kind and cash modalities.

This intervention is expected to provide 10,584 vulnerable men, women, boys and girls   with crucial shelter and heating assistance, helping target households meet their basic needs, reducing illness and mortality, and increasing participants&#x2019; capacity to rebuild their livelihoods by avoiding the sale of productive assets so that they are more resilient against future shocks. With the new administration potentially affecting the implementation of humanitarian projects, Afghanaid will actively engage local IEA actors to explain that we can only implement the project if we are given approval to employ and target women</narrative>
