   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Winterization Assistance to Vulnerable Families in Bamyan Province of Afghanistan</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Afghanistan remains one of the world&#x2019;s most complex humanitarian emergencies, driven by conflict, poor economic situation, natural disasters and recently compounded by COVID-19 and more now the latest political instability. Each year, freezing winter temperatures, especially in high altitude locations drive the need for the provision of life-saving winter assistance as the majority of the affected persons do not have the financial capability to purchase items to support them during the harsh winter season. 

To reach the most vulnerable families, Islamic Relief Worldwide (IRW) has designed the lifesaving proposed project, which will be implemented in Bamyan, Panjab, Yakawlang, Waras, Kahmard, Shibar, Sayghan districts of Bamyan province. The proposed location for the winterization intervention is because of the vulnerability of the area to extreme winter conditions (temperature goes down to -12 degrees C) from November to March every year. The local economy is also very weak because of remoteness and the short crop season. Poor people cannot afford heating, blankets, winter clothes during the winter season while income goes down and family expenditure increases. 

The proposed project aims to ensure that 810 poorest and most vulnerable households, 5670 individuals (Men-1,152, Women-1,152, Boys- 1,728, and girls-1,728) are protected from harsh winter conditions through winterization assistance. In accordance with the joint winterization strategy, IRW will implement a complimentary response and provide a combined package of heating support and in-kind assistance to the same beneficiaries to holistically address multiple needs and to reduce the incentive to sell-off winterization assistance to purchase other needs. The project will follow both the voucher and the in-kind distribution modalities. In-kind has been chosen for the clothes and blanket distribution so as to ensure the best value for money and thus ability to reach more families. After confirmation from the community through focus group discussions, winter clothing kit as per ESNFI standard kit and standard blankets will be procured and initial market assessments suggest that by buying clothes and blankets in bulk from the provincial or national level will allow IRW to purchase more clothes for distribution than would be available at the district level through voucher provision. 

Vouchers have been chosen for the gas distribution so as to allow families to reimburse their vouchers at a time that suits them and as opposed to having to wait for a monthly distribution. Each household will receive the ESNFI standard Winterization Package of 1x $20 value voucher for Gas Cylinder and 3 x $60 value vouchers for gas over a period of 3 months. All vouchers will be distributed in one installment and will have a four month period of validity. Specific vendors will be contacted at the district level following standard IRW procurement procedures. The project will reimburse the vouchers&apos; value to the vendors after verification.

The target households will be selected based on the pre-defined set of criteria that prioritizes the most vulnerable households. Preference will be given to women-headed households, widows, orphaned families, elderly, people with a disability or chronic illness and people with low income. IRW will involve all sections of the target population (women, girls, men, boys, people with disabilities, and the elderly) through a participatory and inclusive approach.

IRW will ensure that a complaints feedback mechanism is fully functional. IRW will closely work with the ESNFI cluster and relevant authorities to implement the project effectively and on time. IRW will also follow the &#x201C;Do No Harm&#x201D; principle that guides to ensure beneficiaries&#x2019; security and safety.</narrative>
