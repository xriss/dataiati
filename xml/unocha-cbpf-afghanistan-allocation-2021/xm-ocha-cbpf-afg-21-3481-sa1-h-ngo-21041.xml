Major diseases outbreaks are continuing and even day by day increasing from those major disease outbreak one of them is COVID-19. The de facto authorities position regarding COVID-19 program is also not clear and even unknown and the heavy movement of the people (IDPs) are reported, so all these will lead to the fourth wave of the COVID-19 in Afghanistan and Kunduz is one of the affected province, because it is central zone of the northeast region and there is heavy movement of IDPs and from other around provinces. JACK conducted rapid health need assessment in Kunduz province and held focus groups discussions with health facilities councils members both male and female in the community  the community reflected that since the COVID-19 programs stopped there isn&#x2019;t any place to refer and get the services of COVID-19 , and they are faced with challenges and this gap should be filled.
