   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Reducing the risk of vulnerable boys and girls dropping out of school in Samangan and Takhar due to drought</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In Afghanistan, 2.6 million children already present education needs (Humanitarian Needs Overview 2021). Alongside these existing needs, Afghanistan found itself amidst a global pandemic, COVID 19 that triggered school closure from February to July 2020. La Ni&#xF1;a could also trigger an important drought that, as the one of 2018, would conduct to important population displacements. With shocks anticipated over spring, and notably the drought putting extra pressure on families, the likelihood of children being taken out of school will increase, disrupting already fragile access to education for many children. Children often drop out of school in times of financial and displacement shock, placing them at higher risk of being forced to work. This is especially true when food and livelihoods are disrupted by drier than normal weather conditions, as well as when floods and displacement occur.

In this context, in the framework of AHF&#x2019;s 2d RA for 2021, ACTED will implement a 6-month project to provide education assistance to 4,260 beneficiaries (including 3,450 school-aged children) in Takhar (Rostaq, Khowja Bahawoddin and Taloqan districts) and Samangan (Aybaq, Feroz-Nakhchir and Hazrat-e-Sultan districts), 2 of the top 10 priority provinces of intervention according to the multi-sectoral Spring Disaster Contingency Plan.

In line with the EiEWG priorities, and after conducting sensitization sessions in the communities of intervention to promote the access of children to education, and notably girls, ACTED will provide support to 120 public primary schools with top-up kits and drought sensitization trainings to teachers, to prevent disengagement and to address risks associated with drought, such as communicable diseases like acute watery diarrhea (AWD),. In areas where additional influx of IDP households is expected to put too much pressure on local public schools and/or CBEs, ACTED will establish 115 Temporary Learning Spaces, equip them with textbook sets, and facilitate the set-up of Community Education Councils (CECs&#x2019;) to oversee them. ACTED will cover the salaries of TLS teachers and provide them with kits, top-up kits, as well as trainings. In the context of COVID-19 and drought, and to address more generally basic water and hygiene needs in schools, ACTED will provide each TLS with soap and a handwashing station. ACTED will use the opportunity of community mobilization and outreach to disseminate key messages on COVID-19 and on basic mitigation measures and drought risk prevention. ACTED&#x2019;s staff is trained and has experience on awareness raising and notably on how to tackle misinformation about COVID-19 and the vaccine. ACTED long-standing presence in the districts of intervention and the fact that the staff is hired as much as possible from the very same area of intervention are two key elements that will help tailor the messages to the communities.</narrative>
