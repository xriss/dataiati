   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The full impact of the recent takeover of power by the Taliban on humanitarian needs is not completely clear yet. However, because of the high level of conflict during the past months, drought and employment decline, the human suffering level from different aspects of livelihoods are severely increased. According to the recent IPC analysis report, during September and October 2021 (the post-harvest season), nearly 19 million people in Afghanistan experienced high levels of acute food insecurity (IPC Phase 3 or above), an almost 30% increase from the same season last year (14.5 million people). The main drivers of acute food insecurity include drought and its impacts on crops and livestock, the collapse of public services, a severe economic crisis and increasing food prices. An estimated 6.8 million people in Emergency (IPC Phase 4) and 11.9 million people in Crisis (IPC Phase 3) require urgent action to save their lives, reduce food gaps and protect their livelihoods. 
For the first time, Sari-e-Pul has also been classified in IPC phase 4 both in project in current. The IPC current classification (September to October period) shows that 55% of people are in IPC phase 3 and above. Looking at various food insecurity driving factors, food security situation deteriorates in Sari-e-Pul in the projection period and % of people in IPC phase 3 above increases to 66%.  In Sari-e-Pul, households&#x2019; food access during winter will further deteriorate due to: the continuing La Ni&#xF1;a climatic episode bringing below-average winter precipitation for the second consecutive year, the impact of high food prices, and growing unemployment. Reduced incomes, lower international and domestic remittances, and continuing obstacles to humanitarian assistance (many related to the financial crisis and limited physical access during the winter period) are expected to contribute to the deterioration of food security in this province. Considering the above mentioned problems and in addition to tackle with the absence of cash in the markets and banks, RRAA preferred to implement this food security project in the form of cash assistance. 
To assist people during peak wintertime, under this project, RRAA is planning to support 970 HHs (6,790 individuals) (355 HHs in Sar-e-Pul, 235 HHs in Sayad, 200 HHs in Sozma Qala and 180 HHs in Gosfandi districts) who are in IPC phase 3 and 4. These vulnerable people will be assisted with 2 months&#x2019; full basket cash assistance. As the FSAC standard food basket value, each beneficiary household will receive 2 round of USD 90 assistance during the course of project. Cash will be transferred to field through Hawala system and by FSP and in total USD 174,600 will be directly injected to 970 HHs beneficiaries and market functionality is ensured in the target communities. Since many years, RRAA has been providing food and livelihoods assistance in Sari-e-Pul in its very well connected to the agencies present in the field and government de facto authorities. The project activities will be implemented in coordination with UNOCHA, WFP and FSAC partners present in the field.</narrative>
