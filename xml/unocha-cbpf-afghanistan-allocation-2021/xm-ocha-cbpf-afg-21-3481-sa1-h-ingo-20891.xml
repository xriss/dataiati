  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Badghis is one of the hard to reach and remote province located in the western region of Afghanistan. The province is included in the list of 25 high risks provinces which will more likely be worst affected by the dry spell as identified in the multi-sectoral need analysis and included in the Humanitarian Response for Spring disaster contingency plan. Being one of the least developed province with poor infrastructures, people have to travel mostly through difficult and muddy roads specially during winter. As one of the conflict and drought affected province thus the quick assessment and desk review conducted by MMRCA as Sehatmandi implementer in Badghis indicates the early effects of dry spell and recent political changes greatly affected the local population with most of them reportedly have been taking loans to buy food and other basic needs. As the water crisis unfolds, water availability for livestock and agriculture, as well as for drinking and hygiene is a challenge for the affected communities. The affected population in white and underserved areas may need to walk longer distance to reach water sources that are currently available and may need to expend additional resources to compensate for limited local water availability and/ or poor water quality. Those who cannot afford to purchase water may de-priorities water for sanitation and hygiene, which in turn will increase risk of infectious and waterborne diseases, including COVID-19 and Acute Watery Diarrhea. At the same time, limited existing or accessible healthcare is a high risk in the affected provinces. Scale-up of mobile health teams and health surveillance to deal with the health implications of the likely drought, disease and malnutrition in these locations will be important and the need will increase in the event of displacement. Data related to IDP numbers and locations was provided by provincial authorities. 

The proposed project will cover catchment population of 48,640 with limited or no access to primary health care in the five targeted districts (Bala Murghab, Jawand, Muqor, Qadis amp Abkamari districts). Difficult terrain, poor infrastructure and the distance people need to walk to reach the health facilities are some of the constraints which makes it very difficult for people to access basic health services. As per the available data of Badghis province around 83,000 people living in white areas where they have limited or no-access to health services. Johanniter International Assistance (JIA) amp Medical Management amp Research Courses for Afghanistan (MMRCA) through this project, aims to improve access and utilization of basic primary health care services and psychosocial support by the affected population through the 
1.Establishment, equipping and staffing of 8 MHTs in Bala Murghab, Jawand, Muqor, Qadis amp Abkamari districts 
2.Provision of psychological first aid and counseling to patients showing symptoms of psychological trauma and other psychosocial problems 
3.Provision of emergency primary health services to the population living in remote amp underserved villages through MHTs. 
4.Integration of COVID 19 response such as screening, contact tracing and referral in the package of services to be provided by the Mobile Health Team 
5.Identification, Management and referrals of GBV survivors 6.Community Awareness raising on prevention amp transmission of COVID 19 infections, proper hygiene practices amp prevention of GBV. 
7. Nutrition screening and treatment of acute malnourished children, referral of MAM and SAM amp orientation of PLW on breastfeeding amp Infant amp Young Children Feeding. 
The duration of project is 6 months and will start 1st of February 2022.</narrative>
