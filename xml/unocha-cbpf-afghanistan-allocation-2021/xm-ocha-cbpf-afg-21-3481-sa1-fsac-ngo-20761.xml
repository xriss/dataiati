  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">As per the AHF 1st Standard Allocation for winterization emergency assistance to shock affected households (IPC Phase 3 and 4) in the selected districts (Kama and Surkhrod) of Nangarhar. The latest Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) analysis, published in October 2021, shows that over 22 million people (55% of the population) will face acute food insecurity (IPC Phase 3 or worse) between November 2021 and March 2022, including 8.7 million people in emergency and requiring immediate assistance. According to the IPC analysis, Nangarhar province is facing emergency level of acute food insecurity. The drought conditions driven by La Ni&#xF1;a, the current political crisis and conflict further compound the food security situation of a population which was already on the brink of a hunger crisis. Assessments of CAHPO conducted Jul-Aug show that even after harvest, 57 percent of households do not have food reserves that would last for 3 months. In urban areas, income loss (driven by economic shocks) has contributed to the rapid deterioration in food insecurity. 10 out of 11 most densely populated urban areas are anticipated to be in IPC 4. Additionally, the higher food prices are negatively impacting the purchasing power of lower-income groups across the country, reducing their access to food. Though the recent change of power and tangible reduction of conflict, the people stay displaced. As per MoRR they still have insufficient income due to several reasons (prolonged conflict in the past, COVID-19, drought, and unemployment) and impacts on livelihood activities, the majority of poor both urban and rural households are expected to be unable to meet all essential food needs. The combination of past conflict, drought as well as Covid-19, has led to 35% of the population in urban Nangarhar being classified as IPC 3 or above by the FSAC Cluster. Through the proposed project CAHPO will provide unconditional cash assistance to 1,865 households (13,053 individuals) in Surkhrod and Kama districts of Nangarhar province to buy food items/commodities. Cash distribution in 2 installments each USD 90 to cover 100% of the minimum food basket for 4 months chosen in consultation with FSAC Cluster. 1st installment after the beneficiary selection in the end of first month and 2nd installment on the 3rd month. The provision will be in two installments in order to be most cost-effective and to avoid the distributions barriers. Money Service Provider(MSP) or Hawala that will be contracted by CAHPO to facilitate the distribution at CAHPO office. The usual distribution point will have proven access to work well for all beneficiaries to be able to travel easily. Because of the new government issues with banking system, the Hawala that will be contracted by CAHPO to facilitate the cash distribution for food items at the distribution point will select by CAHPO in consultation with beneficiaries. The usual distribution point will have proven access to work well for all beneficiaries to be able to travel easily. The distribution will be done based on the signed lists and tokens issued to the selected beneficiaries by the Beneficiary Selection Committee (BSC) through the Hawala. The monitoring staff will collect the phone numbers of the beneficiaries to contact them for cash for food distribution. Beneficiaries should have NIDs or other certifications to check their identity correctly. Beneficiaries who have no NID will distribute verification cards by BSC. Information will be monitored frequently that will not affect by assumption and shared with stakeholders regarding the required food items they will receive. CAHPO team has the experience to conduct awareness training on Protection and COVID-19 separate for male/female, support with hygiene kits according to WHO guide. Nangarhar has a market area with many food suppliers and many Hawalas that make it easy to contract Hawalas to prepare the required cash for food items for beneficiaries.</narrative>
