  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In response to the 3rd Reserve Allocation 2021 HNI-TPO will implement nutrition services in in priority districts of Kunar and Laghman provinces. The HNI-TPO is a Netherland-based international organization working in Afghanistan since 1994 in health, nutrition, MHPSS, communicable disease control, GBV, humanitarian services, capacity building and research. Currently, HNI-TPO is the BPHS/EPHS implementer in Kunar and Laghman provinces, and implements EPHS in Nangarhar. HNI-TPO has been implementing other humanitarian and vertical projects in Kunar, Laghman and many other provinces of Afghanistan. 
The recent fight and collapse of districts caused internal displacement in both Kunar and Laghman provinces. Most families leave their villages and settled in the capital of the provinces or some districts centers. They leave their livelihood, homes and all tools and they fled for rescue. 
In addition, potential drought put some districts of Kunar and Laghman provinces in a dire need for emergency nutrition services to prevent morbidity and mortality in children and women.
COVID-19 pandemic third wave in the country deteriorated the situation and people access to the health facilities badly affected. 
The recent political changes will deteriorate the economy situation and families purchase power will decrease and prices of the food staff will increase. This will affect the already deteriorated nutrition and health situation in Kunar and Laghman provinces. Marginalized groups (women and children) will mostly affect from this situation. 
According to the HRP 2021, nearly one in two children under five and one in four PLW is now facing acute malnutrition and requires life-saving treatment services. 
Kunar and Laghman provinces population is scatter and distributed in valleys with harsh geographic location, transportation problems, and road block due to flood and land slide which caused to limit access to the available health facilities. Most of the health facilities are health sub centers which do not have nutrition services as per BPHS policy. 
According to the rapid assessment, the following districts will be targeted through 4 Health and Nutrition Mobile Teams (HNMTs): Asadabad, Ghazi Abad, Dara-e-Pich districts in Kunar province and Mehtarlam, Alingar and Alishang districts in Laghman province. One team will deploy in Kunar province which will focus mostly on Asadabad and will cover Ghazi Abad and Dar-e-Pich districts hard to reach areas too. 3 teams will deploy in Laghman province which will cover three districts. One team will assign for each district in Laghman province. 
Each MHNT will consist of 4 technical staff including one MD, one Midwife, One nutrition officer/nurse and one vaccinator. Project staff will train on the relevant topics. This project will provide OPD SAM and OPD MAM services. Under 5 years children and PLW screening, under 2 years GMP and RCCE regarding COVID-19 will be part of the project activities. In addition to the nutrition activities, these mobile teams will provide OPD, maternal and newborn care, family planning and vaccination services. Project will have one month inception period for staff recruitment, vehicles renting for HNMTs, provision of SAM and MAM supply form PND/UNICE and WFP, SDPs selection , kickoff , detail planning, receiving HMIS codes for HNMTs and project registration with the Ministry of Economy. 
This project will provide services to 89421 people and will regularly supervise and monitor by HNI-TPO provincial and country offices team. In addition the relevant stakeholders will be involved in all phases of the project.</narrative>
