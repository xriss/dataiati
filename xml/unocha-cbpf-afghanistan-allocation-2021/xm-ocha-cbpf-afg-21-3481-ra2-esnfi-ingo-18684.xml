   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Life-saving ESNFI assistance for conflict and natural disaster affected people in Ghor and Uruzgan</narrative>

  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In line with the AHF 2nd RA Strategy, HRP 2018-2021 SO1 and SO3, and the 2021 Spring Disaster Contingency Plan objectives 1, 2 and 3, Cordaid proposes to provide cash for shelter repair and cash for rent in priority 1 and 2 areas Ghor and Uruzgan. In Ghor (Chaghcharan and Shahrak) Cordaid will target 300 HH with category B (200 HH) and C (100 HH) damaged houses and in Uruzgan (Tarinkot), 500 HH with cat B (300 HH) and C (200HH) damaged houses. Following the ESNFI cluster recommended standard modalities, HHs with cat.B damaged houses will receive $500 and HH with cat.C damaged houses will receive $300, both in 2 instalments. Although not favourable, cash in local currency is delivered by a FSP (Bolero) through cash in envelop as other options aren&apos;t available. Level of damage is assessed by a shelter score card. In addition, 200 recently displaced or natural disaster affected HH in Uruzgan will receive $225 in 1 instalment, covering 3 months&#x2019; rent. 
The project is designed based on recent assessments and presence in both areas. In Ghor, fighting displaced people in and to Chaghcharan and Shahrak. From January to March, some 1,900 people have been displaced. It also damaged or destroyed people&#x2019;s houses, lives and livelihoods. According to the WoAA, 92% of the displaced HH have ESNFI needs. Drivers of those needs are caused by a high percentage of people living in damaged shelter. According to the IOM drought projections, people in Ghor are in IPC4. With the majority of the people in Ghor depending on agriculture, people have little income and cannot afford repair of their houses: 61-80% of the HH in Ghor have a crisis or emergency LCI (WoAA). In Uruzgan, from 29 March &#x2013; 4 April, 630 people were reportedly displaced to Tarinkot and in December 2020 some 4,000 people. Many IDPs are seeking refuge in Tarinkot centre as it is relatively safe compared to other areas. 70% of the respondents indicated that their shelter is (partially) destroyed and that they are living in sub-standard/ damaged and overcrowded shelters. Few people are able to return to their place of origin because they lack the funds to repair their houses as 23% is unemployed and most people have unreliable sources of income. 57% of the assessed people have a LCI &#x2018;emergency&#x2019;. Because of the large size of the average HH (10+ people) half of the respondents is at financial risk and 70% has incurred debts. Nearly all respondents are using negative/ irreversible coping strategies for their survival. 50% of the province is in IPC3+ and people lack the means to ensure sufficient food, let alone to repair their houses. Conflict, drought and flash floods are making them even more vulnerable, displaced people in particular as IDPs are unable to tend to their fields to provide for their families. With so many priorities, they are struggling to pay the rent and are at risk of eviction. The lack of appropriate shelter is representing health and protection risks for elderly, (chronically) ill and women/ girls in particular. The latter are already disproportionately affected by the conflict and COVID-19 and are lacking privacy as well. 
The cash for repair or rent, together with basic repair training will enable selected HHs to improve their immediate living conditions either through house repair or through rental assistance which is also following the CERF allocation providing life-saving shelter assistance to people affected by conflict, drought and COVID-19 in high (Ghor) and medium (Uruzgan) risk areas. Cash is used as markets (incl. rental market) are functional and materials are locally available. Prioritization is based on vulnerability, need for assistance and level of damage. As there is a large percentage of HH with vulnerable groups/ PSN, Cordaid will ensure inclusion of these groups in the assistance through an inclusive approach securing their meaningful participation. As per Cordaid standards, gender, protection and COVID-19 are mainstreamed.</narrative>
