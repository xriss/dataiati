   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Winterization Assistance to Vulnerable Families in Bamyan Province of Afghanistan</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Afghanistan remains one of the world&#x2019;s most complex humanitarian emergencies, driven by conflict, poor economic situation, natural disasters and recently compounded by COVID-19 and more now the latest political instability. Each year, freezing winter temperatures, especially in high altitude locations drive the need for the provision of life-saving winter assistance as the majority of the affected persons do not have the financial capability to purchase items to support during the harsh winter. 

To reach the most vulnerable families, Islamic Relief Worldwide (IRW) has designed the lifesaving proposed project, which will be implemented in Panjab, Yakawlang, Waras, Kahmard, Shibar, Sayghan and Bamyan districts of Bamyan province. The proposed location for the winterization intervention is because of the vulnerability of the area to extreme winter conditions (temperature goes down to -12 degrees C from November to March every year. The local economy is also very weak because of remoteness and the short crop season. However local markets are functional particularly for the heating materials as these are essential items during harsh winter. Poor people cannot afford heating, blankets, winter clothes during the winter season while income goes down and family expenditure increases. 

The proposed project aims to ensure that 1,420 poorest and most vulnerable households, 9,940 individuals (Men-1988, Women-1988, Boys- 2982, and girls-2982) are protected from harsh winter conditions through winterization assistance. The project will include 32% Pregnant and Lactating Women (PLWs) as direct beneficiary. In accordance with the joint winterization strategy, the project will follow both the voucher and the in-kind distribution modalities. In-kind has been chosen for the clothes and blanket distribution to ensure the best value for money and thus ability to reach more families. Initial market assessments suggest that by buying clothes and blankets in bulk from the provincial or national level will allow IRW to purchase more clothes for distribution than would be available at the district level. 

Vouchers have been chosen for the gas/firewood/coal distribution to allow families to choose the heating materials based on the availability in the local market and suitable for their use. Each household will receive the ESNFI standard Winterization Package of 1x $20 value voucher for Gas Cylinder/local Bokhari (fireplace) and 3 x $60 value vouchers for gas/firewood/coal over a period of 3 months. All vouchers will be distributed in one installment and will have a four-month period of validity. Specific vendors will be contacted at the district level following standard IRW procurement procedures. The project will reimburse the vouchers&apos; value to the vendors after verification. Instead of cash the vouchers will be used because banking system is not functional in the remote area, and it is risky to carry cash in these areas. Furthermore, it will ensure heating material and fuel are purchased by the voucher. 

The target households will be selected based on the pre-defined set of criteria that prioritizes the most vulnerable households who are left out from other winterization assistance because of limited allocations. Preference will be given to women-headed households, widows, orphaned families, elderly, people with a disability or chronic illness and people with low income. IRW will involve all sections of the target population (women, girls, men, boys, people with disabilities, and the elderly). 

IRW will ensure that a complaints feedback mechanism is fully functional. IRW will closely work with the ESNFI cluster and relevant authorities to implement the project effectively and on time. IRW will also follow the &#x201C;Do No Harm&#x201D; principle that guides to ensure beneficiaries&#x2019; security and safety.</narrative>
