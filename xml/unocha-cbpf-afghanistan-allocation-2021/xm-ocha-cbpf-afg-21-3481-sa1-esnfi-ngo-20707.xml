   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Winterization Assistance for Vulnerable Conflict and Drought Affected Households in Kunduz Province</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The coalition of conflict and Drought has left most of people unable to face Afghanistan&#x2019;s freezing winter temperatures. Around half a million people have become displaced since last winter and now lack essential NFIs for winter survival. Additionally, the economic devastation of the conflict has left highly vulnerable communities in displacement without access to heating and fuel. This shock risks pushing families into adopting negative coping mechanisms.
The target beneficiaries of ADEO&#x2019;s intervention will be the caseload who has not received winterization assistance and has been referred to ADEO for re-assessment/verification by ES/NFI Regional Cluster for Winterization assistance (Referral is Attached as Annex)
The re-assessment/verification findings show a significant need of winterization assistance for vulnerable Conflict and Drought affected IDP and Returned IDP household.
To respond to this crisis, ADEO is proposing urgent winterization support for both IDPs in Kunduz city as well as returned IDPs to their place of origin in districts of Kunduz province. 
The proposed intervention will primarily target the most vulnerable families who have been affected by Conflict and Drought in June - August of 2021 in Kunduz Province. 
The intervention consists of Cash for Heating, Winter Clothing and Blanket as a lifesaving activity
The intervention will target 1180 IDPs and Returned IDPs households (8260 Individuals), through Cash and in kind modality contributions as they are unable to access markets for winterization NFIs. 
For the use of Cash distribution modality, ADEO conducted some focus group discussions among beneficiaries and they showed a strong preference for using Hawala as Financial Service Provider, the market check shows that Hawala system is functional in all the areas of intervention
However direct cash distribution by ADEO has lower cost than Hawala and simplifies beneficiaries&#x2019; verification but due to security risk and Transparency of distribution ADEO intend to use Hawala.
Banking system is not stable and withdrawal of cash is difficult and also it is not available in district level.
Mobile money is not available in all area and beside this all the project beneficiaries don&#x2019;t have access special elderly, pregnant and lactating women.
The assistance will be delivered to the doorstep of those families who are particularly vulnerable and cannot collect from distribution points.
To contribute with Nutrition cluster the intervention will target 377 Households with pregnant and lactating women PLW affected by acute malnutrition.
ADEO proposes to intervene in Kunduz City, Aliabad, Char Dara, Imam Sahib and Khanabad districts of Kunduz province.
During distributions and monitoring, ADEO will mainstream COVID-19 risk communication and awareness messaging and materials &#x2013; including COVID-19 Kits and Hygiene promotion as well as gender-sensitive behavioral change messaging to positively influence expenditure choices and coping strategies. Since the distribution is conducted in an enclosed space during winter, ADEO will limit the number of beneficiaries per distribution and will provide masks to beneficiaries as well as project staff
Sanitizers will be procured for use by beneficiaries and staff during the distribution. Gender, age, and disability considerations will be integrated as much as possible to ensure the response is inclusive to all segments of a community, particularly People with Specific Needs (PSNs). The winterization response will pay special attention to children, the elderly, chronically ill, or those with limited mobility to deliver lifesaving insulation support to the most at-risk groups.
This project will fill existing gaps in ESNFI support and complement activities undertaken by other partners who are responding the same caseloads
ADEO will monitor the implementation process through the life of the project and will have Post distribution monitoring after the completion of the project</narrative>
