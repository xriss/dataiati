  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The AHF 3rd Reserved Allocation Strategy paper indicates that after a significantly lower than average winter precipitation and higher than average temperature associated with the La Ni&#xF1;a expected to impact significantly across most regions, particularly in the western, northern, southern, and central highlands of Afghanistan, it is anticipated that the situation will impact on both rain-fed and irrigated agriculture, including cereal production, as well as pasture conditions.

The 2021 Humanitarian Response Plan indicates that food prices are about 10-20% higher compared to the 5-year average, while the purchasing power of casual laborers and pastoralists has deteriorated almost 19% and 20% respectively over the last year. Overall, high levels of poverty and food insecurity are fuelling the adoption of negative coping mechanisms, presenting serious dangers to vulnerable people including elevated risks of GBV, early marriage, child labor, begging and recruitment by armed groups and additional debt accumulation. Without immediate, comprehensive anticipatory action, the already dire food insecurity and protection situation will be exacerbated by the consequences of the La Ni&#xF1;a effect. This also applies in Kunar, Paktika, and Laghman provinces. In addition, heavy fighting in Laghman and Nangarhar provinces resulted in increased number of IDPs in Kunar with urgent need of humanitarian assistance. The IDPs are either renting or being hosted by friends. A growing number are also staying in the open in different parts of the city with lack of access to urgent needs, including food.
Lack of access to proper seeds and fertilizers by farmers in Paktika and Laghman provinces has created cultivation issues, hence resulting in reduced product quality and volume. Farmers do not have access to improved agriculture inputs that can halt hunger and tolerate climate change impacts. Lack of access to fertilizers and seeds will negatively affect the households&#x2019; income and resilience against food shortages. They also lack the knowledge and ability regarding effective and proper use of improved seeds and fertilizers.

Through the proposed project, AWRO will provide unconditional cash for food assistance to 1,113 shock-affected HHs (7,789 individuals &#x2013; based on average family size of 7) in Asad Abad district of Kunar province to households in &#x2018;crisis&#x2019; (IPC Phase 3) and &#x2018;emergency&#x2019; (IPC Phase 4) food insecurity and those anticipated to be affected by flood, dry spell and other risks, as per the IPC analysis 2021. Based on the FSAC cluster standards and the allocation strategy paper, every eligible HH will receive USD 180 (equivalent AFN amount based on the exchange rate of the particular period). The cash provided will help the families provide food for their families during the tough situations. This will make sure the vulnerable households have acceptable food consumption score.
The distribution of vegetable seeds, fertilizers, and wheat seed packages will ensure improved productivity, increased income, improved food availability, and enhanced access to livelihood. This will make sure that the target farmers have access to proper agri inputs to ensure proper cultivation. The training workshops provided will enhance the knowledge and capacity of the farmers in proper use of the seeds and fertilizers further contributing to increased production quality and volume.

1. Asad Abad district of Kunar province
1,113 multiple shock-affected Families (1,674 Men, 2104 Women, 1892 Boys and 2119 Girls) 
Will receive US$ 180 for four months food assistance (Full package of FSAC Standard food basket of family 90 USD/month x 2 = USD 180) in two tranches to cover food needs for four months.

2. Mehtarlam and Qarghayi districts of Laghman province, and Yusuf Khalil and Sharana districts of Paktika province
3,859 eligible HHs in Laghman and 2,000 HHs in Paktika provinces&#x2019; mentioned districts will receive agricultural input packages (Seeds amp Fertilizers)</narrative>
