   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Life-saving Food Assistance for Most Vulnerable People of Bamyan province in Afghanistan</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The proposed project aims to provide life-saving food assistance for 2,180 poor and most vulnerable families (15,260 individuals men- 3,052, women- 3,052, boys- 4,578, girls- 4,578), with a preference will be given to the pregnant and lactating women, women headed households, widow, orphaned families, children, elderly, person with disability, poorest and most vulnerable families in Bamyan, Panjab, Yakawolang districts of Bamyan province in Afghanistan. The project is aligned with the AHF&#x2019;s strategy of 1st Standard Allocation 2021, will directly contribute to achieve the HRP&#x2019;s Strategic Objective-1 &#x201C;Lives are saved in the areas of highest needs&#x201D; 

As per IPC projection, within the period of November 2021 &#x2013; March 2022, 25% (164,688 individuals) of population in Bamyan province will be fallen under phase-4, emergency food insecurity. Bamyan is one of the food insecure provinces in Afghanistan because of its mountainous territory, very limited agriculture land, low food/crop production, less economic and employment opportunities, and isolation from other areas. Main sources of income of the people in Bamyan province is subsistence agriculture and livestock. In 2021, agricultural productions, particularly potato products have been dropped to half due to the below-average precipitation in the last wet season, lack of enough water for irrigation and long winter seasons which ultimately negatively impact on agriculture and livestock productions. Income generation activities also reduce during the winter season due to the closing of labor markets and agriculture activities. In addition, the economic decline in the wake of recent political transition in the country have severely decreased the income of Bamyan residents. Poor families can&#x2019;t afford basic food items for the family members during and after winter season. They need external food assistance to survive in the upcoming lean period. (Nov. 2021 to May 2022).

FSAC standard food package in each month will be distributed among the selected 2,180 beneficiary households for two months period. Food Security and Agriculture Cluster (FSAC)&#x2019;s recommended standard in-kind food basket pack will be followed, which each package contents: 62 Kg wheat flour, 25 Kg rice, 15 Kg pulses, 9 litter vegetable oil and 1 kg salt. The project team will select the beneficiaries in a systematic approach as per IRW&#x2019;s standard practices which comply with the AAP WG&#x2019;s standards. The poorest and most vulnerable households will be identified and selected as per FSAC selection criteria, in close consultation with target communities through an inclusive process. Each one of the beneficiaries will be provided with awareness on nutrition and WASH on monthly basis, so that to be able to improve food consumption and hygiene practices.

Systematic monitoring and evaluation procedures will be followed to measure the progress and quality delivery of the project. Post Distribution Monitoring (PDM) will be carried out among 10% of beneficiary households. Complaint and Feedback Mechanism (CFM) will be in place in every step of the project implementation. The project team will be working with the community elders, religious leaders, local authorities, community people, and beneficiaries as well for ensuring their effective participation. The project will be implemented in impartial and non-discriminatory ways to promote the dignity and integrity of the people who will be receiving humanitarian assistance. IRW will also follow the &#x201C;Do No Harm&#x201D; principle to ensure beneficiaries&#x2019; security and safety. The project team will take necessary measures to minimize risks associated with the project implementation. 

IRW has smooth access in the proposed districts in Bamyan as currently one project (funded by AHF-OCHA) is being implemented in the same locations. IRW will maintain coordination with government authorities, OCHA, FSAC and other coordination mechanisms.</narrative>
