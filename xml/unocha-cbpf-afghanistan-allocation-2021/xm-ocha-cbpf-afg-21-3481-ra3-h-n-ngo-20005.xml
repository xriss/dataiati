  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Organization for Community Coordination and Development (OCCD) reregistered with the Ministry of Economy, and it is a non-profit, non-governmental, non-political and independent organization.  OCCD is already a BPHS implementing institution which means that it is accredited already with MoPH and meets all requirements for large scale projects implementation. OCCD is an initiative of senior Afghan staff whose vast and enriched experience is an asset to the country. The aim of the founders of OCCD is to transfer the experiences and expertise from several national and international organizations to a purely Afghan context in order to ensure the sustainability of efforts as well as provide opportunities for Afghans to use their full potentials in humanitarian and community development activities.

The proposed action under this allocation aims to reduce the vulnerability of Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) and other vulnerable in host communities through provision of integrated lifesaving health and nutrition services in four priority districts of Badakhshan province namely Yamgan Teshkan, Tagab, districts as well as the IDPs in the Baghi Zeart area of Faizabad city. In the proposed project, OCCD intends to undertake the following key interventions:

Health: Establishing and maintain three first aid trauma posts (FATPs) at Teshkan BHC (Teshkan district), Yamgan BHC (Yamgan district) and Yemgan BHC ( Yamgan district) to provide first aid, stabilization and referral service to conflict and not- conflict trauma patients.
Medical and non-medical equipment are procured and installed and vehicles will be rented to serve as ambulances to ensure timely transportation of conflict wounded patients to nearest hospitals. 
FATPs will be staffed with three males and one female health professional (midwife/nurse) and the ambulance with one male nurse. and will be trained on Basic Life Support (BLS) and Psychosocial Support (PSS). Additionally, two staff from BPHS paid staff (male and female) will be trained on the above subjects to continue services delivery after the project conclusion. As of the proportionate reduction in the trauma cases due to recent power shift and disruption of the BPHS services, the FATPs will deliver primary health care services to the relevant catchment areas as well.

Nutrition: Deployment of one integrated mobile health and nutrition team (MHNT) covering IDPs in the Baghi Zerat area in Faizabad city. MHNT will be providing Outpatient Department of Severe Acute Malnutrition (OPD-SAM), Outpatient Department of Moderate Acute Malnutrition (OPD-MAM), services to acutely malnourished boys and girls (6 to 59 months) and Acutely Malnourished Pregnant and Lactating Women (AM PLW), Integrated Management of Neonatal and Childhood Illnesses (IMNCI) to children under five years old age, primary health care including immunization to boys , girls , men and women IYCF-E counselling services and psychosocial support to IDPs and host communities. 
MHNT also will be providing Blanket Supplementary Food (BSF) to protect the nutritional status of children 5-59 months and PLWs. The MHNT will be staffed with one male MD, One midwife, one vaccinator, one nutrition counselor/nurse and a driver. 
OCCD will establish and maintain collaborative and cooperative working network with the BPHS/EPHS implementing NGO as well as other health/nutrition implementing NGOs in the project implementation site. OCCD will ensure the implementation of this project in close coordination with all relevant governmental counterparts and local actors at the national, provincial and community level.</narrative>
