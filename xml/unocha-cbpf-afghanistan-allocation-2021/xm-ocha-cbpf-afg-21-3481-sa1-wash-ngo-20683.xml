   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Emergency WASH response to vulnerable drought and conflict-affected IDPs and host population who are exposed to risks of unsafe water, unhygienic practices in the community Zabul and Helmand provinces.</narrative>

  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project will be scaling up to assist the recent drought, conflict amp COVID-19 affected communities with urgent needs of Zabul (Mizan district), and Helmand (Nawzad district) as an emergency response. The droughts caused prolonged poverty that contributes to a worsening humanitarian situation in Afghanistan. Over 18.4 million people require some form of humanitarian and protection assistance in 2021. As per the WASH Cluster strategy AHF 1st SA 2021, WASH is one of the crucial needs in the targeted districts. The IDP in these areas has further increased humanitarian needs during 2021. In Helmand and Zabul only a few NGOs are functional as there were hard to reach (HRT) districts, very deprived communities. CAHPO coordinated with WASH Cluster regional level, local authority to support drought and conflict-affected IDPs in the remote districts&apos; access to water, hygiene promotion.

inline with the WASH cluster strategy CAHPO intends to ensure the provision of emergency water amp hygiene promotion to people with critical needs. Hygiene promotion with focusing on handwashing and distribution of hygiene kits the WASH Cluster standard. The aims are to enhance the health, dignity, and protection of vulnerable families&#x2019; men, women, boys, and girls. 

The project target 1800 households or 12600 individuals who will have access to water and receive hygiene promotion training. For sustainability, local mechanics and caretakers will be trained in support of water points. Water Management Committees (WMCs) will be established and trained in separate female and male groups (by female amp male trainers) to keep the water points functional. These groups will carry out the management and maintenance responsibilities once the water points will be handed over. In order to make the intervention sustainable a small water user fee for the maintenance of the water system will be collected and administered.

According to the WASH Cluster strategy, the activities prioritized include Water source surveillance and drying-up alerts, Supply systems rehabilitation or creation of new water points, Household water treatment promotion, Hygiene promotion focusing on handwashing, WASH for GBV risk mitigation, for the elderly, and people with disabilities.

Provide awareness to beneficiaries on hygiene and DRR (Disaster Risk Reduction). Protection, gender, age, disability, and COVID-19 will be mainstreamed. Totally 3600 people (one female and one male per HH), including traditional Shura members, will participate directly. The coordination with all stakeholders, especially with DRRD, district government, and Shura members is very essential, and also with provincial authorities and DoE. Accountability to beneficiaries, CHS, and the AWAAZ complaint procedure will be instrumental to inform the beneficiaries. 

Conflict reduced due to political change of power, still, the people stay displaced in the project area. As per MoRR the displaced HHs still have insufficient income due to several reasons (droughts lead to the reduction of water for an all-purpose, prolonged conflict in the past, COVID-19, and lack of employment) and impacts on the availability of drinking water. People especially the poor in the rural areas are expected to be unable to prepare water for their consumption. The combination of past conflict, drought amp Covid-19, has led to over 35% of the population settling in urban areas. As mentioned by most people they can return after rehabilitation of the infrastructures particularly WASH which is the first need of the families. 

Community Shura members are actively allowed by the new administration to assist the process. In addition, the project team consults the activities with the NGO commission of the new administration. Though, some of the issues are sensitive but the project team will try to advocate for them, e.g. GBV, access to water points for all including women and girls.</narrative>
