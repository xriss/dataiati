   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Organization for Community Coordination and Development (OCCD) is a non-profit, non-governmental, non-political and independent organization reregistered with the Ministry of Economy and Ministry of Public Health. OCCD is already a BPHS implementing institution which means that it is accredited already with MoPH and meets all requirements for large scale projects implementation. OCCD is an initiative of senior Afghan staff whose vast and enriched experience is an asset to the country. The aim of the founders of OCCD is to transfer the experiences and expertise from several national and international organizations to a purely Afghan context in order to ensure the sustainability of efforts as well as provide opportunities for Afghans to use their full potentials in humanitarian and community development activities.

Concerning the 1st standard allocation, OCCD through the proposed project, intends to undertake the following key interventions: 
1. Establish and maintain six integrated Mobile Health and Nutrition Team to provide lifesaving nutrition service using integrated management of acute malnutrition (IMAM) approach and primary health care services to estimated population of 94,200  living in 83 remote villages of Onaba, Shutol, Rukha, Hesi Awal, Paryan and Dara districts of Panjsher province. 
2. Establish and maintain four integrated Mobile Health and Nutrition Team to provide lifesaving nutrition service using integrated management of acute malnutrition (IMAM) approach and primary health care services to estimated population of 52,685 living in 50 remote villages of Teskhan, Shahr-e-Buzorg, Yagman, and Drayeem districts of Badakhshan province.
3- Each MHNT will be staffed with a male MD or nurse, a midwife, a female nutrition nurse, a vaccinator, and a community mobilizer who will also support nutrition supply distribution to beneficiaries as instructed.
4- MHNTs will travel twice a month to pre-planned villages that are not served by the existing Basic Package of Heath Service (BPHS) stationary health facilities (HFs) to provide: (a) Outpatient Department of Severe Acute Malnutrition (OPD-SAM) (b) Outpatient Department of Moderate Acute Malnutrition (OPD-MAM), services to acutely malnourished boys and girls (6 to 59 months) and Acutely Malnourished Pregnant and Lactating Women (AM PLW) (c) Integrated Management of Neonatal and Childhood Illnesses (IMNCI) to children under five years old age, primary health care including immunization to boys , girls , men and women (d) Maternal, Infant and Young Child Nutrition (MIYCN)  and psychosocial (PSS) counselling services to primary caregivers of children
5- Training of staff on IMAM, MIYCN and PSS
This proposal is in line with the first AHF standard allocation strategy 2021 envelope i.e. Deployment of MHNTs (Activity 3 and 7) and will target 93,018 direct beneficiaries including 14,729  man, 42,168  women, 18,335 boys and 17,786  boys. OCCD will implement this project in close coordination with all relevant actors at the national, provincial and community levels and will maintain a cooperative and collaborative working environment with the BPHS/EPHS implementing NGO as well as other health stakeholders in the project implementation site. OCCD will ensure submission of the timely technical and financial reports as per the contractual requirement in soft and hard copies/forms to the donor.</narrative>
