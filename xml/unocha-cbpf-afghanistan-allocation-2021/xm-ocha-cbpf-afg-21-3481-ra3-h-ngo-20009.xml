  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">AADA is a non-political, non-profit and independent national organization currently implementing BPHS/EPHS in Ghazni, Paktia and BPHS in Zabul, Nangarhar and Herat provinces accordingly. AADA has a wealth of experience in terms of implementation in more than 18 humanitarian response projects funded by CHF/AHF, WHO, WFP and UNFPA since the past six years.

The key activities of this action will be based around three major interventions:
 
(a) On the basis of demands from the community and new health authorities, the previously AHF funded First Aid Trauma Posts (FATPs)  under 2020 1st Standard Allocation (concluded on 31 April 21) in Barakat BHC in Khawaja Omari, Nawa CHC in Nawa, Zanakhan CHC in Zanakhan and Waghaz CHC in Waghaz districts will be re-activated to continue with provision of lifesaving trauma care and psychosocial support to conflict affected people. (b) Deployment of four Rapid Response Teams (RRT) linked to FATPs to ensure timely evacuation of conflict casualties from frontline to FATPs and referring at risk pregnancies and severe illness and nearest hospitals (c) Due to extreme needs, enhancing the capacity of Qarabagh, and Muqur districts hospitals (DHs) by assigning additional specialized health work force, provision of surgery equipment and supplies to provide specialized trauma management services to massive casualties and conflict induced trauma cases referred from BHCs, CHCs and health sub-centers (HSCs). The FATPs will also support provision of primary health care services to health facility beneficiaries where the FATPs are established.   

Each FATP will be staffed with two male and one female health professionals (midwife/nurse) and RRT with one male nurse and support staff. TCUs at target DHs will be staffed with one male or female surgeon, two male nurses, two female nurses and two support staff (one male and one female cleaner to provide 24/7 services in the target location. TCUs buildings that significantly damaged due to airstrike will be rehabilitated to make it fully functional. 
All medical professionals involved in service provision will be trained on Basic Life Support (BLS), Psychosocial Support (PSS) and cross cutting subjects (protection mainstreaming, gender, accountability to affected population and PSEA). To ensure project sustainability at least two BPHS paid staff (male and female) in each targeted HF will be trained on the above subjects to continue service delivery after the project conclusion.
 
The proposed action will target 70,657 direct beneficiaries including 31,759 women and 6,172 girls. 
 
The project implementation will be carried out in close coordination with the Provincial Public Health Directorate (PPHD), regional health cluster (RHC), and other stakeholders including communities and groups involved in different locations in the province.</narrative>
