   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Life-Saving Food Security Assistance to IDPs, Returnees and Host Communities of IPC Phase 3+ in Sighan, Sheiber and Kahmard districts of  Bamyan   Province.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The proposed project aims to deliver in-kind food assistance to most vulnerable IDPs, Returnees and host community households in Kahmard, Saighan and Shibar districts of Bamyan province. The project will initially cover 70% IDPs, 20% returnees and 10% host community households to ensure a community based approach. 250 multiple shock-affected households in Kahmard district, 300 multiple shock-affected households in Saighan district and 500 multiple shock-affected households in Shibar district will receive the standard in-kind monthly food package of FSAC (46 Kg flour wheat, 8.4 Kg pulses, 4.5 Kg Vegetable Oil and 1 Kg Iodized Salt) for 4 months in 2 distribution cycles. As an active member of OCTs and other coordination forums in central highland provinces including Bamyan province, WSTA will closely coordinate the assessment/beneficiary selection, distribution and other activities of the project with new government, UN agencies, INGOs, NNGOs and other stakeholders to avoid duplication in response, and to address transparency and accountability within the overall process. The cluster recommended tools will be used for data collection, analysis and reporting while we will put additional tools to collect more segregated data as per Age, Gender and Diversity (AGD) approach. Women headed households, child headed households, elderly headed households, survivors of GBV and other protection incidents will be prioritized for the assistance if the needs were higher than the available resources. We will closely work with government line departments, beneficiary representatives and other stakeholders to identify and select our distribution points in target province/districts, which shall be safe and accessible for men, women, children, elderly and persons with disability with enough facilitation in place. The COVID-19 protocols will be strictly applied throughout the implementation process to ensure safety of our staff, beneficiaries and stakeholders. Project visibility, reporting to cluster, AHF and government will be properly managed   as per the requirements of each party. We will use the services of AWAAZ Afghanistan and our internal hotline number to register the complaints, and will ensure that the target communities receive our complaint leaflets during the assessments and distribution. We will also help desk at community level and during the distribution process to ensure the beneficiaries/affected population of concern can register their complaints and raise their concerns. With the support of OCT members and other humanitarian actors at provincial level, we will form a distribution committee to avoid duplication and to further address transparency and accountability within the distribution process. Our MampE and Project Control units will regularly monitor, evaluate and verify the project activities to improve the quality of our work, exercising a comprehensive lessons learned, and to address compliance. In the end phase, we will conduct a post distribution monitoring exercise to monitor and evaluate the impact of assistance on lives of our beneficiaries as per Age, Gender and Diversity and to ensure that the assistance are delivered in a transparent and accountable manner to target population of concern in compliance with the project requirements.</narrative>
