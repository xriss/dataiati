   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Abandoned Improvised Mine Clearance</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project will be implemented by the Abandoned Improvised Mine (AIM) division of The HALO Trust. HALO was founded in Afghanistan and has over 30 years of experience conducting Mine Action activities in the county. More recently, HALO established the first AbIMs capability in Afghanistan. Since 2018, HALO has deployed AIM manual clearance, mechanical clearance, non-technical survey (NTS), quick response teams and explosive ordnance education (EORE) teams. HALO is the only mine action organisation in Afghanistan with experience in clearing AIMs. HALO has deployed AIM teams across 12 provinces and conducted clearance in Helmand, Ghazni, and Nangarhar provinces. As of April 2021, HALO has cleared 645,113 square meters of AIM contamination, safely locating and destroying 354 AIMs, to the benefit of 283,229 individuals. 
 
Afghanistan continues to suffer from a deadly conflict that has lasted over 40 years. There are high levels of poverty and acute food insecurity across the country, particularly in Eastern provinces like Nangarhar which is experiencing crisis levels (IPC April 2021). As the conflict intensifies, the number of internally displaced people is expected to rise. Explosive devices that remain after conflict often prevent people from returning home, and injure or kill those who do or are fleeing conflict in other areas. AIM clearance in Nangarhar will directly contribute to saving the lives and livelihoods of some of the most vulnerable populations in Afghanistan.  
  
Under this project, HALO will deploy 11 manual clearance teams to Deh Bala and Achin districts. Each AIM clearance team will consist of five AIM deminers, one AIM deminer medic, one senior medic, and one team leader. HALO will also provide employment to local community members as guards, cooks, drivers, and community mobilisers over the course of the project. Under the original project design, HALO proposed the purchase of eight Wirehound VR1 detectors. However, since then, the DMAC has generously agreed to provide HALO with 11 Wirehound detectors for the duration of the upcoming AHF AIM clearance project. This development has allowed HALO to propose the deployment of three additional AIM teams and provide greater benefit to affected communities. Freight and transport costs will be avoided, and instead the budget will include insurance for the detectors while they are in HALO possession. 
 
In addition to the clearance teams, HALO will also deploy two quick response teams, which will operate in Deh Bala, Achin and Bati Kot districts. This team will consist of one team leader, one assistant team leader, one deminer, and one deminer medic. One team leader will be AIM EOD qualified. The teams will conduct the following activities:  
o	Collect accurate information on mine/ERW/AIM contamination in the planned districts, and victim information. 
o	Marking of hazardous areas identified during survey to deter civilian entrance and reduce risk of accidents. 
o	Provide Explosive Ordnance Risk Education (EORE) for at-risk populations in the planned districts to raise awareness of the risks and provide critical information on safe behavior that can reduce the likelihood of accidents. 
o	dispose of AIM components through community and security forces&#x2019; call outs, although only one team will have EOD capability, the other team will be able to coordinate safe disposal of AIMs  
  
The targets for the project are: 
	At least 216,553 square meters cleared  
	7 tasks released  
	Total  direct and indirect beneficiaries: 22,665 
	4,424 (632 men, 632 women, 1,546 boys, and 1,614 girls) direct beneficiaries from clearance  
	3,321 (822 men, 815  women, 848  boys, and 836 girls) indirect beneficiaries from clearance  
	828 EORE sessions delivered  
	12,420 (1,020 men, 7,400 boys, and 4,000 girls) EORE beneficiaries
	About 2,500 (300 men, 285 women, 1,115 boys, and 800 girls) direct beneficiaries of survey and AIM EOD.</narrative>
