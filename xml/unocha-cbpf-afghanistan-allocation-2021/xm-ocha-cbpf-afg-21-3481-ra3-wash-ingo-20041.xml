  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Considering the strategic objectives of the Afghanistan Humanitarian Fund (AHF), particularly those set under the 2021 AHF RA3, IMC proposes emergency lifesaving WASH services for areas with the highest needs in Kunar province. This package of WASH services will target conflict-induced IDP (Internally Displaced People) and drought-affected communities in three hard-to-reach districts, namely Shultan, Waterpur, and Nurgal. This package of services is designed based on IMC&#x2019;s needs assessment findings conducted in these districts during February &#x2013; June 2021 in collaboration with WASH Cluster members, local partners and authorities, and community members. The project will provide WASH services to a total of 14,280 individuals, including 4,284 women, 4,141 men, 2,856 boys, 2,999 girls from diverse social groups. 

The services under this package will provide safe drinking water, improve water quantity and quality in the target districts, establish water management committees and train their members, and promote hygiene. These services will help individuals and families to access, utilize and manage water in their communities and practice proper hygiene who have otherwise been forced to choose negative coping strategies such as drinking water from unprotected sources and adopting unsafe hygiene behaviors. This project will last 12 months and requires a around $ 357,226 budget. Below, a summary of the specific activities to be carried out under this project is provided.
 Construction of 4 solar-powered pipe schemes (1 in Shultan, 2 in Watapur, and 1 in Nurgal)
 Water table measurement : in order to know about the drawdown of the ground water and to know the static and dynamic level of the water . 
 Provision of water kits for collection and storage of safe water and distribution of water treatment chemicals to the communities (at household level)
 Establish and train 4 water management committees to give the communities a sense of ownership and responsibility for project activities and maintain good communication among all stakeholders.
 Training of community members as mechanics for regular maintenance of pipe schemes and other WASH infrastructure after the project ends
 Conducting 3 rounds of hygiene awareness sessions and
 Distributing a total of 2,040 water kits.
The intervention will take specific care to implement the program per the Sphere standard, ensuring safe access for vulnerable groups, such as women and girls, to the services.
