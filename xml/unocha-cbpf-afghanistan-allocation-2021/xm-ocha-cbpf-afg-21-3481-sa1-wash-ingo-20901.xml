   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Emergency WASH Response for protracted IDPs and vulnerable host communities in Paktia and Kapisa Provinces.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Afghanistan is currently in a state of imminent humanitarian catastrophe with half of its population (18 million) in need of humanitarian assistance, some 8 million will require safe drinking water 8.3 million hygiene materials and practices 4.2 million emergency sanitation options 4.5 million WASH items. The water and sanitation situation in Afghanistan is also one of the worst in the world with 68% of Afghans without access to adequate sanitation facilities and according to UNICEF, nearly 45% are still using unimproved water sources. 

The project proposes an appropriate and well-timed response to address immediate needs of extremely vulnerable affected IDPs and host communities in Gardez and Mirzaka Districts (Sayed Karam) of Paktia and Mahamud e Raqi, Kapisa central district of Kapisa Provinces through provision of adequate and sustainable WASH services at household and community-level. The project aims to improve access to safe water, improve sanitation, provision of hygiene items, hygiene promotion  and ensure community engagement to improve hygiene practices to the most vulnerable and marginalized IDPs and host communities in underserved communities. 

The humanitarian response covers a critical gap in Acute Watery Diarrhea (AWD) potentially affected areas by providing or expanding existing WASH facilities in the affected communities. In addition, communities near to protracted IDPs whose WASH facilities are overstretched will be supported though WASH services provision. The project is aligned with the AHF Standard Allocation Response Strategy 2021 1st RA and has been coordinated through relevant fora, DACCAR and notably the Afghanistan WASH Cluster.

Targeting 3400 vulnerable households (23,800 individuals) in Mahmud e Raqi district of Kapisa and Gardez and Mirzaka (Sayed Karam) districts of Paktia Provinces. NRC proposes to rehabilitate/upgrade 180 existing water sources (wells, hand pumps, and gravity-fed networks, solar-pumping etc.) through contractual services. In addition, 3400 vulnerable families will be supported hygiene kits, and chlorination as well AWD affected families will be support with mini WASH package which include rehabilitation or construction of household latrines.
The items will be provided though in-kind distribution to the targeted households. All of the WASH project hard interventions will be complemented with soft component of hygiene promotion by engaging of diverse community individuals and groups with emphasis on women and girls&#x2019; participation. The hygiene promotion activities will be specifically focusing on prevention of AWD and COVID-19. 

The project will implement gender sensitive WASH facilities and educate women and girls on good personal hygiene practices to prevent personal WASH related diseases. The project will also seek to reduce the effect of poor WASH and malnutrition that lead to health acquired infections and transmission of diseases including cholera/AWD and COVID-19 within target communities.
The project activities will be implemented by existing trained WASH team composed of National WASH Engineer and Hygiene Promoter, having a good experience working in the area with both IDPs and host communities. They will be supported by WASH Project Coordinator, WASH Specialist and WASH Advisor based in Kabul.</narrative>
