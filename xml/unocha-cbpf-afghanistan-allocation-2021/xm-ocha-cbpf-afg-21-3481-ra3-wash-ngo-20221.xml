   <narrative xml:lang="EN">WASH Emergency assistance for the most vulnerable drought and conflict-affected IDPs and host population who are exposed to risks unclean water and lack of hygienic practices.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project will assist the recent drought, conflict amp COVID-19 affected communities with urgent needs of Zabul (Arghndab and Tarnak wa Jaldak), and Hilmand (Sangin and Mosa Qala) as an emergency response. The droughts prolonged poverty contributes to a worsening humanitarian situation in Afghanistan. Over 18.4 million people require some form of humanitarian and protection assistance in 2021. As per the WASH Cluster strategy AHF 3rd RA, WASH is one of the crucial needs in the targeted districts. The IDP in these areas has further increased humanitarian needs during 2021. In Hilmand and Zabul only a few NGOs are functional as there were hard to reach (HRT) districts, very deprived communities. CAHPO with the collaboration of the community has collected information and wants to support drought and conflict-affected IDPs in the 4 remote districts&apos; access to water, hygiene, and sanitation.
As per the WASH cluster strategy CAHPO intends to ensure the provision of emergency water amp hygiene promotion to people with critical needs. Hygiene promotion with focusing on handwashing and distribution of hygiene kits as per the WASH Cluster standard. The aims are to enhance the health, dignity, and protection of vulnerable families&#x2019; men, women, boys, and girls. 
The project target 2250 households or 15750 individuals who will have access to water and receive hygiene promotion training. For sustainability, local mechanics and caretakers will be trained in support of water points. Water Management Committees (WMCs) will be established and trained in separate female and male groups (by female amp male trainers) to keep the water points functional. These groups will carry out the management and maintenance responsibilities once the water points will be handed over. In order to make the intervention sustainable a small water user fee for the maintenance of the water system will be collected and administered.
As per the strategy, the activities prioritized include Water source surveillance and drying-up alerts, Supply systems rehabilitation or creation, Household water treatment promotion, Hygiene promotion focusing on handwashing, WASH for GBV risk mitigation, for the elderly, and people with disabilities.
Awareness to beneficiaries will be given on hygiene and DRR (Disaster Risk Reduction). Protection, gender, age, disability, and COVID-19 will be mainstream. Totally 4500 people (one female and one male per HH), including traditional Shura members, will participate directly. The coordination with all stakeholders, especially with DRRD, district government, and Shura members is very essential, and also with provincial authorities and DoE. To be accountable to beneficiaries, CHS and the AWAAZ complaint mechanism will be applied. 
Though the recent change of power and context (reduction of conflict), the people stay displaced in the project area. As per MoRR the displaced HHs still have insufficient income due to several reasons (droughts lead to the reduction of water for an all-purpose, prolonged conflict in the past, COVID-19, and lack of employment) and impacts on the availability of drinking water. The people especially the poor in the rural HHs are expected to be unable to prepare water for their consumption. The combination of past conflict, drought amp Covid-19, has led to over 35% of the population settle in urban areas. As mentioned by most people they can return after rehabilitation of the infrastructures particularly WASH which is the first need. 
Because of the new administrative change in the Government, it has decided to work through the Shura members those who allowed by the new administration. The previous CDC will not work as normally as before for the time being due to recent changes. In addition, the project team consults the activities with the NGO commission of the new administration. Though, some of the issues are sensitive but the project team will try to advocate for them, e.g. GBV, access to wells for women.</narrative>
