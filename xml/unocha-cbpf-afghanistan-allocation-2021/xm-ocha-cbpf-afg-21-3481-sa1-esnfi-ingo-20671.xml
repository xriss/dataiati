   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Addressing the urgent humanitarian life-saving Winterization Needs of the Crises affected people</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project is designed to support the urgent Humanitarian Needs of IDPs, Returnees and Vulnerable Host Communities affected by conflicts and natural disasters in the target districts (Gurziwan and Bilchiragh) of Faryab Province. According to averaged Household Emergency Assessment Tool (HEAT) assessments in 2020, 64% of immediately shock-affected households reported living in makeshift shelters (including both mud houses and tents). In line with ES/NFI Cluster priorities as detailed in the Allocation Strategy paper, DAARTT under this action will respond to the needs identified under the AHF 1st Standard Allocation Strategy 2021, with the purpose to provide life-saving assistance to IDPs, returnees and vulnerable host communities in the priority provinces Faryab, identified by the ES/NFI Cluster. Under this action, DAARTT will cover the needs of 1,290 families (9,030 individuals) in the two districts (Gurziwan and Bilchiragh) of Faryab Province through provision of (Winterization Assistance &#x2013; Them 2). Under the proposed action, DAARTT will provide $200/families to 1,290 families as Cash for Heating purpose and $105/family for the same 1,290 families for Winter Cloths and Blankets - targeting the most vulnerable people (IDPs, Returnees and Vulnerable Host Communities) in the targeted locations in Faryab Province. 

As the first step of the project implementation, DAARTT will conduct a rapid need assessment in the targeted communities to identify the most vulnerable people. Need Assessment will be conducted through Kobo system and report will be generated automatically. In the same time, a beneficiary selection and distribution committee will be established which will include representatives from local communities (e.g. CDC heads), Government departments (e.g. ANDMA, ARCS and DoRR) and DAARTT staff. Beneficiaries will be selected according to ESNFI vulnerability criteria to ensure the poorest and most vulnerable are targeted, including displaced people, women-headed households, widows, orphaned families, elderly, people with a disability and families with a large number of dependent children. On the top of this, pregnant and lactating women will also be give high priority during the selection. According to nutrition cluster, 32% (520 PLWs) of the beneficiaries will be selected as the PLW, who are identified under the Acute Malnutrition Category. This target will be included in the over target for women beneficiaries. The cash for heating will enable selected HHs to keep and maintain the normal temperature of their houses during the harsh winter season. Cash is used as markets are functional and heating equipment and materials are locally available. Prioritization is based on vulnerability and need for assistance. As there is a large percentage of HH with vulnerable groups/ PSN, DAARTT will ensure inclusion of these groups in the assistance through an inclusive approach securing their meaningful participation. As per DAARTT standards, gender, protection and COVID-19 are mainstreamed in the program design.

DAARTT conducted a rapid need assessment in the two targeted districts, namely Bilchiragh and Gurziwan of the Faryab Province. In total, 29 villages were surveyed to identify the most urgent needs of the population. As per the findings from the report, 60% of the IDP families are residing in the centers of the two districts, who urgently need humanitarian assistance particular Winterization assistance. The assessment also revealed that 30071 persons are vulnerable, who need assistance. 4150 (2045 Males and 2105 Females) were unaccompanied children that composed 13% of vulnerable population in the targeted areas. Out of 30071vulnerable people 548 (1.8%) were infants, without mother. Majority of vulnerable groups related to older persons 5787 (19%).</narrative>
