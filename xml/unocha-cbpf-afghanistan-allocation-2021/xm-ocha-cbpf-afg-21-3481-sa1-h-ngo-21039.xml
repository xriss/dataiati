  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In November 2021, HADAAF conducted assessment in Zabul and Bulkh provinces, to elaborate current health services provision/ Gaps and priority emergency health needs of the underserved population. (Assessment results attached). Based on available data and physical assessment, it was found that health system is collapsed after the event of August 15, 2021 with no partial service provision. During the last 4 months&#x2019; international communities/donors tried hard to revitalize the health infrastructure, but with short term commitment the partially opened HFs are not responsive to the needs of population. 
Coverage areas for the intervention of proposed project were selected in coordination with provincial stakeholders (PPHD, BPHS implementers and communities).  
Proposed project is designed to provide services to the remote and inaccessible population in Zabul and Bulkh through establishment of 8 MHTs in Zabul and 5 MHTs in Bulkh province. In coordination with Regional Health Cluster, PPHD, BPHS implementer and other partners,  HADAAF selected, 7 districts in Zabul and 3 Districts in Bulkh for the intervention:
A- Zabul Province: 
1) Dai Choopan with 6,776 targeted population, 1 MHT is planned in Shoyee and its neighboring villages.
2) Shamal zai with 6,370 targeted population , 1 MHT in Qalai Rasheed and its neighboring villages.
3) Shajoy , with 4,683 targets, 1MHT is planned in Zargaran and its neighboring villages. 
4) Shinkey, with 4,760 targets, 1 MHT planned in Lawara and its neighboring villages.
5) Khaki Afghan, with 5,712 Targets, 1 MHT in Hawari and its neighboring villages.
6) Qalat with 7147 IDPs, 1 MHT is planned
7) Arghandab with 9,597 targets, 2 MHT are planned 
As per Regional HC recommendation, there is strong needs to support current emergency services through Shajoy DH through capacity building, staffing and transportation of critical patients.
B- Bulkh Province:
1) Nahri Shahi District: the project will cover 19000 underserved population through 3 MHTs 
2) Charkint District: the project will target 7000 populations through 1 MHT.
3) Kaldar District: 8736 underserved populations will be covered by 1 MHT.

The country is also facing a protection crisis where people&#x2019;s rights to safety, security amp well-being are threatened due to political changes and collapse of infrastructure, the protection components are integrated to address protection issues. To ensure provision of full package of PHC services, all MHTs will be staffed based on standard staffing status for MHT with extra deployment of psychosocial counselor for counseling mental health issues and GBV victims. IPampC officer is proposed to ensure prevention measures including Covid-19 and RCCE promotion. Based on above explanation the project interventions are in the line with Health cluster SO1 and 2.
The project will be fully functional providing services to the population after 1 month inception period, managed through provincial offices in Zabul and Bulkh provinces and supported by HADAAF&#x2019;s HQ in Kabul. During inception period, all preparatory measures (coordination, recruitment, setup, procurement, training) will be completed.
Following interventions are planned in project design based on cluster priorities:
1) Provision of emergency Primary Health Care, Mental Health/ PSS services amp RCCE in all MHTs. 
2) Training/orientation of health Shura amp community leaders on RCCE and community outreach
3) Infection control and prevention at MHTs level and promotion of hygiene at community level and Provision of PPEs, Chlorine amp Spraying Pumps to MHTs staff to disinfect amp prevent infection. The project interventions are in line with the HC priority&#x2019;s Strategic objective 1 and 2. 
Project activities will be closely supervised and monitored using standard monitoring tools and different feasible methodology. The MHTs will be registered in National HIS data</narrative>
