   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Responding to emergency livestock and agricultural needs in Badakhshan province</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The population already affected by the conflict between the former government of Afghanistan and the IEA, is now facing the devastating effects of the drought that was proclaimed in June 2021. As the country slowly recovered from the severe drought in 2018 and lingering effects that remained, which were aggravated by the COVID-19 pandemic and the conflict, this second drought in four years is expected to have a significant impact across a large part of the country, on both rain-fed and irrigated agricultural crop production, especially cereal production during the main growing and cultivation season (May to September), and on pasture conditions and livestock health. In addition, the effects of the drought are depleting many already poor and vulnerable households&#x2019; financial and asset reserves as they struggle and resort to extremely negative coping strategies, with the poorest and most vulnerable households incurring catastrophic levels of debt.

As Badakhshan is a province that relies heavily on rainfed agriculture, its population is particularly vulnerable to drought and more likely to be food insecure. Badakshan is one of the provinces with the highest percentage of population in IPC 3 and 4. For the period November 2021-March 2022, the percentage of the population in IPC 3 and 4 in Badakhshan is expected to be 10% higher than for September-October 2021 (from 55% to 65%). 

Due to its long-standing presence in Badakhshan, ACTED benefits from a good acceptance in the communities and an experienced team that has been involved in the implementation of many projects, including food security and agriculture interventions. Through this project, ACTED is going to provide crucial livestock and food security assistance through the distribution of livestock packages (made of animal fodder and dewormer) and home gardening inputs. The assistance will target 2,857 vulnerable livestock owner HHs (20,000 individuals) in 3 districts of Badakhshan (1,500 HHs in Kishem, 700 HHs in Tagab and 657 HHs in Shohada districts). ACTED will conduct trainings for all the beneficiaries on livestock health and home gardening techniques. This intervention will enable families to meet their needs in terms of livelihood and food security, giving them a crucial support to mitigate the effect of the drought and economic shock.</narrative>
