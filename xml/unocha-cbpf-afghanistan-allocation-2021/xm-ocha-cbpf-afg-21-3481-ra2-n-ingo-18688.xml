Currently, HNI-TPO is the BPHS/EPHS implementer in Kunar and Laghman provinces, and implements EPHS in Nangarhar. HNI-TPO has been implementing other humanitarian and vertical projects in Kunar and many other provinces of Afghanistan. 
The potential dry-spell and floods in spring and summer months put some districts of the province in a dire need for emergency nutrition services to prevent morbidity and mortality in children and women.

Kunar province population is scatter and distributed in valleys with harsh geographic location, transportation problems, and road block due to flood and land slide which caused to limit access to the available health facilities. Most of the health facilities in Kunar (31 out of 62) are health sub centers (Now called preliminary health center or PHC) which do not have nutrition services as per BPHS policy. 
According to the rapid assessment for AHF project, th  following districts will be targeted through 7 Mobile Nutrition Team (NMTs) : Asmar, Dangam, Marawara, Nari, Noorgal and Watapur.
