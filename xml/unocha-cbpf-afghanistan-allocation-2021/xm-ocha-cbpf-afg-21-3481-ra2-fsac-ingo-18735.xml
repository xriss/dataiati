   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Emergency food assistance for acutely vulnerable people in Badakhshan Province facing a crisis or emergency level food insecurity in IPC phase 4 classified communities</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Measures implemented to slow the spread of COVID-19 virus, including lockdowns, border closures, and the suspension of formal and informal livelihood activities, have in turn triggered a sharp contraction in the country&#x2019;s economy&#x2015; crippling household debt, elevating food prices, and exacerbating food insecurity (HNO 2021). Ongoing conflict coupled with COVID-19 high food prices and rampant unemployment resulted in loss or disruption of livelihoods, and is considered a key driver of acute food insecurity for nearly 14.1 million people in Afghanistan-one third of all Afghans are experiencing high levels of acute food insecurity (IPC analysis, May 2021). In parallel, the low winter rainfall and high temperature coupled with La Nina weather phenomenon have reduced water access during the spring and summer agricultural seasons with a likely impact on below average wheat production (IPC analysis, May amp HNO 2021). According to the strategic situation report of OCHA published on February 2021, Afghanistan now has the second highest number of people in crisis or emergency food insecurity (Integrated Food Security Phase Classification - IPC 3+) in the world. In response to this effect, Afghanistan Inter-Cluster Coordination Team has developed a Spring Disaster Contingency Plan (2021) that outlined the potential risks, priority provinces and interventions to address the seasonal risks. While food needs are widespread across Afghanistan, Badakhshan is one of the four provinces which are classified in IPC 4 of with the second highest numbers of people (316,226) classified under phase 4 of emergency food insecurity (IPC analysis, May amp HNO 2021) and among the first prioritized province in the ICCT Spring Disaster Contingency Plan 2021. 

In response to an anticipated high rate of asset depletion associated to cover food consumption gaps, Concern Worldwide is proposing emergency food assistance for seasonally affected 2,630 host  populations falling under IPC Phase 4, whom are facing the prolonged consequences of multiple shocks including protracted conflict, drought and the Coronavirus pandemic. Guided by newly conducted market assessments, Concern will respond to emergency food needs in Badakhshan Province via in-kind assistance to ensure the most effective and appropriate modality per target area. Given the high number of vulnerable households coupled by limited humanitarian resources, beneficiary selection will be based on a FSAC vulnerability criteria that prioritizes households headed by women, the elderly, and children the chronically ill people with disabilities (PwD) and pregnant and lactating women (PLW). Hence, Concern will provide half food basket of in-kind for four months for 2630 HHs to provide emergency life-saving food assistance to people in Yaftal-e-Sufla, Yawan and Shahr-e-Buzurg district classified in IPC Phase 4 areas. The in-kind modality has been identified based on the rapid market and assistance modality assessment that indicated more limitations of market access for female, people with disability and elderly headed households. In addition, the cost of minimum food basket has indicated 17 percent increase than the last four-year average cost (Famine Early Warning System Network, February 2021) which puts a risk of increased price compared to procuring in bulk. Hence, Concern will ensure the accessibility of and availability of food to acutely vulnerable families in the three target districts. During the implementation, Concern will coordinate with WFP and MRRD to reach to the underserved communities of the targeted districts. With over two decades of operational presence in the Northeast Region, Concern is incredibly well positioned to provide trusted, rapid humanitarian assistance that will address immediate food needs in efforts to save lives, improve people&#x2019;s wellbeing, and reduce the use of negative coping mechanisms.</narrative>
