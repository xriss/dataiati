   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Considering the strategic objectives of the Afghanistan Humanitarian Fund (AHF), particularly those set under the 2021 AHF 1st standard allocation, IMC proposes emergency lifesaving WASH services for areas with the highest needs in Balkh and Laghman provinces. This package of WASH services will target conflict-induced IDP (Internally Displaced People) and drought-affected communities in four hard-to-reach districts, namely Chemtal, Dawlat Abad and Nar-e-Shahi districts in Balkh province and Mehterlam district in Laghman province. This package of services is designed based on IMC&#x2019;s coordination with PRRD and site visit findings conducted in these districts during November 2021 in collaboration with WASH Cluster members, local partners including DACAAR, NRC, ACTED, PU AMI, etc, authorities, and community members. The project aims to provide WASH services to a total of 18,550 individuals, including 5,750 women, 5,380 men, 3,525 boys, 3,895 girls from diverse social groups. 

The services under this package will provide safe drinking water, improve water quantity and quality in the target districts, establish water management committees and train their members, and promote safe hygiene practices. These services will help individuals and families to access, utilize and manage water in their communities and practice proper hygiene who have otherwise been forced to choose negative coping strategies such as drinking water from unprotected sources and adopting unsafe hygiene behaviors. This project will last 10 months, based on IMC experience in related field, the targeted activities require the cited timeframe to have quality work, smoothly and coordinated with all relevant departments with due consideration of seasonal risk. The project required time for recruitment process of staff, technical assessment, and design, furthermore, according to procurement policy to find qualified vender, the design water supply systems will be advertised through ACBAR website in addition, time is required for IMC HQ review and approval. As winter is arrived, the construction work may delay in the targeted locations especially in Balkh province where witness of heavy rainfalls and temperature drops up-to frost during winter season, therefore, technical recommendation related construction work does not permit to work under these circumstances. In addition, some other issues i.e. deployment of materials, unstable condition in the country will affect the project timeframe. According to cited reasons, IMC consider having 10 months&#x2019; timeframe for the implementation of the project and requires around a $743,990.73 budget. Below, a summary of the specific activities to be carried out under this project is provided.

 Construction of 7 solar-powered pipe schemes (1 in Chemtal, 3 in Dawlat Abad, 1 in Nahe-e-Shahi, and 2 Mehterlam)
 Provision of 2,650 water kits for collection and safe storage of water and distribution of water treatment chemicals to the communities (at household level)
 Establish and train 7 water management committees to give the communities a sense of ownership and responsibility for project activities and maintain good communication among all stakeholders.
 Training of community members as mechanics for regular maintenance of pipe schemes and other WASH infrastructure after the project ends
 Conducting 3 rounds of hygiene awareness sessions and conduct sanitation campaign 
 Conduct baseline and end line KAP survey
The intervention will take specific care to implement the program per the Sphere standard, ensuring safe access for vulnerable groups, such as women and girls, to the services.</narrative>
