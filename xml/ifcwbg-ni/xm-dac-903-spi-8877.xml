   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Summary Of Project Information (SPI)       Project Name    Nicaragua: La Colonia              Region    Latin American and Caribbean        Sector       Project No008877   Projected Board DateJune 5, 1998   Company NameCasa M&#xE1;ntica S.A. and Inmuebles Diano Marina S.A.   Technical Partner and/or Major Shareholders    	The M&#xE1;ntica family privately owns both Casa M&#xE1;ntica S.A. and Inmuebles Diano Marina S.A..    	   Project Cost Including proposed IFC investment    	The total project cost is estimated at about US$9.9 million.  IFCs proposed investment is expected to be in the form of up to US$4 million in an A Loan and a Subordinated C loan of up to US$0.5 million.    Location of project and Description of site    	The project will be located in Managua.    	    Description of Company and Purpose of Project    	La Colonia is Nicaraguas largest retail supermarket chain, with 5 stores located in Managua. La Colonia&apos;&apos;s four-year Project will involve the following components:(i) opening 3 new La Colonia supermarkets in Managua; (ii) remodeling and modernizing three existing stores, (iii) introducing an integrated electronic point of sale system (EPOS), and (iv) upgrading management information systems. The Company expects to benefit from higher margins (as a result of improved efficiencies and economies of scale), to streamline and run more technologically-efficient operations, and improve its competitive position, while at the same time preempting local and foreign competitors wishing to enter the market. IFCs financing provides La Colonia with long-term funding which would otherwise be limited and expensive through other sources for companies in Nicaragua. In addition, IFC could serve as a catalyst to encourage greater foreign investment in the Company.  IFCs participation would also improve the Companys corporate governance through improved reporting and better management practices, while acting as an agent of change in its expansion plans. La Colonia&apos;&apos;s Project is expected to have the following developmental impacts: (i) the Companys expansion plans would assist in distributing to the Managuan population groups a wider variety of food and other basic necessity items (at lower or competitive prices) under cleaner and more hygienic conditions. The Project would introduce best practice and modern retailing methods, and bring about technological improvements in logistics and distribution systems; and (ii) the Project will create about 250 jobs, primarily for women, contributing to reducing the high level of unemployment and underemployment in the country. In addition, the Project would also provide uncommon employee-benefit packages and higher than average compensation rates.  The expansion plans would also foster better academical standards and training, and create career opportunities for the Companys employees and management, thereby improving the standards of living in the region in which it will operate.     	    Environmental Category and Issues    	This is an environmental review category B project.  Potential issues which were reviewed for this project included land use and site location, liquid effluents treatment and discharge, solid waste management, use of non-CFC refrigerants, fire protection, safety and emergency response and general worker health and safety.  The sponsor will implement actions to address these issues and demonstrate that the Project will comply with applicable Nicaraguan requirements and World Bank guidelines.  Liquid effluents are properly disposed.  Solid residues will be either recycled or properly disposed according to local regulations.  Non-CFC refrigerants will be used.  The sponsor is reviewing the current safety and emergency response practices and will implement actions satisfactory to IFC.  Employees will be trained in occupational health and industrial safety practices.      	   The  is  May 5, 1998 from the Public Information Center.
