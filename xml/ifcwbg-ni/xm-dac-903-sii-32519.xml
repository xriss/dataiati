   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Condor Gold Plc. (Condor Gold or the Company) is a junior mineral exploration company registered in England and Wales on October 10th 2005 and listed on the AIM Market of the London Stock Exchange.  The Company is focused on the development of its wholly-owned La India gold project (La India or the Project) located in Nicaragua.  In addition, Condor has other exploration mining projects in Nicaragua and El Salvador.  Condor holds its Nicaraguan concessions through two wholly owned subsidiaries incorporated in Nicaragua (Condor S.A. and La India Gold S.A.).  The Company also owns a 20% interest in Cerro Quiroz S.A, a Nicaraguan company controlled by B2Gold that holds the Cerro Quiroz concession.  All exploration and mining licenses in El Salvador are subject to a mining moratorium in the country since 2007.  La India, Condors flagship project, is a gold exploration project comprised of several veins sets that hold a mineral resource estimate (NI 43-101 Canadian standard compliant) of 18.4M tons of ore with an average grade of 3.9 gpt Au and 6.2 gpt Ag for a total of 2.33M ounces of gold and 2.68M ounces of silver contained.  Condor is completing the necessary studies to achieve the pre-feasibility stage by late 2014.  IFCs investment will support the development of La India towards achieving bankable feasibility stage and further exploration activities in the Nicaraguan properties.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">IFC&apos;&apos;s investment will be used to fund the completion on feasibility studies.  Generally, projects at pre-development stage have limited development impact.  Yet even at such stage, Condor Gold has brought tangible benefits for the surrounding communities by providing some direct employment for the local population, as well as investing in social development programs in favor of the neighboring communities living in a very poor rural area in Central Nicaragua.  Out of a total of around 85 people currently working for Condor, more than 95% are Nicaraguan nationals and more than 90% live in nearby communities.  Should exploration lead to mine development and production, the developmental impacts will be notable.  Key expected benefits during mine construction and operation will include revenues to the national government through royalties and taxes, foreign currency from export revenues, significant direct and indirect employment, and enhanced social development programs.</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">La India concessions are located in the Municipality of San Isidro, Department of Matagalpa, and the Municipalities of Santa Rosa del Pe&#xF1;on and El Jicaral, Department of Leon; 70 km north of Managua capital city.  The main access to the Project site from Managua city is via the Panamerican highway, 130 km to the town of Sebaco and then 32 km in a paved road to La India.  The concession package is comprised of seven contiguous concessions, part or which were acquired and some were awarded directly by the Nicaraguan Government between 2006 and 2014.  Condor acquired most of the La India concessions from B2 Gold, a Canadian mining company; and a small concession from Empresa Minera La Mestiza S.A., a Nicaraguan private company, in 2010 and 2012, respectively.</narrative>
