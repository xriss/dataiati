   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This award strives to conserve biodiversity and manage natural resources in ways that maintain their long-term viability and preserve their potential to meet the needs of present and future generations. Activities include combating illegal and corrupt exploitation of natural resources and the control of invasive species. This includes The purpose of this project is to continue with the scarlet macaw (SM) reintroduction and conservation efforts in Los Tuxtlas Biosphere Reserve, Veracruz. The main objective is to continue with the establishment a new population of SM and to use this species as an ambassador for native species recovery, habitat restoration, and human wellbeing. This project aims at reducing the threats of habitat loss and poaching for the illegal trade affecting the SM and other native species. Project activities include: (1) release into the wild another group of SMs; (2) continue monitoring and supporting all SMs released during Phase I of the project (100 individuals); (3) successfully reintroduce the native red-eyed tree frog to Reserva Ecol&#xF3;gica Nanciyaga; (4) create sustainable livelihoods alternatives for the local communities to the establishment of small scale meliponine (stingless bees) beekeeping enterprises ; (5) improve SM habitat quality and connectivity by continuing to carry out reforestation efforts with native tree species; and (6) establish a pilot agouti (Dasyprocta mexicana) farm as an alternative protein and economic alternative to cattle and to reduce the pressure out of the dwindling wild population of agoutis in the area. The goal of this project is to conserve 686,767 acres of coral reefs in six Natural Protected Areas (NPAs) of the Mexican Pacific. The objective is to improve the management of coral reefs to reduce threats from uncontrolled touristic activities. The following activities will enhance and further develop coral reef conservation initiatives in the Mexican Pacific and include: (1) trainings and logistic support for park rangers in the Huatulco National Park (HNP) to install an effective conservation mooring buoy system; (2) trainings for CONANP staff working in six NPAs to implement coral reef monitoring, as well as data management and analysis, (3) a series of participatory workshops with local tourism operators and community watch groups to promote the proper use of the buoy system and tourism best practices in HNP, (4) organize an exchange of experiences between tourism providers in the HNP and the Cabo Pulmo National Park (CPNP) to foster and strengthen coral reef observation best practices, and (5) increase the awareness of 2,500 visitors to the HNP and the PNCP through informal lectures, workshops, graphic materials and outreach activities to promote coral reef conservation. The purpose of this project is to strengthen local authorities operational and coordination capabilities working in Bay of Loreto National Park (National Park), thereby minimizing the impact of illegal fishing and harmful tourism and recreational activities threatening the long-term conservation of the National Park marine mammals and critical habitats. Priority conservation targets include sea cucumber (Isostichopus fuscus), rock scallop (Spondylus calcifer), chocolate clam (Megapitaria squalida), as well as other species at risk including cetaceans, especially blue and fin whale (Balaenoptera musculus and B. physalus, respectively). Specific activities include: (1) validating protocols among institutions to successfully establish the chain of custody; (2) conducting joint land/sea patrolling and monitoring operations among SEMAR, PROFEPA, CONAPESCA, Environmental Police and CONANP that increase the effectiveness in detaining illegal fishermen and reducing illegal trade of fauna; (3) creating and implementing a field patrolling and monitoring work plan among government agencies to strengthen patrolling and monitoring actions; (4) train and establish community patrolling and monitoring committees to increase their sense of ownership and empowerment for the protection of the natural resources they and their families depend on; and (5) holding a series of workshops and meetings and distributing informational materials to increase the awareness of fishermen, tourism operators and visitors regarding the regulations under the Nati.

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">In FY 2017, the United States will partner with Mexico to consolidate and institutionalize progress made as a result of ongoing bilateral cooperation, particularly through the Merida Initiative. By weakening transnational criminal organizations (TCOs), reforming the institutions that sustain the rule of law, protecting human rights, creating a 21st century border, and building stronger and more resilient communities, the United States and Mexico will ensure greater prosperity and inclusive economic growth on both sides of the border. To support the President&apos;s Global Climate Change (GCC) Initiative, a strong partnership with the Government of Mexico and other stakeholders will promote clean energy adoption, energy efficiency, low carbon development, and sustainable land use and forest management to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Mexico is a global non-proliferation partner and related assistance will focus on enhancing Mexico&apos;s capabilities and commitment. Mexico continues to be a strong partner of the initiatives that complement the United States&apos; programs to address the root causes of unlawful migration from Central America.</narrative>
