   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This award strives to conserve biodiversity and manage natural resources in ways that maintain their long-term viability and preserve their potential to meet the needs of present and future generations. Activities include combating illegal and corrupt exploitation of natural resources and the control of invasive species. This includes In partnership with the National Council for Protected Areas of the Government of Mexico (CONANP), the National Institute of Ecology of the Government of Mexico (INE), and the Mexican Fund for the Conservation of Nature (FMCN). The goal of this project is to conserve important protected areas in Mexico, critical to conserving biodiversity, by strengthening CONANP capacity to manage these areas. CONANP is the Mexican Government agency in charge of managing protected areas in the country, and has identified lack of training as a major obstacle in the effective management of areas under its jurisdiction. The objective is to implement a training program for CONANP personnel directly responsible for protecting these areas. The purpose of this grant is to train 100 CONANP field operations employees (reserve wardens) stationed at key nature reserves in Mexico. The curriculum, developed by CONANP regional and field personnel, includes topics selected after a very thorough, comprehensive assessment of training needs of the target group conducted by the Government of Mexico, including input from various CONANP divisions, INE, and USFWS staff. In order to reach a wider audience, the course includes an on-line component, but retains a strong field orientation. This is an unprecedented government-led effort by Mexico to officially institutionalize and standardize training specifically designed to address the needs of reserve wardens in Mexico. Products include: (1) Development of the curricula for a training course for reserve wardens in Mexico, with on-line and field components, and topics addressing social issues; (2) implementation of a training course , with at least one hundred (100) reserve wardens trained; (3) Production of training material. Pending availability of funds in FY13, and satisfactory performance, the Service anticipates supplying additional funding for an evaluation of the training course. This will be a Cooperative Agreement Award (per 505-DM2-2.9), as substantial U.S. Federal involvement is expected. The Service (through the FWS/DIC/Project Officer) will review and approve proposed modifications or sub-grants, prior to award, and direct or re-direct the work because of interrelationships with other projects..</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">In FY 2017, the United States will partner with Mexico to consolidate and institutionalize progress made as a result of ongoing bilateral cooperation, particularly through the Merida Initiative. By weakening transnational criminal organizations (TCOs), reforming the institutions that sustain the rule of law, protecting human rights, creating a 21st century border, and building stronger and more resilient communities, the United States and Mexico will ensure greater prosperity and inclusive economic growth on both sides of the border. To support the President&apos;s Global Climate Change (GCC) Initiative, a strong partnership with the Government of Mexico and other stakeholders will promote clean energy adoption, energy efficiency, low carbon development, and sustainable land use and forest management to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Mexico is a global non-proliferation partner and related assistance will focus on enhancing Mexico&apos;s capabilities and commitment. Mexico continues to be a strong partner of the initiatives that complement the United States&apos; programs to address the root causes of unlawful migration from Central America.</narrative>
