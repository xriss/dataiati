    <narrative xml:lang="EN">General question: Results related to the intended outcome 2016Question: Summarise results related to the intended outcome (this information will be sent to Open Aid)Answer: In such a harsh context 2016 has been a very positive year for the program in terms of reaching out and strengthening the discourse and action. Tools for engendering the constitution were developed, spaces for exchange of experiences were provided, support to partners was enhanced, and the thematic knowledge and technical skills notably improved. Capacity building to partners was extensive especially on the organizational and programmatic levels.

Regional and international spaces to develop the discourse around the process on engendering the constitution, and to promote the Syrian activists&#x2019; demands to the highest levels were ensured. Several events have been conducted reaching out to international institutions and decision makers: UN, UN Women, UN office of special envoy for Syria, UNOCHA, US Department of State, EC, EP and EEAS, EU delegation to Syria and other MENA and European countries, European embassies as well as ESCWA, other Syrian organizations, relevant international NGOs and diverse stakeholders. International conferences, training workshops, exchange trips, roundtables and meetings amplified the voice of Syrian activists. These events supported Syrian actors in developing their discourse, breaking their isolation (especially activists coming from inside Syria), sharing different experiences and voicing their analysis and demands. 

2016 was the peak in the program&#x2019;s lifespan regarding visibility and influence: 12 international and high-level actions were organised by EFI and by the partners. While EFI took care of organising exchange and lobby trip, our role in the partnership was focused more on providing actively technical support to partners, ownership and their visibility. The number of successful events demonstrates that partners have become much stronger and established in what they do, structurally growing their experience over the past years. The events listed below were held on regional and international levels with distinctive audiences, rich discussions and strong resulting outcomes that were widely disseminated and used. These events favored sharing experiences, practices, and lessons learned and developed a strong international and regional support and solidarity for Syrian activists. Meanwhile the process of engendering the constitution reached a wider Syrian audience, contributing to breaking the isolation of Syrian activists coming from inside Syria. EFI provided also a successful facilitation and coordination with the international community.

During 2016, Euromed Feminist Initiative has been able to reach to 66 Syrian CSOs inside and outside Syria, with around 680 Syrian WR &amp; HR civil activists, political activists, academics, lawyers, and legal experts from Damascus, Damascus suburbs, Tartous, Lattakia, Homs, Sweida, Salamieh, Idlib, Jaramana, Shahba, Aleppo and the Kurdish region, as well as Syrian activists expatriated in Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan, and other countries in Europe, the Arab Gulf and the US.

The partners have been able to directly reach around 700 Syrian activists inside and outside Syria. This makes the total Syrian activists who have been directly approached by EFI and the Syrian partners around 1100. Through social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter around 10 000 activists have been reached.</narrative>
