   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The thematic focus areas of this intervention, involving young men and women, boys
and girls in democratic processes in all governorates in Syria, are crucial elements for
establishing a democratic and open society where non-discrimination, participation,
transparency, and accountability are guiding principles.
The impact this intervention is seeking to address is to integrate participation,
transparency, and accountability, in the set up of identifying issues to improve with and
by the local community. These issues are addressed by the members aiming to change
attitudes of communities leading to a more peaceful existence and democratic principles.
This may sounds far fetched in the current context but it has been possible to work on
small scale initiatives that generates a positive outcome engaging young people. FADA II
will continue to open windows of participation for the youth in Syria, giving options toparticipate in local development when possible rather than fleeing the country or joining
the army. The long term aim is to provide youth a role of active positive participation in
building their country after more than five years of conflict; it will deliver the message
that things could be done in the country if youth stay instead of imposing themselves to
danger of illegal migration.
The ongoing programme has a mix of beneficiaries from a diverse spectrum of ethnic
and religious communities in Syria. The size and location of the communities in which
DPNA and Mobaderoon work vary considerably and include communities with a diverse
population. The aim is to include young men and women, girls and boys based on their
engagement for their communities and Syria irrespective of political lines, gender,
ethnicity and religion. The programme is about fighting discrimination via methods of
inclusiveness.</narrative>
