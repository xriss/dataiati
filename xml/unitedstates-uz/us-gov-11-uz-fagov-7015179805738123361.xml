    <narrative xml:lang="EN">Uzbekistan, the most populous country in Central Asia, is key to stability and economic integration in the region. The only country to share borders with all four Central Asia countries and Afghanistan, Uzbekistan&apos;s efforts are essential to impeding the movement of violent extremists and combating narcotics trafficking and transit of illicit goods. U.S.~assistance seeks to foster durable political, economic, and social stability for Uzbekistan and for the region, while promoting rule of law and respect for human rights. The United~States will work with the Government of Uzbekistan (GOU) to increase support for religious tolerance, people-centered development, and transparency and accountability in governance. U.S.~programs will support implementation of rule-of-law reforms and efforts to increase the independence of the judiciary, as well as the provision of direct assistance to civil society organizations. Programs will also work to improve the operating environment for non-governmental organizations (NGOs). U.S.~assistance will promote the New Silk Road Initiative by supporting and developing regional trade and export linkages, strengthening the private sector, including both small and medium-sized enterprises, and will increase agricultural productivity in select value chains from production to post-harvest and export. U.S.~assistance will continue to support agriculture sector reforms and to help seek avenues for expanded trade between companies in Uzbekistan, Central Asia, the wider region, and the United~States. U.S.~assistance will focus on improving the prevention and control of transboundary infectious diseases through interventions to strengthen the diagnosis and management of tuberculosis (TB) and multi-drug-resistant (MDR) TB. U.S. assistance will build resilience and reduce vulnerability to Russian aggression, increase European integration, and provide continued support for enduring programs.</narrative>
