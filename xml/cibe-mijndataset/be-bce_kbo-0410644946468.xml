  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Our world is being shaken by the proliferation of armed and social conflicts, complex humanitarian crises, widening inequality, violations of human rights, poor governance, environmental degradation, and poor management of natural resources.&#xA0; The consequence is the decline in progress on the poverty front and the constantly evolving migratory movements in which too many people risk their lives.&#xA0;More than ever, our efforts must focus on peace, openness, equity, equality, and proper governance, including the rule of law, democracy, accountability, human rights, and non- discrimination. This program will work to raise awareness of the close interdependence between issues of poverty, social problems, economic transformations, migratory movements, climate change, and environmental issues.

Two ways are considered to contribute to these changes. The first aims to improve food and nutritional security in six countries suffering from extreme poverty - countries where we have been present in recent years and where we have built a network of partners. The second aims at raising awareness and training of the populations living in Belgium on the links between migration and development and the interdependence between our modes of life (consumer choice) and the contexts of poor economic, political, and environmental governance. Beyond this, it is for us to facilitate and enable a commitment and a concrete mobilization of our publics, whether politicians, educational actors, migrants, journalists or citizens, with a view to Responsible, active, critical and supportive citizenship.

The very core of our action to achieve these objectives is citizen empowerment: students, teachers, journalists, politicians, farmers&apos; organizations, local partners, and households. Our role is to be facilitators of change; our experience shows that if the real actors - our publics and our partners in our countries of intervention - are strengthened and accompanied in their self-development process, they will be in a position to (re) take charge of their own life, in the respect of all.&#xA0;They will be reinforced through the three pillars of our approach: access to knowledge, accompaniment in awareness, and action. This notion of empowerment will lead to better living conditions and a change in certain behaviors and attitudes.</narrative>
