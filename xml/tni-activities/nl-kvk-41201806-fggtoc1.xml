  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">TNI will work with affected communities and strategic partners in Africa, Asia and Latin America and strategic solidarity partners in Europe and US towards policy changes that lay the ground for binding legislation and UN Treaty on TNCs and other business enterprises. TNI will work on capacity building of affected communities impacted by corporate violations of human rights and environmental standards, dispossession and loss of livelihoods, and forced internal and outmigration. Activities include popular effective documentation systems, case building, networking towards solidarity and alliances with media, academe and other opinion makers. TNI will develop joint strategies with affected communities towards the development and implementation of advocacy with governments, giving visibility and voice to self-representation of communities at country level, in their relevant regional bodies and at the UN in Geneva on the need for a Binding UN Treaty on TNCs and other business enterprises. TNI will also reach out to Parliamentarians in reclaiming parliamentary accountability towards citizens in terms of raising the issues and addressing the erosion of human rights protection legislation impacting affected communities and advocating in the Parliamentary arenas for the UN Binding Treaty on TNCs and other business enterprises. TNI will facilitate public awareness raising with Popular Tribunals, Public Forums, Community Assemblies, Fact Finding Missions debating the issues and engaging governments and experts, and effective use of social media and community radio, projecting both the impacts of corporate violations and the proposals and practices towards alternatives in the juridical/legal, economic and political fields. Last, TNI will work on generating new knowledge through targeted publications and videos and mobilisations that converge various sectors (indigenous peoples, farmers, workers including migrant workers, women, experts in human rights and international and corporate law and multi-disciplinary practioners/ skill sharing) and demonstrate the protagonism of affected communities and social movements and cross-fertilises experiences and practices of alternatives (e.g food sovereignty, citizen-led natural resource basic services; citizen strategies reclaiming participatory democracy).</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">1. With TNI&apos;s technical and facilitating support, the framework proposed for the Binding Treaty in 2017 will be a basis for the Global Campaign on Corporate Impunity to engage in the Open-ended intergovernmental working group of the UNHRC on the Zero Draft for a UN Binding Treaty on TNCs and other business enterprises with respect to human rights. This framework incorporates proposals that address the architecture of impunity of International Financial Institutions, Free Trade and Investment Agreements, and makes regulatory proposals for corporate operations. The proposal will be promoted and articulated with specific application to sectoral supply chains, indigenous peoples, women, and rights of affected communities. 2&amp;3. As an alternative to corporate capture of democratic institutions, new proposals on democracy procedures in Latin America and Southern Africa as well as alternative management of public assets will be discussed and elaborated by partners, in collaboration with TNI, based on concrete struggles at the local level in these countries. 3. The process towards a Peoples Centre on Corporate Impunity will be strengthened at the inter-regional level through research, training, field work undertaken by TNI in collaboration with partners in Southern Africa, Asia and Latin America.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">(1) The UN Binding Treaty on Transnational Corporations and Human Rights is an alternative UN instrument being advocated by TNI and the more than 238 members of the Global Campaign which TNI facilitates. The proposal includes specific articles on sustainable and equitable development as well as measures to ensure access to justice for communities affected by the impunity of corporations whose operations violate their human rights. In 2019, TNI, jointly with the Global Campaign, welcomed a first draft treaty text (presented at the UNHRC by the Open Ended Inter Governmental Working Group (OEIGWG)). While the text is not ideal, the first draft shows negotiations are moving forward. TNI and the global campaign reviewed the draft and indicated where it needed stronger measures on the regulation of TNCs. (2) TNI has been jointly developing with partners the framework concept for the Peoples&#x2019; Centre on Corporate Impunity &#x2013; a virtual observatory with several chapters focusing on the impunity of TNCs. In October 2019, those involved, including affected communities and CSOs from Palestine, Philippines, El Salvador, India, Armenia, and Guatemala, met to further develop the proposal. (3) Strengthening People&#x2019;s Sovereignty &#x2013; TNI, together with partners in LLMICs (Guatemala, El Salvador, Indonesia, Philippines, Nigeria Gambia, Zimbabwe, Nigeria, Tanzania, Kenya, Ghana, Zambia, Honduras, Cambodia, India, Nepal), has been developing initiatives and models that strengthen people&#x2019;s sovereignty and democracy from below. This includes on issues such as the environment, gender, new models of culture for the public good. It has also included the protection of democracy from privatisation. In 2019, TNI launched a virtual &#x2018;People&#x2019;s Sovereignty Lab&#x2019; to enable the promotion and discussion of these initiatives. TNI also began work on preventing the privatisation of democratic institutions including in relation to the UN, at a workshop in 2019, from which a small group was established to further develop this work.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">1 The Proposal for a UN Binding Treaty on Transnational Corporations and Human Rights is an alternative UN instrument being advocated by TNI and the more than 200 members of the Global Campaign which TNI facilitates. The proposal includes specific articles on sustainable and equitable development as well as measures to ensure access to justice for communities affected by the impunity of corporations whose operations violate their human rights. In 2018, TNI jointly with the Global Campaign welcomed the Zero Draft (presented at the UNHRC by the Open Ended Inter Governmental Working Group (OEIGWG)) as a significant step towards the achievement of an alternative instrument on corporate accountability but made its critique, indicated where the Zero Draft needed stronger measures on the regulation of TNCs. The process will now continue towards the development and negotiation of a First Draft Treaty text to be presented in October 2019. 2 TNI has been jointly developing with partners the framework concept for the Peoples&#x2019; Centre on Corporate Impunity &#x2013; involving discussion on how to develop the centre, criteria for building the support for participation in this by organisations and observatories from countries of the Global South and from the European Network of Corporate Observatories (ENCO) researching and analysing case studies on transnational corporations in LLMICs. 3 The Right to Say NO is an alternative to mining: the campaign asserts the right of affected communities to say no to mining based on the principle of Free Prior &amp; Informed Consent (FPIC), which was submitted to and upheld in a South Africa High Court decision in November 2018. The Right to Say NO framework was developed and is led by TNI&#x2019;s partners in Southern Africa. The principle is already being used by movements in South Africa and the Democratic Republic of Congo to fight dam expansion. TNI supported the development of this alternative and the campaign promoting it through strategic and financial support for the campaign, and joint strategizing with its partners in southern Africa to develop their advocacy strategy for democratic participation, and decision making on development in their region.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">1 Proposed Framework for a UN Binding Treaty on TNCs: With TNI&apos;s technical and facilitating support, a global network of CSOs, NGOs and social movements will continue to engage the OEIWG on the draft of the UN Binding Treaty on TNCs and Human Rights, based on their framework for the binding treaty proposed in 2017. In responding to the first and second drafts of the treaty, the network will ensure the treaty text answers the aspirations originally intended for the binding treaty. The framework proposed in 2017 incorporates proposals that address the architecture of impunity of International Financial Institutions, Free Trade Agreements, and Investor State Dispute Settlement and makes regulatory proposals for corporate operations. The proposal will continue to be promoted and articulated with specific application to sectoral supply chains, indigenous peoples, women, and the rights of affected communities. 2 The Peoples Sovereignty Lab: In 2020, TNI will facilitate the launch of the Peoples&#x2019; Sovereignty Lab. The Lab will focus on democracy from below and will count on the participation of a broad range of grassroots organisations, including from LLMICs, and engaged academics. The Lab will provide a global space for developing civil society responses to the deepening role and influence of corporate interests in politics and institutions of democracy while at the same time generating new practices in people&#x2019;s sovereignty. As part of the Lab, a Working Group will be active in proposing alternatives to multistakeholder international governance. 3 The Peoples&#x2019; Centre on Corporate Impunity: in 2020 the centre will become operationalized. This virtual Centre aims to document and publicise key cases of corporate impunity to hold corporations to account. TNI will co-facilitate the establishment of the centre, together with social movements, affected communities and other CSOs and global networks campaigning for a UN Binding Treaty on TNCs and Human Rights, including from LLMICs. The Peoples Centre will provide an inter-active space and tools for social movements and affected communities to address corporate impunity. It will also mobilise a network of academics working on corporate power and link with other networks of organisations monitoring corporate behaviour.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">(1-14) CSOs, social movements and networks from LLMICs advocated for a UN Binding Treaty on Transnational Corporations and Human Rights through oral interventions at Open Ended Inter-Governmental Working Group (OEIGWG) Session at the UNHRC in Geneva, meetings with their national missions, media work and/or public events (see list of organisations below). TNI organised meetings and debriefs before and during the week of action to jointly develop strategy and content, communicated daily briefs on strategy, enabled CSOs access to the UN, facilitated interviews with media, and provided logistical and financial support for some of the CSOs to participate. (15) The ASEAN Regional Taskforce on the Binding Treaty continued to lobby national governments and at the UNHRC in Geneva for a UN Binding Treaty, with TNI&#x2019;s financial, strategic and analysis support. The taskforce includes CSOs and social movements from Cambodia, Indonesia and the Philippines. The Task Force continued to coordinate advocacy for the campaign in the region and its members are lobbying national policy makers in support of the Binding Treaty. (16-20) Five CSOs and networks from the Democratic Republic of Congo, Mozambique, Madagascar, Malawi, Tanzania, Swaziland, Zambia, Zimbabwe, advocated towards their national governments in support of the Binding Treaty. TNI supported these organisations with analysis and strategy through their involvement in the South African Reference Group which TNI also supports financially. (21) With joint strategizing, analysis and content from TNI, a confederation of trade unions in Latin America, who has members in LLMICs, is advocating for the UN binding treaty internationally, including within the international union movement. (22) People affected by oil company Chevron, including peoples from LLMICs, and with TNI&#x2019;s support on communications and strategy, exposed corporate impunity through an organised day of action and a call to action with a sign on 21st May 2019. The Chevron-Texaco case, promoted in Ecuador by UDAPT (Union of People Affected by Texaco&apos;s oil operations, including more than thirty thousand members) is an example of the structure of global impunity that benefits Transnational Corporations (TNC&apos;s) in the violation of Human Rights worldwide and in particular in the Global South. After 25 years of sustained efforts, and despite the fact that the reparation award against Chevron (formerly Texaco) has been ratified at every level of Ecuador&apos;s justice system, it has still not been enforced. Chevron (formerly Texaco) removed all its assets from Ecuador. The affected communities turned to foreign courts to homologate and enforce the Ecuadorian verdict. In Brazil, Argentina and Canada, their lawsuit was dismissed. As an attempt to stop impunity, the affected people have also filed without success a complaint with the International Criminal Court (ICC). The day of action included events in 17 cities and a mass mobilisation in the Amazon. 280 organisations signed a statement representing 280 million people. (23-26) Five global and regional networks working, who have members in LLMICs, with analysis provided by TNI, initiated the process for an alert mechanism to better respond to systematic criminalisation of their members including peasants, fisherfolks, women, (environmental) human rights defenders. The system will be implemented by these organisations.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">1-20 Twenty CSOs, networks and social movements from LLMICs advocated for a UN Binding Treaty on Transnational Corporations and Human Rights in Geneva through oral interventions at Open Ended Inter-Governmental Working Group (OEIGWG) Session at the UNHRC, meetings with their national missions, media work and/or public events (see list of organisations below). TNI organised meetings, spaces and debriefs before and during the week of action to jointly develop strategy and content, facilitated media engagement, and provided logistical and financial support for some of the CSOs to participate. 21 A regional network in support of the Binding treaty was established by CSOs and movements including from Cambodia, Indonesia and the Philippines, with TNI&#x2019;s financial, strategic and analysis support. The Task Force is coordinating advocacy for the campaign in the region and its members are lobbying national policy makers in support of the Binding Treaty. 22-26 Six CSOs and networks from the Democratic Republic of Congo, Mozambique, Madagascar, Malawi, Tanzania, Swaziland, Zambia, Zimbabwe, advocated towards their policy makers, national governments in support of the Binding Treaty. TNI supported these organisations with analysis and strategy through their involvement in a Southern Africa network which TNI also supports financially. 27 With joint strategizing, analysis and content from TNI, a confederation of trade unions in Latin America who has members in LLMICs, is advocating for the UN binding treaty internationally, including within the international union movement. This resulted in the European Trade Union Confederation (ETUC) Resolution supporting the Binding Treaty in June 2018. 28 With financial support, joint strategizing, analysis and networking facilitated by TNI, affected communities, CSOs and networks in Southern Africa strengthened their arguments and evidence for their advocacy through the Permanent People&#x2019;s Tribunal (PPT) on Transnational Corporations in Southern Africa and the Right to Say NO Campaign. At the same time, during the PPT the affected communities, CSOs and networks held demonstrations and engaged with the media and social media under Right to Say NO Campaign. 29-30 A women&#x2019;s organisation from Egypt, with communications support from TNI, translated TNI&#x2019;s framing paper on &#x201C;Shrinking Space&#x201D; into Arabic. The organisation, together with a second from Morocco, used the paper with their members to inform their advocacy on women&#x2019;s rights in their local cities. 31-33 With analysis and networks developed through their involvement in the Emancipatory Rural Politics Initiative (ERPI) that TNI co-organised, two CSOs in Indonesia and Zimbabwe advocated for peasants&#x2019; rights at the United Nations and one CSO has advocated on the right to land and natural resources in Nigeria. 34 In June 2018, Indian unions and CSOs came together to respond to Walmart&#x2019;s takeover of India&#x2019;s largest E-Commerce company, Flipkart. With communications support from TNI, they issued a statement on the takeover and held a press conference. At a later strategy meeting, to which TNI contributed content and analysis, the unions formed an action committee to organise joint work. The unions continue to challenge the emerging duopoly of Ecommerce in India between Walmart and Amazon, with complaints filed at the competition commission and advocacy towards political parties and the Indian Government.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">1-20 Twenty CSOs, networks and social movements from LLMICs advocated for a UN Binding Treaty on Transnational Corporations and Human Rights in Geneva through oral interventions at Open Ended Inter-Governmental Working Group (OEIGWG) Session at the UNHRC, meetings with their national missions, media work and/or public events (see list of organisations below). TNI organised meetings, spaces and debriefs before and during the week of action to jointly develop strategy and content, facilitated media engagement, and provided logistical and financial support for some of the CSOs to participate. 21 A regional network in support of the Binding treaty was established by CSOs and movements including from Cambodia, Indonesia and the Philippines, with TNI&#x2019;s financial, strategic and analysis support. The Task Force is coordinating advocacy for the campaign in the region and its members are lobbying national policy makers in support of the Binding Treaty. 22-26 Six CSOs and networks from the Democratic Republic of Congo, Mozambique, Madagascar, Malawi, Tanzania, Swaziland, Zambia, Zimbabwe, advocated towards their policy makers, national governments in support of the Binding Treaty. TNI supported these organisations with analysis and strategy through their involvement in a Southern Africa network which TNI also supports financially. 27 With joint strategizing, analysis and content from TNI, a confederation of trade unions in Latin America who has members in LLMICs, is advocating for the UN binding treaty internationally, including within the international union movement. This resulted in the European Trade Union Confederation (ETUC) Resolution supporting the Binding Treaty in June 2018. 28 With financial support, joint strategizing, analysis and networking facilitated by TNI, affected communities, CSOs and networks in Southern Africa strengthened their arguments and evidence for their advocacy through the Permanent People&#x2019;s Tribunal (PPT) on Transnational Corporations in Southern Africa and the Right to Say NO Campaign. At the same time, during the PPT the affected communities, CSOs and networks held demonstrations and engaged with the media and social media under Right to Say NO Campaign. 29-30 A women&#x2019;s organisation from Egypt, with communications support from TNI, translated TNI&#x2019;s framing paper on &#x201C;Shrinking Space&#x201D; into Arabic. The organisation, together with a second from Morocco, used the paper with their members to inform their advocacy on women&#x2019;s rights in their local cities. 31-33 With analysis and networks developed through their involvement in the Emancipatory Rural Politics Initiative (ERPI) that TNI co-organised, two CSOs in Indonesia and Zimbabwe advocated for peasants&#x2019; rights at the United Nations and one CSO has advocated on the right to land and natural resources in Nigeria. 34 In June 2018, Indian unions and CSOs came together to respond to Walmart&#x2019;s takeover of India&#x2019;s largest E-Commerce company, Flipkart. With communications support from TNI, they issued a statement on the takeover and held a press conference. At a later strategy meeting, to which TNI contributed content and analysis, the unions formed an action committee to organise joint work. The unions continue to challenge the emerging duopoly of Ecommerce in India between Walmart and Amazon, with complaints filed at the competition commission and advocacy towards political parties and the Indian Government.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">(1) The Global Inter-Parliamentarian Network (GIN) in support of the UN Binding Treaty on TNCs, grew to over 331 members from different countries and regions worldwide, notably new MEPs. Prior to the October 2019 OEIWG, Parliamentarians from Mercosur (which includes LLMIC Paraguay) released a statement in support of the binding treaty. TNI co-organised meetings with GIN and encouraged parliamentarians to join. TNI also co-organised a side event with GIN at the occasion of the 5th OEIGWG Session at Human Rights Council in Geneva (October 2019). The panel involved members of the European Parliament from different groups, as well as representatives of Asian and Latin American Parliaments. The Side Event was attended by at least 15 representatives of States. (2) The Spanish Government started discussions on a proposal for a new national law on TNCs and human rights. TNI and partners lobbied for the law. Many TNCs that operate in LLMICs are registered in Spain. (3) Luxembourg parliamentarians proposed a law for binding regulations on the financial sector. This is significant as Luxembourg is a hub for the financial sector, including corporations who operate in LLMICs. French partners, together with TNI, lobbied for this law. (4) Representatives of the missions of 91 states and 2 non-member states with observer status participated in the OEIGWG Session on the Zero Draft. This included 35 LLMICs and shows the increasing support for the binding treaty. TNI coordinates the Global Campaign for the Binding Treaty and provides analytical and communications support to partners lobbying and advocating for the treaty with their government in the different global regions. Members of the global campaign have been advocating towards their national governments to participate in the OEIWG and support a UN Binding Treaty on TNCs. (5-6) Mexican media (1) (major TV networks and other important press) covered a &#x2018;tour&#x2019; in Mexico to expose the harmful actions of transnational corporations (TNCs). Following the media event, the Mexican Environment Minister (1), Victor Toledo, shared the claims with the Mexican President. TNI co-organised the tour with Mexican partners. (7) In 2019, the World Economic Forum signed a Partnership Agreement with the UN that committed the UN to work with WEF. The content of the agreement with such a major corporate actor was not made public. TNI co-organised a petition signed by 400 CSOs and social movements, including in LLMICs, denouncing the agreement and lack of transparency. The petition called for the UN to be transparent and cautioning against this type of agreements, which can de-legitimize the United Nations and provide transnational corporations preferential and deferential access to the UN System. (8) Le Courier, a major newspaper in Switzerland published a front-page story on the UN Binding treaty, including an interview with TNI staff. This was a first in the Swiss press.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">1 The Global Inter-Parliamentarian Network (GIN) in support of the UN Binding Treaty on TNCs, grew to over 350 members from different countries. Parliamentarians, including those new to the network, urged governments to actively engage in the process of developing the Zero Draft. Parliamentarians discussed the binding treaty at events with four parliaments in Asia and Latin America. GIN members in the European Parliament initiated two Resolutions in the European Parliament in support of the Binding Treaty. TNI co-organised meetings with GIN and encouraged parliamentarians to join. 2 With assistance from TNI&#x2019;s partner in Uruguay, the Uruguayan the Ministry of Foreign Affairs organised a national CSO consultation (in the framework of the government&#x2019;s Foreign Affairs ministry-led national Dialogue and Consultations System) on the UN Binding Treaty process and the Zero Draft in advance of the 4th session of the OEIGWG in mid-October this year. This was a great step forward in itself and a positive sign of progress in moving the Uruguayan government&#x2019;s position on the UN Binding Treaty. It also attracted participation from various governmental bodies. TNI provides financial support to the partner and support on strategy through the Global Campaign on Corporate Impunity. 3-10 Eight Southern African countries (Angola, Democratic Republic of Congo, Namibia, Madagascar, Mauritius, Mozambique, South Africa and Zimbabwe) actively participated throughout the debate on the Zero Draft of the UN Binding Treaty. TNI&#x2019;s partners through the Southern African Group on the Global Campaign, which TNI supports financially and with analysis and joint strategizing, have been actively advocating for their governments to support the binding treaty. 11 Representatives of the missions of 92 states and 2 non-members states with observer status participated in the OEIGWG Session on the Zero Draft. This included 35 LLMICs and was the highest number ever and shows the increasing support for the binding treaty. TNI coordinates the Global Campaign for the Binding Treaty and provides analytical and communications support to partners lobbying and advocating for the treaty with their government in the different global regions. Members of the global campaign have been advocating towards their national governments to participate in the OEIWG and support a UN Binding Treaty on TNCs. 12 Mexico spoke in support of specific obligations of corporations under the treaty showing a shift in its position in favour of the Binding Treaty. TNI, with Mexican partners, have advocated the Mexican government and Mission in Geneva. 13 The European Confederation of Trade Unions (ETUC) issued its Statement in support of the Binding Treaty in June 2018. TNI, with Asian and European unions and international union bodies, sustained advocacy within the trade union movement in the different regions. 14 Movements in South Korea convened a conference in support of the UN Binding Treaty on Transnational Corporations in March 2018. TNI&#x2019;s partners mobilised support from a broad spectrum of social movements and civil society organisations within Korea and contributed with analysis and strategy to set up a Korean Observatory supporting the Binding Treaty. 15 At the 11th General Assembly of the Euro-Med Rights Network in Brussels, CSOs from across the region discussed TNI&#x2019;s narrative on &#x201C;Shrinking Space&#x201D; during a day of discussions on Shrinking Space. The Euro-Med Rights Network is a network of 80 human rights organisations based in the Euro-Med region, including LLMICs. 16 Scholar activists and peasants, food sovereignty, unions and shepherds movements, including from Myanmar, Indonesia, Zimbabwe and Nigeria, came together at an international conference in March in The Hague and a regional gathering in Thailand in December under the Emancipatory Rural Politics Initiative (ERPI). At the meetings, co-organised by TNI, academics and activists discussed current situation of authoritarianism and human rights violations for rural populations while assessing joint possible responses. Analyses from the meetings have since been used by academics, media and social movements in their publications. 17 Frente Amplio, the party in government in Uruguay, included support for the UN Binding Treaty in their programme (for 2020-2025) with which they will be running for a fourth consecutive mandate in the October 2019 elections (presidential, parliamentary and municipal). This will be potentially of critical importance as well for the forthcoming process in Geneva, given that Uruguay will be a voting member in the UN Human Rights Council from 2019 through 2022. TNI&#x2019;s partner in Uruguay continuously engaged with Frente Amplio MPs on the issue and co-organized a meeting on the UN Binding Treaty with civil society, local authorities, grassroots groups resisting corporate power in the territory, civil servants from different ministries and government bodies. TNI provides financial support to this partner and supports on strategy through the Global Campaign on Corporate Impunity.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">1. Network of parliamentarians who support the process of the UN Binding Treaty was created as a result of TNI and partners&apos; lobbying and expertise on the Treaty. 250 MPs and MEPs joined in support. 2. The OEIGWG process is still alive: partly due to TNI and other partners&apos; lobbying, the process for a UN Binding Treaty will continue after its 3rd session last October. We will now enter the negotiation phase. The presence of Southern partners in Geneva helped amplify the voice of Southern groups and make a strong case for the need for binding regulation. 3. The People&apos;s Perminant Tribunal was held in Southern Africa, adding new cases and raising large interest among movements in the region. TNI&apos;s participation at conceptual, communication and logistical level has been fundamental. This process has put the issue of the need for binding regulation more clearly on the agenda of different social movements. 4. After workshops and other sessions organised by TNI and other (FGG) partners, the binding treaty work has been put on the agenda of social movements and alliances working on trade and investment such as the Europe-wide seattle to Brussels network. 5. In Spain, the Catalan Centre on TNCs has been approved by the Catalan Parliament. The Catalan groups of NGOs on TNCs - supported by TNI - have been advocating for this grievance/remedy mechanism for a long time already. 6. In Brazil, a working group on business and human rights was created within the Ministry of Public Prosecution, after long-term advocacy by local groups. TNI supported the preparation of the agenda, the logistical organisation, and expert input for local groups. 7. Through TNI&apos;s co-organisation of large international academic-social movement colloquia such as Initiatives in Critical Agrarian Studies (ICAS) colloqium on the future of food and agriculture in the 21st Century in Basque Country, as well as the BICAS (BRICS in Critial Agrarian Studies) in Moscow, TNI has been able to introduce critical issues such as flex crops, food sovereignty and agroecology to the agenda of both academe and social movements. TNI continues to be sought out in various academic-activist partnership activities, showing our analysis is being picked up in different circles. 8. TNI has been actively involved in discussions at national level in the Netherlands around the creation of a new land platform examining land politics in Dutch policy. The discussions around rights of peasants and land grabbing have come on the agenda here in the Netherlands. 9. MEPs from 5 countries expressed concern on agrifood mergers, investment on land and extractive industries after publication from TNI on land grabbing in the EU which was presented to the European Parliament. 10. At Nyeleni meetings in Europe, TNI&apos;s analysis and alternatives for access to land and food sovereignty were discussed. TNI was involved in the development of these as part of the coordination committee.</narrative>

These discussions will be based on the publication of TNI&#x2019;s framing paper on &#x201C;shrinking space&#x201D; for environmentalists that will go beyond simply naming the attacks or patterns but will delve in to the politics of why this is occurring in somewhat uniform way across the globe.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">(1) The Catalan Parliament unanimously approved a motion that reaffirms the support for the creation of the Center for Studies and Evaluation of Transnational Corporations and Human Rights. The Parliament&apos;s motion includes also the support to the UN Binding Treaty. The proposal was built by the Working Group on transnational corporations and human rights 2 years ago and was blocked in the context of intervention of the Catalan autonomy by the Spanish Government. The working group includes several member organizations of the Global Campaign in Catalonia. The Global Campaign for the Binding Treaty is coordinated by TNI.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">1. In France, a bill on the duty of care of parent and subcontracting companies was passed in 2017. Members of the Global Campaign against Corporate Impunity - supported by TNI in technical expertise and communication outreach - played a huge role in advocating for corporate accountability. 2. Several measures were adopted by Dutch government as a result from work done by LobbyWatchNL (of which TNI is a key member). To combat revolving door situations, a two year &quot;freeze&quot; period has been installed for MP&apos;s leaving parliament. The government also is now obliged to give more insight on who they met with when drafting a new policy proposal. 3. 524 MEPs voted in favour of a resolution for research into &quot;the state of play of farmland concentration in the UE: how to facilitate the access to land for farmers&quot;. TNI played a key role in drafting the proposal for this resolution and providing technical input, through publications and advocacy with MEPs. TNI brought in southern partners to share examples of impact of EU&apos;s policies abroad.</narrative>
