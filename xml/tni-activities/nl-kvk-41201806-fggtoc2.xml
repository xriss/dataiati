  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">TNI and partners will tackle the negative impacts of investment protection and investment arbitration and strive to enhance developing countries&#x2019; policy space for sustainable development, working on a shift towards a more democratic and sustainable trade policy, coherent with the sustainable development goals. TNI will foster knowledge development by monitoring government policies, carrying out research and publishing a series of briefings. TNI will actively support Southern partners in their research and lobby efforts, and will facilitate knowledge building and sharing among southern partners across all regions to ensure mutual learning and where needed joint strategizing. TNI will also develop common analysis and lobby the Dutch government in relation to its trade and investment policies and treaties as well as European institutions (European Commission and Parliament). Partners will co-host training workshops, research and analysis and will lobby their own governments and regional bodies governing investments. In order to develop strategies to respond to human and environmental rights violations caused by different types of natural resources grabbing, TNI will work with organizations and movements in the South, supporting communities&#x2019; work at local and national level, specifically providing tools and building arguments with them for debates with public authorities. TNI will also support the articulation and planning to strategize with different organizations and develop outreach strategies in order to make these organizations visible, raise awareness and reach out to influence public opinion. To work on international networking and advocacy, TNI will deepen the efforts to articulate interests at the international level, building common strategies, exchanging experiences, proposing concrete campaigns and advocating at Dutch, European and international level. TNI will also promote research on concrete/emblematic cases, documenting experiences of organization and advocacy. Next to these capacity building activities, TNI will also explore the use of existing international instruments and tools to advocate and develop positive experiences of use and control of natural resources, including FPIC, VGGT, VGSSF, UNDRIP, UN Guidelines on displacement, and eviction.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">(1) Just Transition: TNI, with unions and environmental organisations from Africa, Latin America and Netherlands, and with five global and regional movements, agreed on a common position on &#x2018;just transition&#x2019; and had a workshop in Chile and Madrid around the planned, but moved, COP. Environmental justice organisations from 15 countries in Latin America (including those from LLMICs), Togo, Indonesia and Europe, strengthened their capacity on Just Transition practices, with technical support and analysis from TNI through workshops and trainings and initiated a process to develop programmatic proposal. (2-3) Food sovereignty proposals: were identified as an approach to address extractivism in the Middle-East and North Africa region. With financial, methodological support and research from TNI, a network in North Africa positioned the debate in public events in Tunisia. The principles of Food Sovereignty have been incorporated into the fisher organisations&#x2019; proposals. Together with local organisations, TNI developed research and trainings in Indonesia, Spain (with Senegalese migrants) and Turkey. A global network of fisherfolks&#x2019; organisations, has decided to deepen its work on food sovereignty towards its next General Assembly. (4) CSOs, academics and movements, including from Indonesia, Myanmar and India, developed a tool for a permanent exchange and analysis on radical proposals for a human rights approach. Part of this debate was published by TNI and FIAN. (5) Connecting Smallholders to markets: TNI first published on this in 2016 and continued to discuss it as an alternative proposal for EU and national policies, including through International Planning Committee Working Group on land and territory. FAO World Committee on Food Security (CFS) discussed what policy processes need to be in place to connect small holders to local markets. TNI authored a paper on the topic for CSM in 2016, which was fed into FAO discussions. In 2019, TNI gave a further submission into the process together with CSOs from LLMICs including an association of farmers in West Africa. (6) Marine Spatial Planning (MSP): Policy makers in Indonesia discussed the impact of MSP with a fisherfolks organisation in Indonesia. The organisation is proposing a more community led approach, focused on the need and priorities of communities rather than big infrastructure and big business. TNI supported with research and analysis on MSP.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">1 Together with FOEE and other Asian partners, TNI developed a detailed set of recommendations to achieve trade and investment deals that put the public interest in the driving seat. This alternative vision in trade aims for a democratic, participatory and transparent policy-making process at both the national level and in international negotiations. Among the key recommendations we included: * Open and inclusive public consultation before trade mandates are formulated * National parliaments must approve the mandate * Independent environment, social and economic assessment * Transparency and meaningful public participation in negotiations, from start to finish * National Parliaments must be able to give directions during the negotiating process * Ensure balanced stakeholder input at all stages * Ensure public debate and national parliament approval of trade agreements before signing and ratification * Ensure cancellation clauses The recommendations were published in the report &#x201C;RCEP: A secret deal - Trade talks fail the transparency and public participation test&#x201D; and shared with government officials from countries involved in the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP). Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Nepal, India, Indonesia, Philippines and Vietnam are participating in the RCEP negotiations. 2 After three years of consultation with communities and with financial and technical support from TNI, a network in Myanmar and their partners launched an innovative alternative for forest conservation and livelihood development. The project is a people-centered alternative to top-down, militarized development and conservation, and builds towards socially just and ecologically sustainable development for indigenous Karen communities. A Charter has been developed, a guiding document that enshrines the principles of self-determination and ecological sustainability into the governance and management of this indigenous conserved area. 3 TNI, with five regional and global networks began to deepen discussion and elaborate on a common understanding of &#x2018;just transition&#x2019;. This convergence was shared at mobilisation moments and convened common activities around COP24 and GCAS. 4 TNI, together with Myanmar partners, critiqued the current hegemonic narrative of Myanmar&#x2019;s development trajectory, proposed by the major donors, and developed an alternative trajectory based on agriculture. The research was published in the Paradigm Trap: The development establishment&apos;s embrace of Myanmar and how to break loose. The paper proposes an agriculture- and countryside-led industrialization process promoted by local community enterprises, cooperatives, small and medium private enterprises, and state enterprises that focus on socially useful production such as making industrial inputs for organic agriculture, medicinal products for treating tropical diseases and relieving pain, and solar and renewable energy devices for a decentralized renewable energy path. The report highlights what an alternative trade strategy and a solar-based energy infrastructure would entail.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">1 Land and Natural Resources Policies in Indonesia and Myanmar: Based on joint research and technical and political support, TNI will jointly develop proposals for inclusive and sustainable natural resource policies using the voluntary guidelines for land and natural resources (VGGTs and VGSSFs) with organisations in Indonesia and Myanmar. 2 Just Transition: Together with partners from LLMICs, TNI will develop common framings on Just Transition to fulfil the commitments within the Paris Agreement and as an alternative to the climate crisis. Member organization of these networks will promote a deeper understanding of the needs and tools for a just transition. 3 Food sovereignty for fisheries: With technical and methodological support from TNI, fisherfolks organisations at the global level will discuss and agree on the characteristics of food sovereignty for fisheries as a way to improve their livelihoods. Their proposals on food sovereignty for fisheries will serve as an alternative to the food system dominated by the industrial fisheries. 4 Sustainable livelihoods in the high Rif region, Morocco: small farmers in the high Rif region in Morocco are currently largely dependent on illicit cultivation, while previous alternative development initiatives based on crop substitution have dramatically failed due to the environmental characteristics of the area. As an alternative, the farmers are instead advocating for a legal framework that will allow them to grow their produce legally for the local and international medicinal and industrial cannabis markets. In 2020, with technical support and capacity strengthening from TNI, the farmers will develop a pilot project to demonstrate the sustainability of this approach. They will also begin advocating, in cooperation with some local academic experts, for the proposed legal framework towards the relevant local and national authorities in Morocco. 5. Marine Spatial Planning (MSP) alternatives: together with the national Indonesian fisherfolk organisation, TNI will promote alternatives to Marine Spatial Planning in Indonesia, as identified through TNI and this organisation&#x2019;s joint research on MSP published in 2019. MSP has been presented as response to the environmental, political and social challenges around oceans. Indonesia is considered a fore runner in its implementation of MSP. Through joint research, the authors discovered evidence of the negative impacts of these policies for small-scale fisheries. The research also highlighted proposals developed by communities for a positive MSP. In 2020, these proposals will be promoted by the fisher folks organisation and TNI. 6. Agroecology: TNI together with FGG Alliance members and partners including a global peasants movement and smaller community organisations, will promote agroecology as an alternative to corporate food systems. In Uruguay and in Colombia agroecology advocacy will continue at the national level and agroecology practices will be piloted. In the Netherlands, TNI will continue discussions with the Dutch government on the Dutch approach to agroecology. TNI will contribute analysis to support agroecology as a solution to the climate and food crisis. TNI will work with a global peasant&#x2019;s movement on agroecology in the framework of the International Planning Committee for Food Sovereignty (IPC) at the international level in relation to FAO together with other FGG Alliance members. At the request of partners in LLMICs TNI will provide analysis, technical support and will co-publish a report on the corporate capture of agroecology, which will be promoted in 2020.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">(1) The ECT was discussed by trade and climate movements. TNI first raised awareness of the ECT in a 2018 report. In particular, the environmental movement in Chile picked up the issue in 2019. Chile is an observer of the ECT, so this was an important step in halting the expansion of the ECT. Dutch environmental movements including 350.org, and their members are now working on the ECT. TNI introduced the issue to these movements and framed the issue in a way it could be useful for environmental movements in the Netherlands. (2) During a debate with the European Commission on the ECT organised by TNI and partners in Brussels, the Luxembourg Minister of Environment Claude Turmes spoke in support of modernising the ECT to make it compatible with the Paris Agreement or withdrawal from the treaty if modernisation didn&#x2019;t happen fast enough. On 24 September, during an EU Energy Ministers&#x2019; meeting, he presented on the problems of the ECT and encouraged other Ministers to engage in the debate. (3) Media in Latin America, Chile and Spain reported on the ECT for the first time. TNI sent publications to the journalists involved and did interviews with them on the ECT. TNI and partners are advocating to stop the expansion of the ECT and for current member states to withdraw as the ECT is not compatible with countries&#x2019; commitments under the Paris Climate Accord. (4) TNI co-hosted and presented at a meeting in Argentina of IILA, a network of academics in Latin America and the UK working on investment. The meeting focused on the interlinkages between ISDS and ecological sustainability. A critique of ISDS was included in the final declaration of their meeting in June 2019. (5) The EU called the ECT as outdated and needing modernisation. The EU&#x2019;s proposal is to bring ECT in line with its current investment protection model (as embedded in CETA). A TNI report on the ECT brought the issue to the public arena and have since advocated, together with partners in Europe and the Global South, including LLMICs, for a halt to the expansion of the ECT. (6) Negotiations were launched by the ECT Conference of Parties on the modernisation of the ECT at their meeting in December. These negotiations showed commitment to the modernisation process and accelerated the process. A TNI report on the ECT brought the issue to the public arena and have since advocated, together with partners in Europe and the Global South, including LLMICs, for a halt to the expansion of the ECT. (7) The Uganda Government discussed accession to the ECT with a Ugandan CSO working on trade and investment, TNI helped prepare with the CSO and contributed video input. The Government officials in the meeting listened and discussed the CSO&#x2019;s proposals. (8) The Dutch Social Democrats, during a FGG debate, made a commitment to oppose ISDS in the Dutch parliamentary debates. (9) 100 MEPs pledged their support for the Stop ISDS: Rights for peoples, rules for corporations&#x2019; campaign, which asks for an end to ISDS and the implementation of a binding treaty on transnational corporations and human rights. TNI and partners lobbied MEPs and held events in Brussels to secure their support. (10) 850,000 people signed a petition in support of the &#x2018;Stop ISDS: right for people, rules for corporations&#x2019; campaign. This demonstrated to policy makers the importance of the issue to European citizens. TNI hosted the campaign coordinator and promoted the campaign. (11) Farmers groups in the Netherlands opposed FTAs in their public statement, surrounding their protest which received national coverage. The Dutch trade campaign, which includes TNI, met with the farmers groups and shared analysis with them. (12) Together with FGG members BE and AA, and in collaboration with Voedsel Anders network, TNI organised a lunch at MinBuZa on the importance and advantages of agroecology for international and national policies related to food and environment. There is ongoing dialogue with the ministry on this topic. (13) National Myanmar media outlets the Irrawaddy, Myanmar Times, Radio Free Asia and Mizzima quoted TNI&#x2019;s briefing on the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) in Myanmar in their stories on the BRI in Myanmar. TNI&#x2019;s briefing analyses the BRI through a political economy lens as an initiative driven by corporations. (14-18) Five Myanmar political parties discussed TNI&#x2019;s analysis of the BRI in workshops with TNI as part of developing their investment policies in the lead up to the next national election.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">1 Over 1600 Dutch citizens participated in an online public consultation on the proposed new model Bilateral Investment Treaty (BIT). TNI hosts the Dutch trade campaign Handel Anders, which encouraged people to participate. This led to the Dutch Government announcing the model BIT would be reviewed by the Dutch Parliament. 2 The ISDS and corporate accountability movements in Europe joined together for the first time in a joint campaign, influencing the agenda of groups from both movements. TNI works in both the ISDS and corporate accountability movements and, with partners, facilitated the coming together of the two groups. A stronger, pan European voice on ISDS can increase pressure on European governments to renegotiate their trade and investment agreements, including with LLMICs. 3 Biodiversity Latin America discussed ISDS for the first time in their webinar, showing the link between seed issues and ISDS. TNI provided information for the webinar. 4 Several groups campaigning on energy and climate in Latin America, Europe and Africa discussed the impact of the Energy Charter Treaty (ECT) on energy transition at social movement conferences in Costa Rica and Nigeria for the first time. The ECT will restrict the energy transition policy options for governments, including in LLMICs. TNI published and brought the issue to international meetings with energy and climate campaigners. 5 A journalist from a major newspaper in Pakistan published an article criticising the ECT. Pakistan is close to joining the ECT and criticism from the Pakistan media put pressure on the Government to reconsider their involvement. TNI published a report on the ECT with a Press Release on the impacts for Pakistan, which it communicated to the journalist and had follow up discussions with the journalist regarding the ECT. 6 The European Commission began discussing with other countries replacing the current ISDS system with a Multilateral Investment Court (MIC), which would have significant impacts on LLMICs. Although for TNI the MIC still has flaws, it shows already improvement and the recognition that the current ISDS system is no longer viable, and that a new system is needed. TNI, together with partners, has researched ISDS and advocated for an end to the ISDS system since 2010. 7 The issue of the China&#x2019;s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) was discussed by social movements in a workshop at the Asia Europe Peoples&#x2019; Forum (AEPF) in September. The AEPF is a collective of social movements from Europe and Asia, including from multiple LLMICs. This was the first time the BRI was discussed by movements from Asia and Europe together. 8 Myanmar parliamentarians from multiple parties discussed ISDS and the proposed EU-Myanmar Investment Protection Agreement during a seminar. TNI co-authored a report on the EU-Myanmar Investment Protection Agreement, including a translation into Myanmar language, and organised a presentation for parliamentarians in Myanmar. 9 The Thematic Circle on Just Trade and Corporate Accountability of the Asia Europe Peoples&#x2019; Forum, which brings together movements and CSOs from Asia and Europe, met in Jakarta in February where they decided to prioritise ISDS and IPR chapters in their campaigns on EU-Asia FTAs (Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, Philippines, Vietnam). They also decided to work together under the Global Campaign to Dismantle Corporate Power to promote and support the UN Binding Treaty on transnational corporations. TNI facilitated the thematic circle and brought the issues to the discussion. 10 A Member of Parliament from the Dutch Socialist Party asked 23 questions to the Dutch minister of Trade and Development about the harm of ISDS, the Investment Court System (ICS) and the Multilateral Investment Court (MIC), mega trade deals such as TTIP and CETA, and the role of the Netherlands. TNI co-published a report on 50 Years of ISDS, highlighting the role of the Netherlands. TNI communicated the report to members of Parliament and media, including the member who asked the questions. 11 The concept of &#x2018;territorial markets&#x2019;, developed by TNI and partners through the Committee on World Food Security, was used by a farmers union in West Africa in their advocacy work. 12 The Flex Crops framework was discussed by academics and social movements, including those from LLMICs, at the Emancipatory Rural Politics Initiative and BICAS Conferences. TNI, in cooperation with other scholars, has developed the concept of Flex Crops and TNI&#x2019;s key publication on the topic was cited in academic journals 40 times in 2018. TNI published a popular version of the papers, which was used by movements from different regions. 13 In October 2018 in Costa Rica, a regional confederation of trade unions, and their allies made a statement on energy, labour and the environment. In the past, the issue of energy has been contentious for unions; the statement shows a step in the process of developing proposals for social and environmental justice together with other movements. TNI supported the conference where the statement was made through helping to develop the methodology, content and preparatory documents. 14 In meetings in the UK in June and September, UK unions and the British Labour Party discussed the consequence of the British energy policies internationally, including LLMICs. TNI presented analysis at these meetings on this topic which was then discussed. 15 The TNI report Paradigm Trap: The development establishment&apos;s embrace of Myanmar and how to break loose was received and shared among high level Myanmar Government Officials. Following this, one high level official requested 50 more copies to share with his team. The sharing of the report among ministers and requests for more copies shows the Myanmar Government is discussing the report internally. 16 Over 4000 copies of the report &#x2018;Paradigm trap: The development establishment&apos;s embrace of Myanmar and how to break loose&#x2019;, published by TNI and partners, were distributed in Burmese and a shorter, more accessible version in Burmese was shared widely on social media. Facebook is a key medium for discussion regarding public policy in Myanmar. 17 In June, Ronald Roosdorp, Director for International Trade Policy &amp; Economic Governance from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Dutch Government indicated during questions in Parliament, its intention to re-negotiate the Energy Charter Treaty (ECT) to bring ISDS in line with the Dutch Government&#x2019;s new model Bilateral Investment Treaty (BIT). LLMICs are signatories to the ECT and changes to the ECT will therefore impact LLMICs. TNI, together with partners, published and promoted a report on the ECT. The report was communicated to the Dutch Government and the Dutch media report on it, soon after these announcements were made. 18 Foreign Minister Kaag publicly stated that ISDS is no longer needed between OECD countries. The statement was made in response to the launch of the 50 Years of ISDS, co-authored by TNI, SOMO, Both ENDS and Milieudefensie and shared with Minister Kraag and other Dutch government officials. 19 In February 2018, the Coordinadora de Centrales Sindicales del Cono Sur (CCSCS), the labour counterpart for Mercosur in the EU-Mercosur FTA negotiations, who are therefore often invited as important players in the negotiations, took a much stronger public stance in opposition to the FTA, which also prompted a stronger than usual joint ETUC-CCSCS statement ahead of the February 2018 round of negotiations in Brussels. Mercosur includes LLMIC Paraguay and will therefore the ratification of an FTA will impact Paraguay. TNI&#x2019;s partner has been in dialogue with CCSCS in relations to FTA.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">1. MEP mission to Myanmar cancelled: European Parliament mission to Myanmar was cancelled, stalling the EU-Myanmar IPA negotiations. TNI co-organised advocacy towards EP in June with local partners from Myanmar. TNI also wrote a briefing with input from Myanmar CSOs which was distributed widely in the EP. As a result, MEPs that had been engaged decided to cancel the trip to Myanmar. The Rohingya crisis might have been another factor that added to the cancellation of this trip. However, we did get clear responses from MEPs that they took the information we provided into serious consideration. 2. CETA delayed: Continuous critiques on ISDS/ICS by TNI and other partners ensured that the final ratification of CETA did not include ISDS part. TNI put pressure on Dutch MEPs and the Council not to ratify CETA. 3. Critique on MIC: TNI played a key role in the S2B network&apos;s response to the MIC proposal by the EU (framing it as global ISDS). MEPs and trade unions turned their opinion re MIC. At a policy debate in Brussels (organised by TNI and others) ambassadors from various countries and the chair of the German judges federation publicly dismissed the MIC. 4. Trade minister Indonesia: Indonesian trade network - supported by TNI - put out a statement calling for a moratorium of the negotiations around the EU-Indonesia FTA. The Trade Minister of Indonesia responded and requested to have a meeting with TNI&apos;s partner IGJ and the coalition. 5. ISDS Latin America: TNI hosted several seminars and workshops in 2017 in Latin America (Colombia, Argentina, Uruguay) to put the ISDS issue back on the agenda of social movements and CSOs in the region. The activities opened up new constituencies interested in the issue among CSOs and trade unions and statements on for example the EU-Mexico agreement got wide CSOs sign-ons. The issue is clearly getting more attention again among CSOs in the region. 6. Binding Treaty/MIC: TNI co-organised a cross-fertilisation between NGOs and social movements working on trade/MIC and those on the Binding Tready for TNCs in Brussels in September. This put the MIC issue on the agenda of the Binding Treaty campaign and led to a more coherent narrative and strategy for both movements. 7. Bolivia renaming BITs: TNI was invited to a meeting with the Bolivian government about the new Bolivian BIT model. Meetings took place with the State General Attorney and the vice-minister of Development. As a result, Bolivia decided to change the BIT model&apos;s name to &quot;investment treaty for development&quot;. 8. TNI&apos;s analysis on fishery policies and food sovereignty was picked up by WFFP. As a result, WFFP incorporated workshops on food sovereignty, ocean grabbing, and climate justice into its General Assembly.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">1-7 Proposals presented by TNI and partners on the different flaws of the Energy Charter Treaty (ECT), Investor State Dispute Settlement (ISDS), Investment Court System, and the Multilateral Investment Court system will be discussed by parliamentarians and policy makers in (1) the Philippines, (2) Indonesia, (3) Malaysia, (4)the Netherlands, (5) Mexico, (6) Argentina and (7) the EU. 8 Ten mainstream media outlets publish critical reporting on ISDS, referencing proposals on the ECT, ISDS, Investment Court System and the Multilateral Investment Court system developed and promoted by TNI together with partners from multiple LLMICs. 9-11 At least 3 governments, in Europe and the Global South, raise serious concerns regarding the ECT, including in the context for modernisation of the ECT. No new countries join the ECT. TNI will contribute analysis, advocacy and capacity building in key target countries. 12 Climate justice movements in Asia, Europe, Latin America and Asia campaign against ISDS in general and ECT in particular, proposing countries withdraw from the ECT or refrain from joining it, based on an understanding of how ISDS/ECT undermines the fight for climate justice and energy transition. TNI will contribute analysis and capacity development, in particular trainings and dedicated material that will explain the impact of ISDS/ECT on energy transition. 13 The three working groups of the International Planning Committee for Food Sovereignty (IPC) and at the Conference of the Parties (CoP) of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) discuss proposals for food and resource sovereignty promoted by TNI&#x2019;s partners, including a global peasant&#x2019;s movement and fisherfolk movement at these meetings. TNI supports this work by contributing analysis and facilitating strategy development in preparation for advocacy meetings.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">(1) A regional Latin American CSO platform, which TNI helped establish, and has members from across Latin America and the Caribbean including from Haiti and Bolivia. TNI supported network building efforts and contributed analysis. The platform is advocating on the impacts of FTAs and ISDS. In 2019 the network expanded its members. (2) An Indonesian research and advocacy institute continued to advocate towards Indonesian Government negotiators to discuss different trade agreements and the impact of ISDS. TNI supported the institute financially and through joint research and analysis. (3-24) Following a workshop on ISDS in Africa, co-organised by TNI, SEATINI, Friends of the Earth International and Client Earth, 22 trade unions and CSOs in Africa began lobby and advocacy work towards their national governments and organising regional advocacy efforts including joint letters. Organisations include: (25-26) With technical support and research from TNI on the Blue Economy (policies that relate to the governance of ocean spaces), two global networks of fisherfolks lobbied and advocated at the FAO on Global Strategic Framework (GSF) monitoring and implementation of the Small Scale Fisheries Guidelines, through the IPC working group on Fisheries and at international venues, such as World Fish. (27) With financial support and analysis from TNI, a fisher folk&#x2019;s network in Indonesia advocated towards the national Indonesian Government on Marine Spatial Planning and Blue Economy policies. (28) An Indonesian feminist association working with fisherfolks, with TNI technical support, advocated towards the national government on gender roles and women&#x2019;s work in fisheries. (29-30) With technical support from TNI, two international food sovereignty movements advocated at the FAO Central-Eastern European regional meeting on the SDGs, surrounding the launch of the UN Decade on Family Farming, through the IPC, and at the FAO CFS (Committee of Food Security) through the Civil Society Mechanism (CSM) . (31-34) With analysis and discussion with TNI, and financial support for the meetings, four Latin American continental networks who all have members in LLMICs, prepared inputs for the 26th COP of the UNFCCC (in Madrid) and organised alternative events on Just Transition proposals from CSOs, both in Madrid and Chile at the Peoples&#x2019; Summit. (35) A Latin American regional network, with members in LLMICs, which TNI has supported with analysis, networking and financial support, since its creation in 2015, organized its regional gathering in Cuba, with participation of more than 1300 representatives from CSOs, movements and governments. These Latin American organizations advocated for better policies on environment, trade, peace and democratic solutions for the region. (36-61) 26 Myanmar CSOs and networks, mostly from ethnic minorities, participated in two courses on political economy, organized by TNI, to strengthen the analytical skills and understanding of political economy. The participants then used this knowledge and skills in their lobby and advocacy work on issues such as land, investment, conflict, gender and other political economy related issues. (62-88) 27 Myanmar CSOs and networks in four cities strengthened their advocacy on investment in Myanmar and their cooperation with each other on this issue, with research and analysis on China&#x2019;s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) from TNI outlined in a briefing paper and discussed in workshops. (89) With financial, methodological support and research from TNI, a food sovereignty network in North Africa developed their proposals for food sovereignty and advocated for food sovereignty through public events in Tunisia.

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">1 A regional Latin American CSO platform was launched in 2018 with members from across Latin America and the Caribbean including from Haiti and Bolivia. TNI supported network building efforts and contributed analysis. The platform is advocating on the impacts of FTAs and ISDS. 2-3 Through joint research with TNI on the publication The Paradigm Trap: The development establishment&apos;s embrace of Myanmar and how to break loose, Myanmar CSOs developed their research and analysis skills, made evident the hegemonic narrative on development in Myanmar and outlined viable alternatives. CSOs have since used the publication in their advocacy with Myanmar MPs and the Myanmar Government, who have discussed the report. 4-5 With technical support and analysis from TNI, two Myanmar networks organized a campaign challenging the Myanmar Government&#x2019;s land policy through social media and in public statements. 6-7 With financial support, technical advice and relationships facilitated by TNI, the two Myanmar networks launched a video showing the experiences of internally displaced people (IDP) of land grabbing by large agricultural investors, including plantations by foreign companies. The networks have been using the video in their advocacy for IDP land rights and the right of return. 8 TNI held a workshop on China&#x2019;s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) with CSOs in Myanmar. Participants discussed the local and broader implications of the BRI. The CSOs are challenging the key investments in Myanmar under the BRI framework with demonstrations and through the media. 9 Through joint research on RCEP, two CSOs strengthened their analysis and evidence of the impact of trade and investment agreements in their countries. They have used this analysis and the report in their advocacy towards their national governments on RCEP negotiations. 10 With financial support and workshops on indigenous peoples&#x2019; rights, human rights and gender rights from TNI, a CSO in Myanmar has campaigned with local community based organisations to stop land grabbing and the development of large scale dams and infrastructure projects, and challenging a massive conservation project in Tanintharyi Region. 11 Throughout the year, TNI&#x2019;s partner in Indonesia engaged with the Indonesian Government negotiators to discuss different trade agreements and the impact of ISDS. For example, in September, they met to discuss the ongoing negotiations of RCEP and EU-Indonesia FTA. TNI supported the partner financially and through joint research and analysis. 12 A wide coalition of Indonesian CSOs and networks denounced the Indonesian government for signing a new BIT with Singapore. They call for non-ratification. This process was coordinated by TNI&#x2019;s partner and was grounded in analysis that TNI had produced and shared with the Coalition. 13-17 In 2018, TNI worked with Indian trade unions to strengthen the unions&#x2019; understanding of the impact of trade and investment agreements on labour issues in India. TNI worked closely with five unions, in particular, providing joint analysis. In April, TNI co-organised a national level workshop with 25 Indian unions (including the 5 unions) on &#x2018;Trade and Investment Liberalisation: impacts on workers in India&#x2019; TNI made a presentation on investor rights, corporate impunity and peoples alternatives to free trade. The workshop helped unions to make the link between international trade agreements and labour rights struggles on the ground and challenging labour relations. The trade unions then advocated towards the national government and their affiliated political parties on issues relating to RCEP and other FTAs. 18 In May 2018 in Singapore, trade unions from across Asia, including LLMICs, came together to develop their understanding of trade agreements at a meeting convened by international unions. TNI contributed through a workshop on the rise of corporate Asia and how corporations are using FTAs and BITs as one of the key tools to access markets and potentially limit policy space through ISDS. Following the meeting, participants launched an Asia Pacific Network. The network is advocating to stop RCEP through online campaigns and supporting members&#x2019; national level activities. 19-20 With analysis on land grabbing from TNI, two Ukrainian networks lobbied the Ukrainian Government to support the UN Declaration on the Rights of Peasants and Other People Working in Rural Areas through meetings with high level officials. 21 With financial support and analysis from TNI, and relationships with other Ukrainian CSOs facilitated by TNI, a Ukrainian progressive popular journal published a special issue on development and theories of agrarian change in Ukraine, challenging agri-business and tax avoidance in the country. The journal advocates for progressive policy change towards the general public in Ukraine. 22 With financial support and analysis from TNI, a fisherfolks network in Indonesia, organised a counter event to a major international conference on Blue Growth which was held in Indonesia in 2018. 23-25 With strategic and technical advice and analysis on &#x2018;Blue Growth&#x2019; from TNI, international fisherfolks bodies made interventions on the floor of the FAO Committee on Fisheries Initiative (COFI) in July 2018. 26 With training from TNI on the Small Scale Fisheries (SSF) Guidelines, fisher folk from Latin America, (including from Honduras), advocated using the SSF guidelines at the FAO. 27-28 TNI conducted workshops on gender and fisheries in Myanmar with two CSOs. These groups then sensitized gender issues in their advocacy on coastal and marine issues at the community level. 29-31 With analysis and discussion with TNI, and financial support for the meetings, three regional networks who all have members from LLMICs, incorporated gender justice perspectives in their statement at a conference in Costa Rica. 32 With training on climate justice from TNI and partners, food sovereignty movements from Nicaragua, El Salvador, Zimbabwe, Haiti, Honduras, Indonesia strengthened their understanding of climate problems and the definition of their proposals for climate policies, which were presented at COP24. 33 With technical support from TNI at their regional assembly in El Salvador, a regional environmental network used environmental justice concepts in their advocacy towards the El Salvadorian Government on the trade and investment regime. 34 With financial and technical support from TNI, a farmer&#x2019;s collective held their annual forum which resulted in a final statement outlining the farmers&#x2019; concerns and positions. The farmers also met Myanmar Government officials and international officials to discuss policies that affected them and presented a video outlining their concerns at the United Nations Commission on Narcotic Drugs (CND) in Vienna. 35 With financial and technical advice from TNI, a Myanmar network developed the framework for an alternative for forest conservation and livelihood development, consulted with communities and local authorities on the proposal, and following their support, developed and launched the community managed park.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">1. Partner in Indonesia: joint publication with TNI and SOMO on the EU-Indonesia FTA increased awareness among CSOs in Indonesia and Europe. Workshops were held in Indonesia to provide technical input for local CSOs. As a result, TNI&apos;s partner released a video on ISDS, published a press release, and showed to be well able to answer media questions and built good contacts in parliament on FTA. 2+3. Myanmar groups: workshops in Myanmar co-organised by TNI led to deepening of knowledge of the ISDS. TNI&apos;s publication on EU-Myanmar IPA contributed to capacity of two local CSOs to be able to reply to in-depth questions from the media. 4. Local partner in Indonesia: after a webinar for Asian CSOs on the newly introduced Multilateral Investment Court (by EU), our partner was able to prepare a press release expressing concerns of Indonesian CSOs about this new investment protection mechanism. 5. India Trade campaign: with technical support and expertise input from TNI, local CSOs in the Indian Trade campaign organised events towards journalists in Delhi to inform them about WTO, FTAs and Bilteral Investment Treaties. Briefing papers on RCEP (co-published by TNI) were used to engage different stakeholders. TNI also co-organised a South India Regional Workshop on understanding the impact of RCEP. 6+7. TNI has worked on strengthening and building capacity of major movements of small scale food producers (La Via Campesina and World Forum of Fisher Peoples) to deepen their understanding of policies, proposals and international standards and best practices. Through TNI&apos;s technical contribution, cooperation and communication among both movements has improved, as they now develop common strategies for example on advocacy towards FAO. 8. The Hands on the Land alliance - of which TNI is a key member and which includes Southern partners - has been strengthened as a political alliance. The alliance will continue to be a space to strategise and propose common intiativies for advocacy and alternatives. TNI has been part of the secretariat of HoTL and has provided expert analysis around issues of land grabbing and food sovereignty. 9+10+11+12. The capacity of fisher folks and ethnic groups in Myanmar to discuss and advocate for better policies has been strengthened, which was demonstrated at different advocacy meetings at national level. TNI provided technical support and continues to be seen as a key ally to support their work. 13+14+15. Materials on how to use VGGTs and VGSSFs were developed with partners from different African countries. This contributed to a better understanding of the guidelines and the way they might be useful for organizations&apos; demands. For example, several partners engaged in a long-term project to develop their understanding of the VGGTs and used these in local advocacy contexts with national governments. This strengthened local campaigns and allowed national organizations to engage in lobbying around proposed changes to land laws and regulations in Uganda and South Africa.</narrative>

Furthermore, CSO networks from Latin America, Asia and Europe, will have an initial understanding of China&#x2019;s strategy towards Investor State Dispute Settlement in context of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). These CSOs and networks will then use this analysis to inform their advocacy relating to specific Chinese investments under the BRI. 9-14 Based on research and analysis from TNI about the risks from the trade and investment regime for policies to tackle climate change, in particular relating to the Energy Charter Treaty (ECT) and networking facilitated by TNI, organizations from Philippines, Uganda, Cambodia, Morocco, El Salvador, Honduras, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Indonesia will advocate for their governments to leave investment treaties or refrain from joining them, including the ECT. 15 A global fisherfolk organisations, and CSOs working on fisheries in Indonesia and Myanmar will sharpen their strategies, strengthen their critiques and develop policy proposals for food sovereignty based on a broader understanding of influences around ocean spaces through technical and research support from TNI. 16-19 With TNI&#x2019;s technical support including analysis and network facilitation, peasant organisations, unions, environmentalists and women&#x2019;s organisations will deepen their understanding and formulate proposals on policies that contribute towards a just transition. 20 With technical support from TNI, a regional network in Nicaragua will increase its skills to advocate regionally for policies that acknowledge climate debt towards southern countries. 21-31 With joint research and capacity development workshops from TNI, 10 CSOs in Myanmar will advocate for improved national land policies and improved land policies of ethnic political parties in the lead up to the 2020 National Election in Myanmar. 32 With capacity development workshops from TNI, joint research with TNI, and technical advice from TNI, small farmers in Morocco will advocate for sustainable livelihoods in the high Rif region through participation in the licit medical cannabis market. They will advocate for a legal framework that will allow them to grow their produce legally for the local and international medicinal and industrial cannabis markets. 33 With financial and technical support from TNI, a food sovereignty network which has members in Morocco, Tunisia, Algeria, Palestine and Egypt, will increase their capacities to advocate for improved food and environment policies at the national and regional level.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">(1) ISDS was removed from RCEP in September 2019. This followed years of lobby and advocacy by TNI&#x2019;s staff in Asia and partners in Asia, including from Indonesia, Philippines, Myanmar, and India. Removing the ISDS from RCEP means an investor-state dispute clause will not be included in the agreement between 15 countries. If ISDS was included in RCEP, then it could be used by corporations to sue for lost revenue if public policy changes. (2) In September 2019 at an event organised by TNI and partners on the ECT, the ECT Secretariat announced no new members would be admitted to the ECT until a modernisation process was completed. TNI co-published a report on the ECT in 2018, organised a debate with the European Commission in 2019 and did media work on it together with partners. The treaty is being promoted for expansion in LLMICs. (3) In July 2019, the Prime Minister of South Korea announced he planned to abolish ISDS. This created spaces for other high-level officials to come out against ISDS. TNI&#x2019;s partners in Asia, with research, networking and financial support from TNI, had advocated against ISDS for many years.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">1 The Dutch Government unveiled a vastly-revised model BIT, which removes double-hatting, party-appointed arbitrators and protection for mailbox companies. The new investment treaty will be a basis for negotiating investment treaties with LLMICs. TNI, with FGG Alliance members SOMO, Both ENDS and Milieudefensie and the Dutch trade campaign Handel Anders, has been lobbying for changes to the model BIT proposed. 2 In April in Rome, the Food and Agricultural Organisation (FAO) launched the Upscale Agroecology Initiative. The initiative is the framework for international policy on agroecology and relevant areas relating to agroecology. The initiative acknowledges the importance of agroecology and incorporated the food sovereignty movements&#x2019; concerns and vision on agroecology. TNI co-facilitated preparation meetings with the movements before the FAO meetings, and contributed analysis. 3 The National Agroecology plan was introduced by the national government in Uruguay. The new law provides a political context and recognition of rights and needs of people in rural areas but also can be used as a tool to claim support for the agricultural practices. TNI supported the CSOs advocating for the law through content and analysis, joint advocacy through the FAO agroecology symposium and a national agroecology school finically supported by TNI. 4 In December, a local authority in Myanmar, in partnership with local CSOs and networks, launched an innovative alternative for forest conservation and livelihood development. The initiative places land rights and indigenous management systems at the heart of its approach. Introduced in 2016 as a people-centered alternative to top-down, militarized development and conservation, it builds towards socially just and ecologically sustainable development for indigenous communities in the area. TNI&#x2019;s partner facilitated the consultations to develop the project and its Charter, a guiding document that enshrines the principles of self-determination and ecological sustainability into the governance and management of this indigenous conserved area. A referendum to gauge community consent for adopting the Charter was carried out in early 2018 and collected signatures, with 75.1% of the population living within the proposed area agreeing to adopt the charter. TNI supported the development of the initiative financially and provided technical advice on the consultation process and development of the Charter. 5 Previously the Indonesian President signed international trade and investment agreements. In November, the Indonesian Constitutional Court ruled that all international trade and investment agreements will now need to be reviewed by the Indonesian Parliament before ratification. This will change the process by which agreements are signed in Indonesia, allowing for a more transparent and democratic process. This will allow Indonesian civil society time and information to scrutinize the agreements. TNI&#x2019;s partner, with technical support from TNI, challenged the previous practice of the President approving international trade and investment agreements in the constitutional court.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">(1) The Argentinian Government introduced and implemented a policy of consultations on the EU-Mercosur FTA with the sectors involved, including CSOs, which provided an opening for advocacy on the FTA which affects LLMIC Paraguay. This has demonstrated a policy shift for the Argentinian Government on consultation with CSOs in relation to FTAs.

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">1 In November, the Indonesian Constitutional Court ruled that all international trade and investment agreements will need to be reviewed by the Indonesian Parliament before ratification. This will increase transparency and deepen democratic decision making on trade policy. TNI&#x2019;s Indonesian partner, with technical support from TNI, challenged the previous practice of the President approving international trade and investment agreements in the constitutional court. 2 The Dutch Government announced the new model Bilateral Investment Treaty (BIT) will be reviewed by the Dutch Parliament. This will allow for deepening of democratic decision making in trade policy. The new model BIT will be the basis for any new investment treaties the Dutch Government will negotiate with other countries including with LLMICs. TNI, with other FGG alliance members and partners, published 2 reports on the model BIT.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">2 EU FTAs increase level of transparency; 2 Southern governments will start dialogue with CSOs on EU-FTAs; Dutch government started dialogue with CSOs on trade agenda. These changes are a result of an increasing critique on IIAs/ISDS and the lack of transparency in negotiations. TNI has been a key voice in the strong and concerted civil society effort working on this, not just in the Netherlands but also at EU level and in Southern countries, with networks and allies. TNI&apos;s exposure of the abuse of different treaties and lack of transparency has contributed to the critique</narrative>
