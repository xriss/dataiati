   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The proposed project (the Project) supports the development of the health insurance sector in Eastern Europe and Central Asia through: (i) strengthening the capital structure of a regional health insurance player Archimedes Global Ltd. (AGL or the Company); and (ii) supporting AGLs growth throughout the region.  The Project fits well with the IFCs strategy to support insurance companies that have a regional strategy and approach rather than a country level focus; so that markets benefit from economies of scale and replication of best practices.  IFC strategy in healthcare is focused on: (i) direct investments in centers of excellence and networks of clinics; and (ii) wholesale facilities in conjunction with CGF targeting healthcare SMEs. Development of private health insurance is conducive to the growth of private healthcare provision and to better quality, transparency and efficiency of healthcare.   AGLs business strategy is to acquire and/or partner with local players in markets with underdeveloped private health insurance sector (predominantly, in Southern and Southeastern Europe and in former Soviet Union) to capitalize markets growth potential. The Company may invest in greenfield operations in promising markets where no acquisition targets can be identified. AGL is currently active in three countries (Greece, Kazakhstan and Georgia) and requires new capital to:  (i) grow its existing operations and to comply with capital requirements; and (ii) continue acquiring targets in the region.   IFCs investment case is based on the following: (i) Equity upside due to geographic expansion plans to enter health insurance market in Bulgaria, Ukraine and Turkey within the next 12-18 months; (ii) Integrated business model: AGL owns an outpatient clinic in Kazakhstan which allows it to deliver a better-quality health care and control costs at the same time. AGL plans to build a second clinic in Kazakhstan and to replicate this model in other countries. In addition to supporting its core health insurance operations AGL plans to capitalize on expected growth of private health care provision in these markets; (iii) pro-active and professional approach to managing access to care and medical facilities and controlling costs of necessary services and treatment; (iv) strong and committed sponsors; and (v) high developmental impact. Health insurance is a highly developmental sector and one that has been difficult to find viable opportunities for IFC to support</narrative>
