   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project consists of an IFC investment of up to EUR21 million for the capitalization of CRG Capital LLC (CRG) and the acquisition of distressed and other special situation assets in Central and Eastern Europe.  The components of the proposed investment comprise:      - up to EUR1 million equity investment for up to a 19.9% stake in CRG, a holding company for underwriting/servicing of distressed assets in the emerging markets; and    - the remainder of approximately EUR20 million for the acquisition of distressed assets to be held in CRG Capital CEE Special Situations Fund I L.P., the main investment vehicle.  CRGs investment focus will be on distressed, underperforming, and special situation assets.

CRG will seek to invest primarily in middle-market companies. CRG will focus in situations with  financial losses, underperformers not meeting expectations, divestment of non-core assets with restructuring potential, highly leveraged companies with liquidity problems, bankruptcies, forced sales and liquidations, shareholders disputes, end-of-life and non-performing private equity funds, and unsuccessful mergers and expansions.</narrative>
