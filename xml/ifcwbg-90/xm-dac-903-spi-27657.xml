   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Lydian International Limiteds (Lydian or the Company) is a junior mining company focused on exploration projects in Eastern Europe and Central Asia. Lydian currently holds licenses for the Amulsar exploration stage property in Armenia and the Drazhnje and Crepulje exploration stage properties in Kosovo. Amulsar is located in central Armenia, approximately 120km south of Yerevan. Drazhnje is located in north-eastern Kosovo, approximately 35km north-east of Pristina. Crepulje is located in north-western Kosovo, approximately 17km west of Mitrovica. Amulsar is a new discovery whereas the Crepulje and Drazhnje projects were previously explored during Yugoslav times. Current and planned future exploration activities mainly comprise continued surface drilling at Amulsar and Crepulje and the opening up and rehabilitation for mapping, sampling and drilling purposes of already existing underground exploration development at Drazhnje. The proposed additional investment by IFC will primarily fund the Company&apos;&apos;s activities in Armenia.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The proposed IFC investment will contribute to continued exploration and associated feasibility studies for the companys main assets. The direct development impacts during the exploration and feasibility study stage are expected to be small. Because the investment predates any feasibility studies, it is not yet possible to fully quantify or specify the potential development impacts during production stage. Potential development impacts at the mine production stage could include employment, foreign currency generating exports, and taxes and royalties at the federal, regional and local levels.</narrative>
