   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The European Fund for Southeast Europe (&quot;EFSE&quot;, or the &quot;Fund&quot;), promoted by KfW, is a collective debt investment vehicle that channels long term resources for housing finance and on-lending to micro-and-small businesses through banks, specialized microfinance institutions and viable microfinance non-profit organizations. IFC was one of the cornerstone investors at the Funds first closing and has supported the Fund via several rights issues throughout the years.</narrative>

  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The key development objective of this proposed project is to increase financial inclusion in the Fund&apos;&apos;s target countries, with increased focus on providing access to finance for micro and small borrowers. Such micro and small financing would be tracked by the outreach of the envisaged target Partner Lending Institution (&quot;PLI&quot;) groups, by sectors, by number of sub-loans and by their average size.  The proposed project is also expected to create a demonstration effect for other investors to promote their finance to MSE&apos;&apos;s across the target countries.  Despite the severity of the financial crisis, EFSE has remained an active lender in the MSE segment and has continued to support a large number of institutions in its mandated region.</narrative>
