As a rule of thumb, before starting any activity at district or community level, involvement and participation of community leaders and government is key. Community consultations were therefore done prior to implementation of project activities in order to get their involvement, participation and support. Project beneficiaries were also informed about different types of feedback mechanisms available for their use, before starting any activity. During the life of the project 3 complaints were received and recorded through the Linha Verde (toll-free hotline) platform, regarding water supply challenges in the resettlement camp. This resulted in the field team moving-in quickly to resolve the problem.

Before any distribution or activity FH first consults and meets with the community leadership to inform about the planned activity and who are the beneficiaries and deliverables. FH also informs the leadership about the different feedback/complaint mechanisms available for their use. In each community, the leadership is comprised of one community leader, one church leader, chief of four houses and Government representative and 50% are women. On beneficiary registration, FH received the lists from the Government and verify to confirm that those on the list are the right ones to benefit.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">FH has been supporting communities providing water through water purification systems installed in Schools, communities and resettlement camp and also through water points rehabilitated. In total FH rehabilitated 17 water points, 5 in Nhamatanda, 2 in Beira and 10 in Dondo.

In the beginning FH provided trucked water for domestic use at the IDP camps. With the support of Water Mission FH was able to install improved technology water purification systems in four communities (two in Savane resettlement camp and two schools) and also drilled a borehole and installed an electric pump to sustain the system which is more efficient and guarantees water with good quality over a long period in all the sites.</narrative>

In total FH rehabilitated 17 water points, 5 in Nhamatanda, 2 in Beira and 10 in Dondo.

In the beginning FH provided trucked water for domestic use at the IDP camps. With the support of Water Mission FH was able to install improved technology water purification systems in four communities (two in Savane resettlement camp and two schools) and also drilled a borehole and installed an electric pump to sustain the system which is more efficient and guarantees water with good quality over a long period in all the sites.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">Same beneficiaries who received NFIs and water supply intervention.

32 water and sanitation committes were formed in all the sites that project did some water point rehabilitations and intallations of water systems. The project managed to provide IEC material to bring awareness to communities on hygiene and sanitation promotion. Information on hygiene promotion was also provided during distributions of hygiene and dignity kits. Door to door campaigns were also conducted through water and sanitation committees.</narrative>
