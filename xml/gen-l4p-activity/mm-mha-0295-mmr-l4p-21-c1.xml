       <narrative xml:lang="EN">This activity had been remarkedly achieved especially in lobbying and advocacy to restore democracy and human rights in Myanmar. CSOs, both in-country and those who had to flee to work in exile, have been collaborating and coordinating in resisting the military rule and engaged actively in promoting  federal democracy. The formation of the Women Advocacy Coalition-WAC and its active engagement with international community, specifically the United Nations agencies, UN Committees such as CEDAW and UPR, European Union, Special Advocacy Council for Myanmar (SAC-M), etc. SAC-M was formed after the military coup in February 2021, to provide an international platform for the democratic movement in Myanmar, to ensure their voices are heard by key decision-maker at this critical time. Information about international advocacy events  organized or participated with leadership of GEN Director, May Sabe Phyu  and the statements are  attached as Annex 6. International Advocacy Events participated by GEN in 2021.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">Capacity building of female peace ambassadors did not take place. Once the formal peace process is revived, peace ambassadors and CSOs are expected to advocate for meaningful participation of women in peace process, engage in joint advocacy agenda on restoration of democracy, human rights, gender sensitive policies , procedures and practices in formal or informal peace structures. 
In 2021, GEN tried its best to cope with the situation, and submitted revised activities and budget to NIMD. After securing approval from NIMD, GEN implemented its revised activities. As part of achieving this targeted result, GEN could contribute in development of Myanmar Country Paper on Pillars for Peace as seen in Annex 3. The paper could capture previous good practices and lessons learnt on women involvement in peace processes, conflict resolution and mediation in Myanmar. This paper will serve as a good foundation/document that is very helpful in future GEN&#x2019;s efforts in attaining agreements as a result of dialogue plaform meeting.</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">Supportive policy environment for women&#x2019;s rights and political participation in peacebuilding (LTO2)

Programme contribute to this LTO by working through 2 pathways:

Pathway 3: Collaboration for better policies
and
Pathway 4: Lobbying &amp; Advocacy (L&amp;A) for implementation of UNSCR 1325 and SDG 5

Pathway 3: Collaboration for better policies

For women to participate meaningfully to sustaining peace, the policy environment must
support, respect and protect their rights, participation and representation. In Burundi,
Colombia and Myanmar, existing post-conflict legislative frameworks already provide some
guarantee of women&#x2019;s participation, on paper. However, implementation lags behind. Mutual
trust and dialogue are necessary ingredients in order to put these frameworks into practice,
and to improve them based on international best practice. For this to materialize, political
actors need to agree on minimum criteria and benchmarks, and collectively move forward on
these issues.

The Intermediate Outcomes (IOs) in this pathway, which contribute to LTO2 are:
Political parties develop joint gender-equality agendas (IO.3.1)
Political actors jointly advocate for the implementation of gender-equality legislation (IO.3.2)
Political actors collaborate for better policies (IO.3.3)

The programme aims to achieve these outcomes through the following set of intervention
strategies:

Interparty dialogue platforms/women caucuses
Existing dialogue platforms in all three countries will facilitate the development of interparty
agendas on women&#x2019;s participation in political and peace-making processes.
INSPIRED-method based multi-stakeholder dialogue
Through the INSPIRED methodology NIMD facilitates multi-stakeholder dialogue between
civil society and political actors in emerging democracies and post-conflict settings.
Peer learning and knowledge exchange across countries
Exposure of key duty-bearers and political actors to environments with good practices related
to women&#x2019;s rights and inclusion is a proven way to enhance understanding of, and openness
to, changes in domestic policy on gender issues.

Pathway 4: Lobbying &amp; Advocacy (L&amp;A) for implementation of UNSCR 1325 and SDG 5

At a time when the civic space to advocate towards governments is rapidly shrinking, CSOs
must work together and push back against this trend in a concerted lobbying and advocacy
effort. The Consortium will, therefore, engage in mutual capacity strengthening, and align with
like-minded women&#x2019;s organizations and CSOs in all three countries. The exact nature of the
CSOs&#x2019; lobby agendas will depend on the country context and available civic space.

Strengthening CSOs&#x2019; capacities is a pivotal enabler to reach LT02. While in-country CSO
alliances can function as important pressure points to change incentive structures, political
actors need to take the agendas of CSOs into account and reflect them in policy and practice.
Therefore, LEAP4Peace will also engage with political actors to stimulate their commitment to
the WPS agenda. Advocacy initiatives can help put positive pressure on national decisionmakers,
by connecting local- and national-level actors to international feminist agendas,
regional and international bodies, and women&#x2019;s rights networks. Therefore, the Consortium
will use its existing outreach and networks to promote women&#x2019;s participation in
peacebuilding. This outreach is based on both the experience in three countries in the
programme, and on international good practice and experience of Consortium Partners. This
Pathway aligns closely to the international frameworks and agreements around National
Action Plans and the fulfilment of UNSCR 1325, and SDG 5.

The Intermediate Outcomes (IOs) in this pathway, which contribute to LTO2 are:
Strengthened like-minded CSOs align for joint advocacy agenda (IO.4.1)
CSOs effectively monitor and lobby for policy change and implementation (IO.4.2)
International lobby and advocacy for supportive international and national policy environments (IO.4.3)

And the intervention strategies are:
CSO capacity-building assessment and strategy
We will build on our existing monitoring and evaluation tool that measures CSO performance,
based on the Five Capabilities model, and enables them to acknowledge their strengths and
weaknesses, and implement strategies for capacity improvement.
The &#x2018;10 Steps&#x2019; and &#x2018;Beyond Consultation&#x2019; L&amp;A tools
These GAPS tools helps governments and duty-bearers to get commitments on WPS and put
them into action.
Gender Policy Analysis tool
This tool, developed by GEN, analyses legal and policy documents in Myanmar and compares
them against international gender standards. This tool will be used also in the other countries.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">The military coup on 1 February 2021,  led to mass civil movements to demand the return of the civilian democratic government, thousands of civilians, including women and girls across the entire country faced assaults, arbitrary arrests and detention. The country is now challenged by nationwide armed conflict, and women can be seen at the forefront to lead in the pro-democracy protests whilst the national reconciliation peace process led by former democratic government is ruined by military coup. The structures of the peace process are still unknown but a new structure is expected to be set-up. Therefore, expected target may be reached when the new peace structure is set and functioning and when dialogue platforms and meetings can take place in next years.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">The current political and policy environment is not conducive to undertake the planned activities for this outcome, but GEN actually implemented the activities that are well-adapted to current situation. After military coup in February, GEN could lead in organizing networks/organizations of local women, and formed Women Advocacy Coalition in Myanmar (WAC-Myanmar), and conducted international advocacy activities as WAC-Myanmar.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">Women peace ambassadors cannot be identified and trained in 2021 due to military coup. To formulate the best ways to carry out this initiative in post-coup setting, GEN needed to assess current political risks and to seek modes of risk mitigation for staff and members of the network. The report explores consensus and standpoint of GEN&#x2019;s members in current situation, and identified priority initiatives of GEN in upcoming years. See Annex 5. GEN Risk Assessment.</narrative>
