    <narrative xml:lang="EN">U.S.-Moroccan relations remain strong and our cooperation continues to expand. Morocco welcomes active U.S. cooperation in the political, security, economic, and cultural spheres. While current security concerns include the impact of regional instability on Morocco, Morocco is supportive of U.S. policy priorities globally and serves as a host and leader for many regional cooperation activities and events. On the domestic political scene, Morocco continues to pursue democratic and economic reforms.However, the pace and scope of Morocco&apos;s economic reforms remain uneven. Although inflation remains relatively low and growth rates hover near four percent, Morocco&apos;s economic situation is complicated by continued low growth in Europe, its main trading partner; an oversized public sector; significant youth unemployment; persistent issues with the quality of education; and broad subsidies for food and fuel. To address these issues, U.S. bilateral assistance will support economic growth and youth employability, educational advancements, robust civil society institutions, and stronger security institutions.</narrative>
