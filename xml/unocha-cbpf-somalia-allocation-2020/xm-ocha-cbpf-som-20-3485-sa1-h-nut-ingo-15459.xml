   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Integrated Health and Nutrition services through support for fixed facilities and mobile outreach through the Integrated Emergency Response Teams (IERTs)</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The proposed project has been developed in line with the Somalia Humanitarian Response Plan (HRP) and the health and nutrition cluster strategic objectives of providing integrated lifesaving health and nutrition services for the cluster priority districts in Nugaal regions i.e. Garowe districts. It is also contributing to the cluster priority of filling critical gaps in health care services for populations facing high incidence of malnutrition and service gaps.
The project has also been designed with full awareness of the prevailing gender norms and deeply rooted gender inequalities in Somalia that limit women and girls from accessing basic services such as health and nutrition, and expose them to a higher risk of GBV. In order to address these challenges, Save the Children will identify and work to remove the physical, cognitive and social barriers by collaborating closely with the communities and particularly the influencers and gatekeepers. We will also address the intersectionality of vulnerability factors, for example women with disabilities or from minor clans who are likely to face multiple levels of discrimination.
The project will contribute to improving equitable access to quality life-saving curative and preventative health and nutrition services through the support of static health facilities complemented by mobile outreach services. There will be one integrated health and nutrition mobile team in Garowe district. The integrated health and nutrition mobile team will provide outpatient consultations, routine immunizations, maternal healthcare, disease surveillance and health promotion as well as systematic identi&#xFB01;cation, referral and treatment of acutely malnourished cases by providing integrated nutrition services to out-patient therapeutic programme (OTP), Targeted Supplementary Feeding Program (TSFP) and stabilization centers. The provision of OTP services for those with Severe Acute Malnutrition (SAM) and the referral and treatment of SAM cases with medical complications to the nearest stabilization centre. Micronutrient supplementation, promotion of Infant and Young Child Feeding (IYCF) practices, promotion of adoption of good hygiene and sanitation practices will be done, providing treatment for all age groups, both male and female. The health and nutrition interventions will improve early identification and prevention of malnutrition, and access to primary health care, and therefore reduce excess morbidity and mortality. As part of gender and social norms transformation we will ensure that the activities include positive messaging for men in their roles as fathers. Women and girls will be seen by health practitioners of the same sex and consultations and documentation will be kept confidential.
Save the Children (SC) will support nine fixed facilities in the following locations Waabari MCH, Gabmbool MCH, Gargar MCH, Jilab MCH, Barwaaqo MCH,Bahnano 1 MCH, Bahnano 2 MCH, Hanano MCH and Awrculus MCH    with integrated health and nutrition services in addition to the mobile and iCCM services. SC will carry out regular safety audits of the facilities to identify and mitigate the risks faced by women and girls in accessing services and resources.
We would like to note that Save the Children is working closely with partners to monitor and respond to the ongoing COVID 19 pandemic and will plan to modify and adapt programme activities according to the emerging situation if necessary. Save the Children will be considering the four following dimensions and is currently developing plans for staff health, business continuity, programme preparedness and programme response.</narrative>
