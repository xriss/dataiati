The integrated response package that constitutes CCCM, Protection, Shelter, NFIs and WASH will prioritize and meet the needs of the most vulnerable IDPs that are in need of support and not currently receiving similar assistance from other humanitarian actors. In addition, the project will complement WRRS&#x2019;s emergency humanitarian efforts in the targeted area on addressing the identified needs.

The protection activities are designed to enhance community based protection mechanisms through establishing community protection committees, documenting and monitoring of protection concerns as well providing timely, safe protection responses to the needy people.
