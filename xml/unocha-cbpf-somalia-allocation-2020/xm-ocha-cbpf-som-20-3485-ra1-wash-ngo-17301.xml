The floods have displaced in Wanlaweyn alone more than 82,000 people, inundated homes, wells and schools and destroyed large swathes of farmland and crops The heavy deyr rains ave caused massive population displacement, damaged housing, property, infrastructure and farm lands in riverine areas in southern Somalia. WASH Cluster has reported critical gaps in Balcad, Marka and Wanlaweyn where no WASH assistance has been received despite high risk levels for AWD.
The main aim of this project is to provide lifesaving WASH services to most vulnerable and underserved communities living in floods affected areas in Wanlaweyn district of Lower Shabelle Region. A total of 17,000 flood affected men, women and children including the disabilities, marginalized communities and IDPs will benefit safe drinking water and will have access equally throughout the project period.
