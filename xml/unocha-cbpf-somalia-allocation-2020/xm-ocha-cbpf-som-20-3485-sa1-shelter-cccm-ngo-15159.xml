   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In close coordination with NRC and DRC, AVORD has developed this proposal with the aim of delivering a holistic, integrated response to provide life-saving services to vulnerable communities in Xudur. As elaborated in the attached teaming agreement, AVORD will take lead in the provision of Non-Food Items, emergency shelters and CCCM services in Xudur while DRC and NRC will undertake complementary WASH and Protection activities respectively. Tentative implementation arrangements have been endorsed by the three agencies with a commitment to coordinate closely and target a similar target group, hence maximizing impact and efficiency of this response.

Under the present proposal, AVORD will distribute NFIs on-Food Items (NFIs) to 4,700 IDP and host community households (estimated 28,200 persons) who live in extremely poor shelter conditions. The target group include 6,768 men, 9,024 women, 3,384 boys and 3,384 girls from the IDP community and 1,692 men, 2,256 women, 846 boys and 846 girls from host communities. Of the target group, an estimated 846 men, 1,128 women, 423 boys and 423 girls will be targeted based on disability. Each registered household will be provided with 1 NFI kit comprising of 1 Plastic Sheet, 3 Blankets, 2 Sleeping Mats, 1 Kitchen Set, 1 Mosquito Net, 1 Solar Lamp and 2 Jerry Cans with the capacity of 10 Liters each. In addition to NFIs, emergency shelters will be constructed for 250 newly arrived IDPs and those living in the open. In the construction of these shelters, the project team will ensure adequate separation between individual household shelters and that pathways exist to provide all-weather access to individual dwellings and facilities. AVORD will closely coordinate with district officials and relevant line ministries at state and national levels to secure land tenure for a minimum of 3 years. The number of emergency shelters to be constructed under this project has been limited to 250 since the majority of IDPs reside in private land, making it difficult to secure enough space for the construction of a large number of shelters. However, it is anticipated that IDPs will be able to use the plastic sheets that will provided as part of the NFI kit to repair damages to their current shelters.

With regards to CCCM, AVORD will setup and strengthen camp governance structures where necessary to enhance information-sharing and trigger system-wide coordination among service providers. Key program activities also include construction of 2 culturally-appropriate multi-purpose social halls to provide space for improved coordination and effective management of sites. Periodic service mapping, site monitoring and safety audits will be undertaken in close coordination with NRC, DRC, the CCCM cluster and other humanitarian partners in the area to effectively address existing gaps and maximize efficiency of the humanitarian response. Site maintenance committees in target settlements will be equipped with a range of site maintenance tools and supplies before engaging in cash-for-work schemes through which community-led site upkeep and maintenance activities will be carried out.

AVORD will adapt systematic approach to beneficiary selection with a clear criterion to prioritize the marginalized, single headed-households, large families and/or families with children under the age of 5, women at risk as identified by protection officers and those with special needs. Data collected to inform beneficiary selection will be segregated by gender to ensure that no group is left-out. List of beneficiaries along with their contact numbers will be availed to SHF and other actors responding in the area to avoid overlap. The effectiveness of the aid package will be ascertained through Post Distribution Monitoring exercise thus ensuring that beneficiaries access their services safely and in a dignified manner. An elaborate feedback and complain mechanism will be setup to ensure accountability to the affected population.</narrative>
