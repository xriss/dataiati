  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">According to FSNAU Post Deyr 2019/2020 technical assessment, the overall health, food security and nutrition needs remain significant within most parts of Somalia with an estimated 43% of rural Nugal and Burtinle population in urgent need of humanitarian assistance (73,433 people, among them 2,073 in emergency, 21,350 in crisis and 50,010  being stressed. Nugaal region has consistently reported poor maternal amp child health and nutrition indicators ridden by high child and maternal morbidity rates, crude mortality rates and under 5 mortality rates. In December 2019, EPHS project that supported health and nutrition intervention in Nugaal came to a close. This left ta gap in health and nutrition in Nugaal. The Proposed project  will therefore bridge the major essential health care service gap that currently exists in Burtinle following the close out of the EPHS Project. The  project will  address the identified gaps in nutrition and health, enhancing access to integrated basic health and nutrition care services within their localities aimed at improving the physical and mental well-being of boys, girls, men and women in the targeted locations.  These specific needs have been outlined in the HNO, HRP and FSNAU and MOH gaps identified in the targeted locations. The proposed project is geared towards reducing the vulnerability of the beneficiaries and communities. World Vision Somalia (WV Som)  will work  with MOH to address the health and nutrition gaps identified. The services will be both preventive and curative targeting vulnerable men, women, boys, girls and persons living with physical disabilities in the 2 targeted districts. 1 Mobile and outreach implementation models will be adopted to address the unique needs of vulnerable beneficiaries in remote and geographically isolated populations in  Burtinle district.  Screening for malnutrition will be carried out and children with SAM will be treated in OTP sites. Children with MAM will be  registered through SCOPE to access  TSFP that is supported by WFP. Children diagnosed with severe acute malnutrition (SAM) with medical complication will be referred to the  SCs that World Vision propose to support in Burtinle  district.  At each of the 4  MCHs, WVI shall establish basic reproductive health care services aligned within the MISP framework, utilizing the ambulances to refer mothers with complications from the MCHs and PHUs to the hospitals. At each PHU WV shall build the capacity of the community midwives to provide basic reproductive health care services in remote hard to reach areas as a mitigation measure against preventable maternal morbidity and mortality. While engaging community volunteers, WV shall adopt Timed and targeted counselling (TTC) approach focusing on pre conception to the first 1000 days of a child&#x2019;s life also incorporating the Finish baby kit and Fortified rice and lentils (Vitameal) as a motivator for adoption of promoted health seeking practices among WCBA through enhancing access to Reproductive health care services, child health including Immunization ,IYCF and hygiene promotion care and care-giver led MUAC screening and referral . At 4 targeted MCHs and PHUs WV has an already established GBV care system with personnel already trained and necessary CMR supplies in place to respond to GBV cases.  World Vision will ensure that beneficiaries visiting the targeted facilities including beneficiaries served at the mobile sites access a comprehensive basic package of services .Towards health and nutrition promotion, World Vision will focus on NHHP, care-giver led MUAC screening that will be done at the project sites with the nutrition beneficiaries is linked with the food security and safety net interventions to enhance household food basket.</narrative>
