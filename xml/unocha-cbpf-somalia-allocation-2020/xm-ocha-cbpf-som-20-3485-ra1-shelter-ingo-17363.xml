  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project will focus on improving the physical protection and dignity of IDPs in Belet Weyne in Hiraan region through the provision of locally purchased Non-Food Items (NFIs) and Emergency Shelter Kits (ESKs) by cash/voucher modalities and settlement re-planning training, to reduce congestion, overcrowding and provide dignified living to beneficiaries. In order to reduce congestion and overcrowding, NRC will engage local community leaders to select beneficiaries in the affected areas and after selection use an electronic mobile data collection tool called &apos;Kobo Tool box&apos; to register all targeted beneficiaries, 20% of the selected beneficiaries will be poor host community members in line with &apos;Do No Harm&apos; principals. Similarly, 15% of the targeted person will be those with disabilities (PWDs) will also be selected from the targeted areas. Beneficiaries will be provided with cash ($100 per each HH in single installment) for NFIs while $145 (80% or $116 as the first installment and remaining 20% or $29 as the second installment) per HH will be provided for Emergency Shelter Kits. In order to enable a holistic response and deliver greater impact, each household will benefit from both the NFIs and ESKs provision. NRC will acquire the services of local telecom company Hormuud Telecom for the cash transfers and with this adhere to strict beneficiary verification protocols which in this case will also include beneficiary verification by the service provider through their mobile Identities before disbursement of the cash. This beneficiary list will include the names of the selected beneficiaries, mobile number, token numbers, location of residence and gender. It is only upon verification of the beneficiary details as submitted by NRC that the service provider shall disburse. Beneficiaries whose personal details are not approved will go through a second round of verification process. 

80% of the targeted beneficiaries will be IDPS while 20% will be host community members . A predetermined beneficiary selection criteria that considers the needs of Extremely Vulnerable Individuals (EVIs) including female and single-headed HHs, orphans, chronically ill, aged and child-headed households will be applied . These criteria will be refined further and agreed upon with community leaders at inception to ensure that only those that are in real need receive aid. Gender will be mainstreamed at each and every stage of the action with specific attention given to the multiple and diversified needs of women, men, boys and girls. The project is designed to ensure that all potential beneficiaries in the location of action have equal opportunity to access resources and training through the complete application of a rights and needs only based approach. Monitoring and evaluation of all components will be informed by refined and easy to use M and E tools that disaggregate data according to age, gender and diversity. This action shall deliver urgent humanitarian flood response assistance in the form of cash for NFIs and ESKs to 1,350 HHs (8,100 individuals) in district Belet Weyne.

To ensure that the assistance provided is used for intended purposes, NRC s will coordinate all components of this action with the community to ensure thorough sensitization and beneficiary participation  for individuals and the community at large .A Post Distribution Monitoring (PDM) exercise will be conducted after 6 weeks of NFIs and ESKs distribution to determine use of cash and while also assess the impact of the response, generate and document lessons learned for dissemination to multiple stakeholders.</narrative>
