  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Palestinian Youth Leadership Training Project-Phase II seeks to identify motivate and cultivate young Palestinian leaders to become more informed engaged and proactive citizens since the youth are among the most marginalized groups in the Palestinian s
ociety by empowering them to articulate and organize around significant civic issues through using the medium of culture. It also plans to build on the success of the first year and expand the outreach and network. The project will employ a 3-part approach
 which consists of the following: (1) Activating the potential of and developing the capacities of young future Palestinian leaders. The methods used to achieve this segment is (a) a series of intensive training workshops for 100 young men and women from d
ifferent areas in Palestine with emphasis on rural areas as they are considered among the most marginalized parts of Palestine on leadership culture and civil society issues. (b) internship training opportunities for 20 young people who participated during
 the first phase of the project in 2011 where their leadership organizational research and communication skills are further developed and cultivated. (2) Enhancing the civic and cultural understanding of the young people and helping to evolve their involve
ment in and appreciation of the importance of civil society and culture in Palestine. The method used to fulfill this particular part of the approach is by holding 4 national seminars organized by and for the youth where significant issues and cultural fig
ures and role models are highlighted discussed and debated. (3) Strengthening the young people?s consciousness of the past and heritage and increasing their sense of ownership of their history and culture as this is fundamental to the formation and evolvem
ent of a dynamic and inclusive identity. This section will be focusing on developing 2 cultural resources with the help of the trained youth which include re-discovered Palestinian cultural figures and heritage.</narrative>
