   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The proposed project aims to demonstrate sustainable models for fostering responsible entrepreneurship education and job skills training as tools to providing economic opportunities to poor and marginalized community members. It will focus mainly on women 
and youth inclusion in local economies within the governorate of New Valley.The New Valley governorate has in total three fertile oases but agricultural activities are very underdeveloped in the whole region as small-scale farmers lack know how and access 
to finance and markets.   The governorate is known for its high unemployment rate and thus for its high migration rates of young men to the Nile delta and big cities to find jobs.Hence the project aims to build on the business and marketing capacity of sma
ll self-employed farmers and artisans enhancing a market driven value chain approach through adopting a coupling strategy to bond vocational training opportunities with business development in 4 vocations (organic agriculture methods and organic products s
pecialization organic composting dairy production carpet weaving and grid manufacturing). The project approach is based on establishing strong long-term sustainability and thus incorporates within its goals actions that underpin managerial technical financ
ial and social sustainability while providing the labor force with the necessary tools to advocate to the local government. To ensure sustainability beyond the lifetime of the Finnish-funded project the project has been done in cooperation with the local C
DAs which will be called upon to answer to the issues addressed by the farmer and artisan community members and with information sharing and collaboration with the Ministry of Agriculture and local governments.</narrative>
