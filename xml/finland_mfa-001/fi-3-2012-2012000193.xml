   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project is providing learning opportunities for children with low social background who have  limited resources in the greater Mexico City area through setting up computer learning environment  so they can better exercise and enjoy their right to educ
ation as described in the Convention of the Rights of the Child in articles 28 and 29.Mexico&apos;s biggest social problem is the large inequality in income distribution. Mexico&apos;s economy has grown diversified and has modernized but only a small proportion of i
ts people may benefit from this. From a population of over 112 million more than 40 million live in poverty and of those over 11 million in extreme poverty while only a small elite is getting richer. Internet and information technology reaches only those w
ho can afford it 30% of the population. The project promotes the UN Millennium Development Goal # 8 allowing the benefits of information technology to be available for socially excluded children. The project focuses on the children&apos;s right to equal access 
to education. This is the long-range goal of the project. The project will open the e-learning solutions to give new opportunities to progress in life to easily excluded groups especially children disabled people and indigenous people. The project will set
 up computer labs using second hand computers donated by local companies and setting them up with the GNU / Linux operating system. The goal is to create easy to maintain and inexpensive computer lab models for poor children&apos;s homes and schools. The projec
t will have a positive impact on the situation of women and strives in all its sectors to improve the situation of gender equality self-esteem independence and improving job opportunities and income for the target groups. The project beneficiaries are: chi
ldren boys and girls workers of the children&apos;s homes and school teachers.  The number of beneficiaries: 4550. The project will use a multiplication method to ensure continuity. The first year two pilot classrooms at the Partner&apos;s facilities plus10 classroo
ms at other institutions the second year 20 more classrooms and on the third year 40 classrooms. A total of 70 computer classes. As the project develops this classroom concept it will be free to be copied and it is expected that we will have other actors i
n Mexico also working toward bridging the great digital divide and the number of beneficiaries will increase.</narrative>
