   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The goal in the project is to create local potential for sustainable fruit tree management. Planted trees will provide harvest in the end of the dry season when food is scarce. The effect of malnutrition is worst in the most vulnerable groups: amongst chil
dren elderly and sick. Vitamins and nutritients from fruits are important addition to dry season nutrition intake. Fruit trees will be planted in depleted farm lands which are otherwise out of use. This will lead to reforestation in areas where the tree co
ver is now very low. Productive fruit tree is such a valuable asset for a farmer that it won&apos;t be cut but in an emergency so the project will sustainably increase carbon sequestration in the trees of the area. The main method of action is planting cashew a
nd mango trees in villages that are capable of protecting the trees from fire and wandering animals. In our previous projects in the area we have reinforced fire control in 10 villages. From these 10 villages we will choose 500 beneficiary families or indi
viduals through applications. We will also construct a tree nursery for seedling production which we expect to cover it&apos;s operational costs in second or third year. The first batch of seedlings for planting in three first villages in the first year will be
 bought from nearby Burkina Faso as there is no tree nursery in the nearby area. Second year will see the project implementation in three to four other villages for which the seedlings will be supplied by tree nursery production. In the third year we expec
t the biggest trees will start to produce fruit. Also we will start the project in the remaining villages re-plant in places where dead trees have occurred and if tree seedling production allows also plant in new communities which are ready to take necessa
ry care of the trees.Main actions:1. Selecting beneficiaries that fulfill the requirements.2. Organizing trainings about nutritional benefits of fruit fruit tree care and fire control.3. Establishing a tree nursery.4. Organizing tree plantings.5. Providing
 supportive actions: securing planting of seedlings acquiring seedlings tools and necessities organizing monitoring of the project.The crosscutting objective of improving position of marginalized groups is one main goal of the project. Marginalized groups 
are most vulnerable to malnutrition so these groups also benefit most of the nutritional improvement.</narrative>
