   <narrative xml:lang="EN">&quot;Palestinian refugee population has no available mental health services in Lebanon. Beit Atfal Assumoud (BAS) started the mental health program: &quot;&quot;Family Guidance Center&quot;&quot; for children in 1997. So far there are five operational Centers in Lebanon. Signific
ant number of learning difficulties or developmental problems are found in major part of the children. Required specialized rehabilitation services are scarce more often too expensive for the families. The cases are often multidisciplinary since the child 
has several problems. Large scale professional efforts are required the rehabilitation efforts are enormous. BAS initiated a Sponsorship Program in 2009 in order to provide special education and rehabilitation services for children in need. BAS covers the 
expenses for the children. The profound ethical guideline in the project: Children with special needs have the right for decent human development and protection regardless of their condition as well as being refugees. The purpose of the project is:1) to se
cure places (36) in special schools institutions or individually tailored rehabilitation process for children and adolescents with multiple special needs referred by Family Guidance Centers of BAS2)  to arrange for parents and siblings meetings workshops a
nd recreational activities for rest recovery and peer support and encouraging them to advocacy and making proposals.3) promote access to special education and rehabilitation services and possibilities of BAS to enhance services in reduced price offered by 
specialised entities. Find out and define prerequisites needed for the special education and rehabilitation service delivery by BAS itself.The project develops more extensive service delivery system of special education and further rehabilitation for child
ren and adolescents with special needs and their families. The project is based on the Sponsorship Programme started already in 2009. There were &quot;&quot;rehabilitation sponsors&quot;&quot; for 20 children among them five from Finland in May 2012. 139 were on the waiting l
ist.BAS is for equality of genders against discrimination and acts for good environmental practices. BAS follows service statistics also by gender and nationality.&quot;</narrative>
