  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Vulnerability to global climate change especially poor rains that can hardly support production of exotic cereals especially if production is entirely dependent on rain fed system is becoming a perennial phenomenon in Sub Sahara Africa. Hunger continues to
 be a global tragedy. The Kenyan economy has and is still largely dependent on agriculture. The high cost production system and reliance on rain fed agriculture in the face of global climate change has therefore to change and give way to a different approa
ch in agriculture to guarantee sustainable food production by embracing low external input for sustainable agriculture. This implies that to achieve food security a change of strategy is imperative. The options available range from introducing irrigation s
ystems using improved seed varieties that can both tolerate moisture stress and withstand pest menace as well as promote production of traditional food crops that withstand moisture stress and other adverse conditions. The project will promote traditional 
crops by not only providing the technology ?seed? and extension services but capacitating farmers to the level that they have solid structures such as farmers marketing federation. The project will intensify production of traditional drought tolerant food 
crops with an agribusiness perspective to augment food security efforts in the country.Project Goal:  to contribute significantly to attain the objects of Millennium Development Goal number one by alleviating the suffering of the food insecure communities 
in Gilgil District by promoting the production of traditional crops as a sustainable means of meeting increasing demand for food while improving farmers? incomes through sustainable agricultural production. Project objectives:1. increase traditional food c
rops production by increasing acreage under this crops by 600 acres at end of three years2. inject an agribusiness approach to farming among the groups targeted with a view of making them competitive in the market place by providing training on agribusines
s3. to link and network the target farmers federations to markets and other agencies</narrative>
