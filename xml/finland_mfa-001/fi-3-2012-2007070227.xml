   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Regional Community Development Training Programme. The Regional Community Development Training Programme, which consolidates several individual community projects in different parts of India, seeks to motivate and train local partners for effective communi
ty work of their own. That is, to independently develop those local communities in which they work. The partners of Fida around India are mainly large local churches, but also a group of volunteers is involved. The on-going training programme is a direct r
esult of the partners? own call for assistance and support to help them to independently do community development work. One indicator of the programme?s success is the excellent team spirit that exists between the partners at all levels. Through this progr
amme the partners gain professional know-how and tools for implementing community development projects as well as training at various levels. Special attention is paid to motivating the partners towards working with the most vulnerable and disadvantaged pe
ople groups within their society. As the partners? knowledge and skills in community development build up, they in turn can train their partnering communities in e.g. health and gender questions, micro enterprise know-how and environmental issues. This, ag
ain, will lead towards improvement in the social and economic status of the local people.</narrative>
