ber of inhabitants in Swaziland is approximately 1 020 000 and the population in the 4 regions altogether aproximately 800 000.The project aims at empowering already existing women&apos;s and youth groups (an average of 6 productive groups in each region amount
ing to 24 groups altogether) whose members live in vulnerable situations direct beneficiaries being altogether 400-500 persons. By the end of the project cycle their production quality is higher and marketing opprtunities better leading to higher income. T
he project also aims at enabling the target group to make better use of local food stuffs leading to better nutrition of their families.The immediate objective is to increase the target group&apos;s economic situation and physical well-being through increased k
nolwledge of good nutrition and increased marketing and quality mangement capacities leading to better income.These goals will be reached thorugh a training program where university staff (home economics and apparel design) further trains Home Economics ex

society and substance specific modules on production and marketing depending on the production area of each gourp) and collectiong information for final seminar and evaluation.The project takes into account all cross-cutting objectives of Finnish developme
nt cooperation: It increases gender equality and empowers women by organising training of women&apos;s rights and enabling them to raise their level of livelihood. It combats inequality by choosing women youth and disabled persons as beneficiary groups. It is a
