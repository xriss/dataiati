   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Implementation of Textile Covenant</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This proposal concerns the financing modality for the deployment and activities of the India Center Netherlands, Stop Child Labor Coalition (represented by Hivos), Solidaridad, UNICEF Netherlands and the FOUR PAWS Foundation for the implementation of the Dutch agreement for sustainable garment and textiles Covenant. This proposal has been developed in consultation with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, following the support facility for civil society organizations in the banking covenant.

The Dutch agreement for Sustainable Garment and Textile Covenant (AGT) is a very important instrument for the aforementioned organizations to work together with a large number of relevant parties to achieve structural improvements in working conditions, the environment and animal welfare in the production chains of garment and textiles. For all organizations this is not only in line with their current mandate and activities related to garment and textiles, but is also considered a great opportunity to implement this mandate.

The AGT entered into force on 4 July 2016. During the previous negotiation process, the parties found that a contribution is required for the work of participating civil society organizations in the implementation phase. This requires a great effort where no free resources are available. This funding concerns the deployment of the five above mentioned civil society organizations for the period from 1 January 2017 to 31 December 2017 with the explicit intention to extend them annually until the end date of the Covenant (which has been done for 2018).</narrative>
