   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Nepal was hit with a 7.8 magnitude earthquake on Saturday, April 25th. The epicenter was in the capital city, Kathmandu where there is a population of 3 million people. Giving Children Hope is collaborated with those on the ground to provide mosquito nets, solar panels, sleeping bags, and hygiene kits to those who have survived.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">We bought 200 sleeping bags, 200 mosquito nets, and solar panels to give away to those yet to receive aid after the April earthquake in the village of Mahadev Kharka. Once it was loaded on a truck the relief team headed out to a village that was only 70 kilometers (43 miles) away but on Nepali mountain roads it took close to five hours. When we finally arrived at Mahadev Kharka.

Distribution was held in an open field where the village leaders called out the names of those most in need first. It was amazing seeing people flood in from near and far, excited to meet us and thankful to receive the supplies. Each person was thrilled about a new sleeping bag and mosquito net. Winter is coming in Nepal and living in the mountains means it can get down to low temperatures. Keeping warm and safe is vital. Mosquito nets were requested to prevent the contraction of dengue fever, yellow fever, and various forms of encephalitis, including the West Nile virus, which are all transmitted through insect bites.
Mahadev Kharka has electricity but it&#x2019;s unpredictable which is why the two solar panels Giving Children Hope gave were a huge asset. Before we left it was already installed. The solar energy will power the communal kitchen as well as the church/town hall room.

After distribution we had the pleasure of walking from home to home hearing from the families about the living conditions they are living through right now. Since the earthquake, their homes are too dangerous to live in, forcing them to live in makeshift shelters out of tarps. There are two to three people living in each shelter. One gentleman said the rain has been difficult this monsoon season but the cold weather coming this winter is what they are worried about. It was humbling to see how resilient these people are living under the circumstances they are. One might be tempted to think uneducated farmers might be simple minded, but these people are truly brilliant at what they do. The man pictured had a canal system dug around his tent to drain the rain that would otherwise flood his tent.</narrative>
