  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">At one point, it was the richest country in Latin America, but now, Venezuela is experiencing a humanitarian crisis. With severe basic needs shortages, including food and medical supplies, it has become increasingly difficult for the people of Venezuela to receive sufficient nutrition and life saving medical assistance. A recent study shows that 75% of Venezuelans have lost 19 pounds due to the lack of food in the country.

With the help of collaborative partners and churches, Giving Children Hope is committed to providing lifesaving resources to the people of Venezuela regardless of the political challenges. These resources include food, clothing, and medical supplies and will be distributed to children, elderly, and indigenous groups in Venezuela.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">With the help of collaborative partners and churches, Giving Children Hope is committed to providing lifesaving resources to the people of Venezuela regardless of the political challenges. These resources include food, clothing, and medical supplies and will be distributed to children, elderly, and indigenous groups in Venezuela.

Giving Children Hope is providing food for 2 feeding programs in Venezuela over the next year. The hope is to see significant improvement in the health of the children as well as preventing deaths related to malnutrition. GCH has a food engineer and nutrition expert advising on the best food to send and how to implement it in the field. 

Additionally Giving Children Hope is providing medical supplies to equip underresourced hospitals and clinics. Patients also require nutrient-rich food to aid in recovery, or because they were admitted due to malnutrition. 

Finally Giving Children Hope is continually sending relief to those fleeing violence and hardship in Venezuela. Giving Children Hope is sending aid to Colombia, which is receiving the majority of refugees fleeing Venezuela,  to assist those crossing the border and fleeing to neighboring countries. Giving Children Hope is working with organizations who are housing, feeding, and providing necessary items to people who may have fled as they try to shape their new lives outside of their home country.</narrative>
