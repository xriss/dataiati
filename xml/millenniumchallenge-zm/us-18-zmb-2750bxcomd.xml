  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Zambia: This compact aims to address one of Zambia&apos;s most binding constraints to economic growth through infrastructure investment in Lusaka, the rapidly urbanizing capital. The compact will invest in water supply, sanitation and drainage infrastructure with the goal of decreasing the incidence and prevalence of water-related disease, productive days lost due to disease and time to collect water, cost of water and new sanitation, and business and residential flood losses. The compact will also support the Government of Zambia&apos;s ongoing water sector reform efforts by strengthening partner institutions. More than 1 million Zambians are expected to benefit from the compact.</narrative>
