   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This award strives to support the science and practice of food, feed, and fiber production (including forestry, wildlife, fisheries, aquaculture and floriculture) and its relationships to natural resources, processing, marketing, distribution, utilization (including nutrition), and trade. In addition, this award On August 24-28, 2015, The Center for Ticks and Tick-Borne Diseases hosted a Training Course on Participatory Surveillance in Animal Health on Lilongwe, Malawi, with APHIS support. The different characteristics of a surveillance system were discussed and examples given. The participants explained the reporting system for animal disease events in Malawi. Reporting from the farmer to the central level can take place in a few hours thanks to the use of mobile phones. Participants from the Democratic Republic of Congo, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, and Zambia also contributed on the discussion and most of them also use the same reporting system as Malawi with only few differences. In addition to the Malawian reporting system, some countries have adopted the active and passive surveillance system to look for diseases. In addition to that, some countries, especially in the Southern part of Africa where commercial farming is highly practiced, each commercial farm has a private veterinarian or animal health technician who regularly visits the farm and collects disease surveillance data..</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">U.S. assistance in Malawi aims to overcome longstanding poverty and make Malawi a stronger, healthier, more democratic partner of the United States. More than one-half of the country&apos;s 17 million people live below the poverty line and more than one-third consume less than the required daily calories, contributing to the stunting of nearly one-half of children under-five years of age. Malawi continues to score poorly on major health indicators for maternal, infant, and under-five mortality. Eighty-five percent of households engage in agriculture activities and most rely almost exclusively on rain-fed subsistence farming that is particularly vulnerable to cyclical droughts. These challenges are compounded by threats from the highest rates of deforestation and population growth in the region. Only 50 percent of children complete primary school, and of those, only 68 percent successfully pass the exam to access public secondary school; only 15 percent of girls are enrolled in secondary school.</narrative>
