   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Addressing critical gaps in WASH, Shelter, Food Security and Protection assistance for displaced communities in Central Rakhine state.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The humanitarian situation in in Rakhine State continues to deteriorate since 2017 due to the different armed conflicts. A further escalation of hostilities between Arakan Army (AA) and Myanmar Armed Forces (MAF) occurred in March 2020. This caused a surge of displacement in Central Rakhine and created a further strain on security, access to livelihoods and the already limited aid provided by the aid agencies. The conflict affected IDPs are exposed to health risks due to crowded living conditions, inadequate shelter, insufficient income and nutrition and critical gaps in WASH resources. As Myanmar is among the most disaster-prone countries in the world with exposure to hazards such as monsoon flooding combined with the lack of government support and the prolonged displacement of the IDPs, makes an multi-sector support program for these IDPs in Central Rakhine a priority.

The proposed integrated project addresses the urgent WASH, Shelter, Protection and Food security needs of 20,355 vulnerable IDPs in Kyauktaw, Sittwe and Mrauk-U townships. The proposed project will built on the operational experience gained by the former MHF-funded PIN and CDN-ZOA projects as well as other projects in the area since 2010.
The proposed project aims to contribute substantially to the reduction of the immediate and life-threatening suffering of the population by ensuring that the physical and mental wellbeing of people affected by the conflict are improved. This will be achieved by providing durable solutions according SPHERE and other international standards while respecting the rights of the affected population.
.
The project is well aligned with the cluster strategic response plans and the priorities of the call by strengthening the resilience of communities and contributing to efforts to address vulnerabilities and underlying structural issues. It also aims to increase communities&#x2019; resilience for potential future shocks and to strengthen the NEXUS link between humanitarian action and longer-term development efforts. 

The project is designed with a conflict sensitive approach concerning IDPs and host population Specific vulnerable groups, such as female headed households, landless people and people with special needs, will be prioritized. The project will contribute significantly to gender equality and women&#x2019;s specific needs will be addressed to ensure equitable access to essential humanitarian services. For example, women will be targeted with the home-garden intervention, in which they learn how to grow nutritious foods while using environmental friendly methods. Gender balanced staff will be recruited, and women will be engaged in all consultations, and distributions. Gender and disability disaggregated MampE data will be collected for implementing barrier removing interventions and mother groups will be an important mechanism for training 

Duty of Care, Safeguarding and Do No Harm are crosscutting elements throughout all activities of the proposed intervention.  Disability inclusion is achieved in the Wash component were for instance special designed latrines will be constructed for physically challenged.The protection component safeguards to meaning full participation of all vulnerable people in all their diversity and will add to an secure environment. An cash based intervention is the basis of CDN-ZOA  shelter component which empowers the participants to make their own choices 

Beneficiaries and affected populations will be heavily engaged in implementation and monitoring of the project and a feedback/grievance procedures will be implemented. The developed MampE plan will ensure timely and quality data collection, with meaningful participation of beneficiaries. The indicators on Accountability to affected populations (AAP) will be used to check if resources are ethically and responsibly used. CDN-ZOA adheres to the Core Humanitarian Standards ZOA and is the first Dutch based organization to be awarded CHS certification</narrative>
