  <description>
   <narrative xml:lang="DA">Indigenous women are often in the frontline in terms of the impacts of a changing climate. Globally, the world is experiencing increasingly frequent droughts and floods which are having economic but also profound social consequences. Indigenous women of Latin America are particularly at risk because of their dependency on natural resources, and we lack a deeper understanding of their role in adaptation and mitigation to a changing climate. 

In 2014, for the first time in the history of the COP (Conference of the Parties of the UNFCCC), a communications and advocacy platform for indigenous peoples took place. The platform raised the concerns of indigenous peoples about their communities and forests to high-level decision makers.

One of the indigenous proposals for COP20 referred to women asking for the support to create a specific program for indigenous women, recognizing their strategic role in adapting to and mitigating the effects of climate change, and allowing them direct access to climate funds. Not much progress is expected to happen on this issue at COP21. Rather, COP22 is hoped to be an opportunity to bring back on the political agenda the practical solutions to climate change, as implementation of the COP21 agreement and previous agreements will require further negotiation. 

Furthermore, the studies and the policy proposal are hoped to become important inputs in the regional debate related to the Green Climate Fund (GCF) and national climate change adaptation and mitigation plans, and how these take local realities, particularly indigenous women, into consideration.</narrative>
