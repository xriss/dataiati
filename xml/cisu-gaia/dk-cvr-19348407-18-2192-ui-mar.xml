  <description>
   <narrative xml:lang="DA">The overall objective of the intervention in this final consolidation phase is to improve the oral and general health of school children and vulnerable families in Rwanda by promoting and integrating sustainable school-based health initiatives and community outreach activities. The knowledge and good results gathered from the previous project and in this proposed project will be used as a tool to advocate for a national action plan on oral health.

The project design contains three key elements: 1) Capacity building &#x2013; an expansion and intensification of the capacity-building advocacy work based on the Oral Health Promotion Committee (OHPC), with gradual transfer of responsibility. The Committee was established through the current cooperation between Tandsundhed Uden Gr&#xE6;nser (TUG) and SOS Children&#x2019;s Villages in Rwanda (SOS RW). 2) School-based activities &#x2013; daily tooth brushing and handwashing programs in a selected number of primary schools ready to take over the responsibility for the activities before the end of the project period. One school will be appointed a &#x2018;Center of Excellence,&#x2019; and, as a new expanded initiative, all students of dental therapy and dental surgery from the Rwandan School of Dentistry will be required to do obligatory outreach activities at the schools as part of their curriculum. 3) Community work among vulnerable families &#x2013; as another innovation, the project will undertake training and education of Home Based Care Practitioners and volunteers working with vulnerable families to convey oral and general health skills.</narrative>
