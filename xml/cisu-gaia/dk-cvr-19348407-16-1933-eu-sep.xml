   <narrative xml:lang="DA">Strengthening the capacities of CBOs in order to contribute to an improvement of the urban environment in select zones of peri-urban Dakar (three communes in the municipalities of Pikine and Guediawaye).

The zones of interventions are essentially informal urban neighbourhoods. For over a decade, most of them have been affected by periodic and permanent flooding. They suffer from a deficit in urban planning, from inadequate management of solid waste, inadequate drainage infrastructure, poor governance and coastal erosion due to see level rise and fraudulent extraction of beach sand. These problems are acute and they constitute the key focus of responses by local Community Based Organizations (CBOs). Due to poor and inadequate organisation of CBOs and insufficient means, CBO actions are short-lived and uncoordinated. Development and Distaster Risk Reduction (DRR) programs carried out or planned by public authorities (Plan Jaxaay, Tawfeex, PROGEP, etc.) have promised an improvement in the targeted urban areas, but their success continues to depend on local populations. Nevertheless, local residents&#x2019; ownership of such projects and their capacity to extend these actions into the most segregated areas are limited.
 
The proposed actions focus on strengthening the CBOs in their capacity for collective action. This will be done through tailor-made training and through organisational structuring of the CBOs at the local, communal and municipal level. The aim is to encourage peer learning, exchange of experiences and coordination of CBO actions. Some of these networks are already present in a number of Pikine&#x2019;s communes. At the scale of the wider peri-urban area, the project aims to foster a creation of a coalition of CBO networks, referred to as the Alliance, which would promote concerted action and thus act as a prerequisite for wider advocacy campaigns representative of the needs of residents living in precarious yet densely populated peri-urban areas. Together, these CBOs must gain weight in negotiations with local authorities and position themselves as key partners in decision-making over issues pertaining to local urban planning and local development.</narrative>
