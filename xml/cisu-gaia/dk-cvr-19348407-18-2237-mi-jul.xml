   <narrative xml:lang="DA">The overall objective of this intervention, is the strengthening of Mozambican civil society through the creation of the Mozambican Platform for Democratic Debate (the Platform). 

Mozambican civil society is hampered by the democratic shortcomings of Mozambique. This includes the above mentioned constraints such as limits to press freedom and freedom of expression. Conditions in Mozambique exacerbate the global trend of &#x201C;shrinking space for civil society&#x201D; . Reversing this process, necessitates a system where the people of the world, not just a narrow political and economic elite, have information and a voice and thus real power or influence. 

As such, the logic guiding this intervention is, that by establishing the proposed Platform, a reversal of the current trend of a shrinking space for civil society can be achieved. By providing a space where information can flow freely, alternative opinions can be heard and political debate take place, the Platform will increase the availability of knowledge and perspective, challenge the limitations to freedom of expression, give voice to people outside of the economic and political elite and, finally, enhance the communication, and thus cooperation, between civil society actors.</narrative>
