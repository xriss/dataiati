  <description>
   <narrative xml:lang="DA">The proposed activity aims to experiment with and test an approach to strengthen local handicraft traditions and skills as a means to restore craft based livelihoods, cultural dignity and vocational training and education in rural areas of West Bengal, India. The activity explores the potential for a neighbourhood based vocational training and skills development set-up termed an &#x2018;After School&#x2019; facility in partnership with local authorities in a rural area. By engaging the full range of craftsmen involved in one type of handicraft (weaving) in an intensive knowledge sharing process and conducting an extended vocational training program for two groups of apprentices (Trainers-Of-trainers) and learners in a second type of handicraft (sewing), in collaboration with CSOs and local government, the activity will test the possibilities of reinvigorating handicrafts in rural areas of West Bengal.
The initiative addresses is the UN&#x2019;s SDG 4: Ensure inclusive and quality education for all and promote lifelong learning&#x2019; and the Incheon Declaration 2015 of the World Education Forum on &#x2013; &#x2018;Towards inclusive and equitable quality education and lifelong learning for all&#x2019; which starts with the words &#x201C;We commit to promoting quality lifelong learning opportunities for all, in all settings and at all levels of education&#x2026;.&#x201D;.</narrative>
