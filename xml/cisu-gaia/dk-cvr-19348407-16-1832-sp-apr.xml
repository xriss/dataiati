   <narrative xml:lang="DA">The development objective is to assist in the inclusion of people with disabilities in the Kyrgyz society by empowering them and their organisations to advocate equal rights. In this project the mission is focusing on communicating that young people with disabilities are valuable, capable individuals and that inclusion initiatives are worthwhile. And doing this by establishing a replicable model of services for integrating young people with disabilities into the labour market, thereby offering them possibilities for living a more independent social and economic life, which is impossible when they are institutionalized</narrative>
