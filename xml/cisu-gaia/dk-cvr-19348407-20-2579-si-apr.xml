  </title>
  <description>
   <narrative xml:lang="DA">The project seeks to build the capacity of a group of 15 widows and cascade to other vulnerable women (WVW) in Kibera and potentially reach the entire informal dwellers in Kibera Kenya. The aim is to empower them through technical capacity building to develop successful small businesses and contribute more towards improved family livelihoods and general community development. Likewise, creating sustainable income, reduction of the grinding poverty and hopelessness. Furthermore, with the novel Coronavirus pandemic these women and slum dwellers generally are the most vulnerable in terms of lack of access to food, healthcare, water and even affording the recommended health guidelines such as social distancing because of one roomed structures they live in. Covid-19 promises to be devastating to people who live in the slums with poor infrastructure and lack of basic social amenities. It is, further, exacerbated by lack of daily chores which they depend on for survival.    This action&#x2019;s main approach proposes training of 15 widows to participate in income generating small scale businesses as the direct beneficiaries while cascading to potential indirect beneficiaries. This is to bridge the &#x201C;gap&#x201D; between communities and poverty reduction mechanisms commonly attributed to the low capacity of communities to identify, participate and make informed decisions on their own gainful opportunities. Likewise, missed opportunities for government policies to prioritize small businesses and increased investments in business development and incubation.</narrative>
