   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Nissa - Strenghtening the provision of GBV, PSS and RH integrated services in Mosul</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The proposed intervention is based on a continuation of the current Mental Health and Psychosocial Support (MHPSS) and Gender Based Violence (GBV) prevention and response activities in East Mosul implemented during the first phase of this UNFPA project. Un Ponte Per (UPP) has been responsible for providing response services for GBV survivors and at risk of GBV in East Mosul since November 2017. In applying its expertise in implementing MHPSS and GBV services in urban settings, UPP aims to increase access for GBV survivors and assist vulnerable women and girls residing/displaced in East Mosul by addressing their specific needs through specialized GBV services integrated with Psychosocial Support (PSS) and Reproductive Health (RH) services. 
In particular, the project intends to implement community outreach activities, safety audits as well as coaching and mentorship plans on GBV case management. UPP will closely work to ensure equal and adequate coverage across East Mosul inlculding through referrals to UPP MHPSS and GBV services by other organizations.
This will be done through three full-time Psychosocial Counselors who will provide level 1 (support groups), level 2 (Psychological First Aid) and level 3 (individual counseling) psychosocial support for  beneficiaries reporting trauma or post-traumatic stress. These activities will take place in three Safe Spaces in East Mosul located in al-Noor neighborhood (UPP safe space) and two Primary Health Care (PHCs) managed by UPP in al-Nabi Younis and al-Summer since October 2017.
In Ninewa, results of several field assessments carried out by UPP in the last months, indicated that  violence continues to affect women and girls negatively in their homes and in the community, further eroding women&#x2019;s rights. As displacement becomes protracted, the risk of SGBV persists and may even intensify. Domestic violence remains the most frequent form of GBV, along with forced and child marriages contributing to psychosocial stress and a limitation on women and girls movement. Effects of GBV are further associated with several concerns seen as reproductive coercion, such as contraceptive non-use, unintended pregnancy, abortion, adverse pregnancy outcomes, etc. For these reasons, UPP will integrate its GBV prevention and response strategy with a Reproductive Health (RH) component in its safe spaces, previously created in East Mosul while extending this service further to cover some areas of West Mosul. and. The medical mobile clinic, is equipped with an ultrasound system and services will be delivered for five days a week. The UPP will recruit one ultrasound specialist, one doctor, and one nurse.  Prior deployment, they will be trained on screening for GBV cases and safety planning, in combination a training on provision of emotional support, psychosomatic symptoms of GBV as well as the, modalities for referrals. The aforementioned staff will be offering to women and adolescents activities such as ANC and pregnancy tests, Family Planning consultations and provision of methods, Gynecological examinations and Testing/treating of infections. The mobile unit will be provided by UPP.</narrative>
