   <narrative xml:lang="EN">General: 
The Basateen Al Sheuokh Camp in Shirqat has been open since October 2017 with a capacity of 1000 plots. As Camp Management, CAOFISR will implement a variety of activities to ensure that the IDPs receive and have access to essential life-saving assistance and protection services within the camp. CAOFISR will also ensure effective coordination of partners, monitoring of services, information management and community participation. Included in this project will be the site maintenance and upgrade that is essential in limiting the risks and hazards in the camp. 

The outputs include the following:
Output 1: Effective Camp Management and Camp Coordination Mechanisms Established
Output 2: Life Saving Assistance and Protection is Provided to IDPs in the camp
Output 3: Risks and hazards inside the camp are mitigated
Output 4: Community Participation in decision making is enhanced, throughout the camp life cycle

Capacity Building: 
IOM has promised to assist with continued support with capacity building, trainings and staff support. We have planned to provide joint cccm trainings to the new staff and TDH has promised to also train our CCCM staff in protection. We also plan to bring protection specialists as our own contribution to educate the staff in protection mainstreaming. 

Protection Mainstreaming:
As camp management, CAOFISR is dedicated to incorporating protection principles in its daily activities and ensuring the following:
-access to a safe and dignified living space and humanitarian aid by monitoring the camp in order to prevent and minimize risks and hazards
-ensure that they have safe access to assistance and services (psychological support, legal protection etc.)
-advocate for equality and against discrimination
-maintain the feedback mechanism  to ensure the various parties are held accountable for their services 
-encourage participation and empowerment so that all are treated equally and given a voice to advocate for their rights as a human

Camp Maintenance:
Due to protection concerns, CAOFISR will be rehabilitating the fence, and dividing the camp into two parts to mitigate the risks in hazards. In addition, we will be adding lighting around the perimiter. The camp has seen many intruders during the night because there is no lighting, and the local community keeps cutting holes in the fence because the camp restricts the path to the market. By dividing the camp, and adding lighting, it will mitigate this hazard. 

Weather has left 407 tents in need of repair, and the shelter cluster has advised us to collect all the pieces, and store them. We will hire IDP workers to collect all the materials, wash and rehabilitate the materials if needed. The men will collect and sort, the women will clean and stitch the tarps. 

Future Funding: 
CAOFISR will be working to secure a new funding source for the camp after the contract duration.</narrative>
