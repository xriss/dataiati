   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Supporting the return of IDPs through the restoration and rehabilitation of damaged water infrastructure and providing WaSH in School assistance packages in the Baiji District.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Terre des hommes (Tdh) has been working in Iraq to provide emergency humanitarian aid to support internally displaced persons (IDPs) since November 2014. In the Salah al Din governorate, Tdh has been implementing multi-sectoral responses since June 2016, including work in water, sanitation and hygiene (WaSH), shelter, non-food item (NFI) distribution, child protection and education activities. Working at the grassroots level in regional bases in five governorates around Iraq, Tdh has the resources and experience to understand and support local communities&#x2019; needs. For residents of Baiji city, limited access to a clean and reliable water supply is a major concern, especially as IDPs begin to return to the district.

As a gateway to the Anbar desert from East Shirqat and Hawija, the Baiji district was a key battleground during military action between Iraqi Armed Forces, Shiite militias and ISIS insurgents. During many rounds of fighting, the water supply system in Baiji was severely damaged: now, Baiji&#x2019;s water services are unable to provide clean, safe drinking water and exposes residents to significant health risks, especially from waterborne diseases. This issue also poses a major hindrance to those thousands of IDPs returning to Baiji who will require basic water services and a reliable source of drinking water.

Given the urgency of the current situation in Baiji, Tdh carried out a detailed needs assessment in coordination with other NGOs working in the region. These surveys focused on the situation between Albo Jwari and Harijiyah, the hardest hit areas during the conflict and the areas where most IDPs living in camps in Shaqlawa and Dream City (both managed by Tdh) are originally from. By carrying out this needs assessment and having direct involvement with restoring the water supply in these areas, Tdh will be able to use an in-depth knowledge and understanding of the situation on the ground in Baiji to support safe and dignified returns for IDPs.

According to the needs assessment, the rehabilitation of the water network and Water Treatment Plant (WTP) are the most efficient and beneficial ways to restore clean drinking water to the Baiji district and reach the most number of beneficiaries. All activities will take place within the Baiji district, and will reach between 15,882 and 23,682 beneficiaries. In close cooperation with the Directorate of Water (DoW), Tdh proposes to work on rehabilitation of Al Taameen water network (please see Annexes 03 and 04) and Al Buujwarry WTP (please see Annexes 00, 01 and 02). In addition, full WaSH packages will be provided to six schools in compliance with WHO standards (please see Annexes 05, 06 and 07). Tdh has previously worked with these schools on another IHPF-funded project last year for WTP rehabilitation: two schools are in Al Zohia, two are in Al Musahak and two are in Al Buujwarry. 

The long-term benefits of this activity are twofold: first, the project will improve water quality and access for the whole Baiji district, reducing the risk of waterborne diseases and other health hazards caused by unsafe drinking water second, sustainable access to clean water is a crucial basic service that will support the safe return of those displaced by the conflict.

As a former leader of the WaSH technical working group in schools and a current leader on WTP rehabilitation technical working group, Tdh has the expertise and experience to implement an integrated emergency response in Baiji. As an advocate for equality, Tdh will also carry out hygiene promotion activities centred around female health, and WaSH activities at school with a focus on children with disabilities. Finally, harnessing its extensive presence around Iraq, Tdh will coordinate this project with its offices in Shirqat and Kirkuk to provide a more holistic response to the needs of the Baiji district, including shelter, CCCM, education, NFI and protection activities.</narrative>
