   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Information and communication are critical forms of aid and key prerequisites for communities to participate in their own recovery. Access to information is a human right and people affected by conflict and disaster should have access to an ongoing, reliable flow of credible information on the disaster and associated relief effort. While communicating with affected populations has never been more essential, the simple provision of information is not enough. Two-way communication and feedback is critical to ensuring communication is effective and efficiently circulates the urgent needs and priorities of affected populations. Two-way communication systems deliver effective aid in the form of information, facilitating the recovery of communities in emergency contexts. Communities can be empowered by providing information to aid agencies, which in turn can be used to advocate and deliver solutions to genuine problems. 

Two-way communication prioritises communication between humanitarian actors and affected communities to establish what support people need and, crucially, what they do not need. Strategic use of two-way communication leads to a more effective humanitarian response, ensures that communities get the right help, in the right place, at the right time, and ultimately empowers communities to be active participants in their own recovery. Two-way communication locates affected populations at the centre of programmatic decision making on relief and response.

As a two-way communication mechanism, the Iraq Internally Displaced Persons Information Centre (Iraq IIC) is a link to the partnership between those who wish to assist those affected by the ongoing conflict in Iraq and those people who have been affected and who need assistance. The Iraq IIC is accountable to both constituencies. 

The Iraq IIC was launched in 2015 following an inter-agency assessment into the information and communication needs of displaced populations in Iraq. It found an information vacuum around the humanitarian response was fueling confusion, mistrust and isolation among displaced communities. Responding to one of the most complex humanitarian crises in the world, the Humanitarian Country Team agreed to the establishment of an inter-agency two-way communication and accountability mechanism that allows affected populations to shape their own relief and recovery. 

A collective accountability mechanism for the humanitarian response in Iraq, the Iraq IIC&apos;s promotes two-way communication between affected populations and humanitarian actors to:
&#xB7; Empower communities through the provision of accessible and timely information on how to access services and resources required to improve their situation, fulfilling their right to know, to ask questions and to participate in their own recovery
&#xB7; Help ensure efficient and effective coordination of humanitarian agencies, funds, and programmes operating in Iraq by collecting and circulating information about the urgent needs and priorities of affected populations and
&#xB7; Support an environment of collective transparency and accountability by: Establishing an easy-to-access and safe mechanism through which affected populations can lodge feedback and complaints Channelling feedback and complaints to humanitarian actors to influence humanitarian programming and shape quality advocacy and, Communicating with affected populations to gauge user satisfaction with the quality of information and guidance provided by the call centre.

During 2017, the information centre handled 76,000 calls from across the country. In 2018, funds from IHPF will be used to continue core programming, expand programming by hiring an additional staff in order to scale as needed for the returnee agenda, enhance the outreach and to extend the duration of the project.</narrative>
