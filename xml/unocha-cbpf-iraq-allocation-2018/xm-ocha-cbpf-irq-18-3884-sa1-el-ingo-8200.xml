  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">An average of 8.7 million Iraqis will require some form of humanitarian assistance in 2018 and 2.8 million are expected to require livelihoods assistance. Kirkuk governorate is at the epicenter of the crisis, hosting a large amount of people in need of humanitarian interventions. As displacement becomes protracted, women face greater challenges as families resort to negative coping mechanisms under the strain of prolonged uncertainty and diminishing resources. Families are currently returning to retaken areas in Kirkuk governorates. Over 23,000 families have returned since 31 January 2018, although basic services and infrastructure remain largely nonfunctional in these areas. 

Relief International (RI) has been an active member of the Emergency Livelihoods cluster (EL) in Iraq, and is an implementing member of the EL Cluster response as part of IHPF 2016  in Kirkuk. Additionally, RI is the Kirkuk Livelihoods Sub Cluster Coordinator. Based on assessed needs in Kirkuk, this project responds to the EL strategic objectives for 2018, providing first line interventions for immediate response to vulnerable returnees, providing them with emergency livelihoods opportunities, cash for work, and equipping women with skills, tools and micro grants to rebuild their assets and regain dignity.

Through this intervention, RI is proposing a small-scale project in Hawija, Krikuk. RI will respond to immediate needs in Hawija by providing 180 vulnerable returnees with cash for work (CFW)  opportunities to rehabilitate government institutions using RI&#x2019;s network through current WASH and Health programs in target locations, as well as local authorities to determine the infrastructure most in need of repair. =. RI already has the necessary permissions and acceptance from the community to operate in these areas, as well as the assessments of the needed rehabilitation works.

Furthermore, RI will provide 86 vulnerable female returnees, with micro grants of $500 for asset recovery and training on small business development, utilizing their skills in connection with local market demand. This combination of interventions, including the $500 grant, is proposed based on lessons learned with RIs previous programming through the OCHA, UNDP, RDPP-DANIDA and other donors.

In total the project will directly serve 260 vulnerable returnees, including 180 returnees (at least 10% women) with CFW opportunities and 80 women with assets recovery. Both urban and rural livelihoods opportunities will be available to women in target areas, based on their sets of skills and type of livelihood that they want to re-establish. Moreover, RI is already operational in Hawija through our existing Health and WASH programmes and so is well positioned to work here through this intervention.</narrative>
