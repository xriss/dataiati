   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Supporting IDPs and Returnees through maintaining the work of one PHCC in kilo 18 camp (Anbar) and running Al-Zanjili PHCC in the right side of Mosul (Ninawa)</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project is designed to support two main affected categories in Anbar and Ninawa who are really in serious need of primary health care services.

A- The first category will be the displaced families who are still living in kilo 18 camp (east of Ramadi) through maintaining the work of UIMS existing PHCC to ensure the continuity of providing primary health care services to the camp population which is nearly 5000 persons. In kilo 18 camp UIMS has various activities (delivery room, women comunity center, and PHCC), UIMS PHCC is fully equipped and staffed and its providing health services since 15-6-2017 under IHPF second allocation funds and till now (no other PHCC funactions at Kilo 18 camp except UIMS one), the project ended in the mid of Feb 2018 but the PHCC is still working under UIMS own funds until the end of March , then, we are hoping to get funds from IHPF to keep it working after March and for 6 consecutive months as this camp will be one of the last camps that will be closed according to the initial information that we got from Anbar governorate. For kilo 18 camp, most of the displaced families have their own reasons to stay in the camp and don&apos;t return to their areas of origins, as you may know, UIMS is working in this camp since two years ago, so, we are already understanding and knowing the nature of those families and their situations.Those families are originally from Anbar, most of them are from Qaim and Jazeera Al-Ramadi while others are from Jazeerat Al-Khladiya, Heet and Fallujah, those families are not willing to return to their origins areas as they have problems there, notably those who have had ISIL affiliated members or their relatives joined ISIL before, another reason that prevents those people from returning which is the large-scale destruction that occurred in their areas of origins and the lack of services.

B- Under this project, there is another category we are planning to support which is the returnee families in right side of Mosul (Zanjli neighborhood and surrounding areas) by rehabilitating Al-Zainjili PHCC (The rehab cost will be covered through Kuwaitis funds as UIMS already secured funds for that) but for running cost, we are hoping to get funds from this allocation to run this PHCC. According to IOM statistics, there are 1796 families returned recently to Zanjili and around 1800 families in Al-Seha and Al-Thwara neighborhoods. The returnees there  have a very limited access to health services as most of the governmental PHCCs either damaged or looted during the military operations, on the other hand, the aforementioned neighborhoods are lacking health services as the governmental PHCCs either damaged or looted through the recent fierce military operations, in addition to that, the return wave to those areas is  scaling up day after day , so we are planning to run Al-Zanjili PHCC which mediate those populated areas. UIMS will start rehabilitating Al-Zanjili PHCC (through Kuwaitis funds ) then we will run it by start May through IHF allocation. As you may already know that the fiercest fighting took place in Zanjili and surrounding areas during military operations and this extremely affected on the infrastructure of those areas, most of PHCC are damaged and others are in need of minor rehab and equipment as most of them looted by ISIL.Additionally, We have double checked with UNDP about Al-Zanjili PHCC and they confirmed by emails that UNDP is not planning to rehab this PHCC. 


Under this project, we will provide primary health care services for 6 consecutive months with one shift from 8 a.m. to  2 p.m./ 6 days per week. At both health facilities, the missing services will be compensated through establishing strong referral pathways.

Both PHCCs will be providing  (general examinations, NCD treatment, health educational sessions, ER, EWARN, vaccinations, RH and referral ) so, it will also look like comprehensive health services.</narrative>
