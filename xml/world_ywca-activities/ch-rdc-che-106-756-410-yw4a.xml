    <narrative xml:lang="EN"># young women, with 60 % from marginalized communities, assuming leadership roles in public and civic decision-making at community level (disaggregated by cohort)</narrative>
   </title>
   <description>
    <narrative xml:lang="EN">This indicator refers to the number of young women in the cohort of young women who are trained in the ToT and who experience changes in leadership skills, experiences and practices. Leadership roles are measured by capacity to apply different forms of leadership training (to peers), willingness to become role models, self-confidence and efficacy, planning and facilitation skills, public speaking, advocacy, willingness to engage in policy change and with actors in public and civic decision-making spaces, exercise of leadership roles in the community, women&#x2019;s groups, CSOs and political spaces, mobilization of young women, networking.
The indicator was further operationalised and translated into a leadership measure that is constructed from two parameters: (1) current conditions for assuming leadership roles), and (2) current exercise of leadership. Current conditions for assuming leadership roles, which includes: 1.a.Values 1.b. Skills 1.c. Knowledge 1.d. Self-perception as a leader. Current exercise of leadership types, which includes 2.a. Private leadership 2.b. Public leadership 2.C. Informal leadership 2.d. Horizontal leadership 2.e. Collaborative and consultative leadership 2.F. Transformative leadership.
A Young Woman Leadership Score was created which is an individualised aggregated measure of leadership. This score represents the baseline value for IO2a. It includes the following categories, arranged from the highest to the lowest: A. Very Skilful, B. Skilful, C. Strongly Emerging, D. Emerging, E. Limited and F. Basic. By placing young women across six different categories, this scale allows for a more nuanced assessment of young women&#x2019;s current leadership as well as monitoring of their progress in the coming years.</narrative>
