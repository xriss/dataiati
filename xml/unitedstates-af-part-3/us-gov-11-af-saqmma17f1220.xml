   <description>
    <narrative xml:lang="EN">U.S. assistance to Afghanistan is designed to cement and build upon the gains of more than a dozen years of democratic governance and ensure the country remains a key ally to the United States and the region in the fight against international terrorism. This request takes into account the fragile progress made by the new Afghan administration in its first year. Facing security and economic challenges exacerbated by international military and development drawdowns and working through the difficult politics of a unity government, the government managed its way through the 2014 fiscal crisis inherited from the previous administration and avoided a fiscal crisis in 2015, selected a majority of cabinet members, re-established its relationship with the IMF, and took action to reduce corruption and waste in government procurements. In September 2015, the government and its international partners agreed upon a new accountability framework focused on the key challenges of corruption, economic growth, fiscal sustainability, and human rights. The government also established a New Development Partnership (NDP) with the United States that incentivizes ambitious development reform targets over the coming four years. Moving forward, Afghanistan will have to fight an emboldened Taliban insurgency, prevent the expansion of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant&apos;s emerging presence, and revive a stagnant economy. President Obama recognized the importance of our partnership with Afghanistan in October 2015 when he announced that U.S. troops would remain in Afghanistan in greater numbers than originally planned through 2016 and into 2017 in order to better train and assist Afghan security forces in their fight against the insurgency. The United States&apos; continued strategic partnership takes on increased importance as they enable sustainable development, help improve security, and calm the nerves of Afghanistan&apos;s neighbors who fear the U.S. government would withdraw its robust support for Afghanistan and the broader region. U.S. civilian assistance is focused on building sustainable and accountable Afghan institutions that provide citizens with security and the essential health, education and public services they need to invest in the future of their country. The FY 2017 Request prioritizes the preservation of past achievements, seeks to stimulate private sector led economic growth, and supports the Afghan government&apos;s progress in strengthening its capacity and stewardship. Significant resources will continue to support Afghan women and girls as they boldly advocate for their rightful role in all aspects of Afghan society. U.S. assistance will also focus on easing the transition from humanitarian assistance to development programming.The FY 2017 request of $1.3 billion will facilitate the continuation of nationwide development programs and conditional incentive programs like the NDP that are necessary to bring Afghanistan closer to long-term self-reliance. Programs will continue to work to facilitate economic growth, support improvements in the justice sector, and sustain gains in health, education, and women&apos;s rights. U.S. programs in Afghanistan will continue to promote transparency and accountability and fight corruption. This request is consistent with U.S. commitments made at the Tokyo and London Conferences to sustain support to Afghanistan through 2017 at or near levels of the last decade.</narrative>
