      <narrative xml:lang="EN">Policies and mechanisms of international finance mechanisms for financing local action: Climate finance is currently lacking in transparency, and less than 10% reaches the local level. Financiers favour larger project sizes and have low confidence in local actors to 
manage funds. 

The baseline indicates that the GCF and World Bank have in the past adopted agreements and initiatives to better ensure the involvement of local actors and local civil society and increase local ownership of climate funds. However, the Global Program is not yet clear whether these initiatives need to be adapted or if entirely new procedures and policies would be better suited to the objective. The Global Program is first reviewing additional literature and interviews before designing an intervention.

Policies and mechanisms of international 
finance mechanisms for financing local action: Climate finance is currently lacking in transparency, and less than 10% reaches the local level. Financiers favour larger project sizes and have low confidence in local actors to manage funds. There are examples of financial mechanisms which have been successful at the local level, but these need to be scaled up and connected to international financial flows.

Private sector policies for mobilisation of financing for local climate action: Only 10% of climate finance currently reaches the local level and there is no additional finance or new climate fund targeting financing local climate solutions, that takes on board recommendations from past challenges and successes.</narrative>

This is expected to lead to funding mechanisms of international climate funds, and their conditions and procedures, being better suited for ensuring that finance reaches the local level in the longer term.

Policies and mechanisms of international 
finance mechanisms for financing local action: Improvement and implementation: Local financial mechanisms are better connected to international finance and key actors are better able to scale up finance at the local level.

Private sector policies for mobilisation of financing for local climate action: Improvement and implementation: By 2025, the private sector actors increase the amount of private-sector funds channelled through selected funding mechanisms to reach the local level.</narrative>
