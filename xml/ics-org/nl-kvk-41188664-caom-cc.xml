   <narrative xml:lang="EN">&quot;ICS has been working very closely with the Commune Council for several years, and they have been engaged in various ICS project interventions in Beng Commune and attended a series of meetings and training workshops initiated by ICS.  The Commune Council also visited various types of project interventions in other provinces in order to expand their understanding and increase their skills in community development. An important key role of the Commune Council is making sure services are provided to its constituents.  This is accomplished through an annual process of Commune Council investment planning which helps them to prioritize where funds should be allocated. A major challenge exists in influencing the Commune Council to change their habits of focusing their funds mostly in infrastructure investment rather than allocating portions to support the socio-economic initiatives of their constituents. ICS has experience in engaging with the Commune Council and co invest with NGOs by not isolating the Commune Council, but rather actively engaging them in the process and work along with them.  ICS act as a bridge between the community, civil society and the Commune Council, and will strategically invest in the Commune Council (supply) and create strong demands from the civil society organization (CSOs.)&#x94;</narrative>
