   <narrative xml:lang="EN">&quot;Young people in Meatu, Tanzania, have few opportunities. Without entrepreneurial skills, few succeed in building a durable business or expanding an existing one. There is great demand among young entrepreneurs for coaching and training opportunities.  There are hardly any educational avenues, let alone routes for young entrepreneurs. Translating a business idea into an enterprise is therefore very difficult.  The Young Entrepreneurship Program - YEP -  offers young entrepreneurs in Meatu a coaching and training program. Here they learn about finances, market research, sales and marketing. On the basis of a good business plan they receive a starter loan. They then have 3 years to pay back their loan.  During the program the young entrepreneurs take on a practical assignment and are apprenticed to a local business.  The basic training program also makes it possible for young people without a business idea to set up their own business.&quot;</narrative>
