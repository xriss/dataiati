   <narrative xml:lang="EN">&#x93;In Oddar Meanchey province poultry production is one of the many activities in diversified rural farming systems and more than half of all Cambodian households keep poultry. Revenues from poultry only represent very small proportion of total household revenues, but women accrue most of this income, which allows them to cover household and education expenses. Housing for birds, although very basic in some cases, can also be nonexistent. Birds sleep in trees and natural sheds at night. The cost of inputs can be a small cash expense for the purchase of day-old chicks (in case own-stock hatching is not pursued) and some complementary feedstuffs. Birds are sold live locally or at farm gates, were motorized traders and middlemen purvey supplies to take to markets. Poultry are thus also an important source of cash income for low-income households. The project aims for the production and improvement of potentially locally bred chickens through community entrepreneurship development and value chain development. It is composed of four components: 1. capacity strengthening of the contract growing system to deliver inputs and veterinary services for poultry, 2. organization of the beneficiaries into enterprises by 3. overall training of stakeholders, 4. equipment and infrastructure development.&#x94;</narrative>
