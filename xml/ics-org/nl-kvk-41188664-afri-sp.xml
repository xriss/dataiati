   <narrative xml:lang="EN">&#x93;The family forms the basic protective unit for children. Children need to feel safe and protected within the family set up. It is within the family that children are taught morals and responsibilities that will enable them go through life. Parents play a key role in the physical social and mental development of their children and are the first point of influence for the children. The ICS skilful parenting programme provides a holistic approach that reinforces positive parenting practices in Kenya and Tanzania empowering parents to address challenges that they face in bringing up their children. The skilful parenting programme focuses on improving both parenting and child outcomes.  Specifically the programme focuses on empowering parents with the knowledge skills attitudes and behaviours that will enhance their capacity and confidence so that they can effectively meet their children&#x92;s developmental and growth needs. To reinforce our initiatives at family level families are on a continuous basis empowered with information guides tool kits and or fact sheets on various topical issues that emerge during parenting discussions. This specific projects covers the development of a family budgeting toolkit. This is seen as important guide that will empower families to proactively plan effectively for their finances - resources - to that they are able to optimally address their needs based on their available resources and to avoid financial stress. &#x93;</narrative>
