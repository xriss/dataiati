It consists of two major entities, Green Forest Social Investment Ltd, which is a holding company, and Green Forest Social Investment Trust, which is a social investment strategy. This project focuses on the activities of the Trust. The initiative&#x92;s long term goal is poverty reduction by way of economic development and income generation through social business and environmental restoration. This is intended to lead to the desired social transformation of the community of Gwasi Division, Suba county through realization of the following objectives: 1) Economic Development, 2)Social Development/Transformation&amp; 3)Environmental Restoration.  In addition to social tree farming, and beekeeping, the Trust supports implementation of the village solar electrification project as a social business venture managed by women. Next to this the trust also works with one community to implement community water supply schemes. The trust also collaborates closely with FASCOBI (a local Community Based Organization) to converge the community focus to participation in child protection interventions with a view of ensuring that all children are safe-guarded and can find social and legal protection.&quot;</narrative>
