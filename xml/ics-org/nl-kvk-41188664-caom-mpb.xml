   <narrative xml:lang="EN">&#x93;The project aims to develop two successful rice bank initiatives in Oddar Meanchey into multi-purpose banks, offering a range of affordable credit and agricultural products to an increased number of members.  In Oddar Meanchey, rice farming is the main source of livelihood for most families.  However, its profitability is heavily compromised by traditional agricultural practices, the absence of affordable credit products and poor marketing of produce.  This affects both food security and household income in the province.  By making available affordable quality farm inputs, credit facilities (cash and in kind) and improved market opportunities, these enterprises help smallholder farmers to improve their productivity and profitability, contributing to their income and food security.  Besides diversifying their activities, the multi-purpose banks will provide 2000 households and farmers with access to these products and services by expanding their operations to thirty villages.  By generating sufficient income, the enterprises remain financially sustainable and will be able to use their profits for other community investments.  In order for the banks to realize these goals, ICS will support the process of expansion and strengthen the managerial and administrative capacities of the enterprises and their management committees. &quot;</narrative>
