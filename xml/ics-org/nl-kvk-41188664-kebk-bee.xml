   <narrative xml:lang="EN">&quot;Although beekeeping has been practiced in Busia and Kakamega counties since long, the commercial potential of honey production is rarely being used. Most farmers that are engaged in beekeeping use traditional technologies, compromising both the quantity and quality of the honey that is produced. Additionally, beekeeping farmers only find access to local markets with small quantities, providing them with very limited returns. Making use of the commercial potential of beekeeping can provide farmers with an additional income through an activity that is not very labour-intensive. This way their primary activities on food production are not compromised. The additional income prevents them from being forced to sell other (cereal) produce that is needed for household consumption.    This project aims at improving the productivity and competitiveness of beekeeping farmers by investing in three areas: 1) training and linking them to extension services to improve their skills and knowledge on appropriate beekeeping technology, 2) improving the availability and access to quality beekeeping inputs, and 3) improving the market position of beekeepers to increase their returns from honey sales. &quot;</narrative>
