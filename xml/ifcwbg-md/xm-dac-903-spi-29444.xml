   <narrative xml:lang="EN">By providing financial support to GC Prim, IFC directly supports:     -	the retention of jobs for local staff in an IDA country with limited alternative employment prospects;   -	a sustainable local glass packaging industry player to continue its operations in a financially sustainable manner, that would also have positive effect on the beverage production sector in Moldova;   -	the competitiveness of a successful exporter in an IDA country.    Furthermore, by facilitating the partial reduction of the outstanding MAIB loan by proposed USD 5 million, IFC would enable MAIB to:       -	comply with the recently tightened single-client exposure limitations of the Central Bank of Moldova;   -	free-up additional capital to be redeployed domestically to a broader base of borrowers, including many SMEs.</narrative>

Construction process of GC Prim was finalized in May 2010, when GC Prim opened the new glass plant with a total capacity of 65,000 tones of finished goods per annum (rough equivalent of 130 million bottles).   At this juncture, during the ramp-up stage of operations, additional financial resources are needed for GC Prim in order to strengthen the capital structure of the Company, to refinance part of its existing loans, to provide working capital and to fund capital expenditure requirements of the Company (the Project).</narrative>
