  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Fair, Green and Global Alliance (FGG) aims to increase the power and decision-making influence of organised, mobilised and informed civil society, to advance fair and green trade and value chains. FGG believes that poverty, inequality and exclusion are caused by power asymmetries. We see the unprecedented power of capital over people and planet as the primary obstacle impeding realisation of fair and green trade and value chains. The FGG programme focuses on recalibrating power within the global architecture of trade and value chains by amplifying the voices of rights-holders &#x2013;  small producers and traders, workers, fishers, rural and indigenous peoples &#x2013; who are practising, claiming or defending fair and green economic practices, and/or whose rights are being ignored, threatened or violated by corporations and/or governments. We aim to transform social relations so that these rights-holders&#x2019; voices are heard and heeded. FGG&#x2019;s eight members (ActionAid, Both ENDS, Clean Clothes Campaign, IT for Change, Milieudefensie (Friends of the Earth Netherlands, in collaboration with FoE International and FoE Europe), The Samdhana Institute, SOMO and the Transnational Institute) cooperate with some 1000+ partners and allies in our many worldwide networks to strengthen collective capacities to advance a common vision of fair and green trade and value chains.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">[4.FoEI1(1)]: Six Spanish CSOs are taking into account perspectives from the Global South when influencing the ongoing parliamentary discussions on the legal reform on waste and contaminated land towards a zero-waste model, as a result of input from a CSO from an Asian UMIC. [See also 3.FoEI9]. [4.FoEI2(2)]: FoEI&#x2019;s narratives (that were developed jointly by FoE groups from all global regions in FoEI&apos;s Climate Justice &amp; Energy programme) around fighting dirty energy, false solutions to the climate crisis (such as &apos;nature based solutions&apos;) and the role of corporate power, pathways to system change and the need to block carbon markets and &apos;net zero&apos;, received substantial media coverage (globally as well as in specific LLMIC/UMICs where FoE member groups campaigned) during the year, and especially in October-December 2021 around the UNFCCC COP26 in Glasgow, potentially contributing to awareness amongst government delegations at the COP. In several countries the FoE groups&apos; campaigns contributed to specific climate issues reaching the agenda&apos;s of governments and with that may also have influenced the governments&apos; standpoints at the COP26. [See also 3.FoEI10]. [Counted are global media and global governments].   [4.FoEI3(1)]: During the UN CFS 47th Plenary Session in February 2021 the Civil Society and Indigenous Peoples&#x2019; Mechanism (CSM) for relations to the UN Committee on World Food Security (CFS), with strategic support from FoEI, successfully advocated for adoption by the CFS of a request for continued deliberation on the impacts of COVID-19 on food systems, agriculture and nutrition in the implementation of the Committee&#x2019;s work programme, despite the obstruction of some governments. A &apos;group of committed&apos; was established including CFS member states Mali, Senegal, Spain, France and Mexico; UN Special Rapporteur on the Right to Food; other UN agencies: WHO, FAO, ILO, UNEP; and CSM to advocate for a just recovery from COVID-19. The new CFS Chair elected at the CFS 49th Plenary Session in October 2021 identified COVID-19 as a priority for his tenure and the CFS commits to specifically addressing COVID-19 in the policy recommendation processes for 2021/2022. [See also 3.FoEI17]. [4.FoEI4(1)]: A statement on biodiversity and agriculture, including five specific recommendations, amongst which &quot;Highlight the role of IPLC in soil biodiversity conservation through their traditional farming systems&quot;, made by FoEI as part of the CBD Alliance during the 24th Meeting (May/June 2021) of the Subsidiary Body on Scientific, Technical and Technological Advice (SBSTTA-24) of the Convention of Biological Diversity (CBD), was reflected in the Conference Room Paper &apos;Review of the International Initiative for the Conservation and Sustainable Use of Soil Biodiversity and Updated Plan of Action - Draft recommendation submitted by the Chair&apos;, and will likely become formal recommendations to the UNCBD COP15 (2022) for the Post-2020 Biodiversity Framework. [See also 5F.FoEI4]. [5.FoEI5(1)]: The UN-linked Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) asked FoEI to make an official written submission in response to inputs shared during a consultation webinar on a draft scoping report for the IPBES&apos; business and biodiversity assessment. FoEI recommended the paper broaden its scope to include detailed study of impacts of business on biodiversity and IPLCs, analysis of effectiveness of measures proposed in a neoliberal system and include role and perspectives of, and impacts on IPLCs.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">[6C.FoEI1(1,1x,1SCS1)]: Six EHRDs from one CSO in an African LLMIC who were arrested in October 2021 have eventually been released without charges thanks to a call for action to mobilise international pressure promoted by FoEI and French CSOs through FoEI&apos;s Internationalist Solidarity System. The petition for the release of the EHRDs was signed by 208 organizations, 25 FoE member groups among them. Letters were sent to  embassies of the African LLMIC in Europe, Africa and Latin America. [See also 2.FoEI1]. [Also counted under subindicator x as this concerns the civic space for the CSO in question, and other CSOs in the African country]. [6C.FoEI2(2,2SCS2)]: Campaigning of FoEI and member groups contributed to putting the demand for a TRIPS waiver for COVID vaccines on the agenda of the Australian government that changed its position from opposing the waiver to supporting it. Also the European Parliament voted to support a temporary TRIPS waiver. The relevance is to achieve global immunity by getting the COVID vaccine to communities and peoples in developing countries quickly, safely, at low or no cost without political-, class- or gender-discrimination. [See also 3.FoEI8]. [6C.FoEI3(1,1SCS2)]: The government of an Asian UMIC imposed conditions allowing only imports of clean and homogeneous plastic waste to ensure that all imported plastic is recyclable and not hazardous, as a result of the advocacy of a CSO in the country financially and strategically supported by FoEI. [See also 3.FoEI9].</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">[5C.FoEI1(5)]: A bill against fracking, introduced by a CSO and allies in one Latin American UMIC, received support from members of congress [1] and municipal deputies [1] requesting the national government to ratify its environmental commitment to avoid the possibility of exploiting unconventional deposits and the implementation of fracking techniques in their departments. In a public hearing convened by the national Congress, the CSO received support for its plea from the United Nations Special Rapporteur on Toxic Substances and Human Rights [1], who requested the Congress prohibit the practice of fracking in the country, reiterating the recommendation already made earlier by the UN&apos;s Special Rapporteur on Environment and Human Rights. The CSOs&apos; campaigning and advocacy to stop fracking received nationwide media attention [1] and was taken up by a trade union [1]. [See also 3.FoEI12].</narrative>

In May 2021 the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank introduced a new Environmental Social Framework that will be incorporated into its investment pipeline. This announcement is supported by the fact that half of all Chinese funded overseas coal projects have been cancelled. The Asian Development Bank new policy adopted in October 2021 rules out any coal finance. FoEI, FoE groups in Asia and allies for many years have been campaigning against investments in coal projects. [See also 3.FoEI6].</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">[5F.FoEI1(1)]: FoEI engagement with UNCTAD put the federation&#x2019;s just recovery demands on the agenda during the process to develop a new mandate and trade and development policy publication includes a number of FoEI policy demands on just recovery. UNCTAD&#x2019;s new mandate includes reference to just recovery and other FoEI/CSO positions. Also, the UNCTAD 2021 Trade and Development policy publication includes a number of FoEI policy demands on just recovery. FoEI advocated that a just recovery needs to include four key principles: redistribution, internationalism, democracy and systemic change. [5F.FoEI2(3,3x)]: In February 2021, at the 47th Plenary Session of the CFS (UN Committee on World Food Security), FoEI presented a CSM (Civil Society and Indigenous Peoples&#x2019; Mechanism for relations with the CFS) statement on the UNFSS (UN Food Systems Summit, a UN multistakeholder initiative convened for the first time in September 2021, aimed to &quot;bring about tangible, positive changes to the world&#x2019;s food systems&quot;) and strategically supported and co-lead the &apos;Liaison Group of the Autonomous Peoples Response to the UNFSS&apos; to raise concerns among the CFS member states of the undemocratic process and content of the UNFSS and its corporate capture. FoEI stated that the CSM is &quot;worried about the current direction to fold all the most important CFS achievements, knowledge and potentially future roles into the UNFSS. The UNFSS is taking the place of the democratic multilateral system, including the CFS and the Rome Based Agencies for the governance of food yet without recognising their leading role, and without upholding the rights and responsibilities of States, the rights of peoples and instead giving a leading role to the corporate sector,&quot; and received support from the UN Special Rapporteur on the Right to Food [1] who presented the CSM position to the UN General Assembly in March 2021. Furthermore, after advocacy at and around CFS meetings, and meetings with and letters to representatives of governments and the UN, and as a result of the civil society counter mobilisation to the UNFSS, including via (i) organising in July 2021 the conference &apos;Global Counter-Mobilization against the UN Food Systems Pre-Summit&apos; in Rome and online (FoEI was a co-organiser) that also received coverage in major media outlets, (ii) publishing the statement &apos;Exposing corporate capture of the UNFSS through multistakeholderism&apos; (September 2021) co-written by FoEI and providing new evidence and analysis of how corporate capture of global governance is unfolding, several CFS member states raised concerns about the UNFSS process and outcomes in CFS plenary sessions, in the CFS Bureau and at the FAO. As a result the CFS [1] at its 49th plenary session in October 2021 did not agree to implement UNFSS outcomes. The FAO Council&apos;s [1] 168th Session In November/December 2021 &quot;noted that the Summit did not have a negotiated outcome&quot; and did not welcome a follow-up to the process but stressed the need to maintain existing UN structures. FoEI contributions to the CSM advocacy also involved coordination and strategizing within the FoE network, a.o. leading to two African and two Latin American LLMIC/UMIC groups participating in and sharing their positions and analysis during the mentioned Counter Summit. [See also 3.FoEI17]. [Also counted under subindicator x as the aim is to maintain democratic decision-making processes on agriculture and food, and to prevent corporate capture of the policy making space over states and civil society].   [5F.FoEI3(1)]: At its 48th Session in June 2021, the CFS (UN Committee on World Food Security) adopted policy recommendations that the CSM (Civil Society and Indigenous Peoples&#x2019; Mechanism for relations with the CFS) with facilitation support and strategic input from FoEI had developed, brought onto the agenda of, promoted in well-attended self-organised webinars, and negotiated within the CFS&apos; Open-Ended Working Group on Agroecological and other Innovative Approaches. The CFS OEWG recommendations highlight critical important elements for agroecology (a.o. centrality of human rights; definition of agroecology as conceived by social movements and not agribusiness; centrality of agroecology), while the policy recommendations adopted fell short on transforming food systems. [See also 3.FoEI17]. [5F.FoEI4(1)]: Six text recommendations, put forward by FoEI and the CBD Alliance, during the third meeting (August/September 2021) of the Convention on Biological Diversity&#x2019;s (CBD) Open-ended Working Group on the Post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework, tasked with advancing preparations for the development of this post-2020 framework to be adopted in 2022, received support from government parties. The Open-Ended Working Group is tasked with advancing preparations for the development of the Global Biodiversity Framework. FoEI&apos;s and the CBD Alliance&apos;s recommendations aim at improvement of the framework with respect to agriculture, agricultural ecosystems, agricultural biodiversity and soil health needs, the vital importance of IPLC&apos;s rights and tenure systems as well as the need to end perverse incentives and subsidies for industrial agriculture that facilitate the direct and indirect drivers of biodiversity loss including soils. Furthermore, the CBD Alliance recommended the establishment of &quot;[government] regulations for all businesses, trade and investment, prohibiting impacts that pass the limits of planetary boundaries, or affect ecosystem functions and human health or abuse human rights, ensuring full transparency of business impacts, addressing conflicts of interest, ensuring liability and redress, and penalising infractions and the provision of false information about ecological and human rights impacts or the benefits of products&quot;. [See also 4.FoEI4].</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">[G.FoEI1]: As a grassroots environmental and social justice federation, Friends of the Earth International sees system change as crucial for the transformation of our societies. We recognise gender justice and the dismantling of patriarchy as key to achieving this transformative change. We affirm grassroots, anti-capitalist feminism as an essential tool to achieving equality, transformation and, ultimately, system change. In December 2020 we issued the booklet &apos;Why Gender Justice and Dismantling Patriarchy?&apos; in which we explain the key concepts that help us talk about, understand, analyse and strategise within this area of work. It is the result of three years of collective conceptualisation, with the the contributions and analysis of the Gender Justice Dismantling Patriarchy Working Group of Friends of the Earth International, together with national member groups, regions and international structures. Through this work, we are collectively deepening our understanding of power and oppressions in order to challenge and dismantle them. In November 2021 FoEI issued the publication &apos;If it&#x2019;s not feminist, it&#x2019;s not just. Women&#x2019;s voices, analysis and action towards a just energy transition.&apos; This paper highlights our collective vision of the Just Energy Transition, as expressed and discussed by the participants of the Friends of the Earth International webinars, and founded on the experiences and perspectives of women across the globe and their fierce feminist demands for a system change that will be inclusive and just for us all. FoEI aims for a gender analysis to be incorporated into its four programmatic areas: Economic Justice, Climate Justice &amp; Energy, Forests &amp; Biodiversity, and Food Sovereignty, as well as FoEI&#x2019;s Internationalist Solidarity System, and their lines of work supported by FGG. In 2021 this included: (i) Work in FoEI&#x2019;s Forests &amp; Biodiversity programme to develop a gender justice framework for community forest management, which will be finalized in 2022; (ii) Responding to a need to strengthen our advocacy capacity for economic justice solutions by designing and delivering an international course for national member groups on economics that included a component on feminist economics; translating a report on trade and gender developed by FoE Latin America and Caribbean to be used in future capacity development to better integrate a gender analysis in our trade-related work; and in one Latin American country supporting the organization of workshops for two movements on feminist emancipatory initiatives for a just recovery; (iii) FoEI&#x2019;s Climate Justice &amp; Energy programme launched the report &#x201C;If it&#x2019;s not feminist, it&#x2019;s not just&#x201D; at the Just Transition Hub in Glasgow in conjunction with the UNFCCC COP26. The report, an output of a series of three international webinars that brought together some 100 people from the Friends of the Earth federation around the globe together with allied organisations  to analyse what a just energy transition means from a feminist perspective, will be a tool in ongoing advocacy. Campaigning against net zero and carbon markets were a priority for FoEI&#x2019;s climate justice and energy program in 2021; our &#x201C;real zero&#x201D; demands that informed our materials and activities incorporate gender justice demands; (iv) FoEI&#x2019;s Food Sovereignty programme developed a position paper on the right to Food Sovereignty with Gender Justice, drawing upon a synthesis of theoretical and methodological positions, alliances and proposals and member group interviews carried out in 2019; this will be used to inform the strategies, activities, proposals and demands of FoEI&#x2019;s Food Sovereignty program. The paper includes recommendations for how FoE national member groups can integrate the position into their work. Additionally, the script for an introductory/promotional video is also finished. These materials will be launched in 2022. Additionally, the program supported three pieces of work at the national level in Asia-Pacific countries that specifically included attention to gendered issues connected to their advocacy demands; (v) FoEI&#x2019;s Internationalist Solidarity System team, working with allies, carried out trainings for national member groups to build understanding of key concepts in relation to the defense of territories and gender justice and to learn how to detect and prevent situations that threaten women defenders we work with. Additionally, a report on threats to the rights of women environmental rights defenders in three countries in Latin America (&#x201C;Ser mujer, disidencia, defensora del territorio en Am&#xE9;rica Latina&#x201D;/&quot;To Be a Woman, Non-Binary Person, Defender of Territory in Latin America&#x201D;) was developed to be used in lobby activities in 2022.</narrative>

Therefore gender justice is specifically aimed for and addressed in all mentioned strands of work. [Relevant countries are not mentioned, in line with FGG&apos;s IATI exclusion policy].</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">[O.FoEI1]: FoEI is highly decentralised, comprising autonomous organisations (73) with a shared analysis of the root causes of today&apos;s most pressing environmental and social issues. FoEI is democratic, with a general meeting every two years to decide the federation&#x2019;s policies, reflect on the activities of the federation during the previous two years and consider strategies and activities going forward. All members have an equal say at this Biennial General Meeting (BGM). The membership elects an Executive Committee (ExCom) and confirms the International Programme Coordinators (IPCs) positions at the BGM.  FoEI&#x2019;s international programme work is facilitated by eight IPCs, two for each programme. IPCs are assisted by a programme steering group with member group representatives from all four global regions. IPCs are hosted by different FoE member groups around the world, to ensure that our international programme work remains rooted in the local reality of our member groups and the struggles they are involved in. IPCs working with the input and guidance of their steering groups develop strategies and positions, which are based on inputs gathered through consultative processes with member groups in all regions. IPCs and steering groups also carry out evaluation processes in order to reflect and learn from activities and strategies that have been implemented and make use of those lessons learned in the development of subsequent strategies and plans. Steering groups also play a role in signing off on external program communication and decisions to endorse campaigns, thereby helping to ensure that perspectives informed by member groups in all regions are considered. They are also involved in decision-making on selection of national-level lines of work to contribute to international program objectives. FoEI has regional structures in Africa, Asia-Pacific, Latin America and the Caribbean, and Europe, as well as a member group in Canada and the USA respectively. Regional Facilitators in Africa, Asia-Pacific and Latin America, based in a member group in each region, support each region, to ensure engagement in regional decision-making, strategy development and activity planning. In the European region a Brussels-based team coordinates the region. FoEI&#x2019;s Internationalist Solidarity System (ISS) which responds to violations and mobilises internationalist support for threatened peoples and communities, is supported by four focal points, one in each region. An international Membership Development Team (MDT) composed of regional representatives, implement the membership development strategy and consult with groups in their region on membership issues. FoEI&#x2019;s work to achieve Gender Justice and Dismantle Patriarchy within Friends of the Earth International and more widely is supported by a working group, composed of member group representatives from each region and the IPCs.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">FoEI and national CSOs will engage in advocacy activities at the national, regional and international level, including on the EU-Mercosur trade agreement (with CSOs from several countries in Latin America), BRI environmental governance (with CSOs from several countries in Asia), EU Directive on Due Diligence (with a CSO in Latin America), on the trade in plastic waste (with CSOs from Asia), in support of the UN Binding Treaty (with CSOs from all regions)  and against the corporate capture of UN spaces through multistakeholderism (with CSOs from all regions). Additionally, FoEI and CSOs will advocate for climate justice and against false solutions to the climate crisis (various), specifically to block carbon markets. A CSO in Africa will lobby for the right to water and energy and in several LLUMICs (Latin America, Asia) FoE member groups and allies will push for adoption of measures to protect the rights of environmental human rights defenders. FoEI will support groups seeking justice in cases of specific rights violations (a.o. a CSO in Latin America) and to block fossil fuels projects and dirty energy infrastructure (probably CSOs from all regions). The implementation of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Peasants and Other People Working in Rural Areas is a key instrument for achieving sustainable food systems; FoEI will lobby with member groups and allies for this to be taken up by the UN Committee for World Food Security and the UN Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. All this happens based on capacities of CSOs strengthened with the aid of FoEI with regards to a.o. movement building at the combined local, national, regional and global levels amongst CSOs and with communities, the development of alternatives, strategizing, research, development of positions, communication, press work, advocacy activities such as influencing and/or participating in decision-making processes.

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">[3.FoEI1(2,2x)]: With strategic and financial support from FoEI a CSO in a Latin American LLMIC and a local community experiencing threats and repression due to their opposition to a mega dam have strengthened their capacities to protect themselves by developing a risk analysis, putting in place security measures of collective protection and implementing a rapid response system to activate in case of EHRD violations. [Also counted under subindicator x as the activity aims at improving the community&apos;s civic space.]. [3.FoEI2(3,3x)]: FoEI supported a CSO in a Latin American UMIC, financially and strategically, to strengthen its advocacy capacity by developing a communication and legal strategy to advocate on behalf of local community leaders involved in community water management who were being threatened and stigmatized by different local institutional bodies.

Furthermore, with coordination support from FoEI an EHRD from a CSO in a Latin American UMIC working with communities affected by a hydroelectric project strengthened his capacity to defend his rights in a legal case. [Also counted under subindicator x as the activity aims at improving the EHRD&apos;s and community leaders&apos;/ communities&apos; civic space.]. [3.FoEI3(1,1x)]: With strategic and coordination support from FoEI and other international CSO networks a representative of a CSO from a Latin American UMIC addressed the Plenary Assembly of the 46th session of the United Nations Human Rights Council to condemn the systematic violence and repression against peasant organizations in their country.

[One CSO also counted under subindicator x, as access rights and control over their territory are aspects of the civic space that is pursued.]. [3.FoEI5(2,2x)]: With FoEI strategic and financial support two CSOs in Latin American UMICs advocated at the national and regional level to stop the EU-Mercosur trade agreement and campaign at the national and regional level to raise awareness amongst the general public and legislators on the negative environmental, social, economic and other impacts of the trade agreement. [See also 2.FoEI3]. [Counted under subindicator x as well, as the work aims to prevent the negative impacts of FTAs and investment treaties on democratic decision-making, and on the position of civil society vis-&#xE0;-vis the corporate sector]. [3.FoEI6(4)]: FoEI built the capacity of four CSOs in Asian LLMIC/UMICs on the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). FoEI monitored and informed member groups on developments in Chinese financed projects related to the BRI, developed and communicated messages about the BRI on social media, and built the knowledge of CSOs during a workshop about Chinese Foreign investment and the BRI at a CSO forum in one Asian country. The CSOs used this in their lobby and advocacy on the environmental, social, economic and other impacts of the BRI. [See also 6D.FoEI1]. [3.FoEI7(+2)]: With financial and communication support from FoEI, three CSOs in Latin American LLMIC/UMICs developed communication tools and used these in advocacy with local communities to address the environmental and social impacts of special economic zones (ZEEs or ZEDEs).

April 2021 FGG member TNI and FoEI published a study &apos;COVAX: A global multistakeholder group that poses political and health risks to developing countries and multilateralism&apos;. [Two CSOs already counted above]. [See also 6C.FoEI2]. [3.FoEI9(+2)]: With financial and strategic support from FoEI five CSOs in Asia, of which 4 from LLMIC/UMICs, strengthened their capacities to lobby and advocate together against the trade in plastic waste by developing resource materials such as the report &apos;Breaking the Plastic Cycle in Asia&apos; (published July 2021) and media work explaining the impacts of waste trade, international policy processes for a legally binding treaty on plastic production, legal actions, and local initiatives which show it is possible to produce and consume in a different, more sustainable and economically-viable way. Activities took place at the national, regional and international levels. A representative of one of the Asian LLMIC/UMIC CSOs, with interventions at a Spanish civil society conference organized by an alliance of six Spanish organizations, informed Spanish civil society and advocated for action in Spain in relation to the negative impacts of plastic waste imports in South East Asia on the well-being of the population, influencing the efforts of the alliance of six organisations to lobby Spanish parliamentarians on the legal reform on Waste and Contaminated Land in Spain. [Two CSOs already counted above]. [See also 4.FoEI2 and 6C.FoEI3]. [3.FoEI10(+5)]: FoEI contributed to (i) the strengthening of lobby and advocacy capacity of nine CSOs from African, Asian and Latin American LLMIC/UMICs working on the UNFCCC COP26 in Glasgow and at the national level by development and discussion of relevant analysis and policy briefings, development of joint strategies, strategy meetings, COP delegation coordination and engagement in delegation activities, and with financial support.

Furthermore, with financial and strategic inputs from FoEI, (ii) eight CSOs from Asian LLMIC/UMICs [of which three not also involved under (i)] strengthened their capacities to lobby and advocate together against carbon markets, net zero, nature-based solutions and other false solutions to the climate crisis at national, regional and international levels by evaluating the political processes and outcomes of the UNFCCC COP26, by submitting detailed comments on draft national guidance on carbon market mechanisms and participating in government consultation processes, by developing videos explaining net-zero for climate campaigners and by developing a joint advocacy plan for the coming year. Twelve individual climate campaigners from six of these CSOs have also set up an internal network for collective action and are able to communicate more effectively around climate justice. [See also 2.FoEI4 and 4.FoEI2]. [Seven CSOs already counted above]. [3.FoEI11(+0)]: FoEI supported one CSO in an African LLMIC with strategic, communications and coordination input to strengthen their capacity to resist a fossil fuel project in the country. Using that capacity, the CSO carried out lobby and advocacy at the national and international levels against the development of gas extraction and infrastructure in the country. [CSO already counted above]. [3.FoEI12(+0)]: With financial and strategic support from FoEI a CSO in a Latin American UMIC strengthened its capacities to lobby and advocate against fracking in their country.

[Counted under subindicator x as well, as this activity aims at increasing the power of civil society vis-&#xE0;-vis corporations by developing mandatory environmental and human rights due diligence (mEHRDD) law. One CSO already counted under x above.]. [3.FoEI15(+7,+9x,3g)]: With financial and strategic support from FoEI, ten national-level CSOs in Latin America, of which 9 from LLMIC/UMICs, and 5 regional-level CSOs in Latin America strengthened their capacity to lobby and advocate for political and legislative changes to regulate the growing power of transnational corporations in the energy and/or food sectors at national and regional level with: the development of a shared political analysis and joint strategy, built upon research on relevant regulatory frameworks and instruments in seven countries as well as a report on threats to the rights of women environmental rights defenders in three countries [count for subindicator g: 3]; participation in a regional strategy meeting; and the development of communication tools, including visuals and a series of podcasts addressing the role of corporations in rights violations. [Seven CSOs already counted above]. [Counted under subindicator x as well, as this activity aims at increasing the power of civil society vis-&#xE0;-vis corporations by developing mandatory environmental and human rights due diligence (mEHRDD) law. Five CSOs already counted under x above.]. [3.FoEI16(+1)]: With communication support from FoEI 12 CSOs from African, Asian and Latin American LLMIC/UMICs took action to increase international visibility of specific cases of environmental destruction and human right violations by corporations, and of the local, national and/or international CSO strategies (including litigation) to solve these problems, and demand justice (media work, mobilisation and lobby meetings with polticians and government representatives at the national and international levels). [11 CSOs already counted above].   [3.FoEI17(2,2x)]: In various ways FoEI supported the International Planning Committee for Food Sovereignty (IPC, a global platform of more than 300 million small-scale food producers and 6000 CSOs whose goal is to advance the Food Sovereignty agenda at the global and regional level). FoEI strategically supported the IPC Working Group on Land, Water, Forests and Territory to facilitate discussion among social movements to develop positions on financialization of territories by conducting a series of online workshops to discuss different aspects of financialization such as COVID-19, land, and a green economy. Furthermore, FoEI facilitated IPC discussions to help CSOs to follow the CSM process for the UN CFS negotiations on policy recommendations on Agroecology and other Innovative Approaches. With FoEI involvement the IPC working group also organised, together with UN FAO, a webinar on the Tool for Agroecology Performance Evaluation (TAPE). Furthermore, FoEI together with five members of the IPC&apos;s Ny&#xE9;l&#xE9;ni process task team publicly launched the regional and gobal processes that prepare for and culminate in the Global Forum on Food Soverignty in March 2023, as explained in the brochure &apos;Ny&#xE9;l&#xE9;ni. Towards a Global Forum on Food Sovereignty&apos;. The process aims to strengthen the movements, through the development of a new political framing and strategy to resist the expansion of the agribusiness model and advance agroecology and food sovereignty. Following its general meeting in April/May 2021, with strategic and technical support from FoEI, the IPC issued a statement making clear its position related to the Ny&#xE9;l&#xE9;ni process, CSM, FAO, CFS and UNFSS. Furthermore, FoEI strategically and in other ways supported the Civil Society and Indigenous Peoples&#x2019; Mechanism (CSM) of the UN Committee on World Food Security (CSF) (explained under 4.FoEI3, 5F.FoEI2 and 5F.FoEI3).

[3.FoEI18(+0)]: FoEI provided financial and strategic support to one CSO in an African LLMIC to strengthen their knowledge and evidence for advocacy through a national study on organic agriculture, agroecology and the role of the private sector. The study will inform national and regional dialogue and advocacy actions planned by the CSO for policies that support agroecology and food sovereignty. The research-based report and a magazine target national policy makers to increase awareness and advocate for policies supporting agroecology. [See also 2.FoEI10]. [CSO already counted above]. [3.FoEI19(+0,3g)]: FoEI provided financial support to 3 CSOs in Asian LLMICs to undertake research to strengthen their evidence to support advocacy for improved national Food Sovereignty policies and laws. National research involved included community and farmer consultations (documenting traditional and best practices), reviewing and developing possible recommendations for relevant national laws and policies. The papers focussed on women&#x2019;s experience, role and rights in agriculture, and the impact of agricultural practices on them. [Counted as well under subindicator g].

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">Capacity development at the regional level in Asia-Pacific (on FoEI&#x2019;s Internationalist Solidarity System (ISS), and food sovereignty ) and in Latin America and the Caribbean (on the ISS, food sovereignty and the UN Binding Treaty on Business and Human Rights), as well as internationally-organized capacity strengthening in relation to advocacy against false solutions to the climate crisis (such as so-called &apos;nature based solutions&apos;) and cross-program solutions (food sovereignty and agroecology, community-forest management, socially controlled renewable energy and public services/co-operatives) specifically aim at increasing civic space in the following ways: the ISS aims at protecting and defending EHRDs and with that contributing to an &apos;enabling environment&apos; for civil society in LLUMICs; FoEI&apos;s UN Treaty work includes advocating for inclusion of civil society in the negotiation and implementation of the treaty and ultimately aims at establishing at the global level a legal framework that can be used by civil society in LLUMICs that have weak laws or weak law enforcement, which allows and stimulates corporations to neglect civil rights and pollute the environment and commit other crimes; the work on food sovereignty and &apos;nature based solutions&apos; for instance aim at sovereignty of communities when deciding about their agriculture and food systems and the use of their territories, and independence from agribusiness and the fossil fuel industry in this regard.

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">FoEI will contribute to capacity building of 38 CSOs in Latin America, Asia-Pacific and Africa  in relation to advocacy and lobby for the UN Binding Treaty, in support of agroecology and food sovereignty, in relation to ISDS, the EU-Mercosur trade agreement and the trade in plastic waste, as well as environmental governance in relation to the Belt and Road Initiative, multistakeholderism and corporate capture of decision-making spaces. We will build knowledge and lobbying capacity on false solutions to the climate crisis, such as carbon markets and so-called nature-based solutions, and on real solutions featuring food sovereignty, biodiversity, economic justice and community-controlled renewable energy. Capacity will also be strengthened in relation to developing strategies and processes to support environmental human rights defenders in all regions.

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">[2.FoEI1(23,23x,18g)]: 23 CSOs from African, Asian and Latin American LLMIC/UMICs, took part in one or more of five sets (i-v) of trainings organized by FoEI that strengthened (i) their capacity to use FoEI&#x2019;s Internationalist Solidarity System (ISS) to mobilize international support to lobby and advocate against violations of the rights of environmental human rights defencers (EHRDs) and demand justice; (ii) their knowledge about the impact of the violence perpetrated on women defenders of territories and how to strategize in lobby and advocacy for their rights [the 18 CSOs participating in this set of trainings are also counted under sub-indicator g]; (iii) their capacity to document and analyze violations of EHRD&#x2019;s rights for use in lobby and advocacy; (iv) their capacity to use FoEI&#x2019;s Rapid Response System to follow-up on emergencies related to EHRDs at risk; and/or (v) their capacity for creative campaigning and applying tactics of environmental human rights defenders, with special attention to women defenders and the impacts they experience. [All LLUMIC CSOs in the entire outcome are also counted under sub-indicator x as the ISS work aims at increasing civic space in the countries and regions in question for the groups and EHRDs in question, as well as for civil society in general. In these trainings also non-LLUMIC CSOs participated. Those are not counted.]. [2.FoEI2(+0,+0x)]: FoEI as member of an international working group in which also FGG members TNI and IT for Change participate, and as co-organiser of a global webinar, contributed to strengthening the understanding of national and international CSOs on multi-stakeholderism and the potential negative impacts on global governance. Multi-stakeholderism provides opportunities for the corporate capture of governmental decision-making, ensuring it serves the interests of corporate business and profits instead of putting in place policies for the wellbeing of humanity. FoEI&apos;s and colleague CSOs&apos; alternative is building a strong public and participatory governance for a world beyond the current health, climate, inequality and democracy crises. [Not counted as no list of CSOs participating in the webinar is available. Also relevant for sub-indicator x.]. [2.FoEI3(12,12x,2g]: FoEI provided strategic and financial support to two CSOs in two Latin American UMICs [counted under 3.FoEI5] to strengthen the capacity of 13 UMIC CSOs in the region to advocate on the democratic, environmental, socio-economic and other impacts of the EU-Mercosur free trade agreement, and to develop and launch feminist emancipatory initiatives for a just and feminist recovery from the current crises. [1 CSO already counted above]. [Also counted under subindicator x, as the principal problem of trade agreements addressed is the related power shift from democratic institutions to corporations. Two CSOs involved in the feminist initiatives also counted under subindicator g].   [2.FoEI4(23)]: With FoEI strategic and financial support a CSO in an Asian UMIC [counted under 3.FoEI10] strengthened the capacity of 23 CSOs in the country to advocate and lobby against carbon markets, carbon offsetting and &apos;net zero&apos; by carrying out an awareness raising campaign on these issues with CSOs, indigenous communities and the public. [One CSO already counted above]. [2.FoEI5(+2)]: FoEI facilitated eleven CSOs from African, European, Asian and Latin American LLMIC/UMICs and two movement allies to share via a webinar and a workshop critical analysis (including a deepened gender analysis) and to develop for the food sovereignty movement positions on nature-based solutions to climate change (NBS) through one webinar for the federation and one workshop with movement allies. FoEI later submitted a contribution on NBS to the UN Committee on Economic Social and Cultural Rights (UNCESCR) consultation for the &apos;Draft general comment (No. 26) on Land and Economic, Social and Cultural Rights&apos;, raising awareness of the dangers of land sequestration for carbon capture. This document was also used by CSOs at the UNFCCC COP26 to raise concerns on NBS. [11 CSOs and movements already counted above]. [2.FoEI6(24,+25x)]: FoEI (i) financially and strategically supported two CSOs in African LLMICs [counted under 3.FoEI14] to strengthen capacities of 24 CSOs from eight African LLMICs/UMICs to engage at the national and UN levels in the UN Binding Treaty process, and challenge corporate rights violations through workshops, webinars, field trips, strategy meetings, network strengthening and undertaking joint actions. Furthermore, FoEI (ii) built the knowledge of three CSOs in Latin American UMICs on legislation for corporate regulation and due diligence through jointly developing advocacy materials and organising a seminar. [3 CSOs already counted above]. [Counted under subindicator x as well, as this activity aims at increasing the power of civil society vis-&#xE0;-vis corporations by developing mandatory environmental and human rights due diligence (mEHRDD) law. Two CSOs already counted for subindicator x above]. [2.FoEI7(+0)]: Representatives of nine CSOs from African, European, Asian and Latin American LLMIC/UMICs took part in a FoEI-organized five-session training course on economics, designed to strengthen their capacity to understand, analyze and engage in economic debates. [All CSOs already counted above]. [2.FoEI8(+0)]: Together with six CSOs from African and Latin American LLMIC/UMICs FoEI further developed its narratives on just recovery, just feminist transition, and energy solutions, contributing to strengthened capacities of these CSOs to advocate at the national level. [All CSOs already counted above]. [2.FoEI9(+0)]: FoEI supported one CSO from a Latin American UMIC to develop and highlight their Transformative Cities Initiative to increase the visibility of their economic justice solutions. [CSO already counted above]. [2.FoEI10(4)]: FoEI provided financial support to three CSOs [one of which is counted under 3.FoEI18] and two communities from an African LLMIC to participate in a training and knowledge exchange on agroecological practices to stengthen their ability to communicate and promote agroecology to support their advocacy with policy makers. [2.FoEI11(+1)]: FoEI provided strategic support to three CSOs, from a European, an Asian and a Latin American LLMIC/UMIC, to develop lobby work plans to guide their advocacy for improved regulation relating to community forest management and IPLC&apos;s rights at a national level. [Two CSOs already counted above].  [2.FoEI12(13,13x,1g)]: FoEI contributed to capacity development of 13 additional LLUMIC CSOs. Description is included under indicator 3. [13 CSOs also counted under subindicator x. 1 CSO also counted under subindicator g.].</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">Capacity strengthening of CSOs (a.o. aimed at capacities relevant for movement building at the combined local, national, regional and global levels amongst CSOs and with communities, the development of alternatives, strategizing, research, development of positions, communication, press work, advocacy activities such as influencing and/or participating in decision-making processes) in relation to promoting FoEI solutions (agroecology, economic justice, community-controlled renewable energy, promotion of biodiversity and community forest management) each of which is based on a framework that includes and promotes gender justice. The link to gender justice will be made in capacity strengthening efforts in the context of internationally-organized work, region-level work and in some national level work supported through FGG. Development of positioning on industrial livestock and meat consumption and knowledge building sessions on nature-based solutions will also include building capacities to analyse how these threaten women&#x2019;s rights and gender justice.
