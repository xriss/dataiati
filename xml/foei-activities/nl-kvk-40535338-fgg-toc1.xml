   <narrative xml:lang="EN">FGG FoEI ToC 1: Improved Corporate Conduct</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">A. Enabling environment. Both the rights and the legal and political spaces needed to claim and defend those rights are protected for people, communities and civil society actors, enabling them to address misconduct and grievances successfully, and promote improved corporate conduct and related governmental regulation. B. Capacities strengthened. Increased capacity of civil society actors to research, network and advocate in relation to the conduct of corporations has been increased. C. Alternatives developed. A range of alternative, participatory initiatives and models related to corporate conduct have been developed, piloted and promoted by FGG and civil society actors, from best practices through to enforceable multi-stakeholder agreements. D. Agendas set. Private and public sector decision makers have prioritised improvement measures due to support from influential civil society actors, critical media attention, increased public awareness and effective scrutiny of corporate conduct. E. Policies changed. These include improved government and corporate policies on corporate accountability, including transparency and safeguards policies, conflict resolution mechanisms, and policies promoting social justice, decent work and sustainability. F. Practice changed. Improved corporate policies and government regulations have been put into practice and enforced.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">FGG&#x2019;s goal is to ensure that improved corporate conduct advances social justice and environmental sustainability. Like Minister Ploumen, we believe that corporations, including private banks, have a role in and responsibility for fighting poverty and injustice and promoting inclusive and sustainable development. This includes - but goes beyond - a &#x2018;business-as-usual&#x2019; approach to corporate accountability. It requires a fundamental change in corporate conduct, including changes to basic decisions about investment, buying practices and sourcing. Not just on paper, but in practice. Although progress has been made, evidence that corporations are eschewing their social and environmental responsibility is abundant and affirmed by FGG partners. Massive infrastructure and extractives projects have destroyed and damaged ecosystems and the natural resources that communities rely upon, and forced people from their land, as well as emitting climate damaging greenhouse gases. Key sectors responsible include the extractive industry and agribusiness, including their financiers and purchasers. When abuses are revealed, corporations often withdraw, leaving affected communities deprived of livelihoods. Those adversely affected by corporate conduct rarely see remedy. Through globalisation, companies have acquired greater power and legal rights without a parallel increase in accountability. Acting within complex transnational structures, networks of business relationships, financing arrangements, and global supply chains, companies can avoid responsibility for their conduct. We believe this corporate &#x2018;governance gap&#x2019; must be closed for social justice, and environmental sustainability to prevail. This requires rules, regulations and enforcement, and improvements in corporate governance, business models and business practices, including the active promotion of sustainability, and fostering local, vibrant, small-scale and sustainable businesses. It also requires creating an enabling environment in which human rights are respected.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">[FoEI1(1)]: In 2020, FoEI contributed(financing, capacity development of CSOs, facilitating the use) to the ongoing implementation of its Internationalist Solidarity System  (ISS, developed by FoEI together with LLMIC and non-LLMIC member groups) that addresses prevention, rapid response, monitoring, and mobilization of solidarity actions in relation to the violation of rights of environmental human rights defenders (EHRDs) in Asia Pacific and Latin America. (See 1.B FoEI6 for examples of the application of the ISS, and of capacity building workshops for CSOs FoEI organised on the ISS).
[FoEI2(1)]: In collaboration with the Make Big Polluters Pay coalition, FoEI in September 2020 launched the Liability Roadmap (https://liabilityroadmap.org) that outlines how decision-makers and movements can hold polluting industries liable for the climate damage they knowingly cause. The Liability Roadmap provides tools for the local, national and international levels. The roadmap contains for each of these levels, and multilevel, a variety of approaches that can be harnessed depending upon the type of leadership one holds.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">[FoEI1(2)]: FoEI provided financial and organizational support for an EHRD coordinator in the Asia-Pacific region that is to assist national groups in the region in their EHRD work. This EHRD coordinator worked with national FoE groups in the region (from Bangladesh, Indonesia, Malaysia, Palestine, Philippines, Russia, Sri Lanka) (including at a meeting in Asia in July), to co-coordinate a regional publication &apos;Defending territories, Defending our lives: Protecting human rights and the environment in Asia Pacific through system change&apos; for which the CSOs provided case studies (launched in December, promoted on social media and by FoEI&#x2019;s Real World Radio) which puts forwards demands to national governments in relation to the UN Treaty demands, as well to the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) and governments within ASEAN. These demands include (1) a push for the ASEAN human rights mechanism, the ASEAN Intergovernmental Commission on Human Rights (AICHR) to become a judicial body with the power to intervene when there are abuses and violations against Defenders of Territories, and to enforce its judgements; and (2) to allow AICHR to accept complaints from CSOs and aggrieved parties after all national remedies have been exhausted and provide the commissioners with powers to investigate violations against defenders and recommend appropriate actions. The publication will be a tool in advocacy and lobby in 2020 for CSOs in the Asia-Pacific region.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">[FoEI1&amp;2]: In 2016, knowledge and advocacy skills on the UN Treaty on TNCs and human rights process have increased in Asia, Africa, and Latin America through FGG-funded projects. The capacity-building of WALHI/FoE Indonesia, JA/FoE Mozambique, CESTA/FoE El Salvador, and CEIBA/FoE Guatemala has enabled them to strengthen their engagement in the international FoEI programme work on the UN Treaty process and to connect it with their national work against corporate abuses. This has included: benefitting from knowledge- and experience-sharing on the corporate abuse work and joint strategising for advocacy demands in relation to that through regular programme calls and meetings, joint preparation of the FoEI input to the October 2016 UN Intergovernmental Working Group (IGWG) meeting in Geneva (providing national examples of corporate abuses as evidence of the need for binding regulations on TNCs and jointly preparing FoEI recommendations for future treaty provisions), participation in the FoEI delegation present at the October 2016 IGWG meeting (the 4 CSOs made oral interventions in the plenary session on behalf of FoEI and took part in advocacy meetings with government representatives happening all throughout the week). Key speakers from FoE at the UN IGWG negotiations were female. They highlighted how women are specifically affected by (the impacts of) corporate misconduct. In all four of the countries, an emphasis was put on reaching out to remote communities that suffer direct impacts of transnational companies&apos; operations and this gave the opportunity to discuss and highlight the very specific impacts of such projects on and with women. [FoEI3&amp;4]: In 2016, the work with 4 CSOs on the UN Treaty (WALHI/FoE Indonesia, JA/FoE Mozambique, CESTA/FoE El Salvador, and CEIBA/FoE Guatemala) has also contributed to strengthening the capacity of the CSO representatives to campaign and advocate more confidently and effectively on the topic of business and human rights when back home. For example in Central America groups organized 4 community workshops, 2 CSO skillshare/workshops, and published 2 studies relevant to this area of work. [FoEI5]: In Mozambique, the legal capacities of the national member group JA/FoE Mozambique have been developed in relation to (1) pressuring the government to establish and respect minimum human rights and environmental standards and hold companies accountable and (2) to work in this regard with communities impacted by mining operations. Activities included community-level trainings, information gathering, public awareness processes, and participation in the Southern Africa Permanent Peoples Tribunal. [FoEI6]: In Honduras, 12 local Honduran CSOs and 8 regional-level CSOs are better able to continue their core work as environmental watchdog organizations as a result of having strengthened protection strategies, protocols and mechanisms. In May 2016, Honduran CSO Asociaci&#xF3;n Madre Tierra/FoE Honduras organized a national HRD strategy meeting with 12 local Honduran CSOs and Amigos de la Tierra Espa&#xF1;a - oficina Hondure&#xF1;a. In addition, CSOs from 8 other Latin American countries also participated in the event (REDES/FoE Uruguay, CEIBA/FoE Guatemala, Otros Mundos/FoE Mexico, CESTA/El Salvador, CODEFF/FoE Chile, Coecoceiba/FoE Costa Rica, NAT/FoE Brasil and CENSAT/FoE Colombia). Participating organisations analysed together the national and regional level trends associated with the &quot;displacement of indigenous peoples from ancestral territories&quot;; &quot;the context and situation of Human Rights Defenders&quot;; and &quot;neoliberalism in Latin America&quot;. The participating organizations developed and agreed protocols and an HRD emergency response system able to connect otherwise isolated Honduran CSOs at the local level to CSO networks at national, regional and international levels. [FoEI7]: In Guatemala, 11 local Guatemalan organizations and 5 regional-level CSOs are able to better continue their core work as environmental watchdog organizations as a result of having strengthened protection strategies, protocols and mechanisms. In November 2016, Guatemalan CSO CEIBA/FoE Guatemala organized a national HRD strategy meeting and HRD training with organizations from Guatemala, REDES/FoE Uruguay, NAT/FoE Brazil, Madre Tierra/FoE Honduras and CESTA/El Salvador. Participating organizations were trained on digital security and on tactics to better ensure personal safety of CSO staff and communities with which they work. Protocols for rapid reponse as well as prevention were agreed, with clear division of local-regional roles, connecting community based HRDs to regional and international Human Rights networks, as well as to the UN Special Rapporteur on Human Rights Defenders, Michel Forst. Country-specific strategies for bringing perpetrators to justice in both Guatemala and Honduras were agreed. [FoEI8]: 15 environmental CSOs from 9 Latin American countries are better able to mobilize women to engage and take on leadership roles related to environmental campaigning as a result of participating in a skillshare and training focused on &apos;mobilizing grassroots women&apos; for environmental protection. In Honduras, 13-20 May 2016, women from CSOs REDES/FoE Uruguay, CEIBA/FoE Guatemala, Otros Mundos/FoE Mexico, CESTA/FoE El Salvador, CODEFF/FoE Chile, Coecoceiba/FoE Costa Rica, NAT/FoE Brasil, Madre Tierra/FoE Honduras and CENSAT/FoE Colombia came together to analyze local, national and regional trends related to the disprorationate negative impact on women of unsustainable development projects, as well as the challenges particular to women environmental campaigners, within both CSOs and the communities with which they work. To this end, women shared skills, tactics and developed strategies for promoting women&apos;s leadership within their organizations and among their respective constituencies. [FoEI9]: 5 environmental CSOs from 5 African countries are better able to mobilize women to engage and take on leadership roles related to environmental campaigning as a result of participating in a skillshare and training focused on &apos;mobilizing grassroots women&apos; for environmental protection. In Cameroon, 16-17 August 2016, women CSO leaders from CED/FoE Cameroon, SDI/FoE Liberia, ERA/FoE Nigeria, Les Amis de la Terre/FoE Togo and NAPE/FoE Uganda, came together to analyze local, national and regional trends related to the disporporationate negative impact on women of unsustainable development projects, as well as the challenges particular to women environmental campaigners, within both CSOs and the communities with which they work. To this end, women shared skills, tactics and developed strategies for promoting women&apos;s leadership within their organizations and among their respective constituencies. Participants agreed communications strategies to strengthen the visibility of African women environmentalists, and issued a related statement, which was then circulated internationally.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">[FoEI1(1)]: 1 CSO in a Latin American LLMIC increases its capacity to support local communities to resist, campaign and advocate against the further development of a hydro electric dam that will harm local communities. The CSO will use the increased capacity to provide the communities training on gender inclusive advocacy and campaigning, to monitor the development of the hydro project and security on the ground, and to build networks with other CSOs to support the case. FoEI will contribute to this result by providing the CSO with financial, communication and strategic campaigning support. [FoEI2(1)]: 1 CSO in an Asian LLMIC is enabled to provide legal support to local communities in legal cases against violations by corporations grabbing and polluting their ancestral territory. FoEI will contribute with strategic support to improve the strategising capacity of the CSO and provide funds for the CSO&#x2019;s activities with the communities. [FoEI3(1)]: 1 CSO in a Latin American LLMIC is enabled to strengthen a network of people affected by climate change, women&apos;s groups, indigenous people, and other organized groups to support their campaigning and advocacy towards the government for corporate accountability. FoEI contributes to this result through financial support for the national group and contributing to the strategic capacities of the national group. [FoEI4(+0)]: FoEI will support (networking, strategizing, research, communication) and coordinate an international working group (including CSOs from at least 2 LLMICs) that will effectively campaign at national and international level for a strong UN Binding Treaty. [Groups probably involved already counted above or under]. [FoEI5(3)]: FoEI will provide financial and strategic support to a CSO in an African LLMIC for their efforts to further build a network of CSOs in the African region fighting against corporate impunity and advocating for the Binding Treaty; to support at least 2 African CSOs from LLMICs to advocate towards their governments to ensure African states support and lead the UN treaty process; and to support communities in their fights against transnational corporations&#x2019; violations of their rights.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">[FoEI1(1)]: FoEI supported (financial, communication and strategic campaigning support) a CSO in a Latin American LLMIC to strengthen their collaboration with allies and affected communities through joint analysis and advocacy in relation to the social and environmental crisis in the light of the Covid pandemic, the privatization of water, proper waste management and the banning of single-use plastics, public debt, and criticizing free trade agreements. 
[FoEI2(1)]: FoEI supported (financial and strategic support) a CSO in an Asian LLMIC to enable them to support indigenous communities with paralegal trainings and assistance in court cases to protest the illegal operations of a gold mine in their territory, resist harassment by guards and paramilitary, and advocate towards the local government and the court to uphold legal orders and codes that ban mining.   
[FoEI3(1)]: FoEI financially supported a CSO in a Latin American LLMIC to strengthen their collaboration with trade unions and other CSO networks through joint analysis and advocacy on the social, environmental and political situation in the country. This resulted in several national and international networking meetings of CSOs, community leaders, farmers, municipality officials a.o. to analyze the social and environmental crisis in light of the Covid pandemic; public debt; waste management; and in joint campaign efforts such as press conferences e.g. to criticize the privatization of water and present water management proposals; and to criticize free trade agreements and the import of food, to the detriment of local production.
[FoEI4(3)]: FoEI supported (networking, strategizing, research, communication) and coordinated an international working group, consisting of CSOs participating in networks such as the FoE network and the Global Campaign to Reclaim Peoples Sovereignty, Dismantle Corporate Power and Stop Impunity (Global Campaign), that campaigned for a strong UN Binding Treaty on Business and Human Rights. In preparation of the 6th Open-Ended Inter-Governmental Working Group (IGWG) meeting (October) FoEI had strategising calls with the FoE delegation and the Global Campaign; organised online workshops and webinars in Asia, Latin America and Africa; shared the inputs of the Global Campaign on the Treaty text with member states; met with delegations of members states in Geneva during the 6th IGWG; and made direct interventions during the UN Informal Binding Treaty consultations and the 6th IGWG negotiations. Three FoE groups from LLMICs (Mozambique, Togo, Indonesia) spoke directly to the UN floor during the consultations and negotiations.  
[FoEI5(+0)]: FoEI supported (financial and strategic support) a CSO in an African LLMIC to further strengthen a network of CSOs in Africa to advocate for a strong UN Binding Treaty at the national and regional level; to build the knowledge of CSOs on corporate impunity and human rights; to strengthen communities to monitor the rights violations by TNCs and to support court cases against these violations. The network wrote joint letters to African governments and to regional bodies (such as ECOWAS), ensured the UN treaty issues were discussed in workshops and events, developed specific African demands for the treaty text and reached out to other national organizations working on similar issues. [CSO already counted under the previous outcome].
[FoEI6(+9)]: In the framework of its Internationalist Solidarity System (ISS) that addresses prevention, rapid response, monitoring, and mobilization of solidarity actions in relation to the violation of rights of environmental human rights defenders (EHRDs) (see 1.C FoEI1), FoEI worked on fifteen cases of violation of rights of EHRDs, (4 in Africa, supporting 3 LLMIC CSOs/EHRDs); 4 in Asia, supporting 3 LLMIC CSOs/EHRDs); 6 in Latin America, supporting 3 LLMIC CSOs/EHRDs), a.o. by providing emergency support, advising, documenting cases and raising public awareness of them, ad hoc advocacy, mobilizing CSOs and the general public to demand justice for affected communities through calls for action and the support and endorsement of statements. FoEI further built capacity of groups in national and regional workshops dealing with shrinking democratic space in the region (in Africa, the Middle East, Asia, one Asian LLMIC, Latin America, with the participation of 3 additional LLMIC CSOs. The findings in these workshops were used by the CSOs involved, including tens of CSOs that participated but that are not counted here, to strengthen their advocacy and EHRD work, and to further strengthen the joint ISS work. [Three CSOs already counted above].</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">[FoEI1(6)]: Through the continued development of EHRD training curricula, EHRD workshops at regional level, the strengthening of an urgent alert and response mechanism at the national, regional and international level, and advocacy delegations, FoEI will strengthen the capacity of 6 LLMIC CSOs from Latin America, Africa and Asia that these CSOs will apply to effectively seek justice in the case of human rights violations, including against women EHRDs, through the use of UN mechanisms and international solidarity action. Through these same activities, and FoEI coordination, capacity amongst these LLMIC CSOs will also be strengthened that these groups will apply in their advocacy for a UN binding treaty to regulate the activities of transnational corporations (TNCs). [FoEI2(+0)]: With the support of FoEI (campaign, communications, research and info-gathering support, as well as legal knowledge building), which will strengthen the capacity in these fields of 1 LLMIC CSO in Africa, this CSO will undertake advocacy and possibly litigation to push for accountability of fossil fuel corporations for negative environmental and social impacts. [FoEI3(+3)]: 7 LLMIC CSOs, together with 1 CSO in Europe, with FoEI communications, campaigning and/or financial support that will strengthen the capacity of these CSOs in these fields, will work on blocking eight dirty energy projects. FoEI will also contribute to the CSOs&apos; advocacy work aiming at internationalizing these cases.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">[FoEI1(15)]: FoEI prepared and coordinated the FoE delegation to the 5th negotiation round in October 2019 in Geneva of the UN Inter-Governmental Working Group (IGWG), consisting a.o. of 6 CSOs from LLMICs in Asia (Indonesia, Philippines), Africa (Mozambique, Uganda, Togo) and Latin America (El Salvador), in order to effectively make use of UN mechanisms to seek redress and to advocate for a binding UN Treaty on Business and Human Rights to regulate the activities of transnational corporations. The groups applied strategizing and lobby capacities (that were strengthened in cooperation with FoEI) in meetings with their country delegates to convey FoEI&#x2019;s jointly developed proposals for the treaty text and made oral statements in the IGWG plenary. The mentioned groups, and other groups (including 9 from LLMICs in Asia (Bangladesh, India, Nepal, PNG, Sri Lanka, Timor Leste) and Latin America (Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras)) were trained by FoEI in regional sessions and applied the lobby and strategizing capacities strengthened in lobby towards governments in their country and/or region and/or globally in FoEI&apos;s Economic Justice Programme in regards to their and other governments&apos; position with respect to the UN Treaty process. In some of the regional sessions organised by FoEI and/or national FoE groups also representatives of the labour, feminist and peasant movements from the region took part, to strengthen network building in support of the UN Binding Treaty. Furthermore, FoEI provided financial support for a research project in 2019 involving 10 CSOs in the Latin America region (including LLMICs El Salvador, Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras) that investigated and analysed the economic activity of 27 regional TNCs, leading to a deeper understanding of how TNCs operate in the region and strengthened the capacity of the CSOs in how to identify new forms of business cooperation and how to relate them to the violation of human rights. The research is used to strengthen the CSOs&apos; ongoing lobby and advocacy for a UN Binding Treaty and to effectively seek justice following rights violations. [FoEI2(+0)]: FoEI has strategically, financially and with communications work supported 1 LLMIC CSO from Africa (Uganda) and two local community representatives to undertake litigation to push for accountability of a fossil fuel corporation for the negative environmental and social impacts resulting from a mega oil project in their country. FoEI further supported financially and with knowledge building on litigation 1 LLMIC CSO from Asia (Philippines) to support rural communities and indigenous people affected by large-scale mining, agricultural and dam projects and advance their legal cases against these companies and lobby for reforming mining bills, in order to protect the rights of the indigenous people. [CSOs already counted above]. [FoEI3(+3)]: FoEI supported 5 CSOs in Asian (Indonesia, Sri Lanka), African (Mozambique, Togo) and Latin American (Honduras) LLMICs to campaign and lobby towards governments and fossil fuel and mining companies to block dirty energy projects: coal mining in the two Asian countries; gas and mining projects in the African country in which European and African oil and mining companies are involved; offshore oil projects in another African country; and a dam project in the Latin American country. In the last project in the Latin American LLMIC, the national CSO, in order to strengthen them in their fight against the dam, brought communities and 3 indigenous community groups fighting dams together to discuss their common struggles and strategies of resistance. FoEI&apos;s support involved a.o. international communication, gathering international CSO support, facilitating access to stakeholders, and financing [CSOs already counted above; 3 indigenous community groups in the Latin American LLMIC counted]. [FoEI4(+3)]: In order to protect EHRDs suffering serious and life threatening human rights violations as a consequence of corporate control of their territories and natural resources, FoEI distributed emergency funds to CSOs in 4 LLMICs in Africa (Cameroon, Togo, Uganda) and Latin America (Honduras) to protect the individuals, and contributed to strategizing and communication, leading to strengthened capacities that were applied in the EHRD cases at hand. Furthermore, as a result of FoEI-funded regional facilitation and capacity strengthening activities, more than 20 CSOs (including in 7 LLMICs in Asia (Philippines, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, PNG) and Africa (Kenya, Mozambique, Uganda)) took part in a coordinated solidarity action in October to put pressure on the Indonesian government following the murder of environmental justice lawyer, Golfrid Siregar. The CSOs sent or delivered letters demanding justice, and in some cases they met with embassy personnel. FoEI also supported the case and action with regional and international communications work, including with coverage on its Real World Radio. Furthermore, FoEI&apos;s EHRD coordinator worked with national groups to continue to develop the federation&#x2019;s Internationalist Solidarity System, and strengthen alliances with relevant organizations in the region, to support CSOs to increase visibility and solidarity when human rights violations occurred. [3 CSOs not yet counted above]. [FoEI5(0)]: FoEI supported an EHRD security capacity building seminar in a Latin American UMIC in March for 15 national and regionally working CSOs. This activity resulted in increased digital security knowledge for the CSOs, strengthened communications skills for international advocacy on issues related to corporate conduct and the work of EHRDs, while the visibility of struggles provides a form of protection, the strengthening of national and regional allies networks, and the development of an initial action protocol for the protection of EHRDs facing violence or the threat of violence. [Not counted as the organisations are from Latin American UMICs].</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">[FoEI1(2)]: With the strategizing and financial support of FoEI, a CSO from the Philippines advocated towards the national parliament for the adoption of the Alternative Minerals and Management Bill (AMMB). The CSO from Philippines also supported a CBO to build a case against companies encroaching on their ancestral land and advocate for a halt to these projects. [FoEI2(7)]: A CSO from Mozambique supported six communities affected by TNCs by increasing their awareness and understanding of human rights, community rights, land ownership rights through trainings; by organising debate around ways to mobilize to hold corporations accountable; building legal capacities and knowledge on constitutional and fundamental rights, and how to seek for justice in national courts. This enabled the communities to further mobilize and pressure the companies and government to respect the communities&#x2019; rights. Furthermore, the CSO from Mozambique has been active in the Reference Group of the Southern African Campaign to Dismantle Corporate Power throughout the year and collaborated with the coalition to organise the Permanent Peoples Tribunal (PPT) on TNCs in South Africa. The CSO from Mozambique also supported two of the mentioned communities to present their cases and share their experiences at the PPT. FoEI co-financed this work and contributed to strategizing. [FoEI3(+6)]: FoEI gave strategizing and content support to CSOs (including from LLMICs Mozambique, Liberia, Uganda, Togo, Palestine, Bangladesh, the Philippines, Indonesia) to advocate for and mobilize around the UN Binding Treaty process and the 4th IGWG session in Geneva. This resulted in 8 groups from LLMICs meeting with their government officials and discussing their support for the Binding Treaty process. Groups from non-LLMICs supported the network by advocating non-LLMIC governments to support the UN Treaty. [2 of the 8 already counted above]. [FoEI4(1)]: FoEI supported (financially, and in coordination and facilitation) a regional strategizing meeting in El Salvador, in May, with representatives of 12 national-level CSOs from Latin America, as well as representatives of the labor, feminist and peasant movements from the region, which strengthened the network building in support of the UN Binding Treaty. A delegation of five representatives (including from a CSO from El Salvador) met with the El Salvador government to discuss the UN Binding Treaty. [FoEI5(+4)]: To deepen the knowledge and generate public discussion on the human rights impacts of transnational corporations in Central America, a Salvadoran CSO with financial and conceptual support from FoEI conducted a regional study &#x2018;Women defending life and natural assets: cases of Central America&#x2019; and together with a CSO from Honduras organized a public event in October in Honduras in which 3 women&apos;s organizations and community groups could discuss the cases with representatives of mayors&apos; offices and leaders of urban and rural areas. The participants developed a proposal for a sub-regional feminist solidarity network as well as proposals for collective self-care for themselves and other women HRDs, which will be implemented in 2019. [FoEI6(+1)]: A CSO from Honduras has supported 2 communities, affected by the construction of a dam, by connecting them with legal CSOs, strengthening their campaigning strategies and lobby and advocacy capacities, and by nationalising their case. With this support the communities were able to bring their case to the national government and halt the construction of the dam. [1 of 2 communities already counted above]. [FoEI7(+0)]: A CSO from Togo with financial support from FoEI increased knowledge of their staff on techniques to mobilize people for advocacy and campaigning by organising a workshop for staff, community members affected by oil projects, and members of CSOs. Further, the findings of research (conducted by the CSO from Togo with support of a consultant) on the potential impact of offshore oil drilling on livelihoods and the environment with a focus on fish possessing women in the communities, enabled the CSO to take up messages and demands from the communities in their campaign. [CSO from Togo already counted above]. [FoEI8(+0)]: 30 participants (6 from LLMICs: Bangladesh, Indonesia, Mozambique, Togo, Uganda and El Salvador) took part in the FoEI convened international Political Formation Meeting in April in Cuba. This event resulted in the production of a large amount of resources that are being written up as methodological guides (work continues into 2019) and pedagogical learnings that influenced the methodologies of FoEI&apos;s regional Schools of Sustainability and strategising meetings in 2018. The participants strongly strengthened their positions and conceptualisation linked to system change, gender justice and dismantling patriarchy and human rights defenders, thereby building their capacity to defend positions externally. This international event is part of an ongoing FoEI process to strengthen capacities for campaigning and lobby and advocacy through participative and inclusive collective learning based on the principles and strategic positions of the federation. FoEI provided logistical and financial support for this event. [all CSOs already counted above].</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">[FoEI1:] In 2017 knowledge and advocacy skills on the UN Treaty on TNCs and human rights process continued to be increased in Asia, Africa and Latin America through FoEI funded projects. Capacity building of one LLMIC African, one LLMIC Asian, and one LLMIC Central American CSO enabled them to strengthen their engagement in international FoE network efforts to lobby and advocate for a binding Treaty on Transnational Corporations (TNCs) and other business with respect to Human Rights at the United Nations, to do so at the national level and to connect it with their national work against corporate abuses and proposals for legislative changes. Through FoEI&#x2019;s ongoing international coordination to lobby and advocate for the UN Treaty, the engagement of additional organizations &#x2013; one LLMIC African, two LLMIC Asian, one LLMIC Middle Eastern, one LLMIC Central American &#x2013; in international level processes (strategy development, development of lobby materials, participation in advocacy or lobby events) and/or at the national and regional levels was also facilitated. [FoEI2:] Through financial support and coordination FoEI supported representatives of two LLMIC Central American civil society organizations to take part in meetings (Brussels, October) with the European External Action Service of the European Union, and a Dutch Permanent Representative Official for Human Rights to the European Union to discuss the dangerous reality for environmental human rights defenders in their country, including murder, disappearances, illegal incarceration, threats and harassment to activists and family members. [FoEI3:] With financial support from FoEI, throughout 2017 one Mozambique CSO continued to support three legal processes involving rights violations by corporations. FoEI contributed to building capacity of this group and communities in the country, and exchange among African groups, with respect to legal action, finances, assessing gender impacts of TNC operations, mobilising communities. This contributed a.o. to a bigger involvement of women&#x2019;s associations in the activities related to corporate abuse, and an increasing ability to make visible the impacts endured by women living in the region of corporate megaprojects. [FoEI4:] With financial support from FoEI, one Philippines CSO continued to advocate for the Alternative Minerals Management Bill, to support legal claims of a community people against a mining company and to take part in preparations for the review of the Indigenous People&#x2019;s Rights Act (IPRA), including conducting a roundtable discussion with communities and support organizations on their experiences on IPRA implementation and recommendations on how it can genuinely benefit IP communities.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">FoEI1: The proposal for a UN Treaty on TNCs and HR is moving forward at the UN Human Rights Council dedicated Intergovernmental Working Group (IGWG). A FoEI delegation (composed of 20 representatives from 12 countries amongst which El Salvador, Bangladesh, Guatemala, Mozambique, Indonesia, Cameroon, Nigeria and Palestine) took part in the October 2016 working session in Geneva. The FoE network put forward concrete recommendations for what a future treaty could look like through a legal submission (see http://www.foei.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/UN-Treaty-TNCs-submission-English.pdf) and oral input during presentations on the official panel that included testimonies about corporate misconduct in the countries of the FoE representatives, and interventions in the session. FoEI&apos;s legal submission was also the basis of follow up discussions with UN experts, key ambassadors and important CSO constituencies. The proposal is illustrated with cases of corporate misconduct in a.o. Indonesia, Nigeria, Mozambique, Honduras and El Salvador and calls for a UN Treaty that a.o. embraces all human rights and all human rights violations; focuses on TNCs including subsidiaries and on value chains; and establishes a World Court on TNCs and Human Rights as a mechanism of international control, enforcement and implementation of binding rules.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">[FoEI1(1)]: During the 6th session of the OEIGWG (see 1.B FoEI3) 15 UN member states declared they were in favor of an ambitious Binding Treaty supporting demands that are also reflected in the Global Campaign analysis and proposals. The CSO network Global Campaign to Reclaim Peoples Sovereignty, Dismantle Corporate Power and Stop Impunity (Global Campaign), including FoEI and FoE member groups, had advocated towards UN member states for demands for a more ambitious Binding Treaty. FoEI and FoE member groups in several countries had called upon parliamentarians and local authorities to share their visions and key points for a UN Binding Treaty on Business and Human Rights proposal and to support the treaty process. An African CSO group (Mozambique) supported by FoEI was involved in setting up a network of local authorities who spoke out in support of the Treaty. 
[FoEI2(0)]: [Results on the agriculture dossier are reported under ToC2 2.D].
[FoEI3(1)]: FoEI&apos;s position on the Covid-19 crisis, a.o. published in the article &apos;COVID-19 crisis is a wake up call for system change&apos; (April 2020), the paper &apos;Principles for a Just Recovery based on environmental, social, gender and economic justice&apos; (August 2020), and the report &apos;Feminist Economics and Environmentalism for a Just Recovery. Outlooks from the South&apos; (October 2020, together with World March of Women, and The Latin American Network of Women Transforming the Economy (REMTE)), was discussed with social movements, amongst which the trade justice movement, the food sovereignty movement, and the climate justice movement, in many webinars organised by these movements and/or FoEI, and was used by the latter two movements as input to positions they produced.
[FoEI4(3)]: A CSO in an Asian LLMIC successfully advocated for a national alternative mining bill, and received support from a senator who spoke out in favor of this alternative mining bill, co-developed by CSOs. Furthermore FoEI supported this CSO to support indigenous communities in court cases against mining operations. They successfully advocated for the local government and provincial court to uphold a suspension order and an environmental code which bans open-pit mining. 
[FoEI5(1)]: Following outreach by 205 CSOs to seven companies involved in gas extraction in one African LLMIC, and to that country&#x2019;s government, the United Nations Special Rapporteur (UN SR) on the Situation of Human Rights Defenders, the United Nations Special Rapporteur on Human Rights and the Environment, and the African Commission on Human and Peoples&#x2019; Rights to demand respect for human rights and an end to the development of gas extraction, the UN SR on the Situation of Human Rights Defenders requested more information on the case. The media also took action to cover the case.
[FoEI6(1)]: The case of kidnapping and violation of rights of members of an indigenous community in a Central American LLMIC, and the CSO demand for the safe return alive of the kidnapped and an end to systematic violence in the country, was discussed in a meeting with the European External Action Service, at a meeting with the EU delegation to this country and during a webinar with MEPs and others on human rights violations and the role of the EU. This happened after a call to action and letters from FoEI supported by many CSOs worldwide.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">[FoEI1(20)]: FoEI supported (with joint strategy development, coordination and content) FoE member groups to discuss the UN Binding Treaty process and FoE proposals for the content with the UN IGWG Chair, their national governments, their national representatives at the IGWG in Geneva in October, and other parties. FoE engagement thus contributed to the UN Treaty, and the civil society proposals for the treaty, being (extra firmly) on the agenda of UN IGWG Chair [1], national governments and/or their representatives in Geneva [Uruguay, Mozambique, Philippines, France, Germany, South Korea, Australia, Spain, El Salvador, Palestine, Bangladesh, Togo, Uganda, Philippines, Mozambique, Liberia [16]], and the media [1]. Furthermore, in El Salvador, building on FoE capacity development and participation in meetings, a national CSO organized a workshop on the UN Binding Treaty for union leaders [1] to put the UN Binding Treaty on their agenda and build new alliances. This CSO also organised three workshops to build the knowledge of technical staff of the Office of the Procurator for the Defense of Human Rights (PDDH) on the UN Binding Treaty process. As a result the PDDH sent a letter to the Minister of Foreign Affairs requesting information regarding the Salvadoran government&apos;s position and their actions to promote the UN Binding Treaty [1]. [FoEI2(1)]: With financial support from FoEI a CSO from the Philippines supported a CBO [see 1.B FoEI1] to build a case against companies encroaching upon their ancestral land. They filed this case with the Philippines Commission on Human Rights who published a resolution on this case. [FoEI3(1)]: With financial support from FoEI a CSO from El Salvador organised a forum and regional exchange &quot;Berta C&#xE1;ceres Vive&quot; in coordination with other CSOs, to remember Berta C&#xE1;ceres and her legacy in environmental and social defense, and develop a common agenda with CSOs and communities, peasants and indigenous peoples who participated. The demands of the participants were broadcast by a Latin American TV Channel. [FoEI4(2)]: With financial support from FoEI a CSO from El Salvador in collaboration with an ally campaigned to raise awareness on the threat of water privatization. They organized a festival to generate discussion with the general public around water as a common good and against the privatization of water. They also held a press conference on the draft of the Comprehensive Water Law (covered by the media). This campaign resulted in more public awareness [1] and the government taking their proposal as an input for discussion [1]. [FoEI5(2)]: With financial support from FoEI a CSO from Honduras has supported 2 communities affected by the construction of a dam. With this support the communities were able to bring their case to the national government. This resulted in various members of parliament [1] speaking out in parliament and the media in favor of the communities and against the construction of the dam. The media [1] has also given airtime to interviews with the communities about the case. [FoEI6(2)]: FoEI&apos;s Environmental Human Rights Defenders (EHRD), Defenders of Territories framework, including a rapid response system in the event of rights violations, was presented and discussed during various sessions of the Asia Pacific Conference on Extractives and Human Rights, attended by some 70 activists from the environmental and human rights movements in September in Semarang, Indonesia. As a result elements of the framework were reflected in the conference declaration, participants expressed interest in applying components of the EHRD rapid response system in their organizations and communities and discussions took place with the representative of the newly formed network Asia Pacific Network on Environmental Defenders (APNED) for possible partnerships for protection of EHRDs [1]. Furthermore, FoEI&apos;s Environmental Human Rights Defenders (EHRD), Defenders of Territories framework, including a rapid response system in the event of rights violations, was presented and discussed during the World Thematic Forum on Extractivism in November in Johannesburg [1].</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">[FoEI1:] In 2017 the proposal for a treaty on transnational corporations and other business enterprises with respect to human rights continued to be discussed at the United Nations. More than 200 civil society representatives were present for the third session of the intergovernmental working group (IGWG) taking forward the development of this legal instrument at the UN in Geneva. IGWG3 recommendations and conclusions were adopted in the presence of a record 101 participants and continuity of the process in 2018 was secured. FoEI coordinated the strategy development and implementation, communications and logistics of a team of eight people who took part in UNHRC sessions in Geneva (in March and June) and a FOEI delegation of 40 people from 25 national member groups at the 3rd IGWG session in Geneva in October; FoEI coordinated an international steering group whose members were involved in the organization of several regional activities of advocacy, training and mobilization through the year, particularly during May, August and September. FoEI continued to coordinate inputs to the UN process from national groups from across all regions, support capacity building on the need for the treaty and its link to addressing corporate impunity and threats to environmental human rights defenders, and to coordinate strategy development and activities with allies in the treaty process. Several FoE groups managed to contribute to a positive attitude of their governments towards the UN Treaty and their constructive participation in the IGWG3. [FoEI2:] In 2017 the Mozambican Bar Association started three legal actions, in support of cases raised by a Mozambican CSO against three corporations and the Mozambican state regarding communities whose rights were violated. This is important progress at the national level as there is no record of legal actions from the Mozambican Bar directed at multinational corporations prior to 2016. [FoEI3:] In March 2017, in a legal case in relation to forest fires related to oil palm plantation expansion, the Palangka Raya District Court in Central Kalimantan ruled that the government should (a) review and revise the permits of all plantation companies, whether implicated in 2015 forest and peat land fires or not; (b) actively enforce civil and criminal laws to penalize companies whose concessions were implicated in the 2015 fires; (c) inform the public regarding the affected land and the companies that own concessions implicated in the fires; (d) form a Joint Team on Forest Fire Management consisting of the Ministry of Environment and Forestry, the Ministry of Agriculture and the Ministry of Health; and (e) build a Respiratory Medicine hospital and an evacuation room for people affected by forest fires. The March 2017 ruling is being appealed by the government in the High Court. FoEI provided financial support to the Indonesian CSO that filed the case.</narrative>
