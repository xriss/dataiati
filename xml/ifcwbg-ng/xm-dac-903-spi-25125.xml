   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The potential developmental, institutional and capacity building impact of the project is high.  The proposed IFC investment in UBA-Metlife will support the development of the insurance industry in Nigeria which is currently undergoing reforms. The Nigeria life insurance sector, in particular, is underdeveloped and the partnership between UBA, a strong local partner, with the world-class industry expertise of MHL, has the potential to transform an existing but dormant local insurer into a viable, world-class life insurer.  
Insurance companies have a disproportionately high impact on economies because they are necessarily large investors who directly affect the general economy through their operations.   In order to settle claims that may arise, insurers invest excess premium income to build a portfolio of financial assets and income-producing real estate which can then be called upon to pay off any future claims that arise.   A vibrant insurance industry can be a reliable source of long-term capital, which is lacking in Nigeria and other African countries.   The provision of quality insurance is therefore crucial for the development of a healthy and dynamic private sector and long-term capital markets.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The proposed Project intends to strengthen and expand the operational capacity of UBA Metropolitan Life Insurance Limited (UBA-Metlife or the company), a new Bancassurance company specializing in life insurance in Nigeria.  The company was established in January 2007 as a result of a joint venture between UBA Insurance, a wholly owned subsidiary of United Bank for Africa Plc (UBA) of Nigeria and Metropolitan Holdings Group (UK), a wholly owned subsidiary of Metropolitan Holdings Limited (MHL) of South Africa.  The investment envisages an equity contribution of up to $3.0 million by IFC and corporate governance support for the company at a key stage in its development.</narrative>
