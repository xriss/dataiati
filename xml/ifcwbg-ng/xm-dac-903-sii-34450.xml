   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Greater availability of gas is one of the key ingredients for increasing power generation in Nigeria, a country that suffers significantly from lack of electricity and where only about 50% of the population has access to electricity from the grid. The quality of service is generally poor and lack of electricity has put a constraint on the country&apos;&apos;s economic growth. There is about 6 GW of existing capacity in Nigeria, of which only about 4.5 GW is operating. The Federal Government of Nigeria&apos;&apos;s ambitious sector reforms have recently met some major milestones, amongst which the privatization of 6 Generation Assets (GENCOs) and 10 Distribution Assets (DISCOs), the Transmission Company of Nigeria&apos;&apos;s management that has been given to Manitoba Hydro International and the Gas Aggregator that has been created and is operating. Overall, it is estimated that generation capacity will increase to 15 GW in 2020 (mainly thermal). If supplied, gas consumption by the power sector could reach 1.9 Bcf/d in 2015 and 2.6 Bcf/d by 2020. Gas production and transportation is critical to the energy mix, and Nigeria harbors significant gas reserves. Seven Energy&apos;&apos;s midstream capacity will be sufficient to supply gas for up to 2,15 GW of power capacity, which represents more than a third of the country&apos;&apos;s current capacity. In addition to supplying gas to the Ibom Power Plant (IPP), the Company will directly supply the Calabar National Integrated Power Project (NIPP), a plant with a capacity of about 560 MW. Moreover, IFC funding would also contribute to a planned 2014 project between Seven and an IOC to eliminate approximately 23mmcfd of IOC flared gas. The project will divert the gas to Sevens Uquo gas facility where it will be stripped of liquids and the residual gas blended with Sevens gas, adding to Seven&apos;&apos;s gas and liquids steams, in addition to eliminating the flared gas. Finally, the project will generate direct jobs and indirect jobs (through power provided to the grid and to industries including a fertilizer plant in the Akwa Ibom state), as well as government revenues.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Seven Energy International Limited is a Nigeria and UK based oil and gas exploration and production (E&amp;P) and midstream company (Seven Energy or the Company). It is one of the few E&amp;P companies in Nigeria with a focus on developing and commercializing gas which was historically stranded or flared, and supply it to Nigeria&apos;&apos;s domestic market for power generation and industrial consumption. IFCs investment will contribute in funding the Companys general corporate purposes including potential acquisitions in both midstream and upstream in Nigeria, and capex programs such as a planned 2014 project between Seven Energy and an International Oil Company (IOC) to eliminate and monetize approximately 23mmcf per day of flared gas.  Seven Energys strategy has been to grow its business primarily through (i) exploiting its existing asset base, (ii) establishing gas pipelines, processing, and transportation systems within its areas of operation through which it can transport production to the expanding Nigerian domestic gas and power market, (iii) negotiating supply agreements with upstream gas producers, (iv) reaching sales agreements with power and industrial producers, and (v) completing strategic acquisitions of attractive oil and gas assets.  Seven Energy currently has two core areas of operation in the South East and North West onshore Niger Delta. The South East Niger Delta has significant discovered but undeveloped gas fields, with some installed gas demand and significant growth potential, but very limited gas processing and distribution infrastructure. The North West Niger Delta is characterized by mature oil and gas fields, with pipeline infrastructure in place, but with significant additional undeveloped gas reserves and a shortage of gas processing capacity. The Companys expansion plan for the next few years is to strengthen its unique position as a key midstream player in the south-eastern part of Nigeria. This plan includes both upstream and midstream oil and gas activities.</narrative>
