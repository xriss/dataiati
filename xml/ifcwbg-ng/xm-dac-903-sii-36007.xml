   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Hygeia Nigeria Ltd. (HNL or Hygeia) is Nigerias leading and largest integrated healthcare provider offering both hospital and health management services. As of today, HNL operates 2 hospitals and 3 clinics in Lagos, a health maintenance organization (HHMO), a Community Health Plan (HCHC) for low income families and a Foundation (HNLF) for capacity building of medical professionals in disease programs including HIV/AIDS.  HNL is seeking to raise $16.1m to upgrade existing hospitals and expand its operations. $49.7m will also be raised for the acquisition of secondary shares from existing shareholders. The purpose of the project is to increase access to good quality and affordable healthcare services in Nigeria by helping Hygeia to expand its activities and achieve optimal operational efficiency.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">i) Quality of healthcare: One of the co-investors alongside IFC is a strategic investor who will work with the company to improve service provision, professionalize management and improve quality control systems in Hygeia thereby increasing the availability of quality healthcare in Nigeria. Furthermore, as the only Nigerian hospital to be accredited by Joint Commission International (JCI), an investment in Hygeia would also support an increase in the quality of services available in Nigeria. ii) Access to healthcare: The expansion of Hygeia&apos;&apos;s bed capacity and service offering will help address the vast shortage of healthcare provision in Nigeria and allow patients to access appropriate treatment in Nigeria rather than abroad. Additionally, the project is expected to increase the capacity of the HMO to expand its enrollee base, providing greater access to healthcare in the country.  iii) Affordability: The investment is expected to result in operational efficiencies lowering costs which could be passed on to customers thereby enabling more affordable and quality healthcare.  iv) Employment: The business expansion will result in the creation of skilled jobs in healthcare professions as well as related lower skilled jobs. v) Demonstration effect: The increasing success of Hygeia will demonstrate the commercial viability of investing in healthcare providers in Nigeria and will attract further capital to the sector.</narrative>
