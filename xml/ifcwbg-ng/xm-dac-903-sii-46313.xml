   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Project follows the AIMM (Development Impact) Rating for the Startup Catalyst Envelope.

IFC anticipates that the Project would result in increased access to seed stage equity for digital startups in Nigeria, Kenya, Egypt, and Rwanda, countries where venture capital availability has increased in recent years, although challenges for seed- and early-stage startups, especially in Rwanda, persist and continue to deter their establishment. The Project is also expected to increase the ability for startups to succeed and scale digital businesses, through the Funds mentorship and window for follow-on funding.

Beyond the Project, this investment is expected to contribute to developing the start-up ecosystem and venture capital market in Nigeria and other operating markets, by demonstrating the commercial viability of the VC fund model in the country. IFCs support also enables creation of a constant and quality pipeline of investment opportunities that investors at Series A stage and beyond depend upon.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The investment proposal is for up to US$5 million in equity into Ventures Platform Fund IV (the Fund), an African seed fund that is raising US$30 million to make early-stage investments, primarily in Nigeria and the Rest of Africa. The Fund is focused on making early-stage investments (pre-seed to series A) in tech and tech-enabled startups targeting the mass market in Africa. The Fund had a first close in December 2021 of US$14.9 million.  The Fund will be supported by the Blended Finance Facility (BFF) of the IDA 19 IFCMIGA Private Sector Window (IDA PSW), created by the Word Bank Group to catalyze private sector investment in IDA countries, with a focus on fragile and conflict-affected states.</narrative>
