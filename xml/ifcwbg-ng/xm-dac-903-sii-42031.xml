   <narrative xml:lang="EN">1.	Stakeholders Impact - IFC anticipates that the RSF will allow the Bank to sustainably improve its SME portfolio risk profile and hence contribute to increasing access to finance for SMEs including to underserved segments such as WSMEs and SMEs operating in the Northern and Delta regions in Nigeria.                     
                             
2.	Inclusiveness - IFC anticipates that capacity building offered by the SLGP and IFC Advisory Services will help Union Bank to scale-up its lending activities to SMEs in Nigeria, thereby demonstrating that this underserved segment could be commercially viable. This should give comfort to other banks to also extend their services to this segment, making the banking sector more inclusive. Union Bank recently launched a Women&apos;s product &#xCE;&#xB1;lpher and the proposed project is expected to expand its current offerings to individual women and women-owned businesses.

3.	Competitiveness: Through the demonstration and replication channel, Union Bank&apos;s expansion of its SME portfolio will demonstrate to the wider local market that SMEs, particularly currently underserved segments (WSMEs and SMEs including those operating in the northern and delta regions in Nigeria) are an attractive asset class. The Project is, therefore, expected to increase the market&apos;s competitiveness as other market participants also move down-market to replicate the Bank&apos;s success. Also, once the viability of this product and segment is established, it is likely to be replicated more broadly across the banking sector in the Country. Banks will start scrambling for market share on this newly bankable segment, progressively lowering their pricing as perceived risk reduces and more suited products are introduced to the market.</narrative>
