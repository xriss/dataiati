   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Summary Of Project Information (SPI)    Project NameNigeria  AEF Safety Center    RegionSub-Saharan Africa    Sector   Project No10105   Projected Board DateMay 22, 2000   Company NameSafety Center International Limited   Technical Partner and/or Major Shareholders    	The project is sponsored by Mr. Jobst Kruttke, a 60-year old engineer from Hamburg in Germany. After his training he spent 9 years working in various roles for engineering companies before his appointment as managing partner for ENCON Maschinen- und Anlagenbau GmbH, where he worked for 22 years. ENCON specialized in the design, delivery, installation and management of complete industrial plants for ceramic and plastic processing industry. Through this company he worked on various turn-key projects in Nigeria. In 1988 he left to co-found Intertec Industries Services GmbH, Hamburg supplying industrial spare parts for maintenance and providing logistics services to oil companies in Nigeria and in 1997 he became the Managing Director of Intertec Engineering (Nig) Limited. He is well known in the oil companies, NNPC, PPMC and the finance industry. Mr. Kruttke will be the major shareholder with 39% of the company.   	The project has no technical partner.    Project Cost Including proposed IFC investment    	Total project cost is estimated at US$2.0 million.  IFC has been asked to provide a loan of US$.5 million and equity of US$.04 representing 27% total project cost.    	   Location of project and Description of site    	The project will be located at Omuolo-Omagwa Village, Ikwerre Local Government Area, Port Harcourt, Rivers State, Nigeria. The area is close to the Port-Harcourt International airport and well served with essential infrastructural facilities such as electricity, security, access roads, telecommunications, accommodation and medical facilities.     Description of Company and Purpose of Project    Safety Center International Ltd. will be incorporated in Nigeria with the objective to train safety and fire fighting personnel in the use of Self Contained Breathing Apparatus (SCBA) and maintain safety instruments and equipment for oil companies. The project is to set up the first training center in Nigeria at Port Harcourt to train fire brigade and safety personnel on how to use SCBA when operating under fire and other hazardous conditions. This training will certify, standardize and improve the ability of safety and fire operators to rescue victims of fire and other tragic incidence trapped in difficult location.    The training center will use Simulation Tunnel (ST) designed and built based on the Training Gallery concept of Drager Sicherheitstechnik GmbH, Germany, a world-wide market leader in the fire protection and safety industry which has experience of building over 200 similar galleries in various parts of the world.   	IFC is one of the few lenders able to provide long-term finance to projects in Nigeria and its participation in this project enhances the prospects of it being implemented. The project will have the following development impacts:    	(a) Increase number of SCBA wearers: t will positively impact the fire safety and protection industry by increasing the number of qualified SCBA wearers that can save lives. The current ratio of 1 safety personnel to 100,000 citizen is poor.    	(b) Foreign currency earner: it will provide opportunity for other countries within West African region to train fire and safety personnel and in the process earn foreign currency. The nearest facility is in South Africa and Oman   	(c) Life Saving: currently very few firemen wear SCBAs when on mission, the project will expose them to tactical training that would protected them from hazardous fumes and improve their ability to carry out rescues in life threatening incidence and hopefully prevent further unnecessary loss of lives.    	(d) Technology Transfer: the training center would be an exact replication of other facilities already built Germany and other parts of the world.    	(e) Demonstration model: this project will serves as a demo for other facilities that may eventually be built in other parts of the country.    Environmental Category and Issues    	This is a category B project according to IFC&apos;&apos;s environmental and social review procedure. Environmental issues associated with this project include:  Site location and prior use; water and power supply;  handling and storage of chemicals; sewage and liquid effluent treatment and disposal; solid waste and hazardous waste disposal; CFC equipment; fuel storage ; air emissions; employee training on  health and safety; fire protection, life safety  and emergency response measures. There will be not storage of chemical on site and no process waste water; sewage will be disposed of in a septic tank. A company environmental policy will be drafted models developed by Schell. The  guidelines for health and safety will be  those currently used  by  Shell for its Petroleum Platforms in Nigeria.    Based on its review of available information regarding potential environmental impacts and the measures described above, IFC concludes that the proposed project will be in compliance  with World Bank Group and  IFC policies and with World Bank Group environmental, health and safety guidelines in force at the time of appraisal. IFC will monitor ongoing compliance during the life of the project by evaluating monitoring reports submitted annually to IFC by the sponsor and by conducting periodic site reviews during project supervision.
