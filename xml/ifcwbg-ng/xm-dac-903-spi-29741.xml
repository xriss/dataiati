   <narrative xml:lang="EN">(i) Expand mobile telephony access: With the construction of additional tower sites, existing Telcos will be able to expand the reach of their services both in terms of geography and capacity. In addition, collocation reduces the incremental cost of expanding service for all carriers thereby allowing them to service remote and economically less developed areas where ARPU and usage will be lower. (ii) Increased competition: The presence of IHS Nigeria will allow smaller and newer wireless operators to benefit from reduced barriers to entry as they will have access to leased tower facilities rather than having to build their own. (iii) Expand access to other ICT technologies:  IHS Nigeria, directly and through its subsidiaries, will be building a tower network that is capable of supporting not only mobile cellular networks, but also wireless broadband and backhaul networks, thereby improving the penetration of these technologies. (iv) Contribute to mitigating environmental impact and Climate Change: The underlying projects developed by the Company will provide a cost effective opportunity to Telcos to reduce their carbon emission footprint by sharing infrastructure. A significant benefit of sharing tower infrastructure arises from the material, energy and emissions savings that ensue from building only one tower instead of three or four.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Project consists of an investment of up to $95 million on IFCs account and mobilization of up to $200 million to strengthen the capital structure of IHS Nigeria Plc (IHS Nigeria or the Company) to support (i) the national and regional expansion of its current operations in the areas of Tower Management and Tower Construction; and, (ii) the acquisition, leasing and maintenance of telecom towers across Sub-Saharan Africa.  IHS Nigeria was incorporated in Nigeria in 2001 as an engineering company with the primary business of building and managing sites for Telcos and third party vendors seeking to build and expand their telecom infrastructure.  With over 700 employees in various cities across Africa, the Company is preparing to bid on the acquisition of existing tower networks in Nigeria, Sudan, Tanzania and DRC to provide GSM and fixed wireless operators in those countries with an economically viable and energy efficient infrastructure sharing model which will serve as an cost effective alternative to in-house construction, maintenance and ownership of telecommunication tower sites.  In 2009, the Company became a publicly listed company, trading on the Nigerian Stock Exchange.</narrative>
