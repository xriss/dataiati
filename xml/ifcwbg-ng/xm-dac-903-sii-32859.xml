  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Azura-Edo Independent Power Plant (IPP) is a 450 MW gas-fired open cycle power plant located in the North Eastern outskirts of Benin City in Edo, Nigeria (the Project). As of July 2013, the plant is estimated to cost around US$[654] million, and to achieve commercial operations by late 2016. This would make it one of the first IPPs to come online in the country in over a decade. The Azura-Edo IPP benefits from the full support of the Federal Government of Nigeria (FGN) and is currently negotiating a tripartite agreement to be signed between Azura, the Nigerian Bulk Electricity Trading PLC (&quot;NBET&quot;) and the Nigerian Federal Ministry of Finance (&quot;MoF&quot;) wherein the MoF will back-stop the payments owed to Azura by NBET in the event of a termination of the Power Purchase Agreement. In addition, Azura is one of 14 IPPs nominated by the MoF for participation in a PRG series proposed by the World Bank and MIGA is also considering providing political risk insurance for the Project (including breach of contract cover). IFC has been mandated to co-arrange the Development Finance Institution (DFI) debt tranche with FMO, and is expected to invest an A loan of up to US$125 million for its own account, as well as co-mobilizing the balance of required DFI funding.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Project is expected to have the following development impact: - Demonstration effect: supporting a pioneering IPP under the umbrella on-going sector reforms in Nigeria. This is expected to set a precedent for future IPPs not only the country but the region;  - Access to energy: the project will help avert load-shedding in a country where only 20% of the electricity demand is estimated to be satisfied by the grid; - Reduction in reliance on diesel generators: private enterprises are currently suffering from expensive and environmentally unfriendly diesel generators;  - Reduction in electricity costs: gas offers a lower cost option to power the country; - Viability of the gas sector: the Project will contribute to supporting gas producers, ensuring maximum utilization of gas to fuel power generation and reducing of gas flaring in the country.  - Economic and Fiscal benefits: the country will also benefit from taxes from the Project and from the increased economic activity brought about by additional power supply.</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Project is located to the north-east of Benin City, adjacent to an existing 450 MW state-owned thermal power plant (Ihovbor) and will benefit from proximity to: (i) the Escravos Lagos Pipeline System (ELPS), a 1 billion scfd gas trunk line currently being expanded to double its capacity; (ii) the existing Benin Main Substation and the new Benin North Substation (currently being built); and (iii) the largest and most critical node in the countrys transmission network. The Project also comprises the construction of a short high voltage connection line (c. 500 m) to the adjacent Benin North Substation, and a short pipeline spur (c. 1km) connecting the power plant to the ELPS.   The site is just outside the limits of a built up area and off the Benin bypass road. It mainly consists of secondary forest, subsistence farming (slash and burn practices), plantation (palm oil, rubber), and dwellings and footpaths.</narrative>
