    <narrative xml:lang="EN">The two hotels will be located in the urban areas of Lagos and Benin City where land ownership is well defined and title deeds are available. The site for the hotel in Lagos is owned by Skye Bank PLC and has been transferred to the Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV), Skye Capic Limited. The site is currently being used by Skye Bank as vehicle parking space for staff as well as storage for the banks various materials. It is secured by a wall, which has prevented irregular occupation. The hotel in Benin City will be established on a site previously utilized for similar purposes i.e., the Emotan Hotel, which reportedly ceased operations in 2002. Existing structures on this site will be demolished to accommodate the new CAPIC Hexagon Limited hotel. In both instances land purchases are on a willing seller/willing buyer basis; thus PS5: Land Acquisition and Involuntary Resettlement does not apply. Equally PS6: Biodiversity Conservation &amp; Sustainable Natural Resource Management is not applicable.</narrative>
