   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Expand mobile telephony access: With the construction of additional tower sites, existing mobile operators will be able to expand the reach of their services both in terms of geography and capacity. In addition, since Helios Towers is not affiliated with any operator, and as its business model is predicated on sharing and collocation, the benefits of expanded access through Helios Towers will also be available to new market entrants. Collocation reduces the incremental cost of expanding service for all carriers thereby allowing them to service remote and economically less developed areas where ARPU and usage will be lower.     Increase competition: The presence of Helios Towers in the Nigerian market will allow smaller and newer wireless operators to benefit from reduced barriers to entry as they will have access to leased tower facilities rather than having to build their own.    Expand access to other ICT technologies:  Helios Towers will be building a tower network that is capable of supporting not only mobile cellular networks, but also wireless broadband and backhaul networks, thereby improving the penetration of these technologies.    Contribute to mitigating environmental impact and Climate Change: This project will provide a cost effective opportunity to telecommunication operators to reduce their carbon emission footprint by sharing infrastructure. A significant benefit of sharing tower infrastructure arises from the material, energy and emissions savings that ensue from building only one tower instead of three or four.  The most immediate impact is on the visual environment, where the removal of two or three unnecessary towers creates an immediate visual benefit. The savings in resources are more significant, as only one-third or one quarter of the steel, concrete and other building materials are necessary for a shared tower. Finally, in areas of uncertain power supply like Nigeria, the ability to use only one back-up power generator to serve an area where there would formerly be 3 or 4 back-up power generators for separate towers, results in immediate and continuing reduction of harmful emissions.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project consists of the nationwide expansion of a shared telecommunication infrastructure network owned by Helios Towers Nigeria Limited (Helios Towers or the Company). Helios Towers Nigeria Limited was established in 2005 to provide GSM and fixed wireless operators in Nigeria with an economically viable and environmentally friendlier outsourced alternative to in-house construction, maintenance and ownership of telecommunication tower sites. The company builds and maintains a network of telecommunications towers, and leases space on the towers to multiple GSM, fixed wireless and other providers of wireless services under long-term lease agreements.</narrative>
