   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Socketworks Limited (Socketworks or the company) is a privately held Nigerian limited liability corporation.  It was established in June 2002.  It has been supported by the IFC since this time by way of capacity-building and advisory support services through the African Project Development Facility (APDF) as well as a loan (signed in February 2006).  Socketworks is a software and outsourcing company that aims to provide packaged ICT solutions to its clients.      In the education market, it has developed software (trademarked CollegePortal) that has been endorsed by the Nigerian Universities Commission as the most suitable management software for Nigerias universities.  Socketworks packaged solution for universities is helping universities automate their processes (eg: student admissions and registration, course selection, course management, exam management, facility management) that are currently done manually and is providing internet access that would not otherwise be available.  These services are making an enormous difference to universities in Nigeria that otherwise have no ICT systems.  The company has also begun implementing e-Government contracts to automate and improve the efficiency of various government services such as immigration and pensions.    The proposed IFC investment will be comprised of equity and/or debt financing for the following:    -  Implementation of 19 polytechnics contracts in Nigeria, each consisting of a bundled solution, involving the provision of both hardware and software to each institution. -  Expansion of the SocketWorks into Sierra Leone, Ghana, Uganda, Liberia, and Kenya as well as the implementation of new university and e-Government contracts in each new country.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The investment in Socketworks fits well with IFCs overall developmental objectives because universities in Africa are essentially devoid of information technology.  Computing and internet facilities do not exist.  The provision of modern IT equipment is expected to dramatically improve the education provided in Africa because it will enable students and faculty alike to access the latest publications and knowledge from the World Wide Web.  It will also improve the efficiency of the administration of African universities, freeing up resources for more productive uses.  Similar benefits are expected in the various government departments where SocketWorks has signed or plans to sign contracts.</narrative>
