   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Eleme Petrochemicals Company Limited (Eleme or the company) was incorporated in 1988 as a 100% subsidiary of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) and started operations in 1995.  Eleme is one of only two petrochemicals complexes in Nigeria (both of which are state owned).  Due to operational problems (inadequate maintenance, lack of spare parts, equipment break-downs etc.) the plant has operated at a very low capacity utilization since its inception.      The project is to assist Indorama International Finance Plc, UK (IIF or the Sponsor) in the privatization purchase of a 75% equity stake in Eleme and in implementing a turnaround capital investment program to return the company to profitability.  The proposed transaction has two components:    -  Privatization Acquisition Finance (Acquisition): IIF would set up two special purpose vehicles (SPVs) to finance the purchase of its shares in Eleme.  The first SPV (Offshore SPV) would be the main investment vehicle to own 50.3% of Elemes equity capital and the second SPV (Onshore SPV) would own the balance 24.7% of Elemes shares.  The Onshore SPV would be owned by the Offshore SPV and would also have the Rivers State government as a minority shareholder.      -  Turn-around Capital Expenditure (Project):  IIF estimates that Eleme will require a capital expenditure of $160 million towards repairs, refurbishment, modernization and working capital in order to restore the plant to full capacity utilization.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">With a population of more than 130 million, Nigeria is Africas most populous country. The past few years have witnessed steady economic growth in the country, driven primarily by the governments aggressive social and economic reform agenda, as well as higher oil prices. The proposed project will play an important role in furthering this process. Through the transfer of existing state assets to the private sector and a capital expenditure program to help bring them back into productive use, the project is expected to:    -  add value to Nigerias natural resources;    -  support local upstream and downstream players;    -  provide momentum to the privatization agenda;    -  facilitate the development of the downstream sector; and    -  make available domestically produced polyethylene (PE) and polypropylene (PP) for which the historically strong local demand has been met largely through imports.     Indicators that will be used to monitor the development impact of the project include:    - purchases of Natural Gas Liquids (NGLs) as feedstock;    - PE and PP sales to local companies; and    - number of state-owned companies privatized.</narrative>
