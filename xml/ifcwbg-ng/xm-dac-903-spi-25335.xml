   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Star Paper Project</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Star Paper Mill Limited (Star Paper or the company) is in the final stages of completing a $28 million expansion of its existing paper manufacturing/conversion plant in Owerrinta, Abia State, Nigeria and is seeking IFCs assistance with refinancing short/medium term loans and funding additional capital expenditure.  Star Paper began commercial production on the new 60-65 tonne/day tissue machine in May 2006 and has more than doubled its production capacity from 20,400 tons to 44,200 tons of jumbo reels per annum.  This project is the first phase of a larger program aimed at increasing the total plant capacity to 73,200 tons per annum.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project will benefit the country by transforming recycled paper into converted tissue paper and thereby avoid importing tissue jumbo reels.  Since tissue has a high volume to weight ratio, its per ton transportation cost is approximately five times that of recycled paper.  Handling and distribution costs are also reduced.  In addition, the project almost doubles the value added of producing converted paper by going further up the input stream to recycled paper. The project has resulted in the employment of 106 additional staff and it will support the viability of an important source of employment for up to 900 people in the company who are mostly from the poor region of the oil producing Delta region of Nigeria.   

Non-quantified development impacts include: Environment, Social, Health, and Safety: The company significantly contributes to collecting and recycling wastepaper generated in Nigeria, as it is the raw material it utilizes to produce paper.  By adopting IFC&apos;s environmental health and safety standards, the company will adhere to stricter international practices, while providing its employees with safer working conditions.  The host community will also benefit through greater direct and indirect employment in the area.  The presence of the company in the area has enabled the community to have access to reliable power supply and improved infrastructure.</narrative>
