    <narrative xml:lang="EN">Albania received European Union (EU) candidate country status in June 2014 and continues to actively pursue EU membership. In 2015, the EU noted progress on the political criteria required to begin accession negotiations, but also highlighted the need for further reform in numerous areas, particularly in the justice sector and rule of law by increasing counter-corruption efforts and fighting organized crime. U.S. assistance focuses on supporting Albania on its European path by strengthening the country&apos;s justice sector, improving local governance, and developing civil society&apos;s capacity to fulfill its watchdog function. U.S. assistance also builds the capacity of Albania&apos;s security and law enforcement agencies. In addition to the bilateral funding requested, Albania will also benefit from resources requested for the Europe and Eurasia Regional operating unit to improve the conditions needed for broad-based and sustainable economic growth throughout the region. U.S. assistance will build resilience and reduce vulnerability to Russian aggression, increase European integration, and provide continued support for enduring programs.</narrative>
