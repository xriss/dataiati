   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Northern Kosovo do not show any sign of sustainable economic rise for more than decade despite the (considering the state of regional economy and current circumstances) excessive financial help delivered: therefore, Northern Kosovo remains totally dependent on financial remittances coming outside the region while the capacities for the economic development remain minimal.
The lack of private initiative is considerable: most of the young expect to &#x201C;be provided&#x201D; job in public (state) companies, which are, however mostly at the brink of collapse and exist only due to financial help coming from the region, or in public administration. Both public administration and public companies have low employment capacities. With the process of economic transition the number of companies that could afford to offer kind of well-paid jobs with minimal work decreased abruptly. The salaries remain the dominant interest of employees, while the opportunities, careers development and working conditions are out of their focus.
Furthermore, the fact that must be taken into the consideration is that the current job-creation and employment capacities in the region rely more on kinships and nepotism, personal connections, monopolistic behavior etc..than on quality and capabilities. Business education by itself is far from being enough to overcome these issues.
Our intention is to stimulate the examples of good practice based on fine ideas and plans of operation, quality and capability and cooperation rather than dubious business and management.Our aims consider stimulating creativity among the future entrepreneurs, so they could move on with the new ideas/businesses/companies/services that are lacking in the region. 
CTD plans to start business incubation center in Mitrovica at the beginning of 2014. Along with that we plan to help and stimulate young entrepreneurs by mentoring process done by our professors and experts. The process can be managed centrally by CTD who could provide expert help and with donors.
The entrepreneurship curriculum, already developed, structured and piloted within MFS2 Program is going to be adopted by two more faculties during the 2014. In 2013, 4 UM faculties accepted curriculum (Faculty of Medicine, Faculty of Law, Faculty of Technical Science and Faculty of Agriculture).</narrative>
