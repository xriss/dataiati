   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Promoting Sustainable Economic Development by supporting Small and Medium Enterprises through promotion and access to finance.


- The entrepreneurship spirit is somehow low in Burundi, as most graduating students in universities tend to consider public service as the sole option for a career,etc.
It is important we tackle these problems because:
The Burundian economy needs to be diversified, hence the need to organize business plan competitions and market places as these are opportunities for young entrepreneurs to emerge and show their innovation.
Capacity building of our Burundian entrepreneurs is crucial in the frame of the East African Community regional integration, Burundian business mens skills need to be upgraded through various trainings, workshops, etc.
Majority of jobs in most economies are not created by public sector companies, but rather by private sector organizations.
Business Incubation is a concept that directly deals with entrepreneurs, and business people, through promoting the creation and development of SMEs in the private sector.</narrative>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The beneficiaries of this project are made up of young people who are animated with a viable entrepreneurship spirit as well as new and existing entrepreneurs already active and who wish to expand their activities. The project will target mainly the province of Bujumbura and some other areas of the country.</narrative>
