   <narrative xml:lang="EN">A recent Value Chain Analysis for the date sector in Hodeida conducted by SPARK(2014) shows that the sector has good opportunities if the following challenges are dealt with:
The processes of cultivating, harvesting, storing and processing of local dates in Hodeida seem to be out of date and not matching the changing needs of the market. Therefore, those processes need modernizing and developing.
The market governance of the dates value chain is not stable and needs establishment
There are several small businesses opportunities that need to be addressed in the date value chain
The market awareness and attitude towards the locally produced date is not positive, and so a well-planned campaign is required to establish good impression about the locally produced date
Local youth employability is not ready for the labour market, and so youth capabilities need enhancement for the labour market needs.
A major obstacle for addressing the previous stated challenging is the lack of the needed knowledge and skills. Therefore, if suitable training and networking is implemented to develop and modernize the dates production processes, for developing and starting small businesses in the dates agri-business sector, improving the target market governance and awareness, and for improving the youth employability skills, positive results are highly expected.
As a result of all that, this proposal is addressed to SPARK from FAF hoping to help SPARK achieving their goals of the project.</narrative>
