   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Project outputs: 

50 potential and existing manufacturing enterprises who are export ready trained
10 product development reports disseminated to enterprises
 4 Sessions organized
40 Enterprises linked with buyers in export markets through matchmaking sessions
2 reports (narrative and financial) developed and submitted to Spark

Project outcomes: 

80% of trained exporting SMEs are aware of and easily access key export market information 
10 Products complied with EAC SQMT standards
40 exporting SMEs grown
At least 60 new jobs created</narrative>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The direct beneficiaries of the project at hand will be small and medium manufacturing enterprises whose products have export potential in both the EAC and regional markets.</narrative>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project concept outlines the rationale and methodology of an export development project for 50 manufacturing Rwandan SMEs, members of Rwanda Association of Manufacturers (RAM) to make them export ready and to enhance their capability to do more business in the regional markets of the EAC. The project is designed to invest approximately Euro 105,616 over 12 months and is expected to boost the export competitiveness of the SME sector in Rwanda, to integrate at least 50 entrepreneurs especially in manufacturing SMEs into regional value chains.

The Export Capability Development Project will among other activities, support budding entrepreneurs and selected small and medium enterprises (SMEs) producing processed value-added export products, with export skills, capacity building support and export advisory services in order to address the larger order problem of low diversification. This support is designed as additional to the on-going effort by the PSF SPARK Initiative which is already supporting 84 entrepreneurs to access markets. 

Enhancing the capability of Rwandas private sector to become &#x201C;export-oriented&#x201D; and &#x201C;export-competitive&#x201D; is a close fit with Rwandas Economic Development and Poverty Reduction Strategy IIs (EDPRS2) broader objective of reducing Rwandas external dependency through attaining the target export growth rate of 28% per annum by 2020.

THE FOCAL PROBELM
At national impact level, Rwanda is experiencing slow export growth. Conversely, at sector level, low diversification of markets and products coupled with low, relatively declining competitiveness is constraining export growth. Rwanda still registers a relatively high export product concentration ratio because of its strong reliance on a few resource-based products for export. Even against a backdrop of generally increasing export diversification(between 2001 and 2012) EAC manufacturing report, Rwandas manufacturing exports are still characteristically concentrated in a fewConcentration remains above the EAC average - EAC manufacturing report sectors. 

Some of the contributory factors to this relatively low performance are lack of adequate access to markets and poor knowledge of export markets. The latest survey of Rwandan exporters carried out by the Private Sector Federation in May 2013, confirms this. The survey finds that Rwandan exporters, regardless the nature of their business, rank the provision of potential market information and market opportunities as the most needed intervention followed by lowering the cost of doing business (Fig.1).

Furthermore, surveyed businesses alluded to difficulties in accessing export financing.

This project therefore will support export capability development for existing entrepreneurs in the manufacturing subsector, through the provision of export advisory services, export readiness training and market information.  

A company that is export ready has a well developed capability to produce the right quantity and quality of goods and services demanded in the export market, at cost and delivered in time. Beneficial export transactions are premised on the capability of the enterprise to communicate, to distribute, to take orders and fulfil them on time.This project concept outlines the rationale and methodology of an export development project for 50 manufacturing Rwandan SMEs, members of Rwanda Association of Manufacturers (RAM) to make them export ready and to enhance their capability to do more business in the regional markets of the EAC.
