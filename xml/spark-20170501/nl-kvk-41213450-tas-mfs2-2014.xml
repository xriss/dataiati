   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The ultimate goal is to utilize tourism as a competitive advantage towards improving service delivery to tourists and citizens, generating revenue, creating new jobs and driving economic growth. The association is governed by the Board of Directors composed of community representatives both from the private sector and civil society. The institution is staffed with professional and competent staff able and willing to drive the aims of the association forward and bring back the glory of tourism to &#x160;trpce/Sht&#xEB;rpc&#xEB;.
Tourism association Strpce was established through private/public partnership under USAID DEMI funded project &#x201C;Establishment of Tourism Info Centre&#x201D; in May 2012 with and has more than 100 members. The TA Strpce   has been additionally supported by GIZ Promoting private sector competitiveness programme in 2013 and municipal department for economic development.  In 2014, Municipality of Strpce failed to provide financial support to TIC office after elections on local level that resulted in closing of the TIC Office in March. Taking into consideration initiated privatization of Ski centre Brezovica and anticipated increased number of visitors, Tourism Association of Strpce sees huge interest in organizing and guiding private sector in tourism and related service sectors to prepare their clear vision and promotion of their offer in cooperation with Regional Marketing Centre in Gnjilan. Since its establishment, TIC Strpce faced a problem with low level of skills of appointed staffs paid by municipality that influenced quality of work carried on behalf of businesses promoted. In such an environment, Tourism Association Strpce participated on numerous meetings with local municipal authorities and failed to obtain sustainable support especially in attracting youth to take a leading role in promoting tourism attraction on local, regional and international level. In this respect, Tourism Association Strpce with support of GIZ developed clear ToR of TIC personnel and has identified fields of capacity building trainings that will help TA Strpce to better organize implementation of Tourism Strategy of Municipality of Strpce and take an active role of behalf of private sector representatives by attracting youth educated unemployed people in planning and leading local communities in line with Regional Tourism trends. The project proposal will be implemented through partnership with TV Herc International as local partner that will contribute to better promotion of TIC locally and regionally, through its local media networks and online promotion. Second partner will be BSC Kragujevac that will assist the TIC office to set its internal procedures and develop business plan for future sustainability through membership fees from its members.
Training foreseen under this proposal target representatives of private sector in tourism and other associations that are members of TA Strpce such as:  Beekeeper Association Sarski roj, Farmers Association, Raspberry Association and local craft producers that will benefit from all training courses as most needed in its initial phase in order to crate local identity and brand that will be widely promoted through this action.

Tourism Association Strpce will sign MoU with TA Southern Kosovo and TA Kosovo and Metohija to improve networking and establish more sustainable cooperation with inbound tour operators in Region and to create synergy with future projects that will be developed under this Action.</narrative>
