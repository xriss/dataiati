   <narrative xml:lang="EN">SUTCO will work directly with youth, youth league leaders in Central Equatoria State, Lakes State, Jonglei State and Eastern Equatoria State in collaboration with Government structured affiliated institutions.
The active participants will be students from universities and higher institutions of learning to benefit in the YouthNow! Project Fellowship/ internship program with an objective of working with 6 talented South Sudanese youths to be attached externally and 21 internally as interns in various institutions such as, parliament, judiciary and financial sectors.
SUTCO will also work with leaders and youth in protection of civilian camps (PoCs) so as to give them chances to air out their views and opinions for a wider audience to counteract or listen to.

Stake Holders
SUTCO/YouthNow! Project will interact with private and public sectors leaders, youth groups within and in diaspora, political parties and civil society organizations (CSOs) to address challenges facing South Sudanese youthin the context of the current fighting (post Dec 15th, 2013); when it comes to active participation and/or leadership and decision making; access to practical employment and business opportunities; peace building &amp; conflict resolution; negotiation and reconciliation of for peace and harmony; youthrepresentation and participation.</narrative>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">South Sudan gained freedom and independence on 9th July, 2011, after over 21 years of war. Prior to the current crisis, there was the oil export shutdown from January, 2012, which brought in austerity measures by the Government of South Sudan, and its negative effects on implementation of development programs and projects in the new nation. However, after two years into independence, the 15th December, 2013 Crisis erupted and has compounded on previously existing challenges in terms of development, political, and socio-economic economic positions of the youth. 

According to the 5thSudan Housing and Population Census (2008), the youth constitute 72% of the population of South Sudan; 51% under 18 years; 32% are under 10 years of age; 91% of the population has no qualifications; Literacy rate for population aged between 6 years and above is 29%; and the urban areas literacy rate is 51% while rural is 24%. Key challenges faced by the youth includes; abject poverty despite rich agricultural land; inadequate agricultural implements and seedlings; subsistence farming and little production for the market; negative attitudes of youth towards agri-business; high illiteracy rates for the youth which negatively affects their participation in governance and democracy; lack of access to quality education and/or technical/vocational trainings; job related prejudices and/or negative cultural values; dependency syndrome inherited during war time and lack of networking skills. Other challenges are high cost of living, access to quality health care, and high start-up capital for entrepreneurs; poor road infrastructure and lack of national electricity grid for viable economic developments among others.

Current data on employed youth in the private and public sector is missing. However, according to SHPC 2008, only 9% of youth are in salaried jobs and 11% have given up looking for jobs and 58% are engaged in subsistence farming especially in the agriculture and livestock sectors in South Sudan. With this status quo, the socio-economic position of the youth is quite poor and their active participation in governance and nation building is very low.

In terms of youth participation, very few youth are participating at the management level of political parties, private sector and government departments at national and state levels in South Sudan. At times certain youth are scared away from participating in governance and  democracy due to personal insecurity (human insecurity) / armed conflict sparked by the December 15, 2013 Juba Crisis resulting in untold human rights violations. This recent fighting and human displacement aggravates challenges known to have reduced and limited youths broad active participation in employment, businesses, governance, leadership and decision making roles. The status quo (crisis situation) has distracted the supposed national attention from development to emergencies, many youth are now combatants in the frontlines, some are caught up in crimes, and thousands are living as Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) within South Sudan, or refugees outside the country. In urban areas, there are thousands of redundant youth at tea-places, bars and staying idol houses, probably not motivated and unbothered about work.

The above scenarios and challenges facing the youth need more critical thinking, generation and assessment of alternative strategies for addressing them and choosing the most feasible and realistic ones, while carrying forward on-going and unfinished YouthNow! Project activities in South Sudan.

YouthNow! Project has achieved in bringing South Sudanese youth representatives from 10 States of South Sudan to attend a workshop for understanding the Constitution making process. However, youth issues still have to be put on the agenda of those lawyers and technocrats involved in the Constitution making process so that it can be finally put in the final document, and SUTCO through YouthNow! Project will follow up on this.

YouthNow! Project already has trained ToTs totaling to 15 and a network of 194 followers in and around Juba, especially amongst students in Secondary Schools, Tertiary Institutions and Universities. However, this existing network hardly includes the uneducated or less educated youth in Central Equatoria State. Therefore, in 2015, YouthNow! Project will broaden the number of followers to reach out to more youth in and around Juba, especially in Munuki, Rajaf, Kator, Lobonok, Northern Bari and Gondokoro Payams and other Counties of Central Equatoria State in South Sudan. Youth Now! Project initiative towards Internships/ fellowships placementshas reached the table of some decision makers in 5 Corporate companies including; GEMTEL, Equity Bank, KCB Bank, Zain, and the Co-operative Bank. This was done through a Corporate cocktail meeting held on 2nd December, 2014, at Crown hotel in Juba, South Sudan. This is an initiative under YouthNow! Project that SUTCO team shall vigorously follow-up in 2015 to equip youth with relevant skills and knowledge that make them employable or become job creators.

Notably five youth in the network of YouthNow! Project; have been very active in participating in youth dialogues either on media or through organised forums in Juba. David Ali Tipo, SoroSebit William, Abui John Garang, Ubur Abraham Dingmoi and Florence Lokudu, have been very active in meeting Members of Parliament at National Legislative Assembly and officials of Ministry of Culture Youth and Sports to have the draft national youth policy critically reviewed to reflect and address the real challenges facing both rural and urban South Sudanese youth. Tom Ogwal of SUTCO, made an initiative of contacting UNESCO South Sudan country office officials for support towards development of a national youth policy by contracting two consultants to review the draft youth policy. In line with this SUTCO was invited by UNESCO South Sudan, to send a staff for an International Symposium on Evidence Based Youth Policy Making which was organised by UNDESA and UNESCO, and it was attended by Ubur Abraham Dingmoi, a member of YouthNow! Network. 

This process of reviewing the national youth policy is another on-going activity/ contribution that SUTCO team will follow-up in 2015. Platforms for collecting views of youth and sharing information have created under YouthNow! Project through the website: www.youthnow-ss.org with 7,685 visitors and social networking websites of Twitter, Facebook, Google+ and LinkedIn. Thus, the information shared by youth on the YouthNow! Project website and other social networking websites shall be analyzed and reported on in 2015. In April, 2014, there were 12 youth trained in media production and broadcasting, thus these youth have to be placed in various radio stations to apply the skills they learnt in collaboration with existing radio stations and media practitioners in Juba.

A holistic approach to supporting improvement of youth socioeconomic positions and participation in the governance and democratic systems and structures, need to capture different and various strategies, to positively change youth mentality and thinking, and equip them with skills and knowledge towards effective nation development and governance for self-reliance and transformation in society.

So, that means different strategies involving multiple stakeholders such as private and public sectors including line Ministries such as; Culture Youth and Sports; Education, Science and Technology; Labour, Public Service and Human Resource Development ; and Corporate companies, shall be used to address the challenges  mentioned in the context analysis above. This will be done through capacity building with a focus on equipping youth with employable skills, knowledge and encourage them to think critically; and strengthening of political youth leagues in the different political parties, and the overall ordinary youths to be able to participate jointly and actively in democratic and governance issues, and improve their positions in the socioeconomics aspects.</narrative>
