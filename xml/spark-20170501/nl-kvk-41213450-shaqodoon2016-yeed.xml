   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Somalia has been ravaged by war, political turmoil and humanitarian crisis for decades. While the situation is still relatively unstable, conditions are starting to improve. A significant factor in Somalias future rests with youth and having them engage in economic and development activities.
Somalia has a disproportionately large youth population with more than seventy percent of the population aged under thirty years. Traditional formal-sector entry points into the workforce for
Somali youth are very limited and jobs leading to careers are scarce. There is a growing need in
Somalia to support the entry of youth into informal-sector employment. With fertility levels at
6.2 births per woman between 2010 and 2015, Somali youth will continue to make up a disproportionate percentage of the labour force in the country for the foreseeable future.

Youth unemployment is a pervasive issue in Somalia and is especially apparent in some of the most vulnerable groups in society: disadvantaged with limited or no access to formal education, ex-militia, disabled, minorities, IDPs and, most importantly, women. Statistics on unemployment indicate even though they make up two-thirds of the labour force, 70 percent of the youth cohort is unemployed. According to UNDP Somalia Human Development Report 2012 the unemployment rate of youth aged 14 to 29 was 67 percentone of the highest rates in the world. Females experienced higher unemployment rates at 74 percent. Youth unemployment was highest in Somaliland at 84 percent, followed by South-central Somalia and Puntland at 54% and 62% respectively. This is worrisome as some studies have shown a strong positive correlation between having a disproportionately large youth population and social unrest.

The conflict in Somalia has disproportionately affected women in Somalia, who are often the bread-winners in most families. Men often had to join the war or migrate to other areas to seek better economic opportunities leaving women-run households in many communities. An overview of the informal economy has shown that many small businesses are run by women, and an estimated 70 to 80 percent of the regions households were dependent on womens earnings for the familys livelihood. Somali women faced with either the loss of a husband or a husband unable to find work found means of earning a living through petty trade and cooperatives established with other women.3 This reality is often in direct contrast to their position in a patriarchal society where cultural norms that mean they often have very limited opportunities for education, skills training and access to financial products that could help sustain and grow these income generating activities.

In Somalia, the nexus between unemployment and conflict has assumed great significance due to poor socio-economic conditions and limited economic opportunities, both which make lack of sustainable employment opportunities a catalyst for conflict. As such there is an acute need to mobilize interest, investment, knowledge, resources and action to drive large-scale comprehensive employment and enterprise development programs, particularly for youth.

Shaqodoon recognizes that youth employment is a key contributor to healthy and thriving economy. thereby providing technical assistance and related support to entrepreneurs is one of the most effective and flexible strategies in the fight against poverty and, in particular, youth unemployment in Somalia Based on our experience of working in Somalia we see a significant opportunity to stimulate youth job creation through entrepreneurship development by combining the provision of enterprise development training, access to Business Development Services [BDS] and business mentoring , with the emergence of a new breed of responsive financial institutions and linking these both into a structured mechanism which enables Somalia diaspora to invest (financially and with human resources) back into their home communities.

In partnership with a number of Somali Financial Institutions (FIs) including but not limited to Micro-Dahab  member of Dahabshil group, Kaah Islamic Microfinance Institution Services [KIMS] DaruSalam Bank, IBS Bank, Shaqodoon is in the best position to provide needed support to youth under this project.

Whilst access to finance is a critical barrier to starting and/or growing sustainable enterprises it is not the sole support required. Shaqodoon has also developed a range of innovative enterprise support services such as business skills training and market access solutions which have been offered to enterprises to synergistically complement financing.

Under this project, we propose bringing our skills and experience in addressing hither to underserved market segments to achieve LEAD program objectives through creation of sustainable employment in Somalias growing sectors [Renewable energy, livestock, agriculture, fisheries, and food processing industries], provision of intensive entrepreneurship training, BDS, and access to SME financing via Financial Intuitions with the aim of creating additional direct and indirect jobs for youth.  Shaqodoon will also advocate to promote entrepreneurship education through integration of entrepreneurship education in the education sector i.e. in secondary and higher education by providing in-depth training to teachers, developing and providing comprehensive entrepreneurship learning modules [curriculum] to high school and university teachers.

Shaqodoon will build upon promising practices in implemented projects and leverage their own experience, and partnerships to expand the reach of financial and non- financial services to a greater number enterprises both existing and start-ups in Somalia with a particular focus on disadvantaged groups such as low income women and youth (age 15-24).</narrative>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The target group is young people aged 15  35, with strong emphasis on category age 15  24 years old (over 65%-70% of the total fund), and women account for minimum 40% of all beneficiaries. The project will target young men prone to irregular economic migration, and young women that will increase family income and help reduce migration.</narrative>
