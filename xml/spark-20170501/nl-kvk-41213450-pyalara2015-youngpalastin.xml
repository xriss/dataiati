   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Statistics issued by Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics for  the 2nd  of 2014 stipulate that the unemployment rate in the West Bank has reached 19.1% whereas in Gaza it has reached 46.4%. The highest unemployment rate was 42.8% among youth aged 20-24 years. For years of schooling, the highest unemployment rate among females with 13 years of schooling or more was 52.4%. The public sector employs 22.4% of those in employment with 62.6% by the private sectors, 11.9%  in Israel and the settlements and 3%  in other sectors. In regard to average daily wage for a wage employee is (96.7 NIS &#x201C;$24.7&#x201D; in public sector, with 71.4 NIS &#x201C;$19.8&#x201D; in private sectors  and with 184.3 NIS &#x201C;$51.2&#x201D; in Israel and settlement. 

In order to improve the socioeconomic situation of young Palestinians, PYALARA has initiated its MANARAT project which has been funded by SPARK since January 1, 2013. The project contributes to improving the socio- economic position of young Palestinians through capacity building, advocacy campaigning and policy change. We have managed over the past year to create well informed cadres of young Palestinians who were involved in scores of capacity building sessions. They served as youth workers and young Palestinian leaders. They managed to raise awareness of their peers and community members on issues related to the socioeconomic situation and managed to brainstorm major issues that hinder young Palestinians  engagement and participation in the decision Making process. The project also succeeded in bridging the gap between young Palestinians and Palestinian officials and decision makers, political parties and private businesses to a certain extent through encounters and dialogues to influence them place youth issues on their agendas. The importance of the project lies in its tendency to change policies in favor of young Palestinians rather than opening job opportunities.    

Following the implementation of the project over the past year, the different sectors of the Palestinian society become aware of MANARAT project as follows:
MANARAT is well known inside Palestinian universities. University students  who took part in the project in addition to those involved in YEP training promoted the project amongst their peers in the different Palestinian universities and colleges that include (Abu Deis university, Al-Quds Open University, Khdouri technical school, An-Najah university and Hebron university). 
Political parties become more aware of MANARA and many of political parties representatives expressed their interest in being involved in the project activities and in the debates that will be implemented as part of the project.
Civil society organizations become more aware of the project. This was expressed through our encounters with a number of representatives of CBOs and NGOs. It is worth noting that we cooperated with around 40 organizations and youth centers so far.
Private businesses become aware of the project and its activities.

Following the 55 workshops that were carried out in the different Palestinian governorates to identify major issues  that hinder young Palestinians from improving their socio-economic situation which they identified as retirement age, nepotism and lack of young Palestinians capacities and practical experience and following the two national meetings that were carried out in Hebron and Nablus which aimed at discussing the above issues with decision makers that include:  Mr. Mohammad Shaheen and Dr. Mohamad Amr  from Al-Quds university, Mr. Mohammad Abu Rahma and Mr. Badr Amarneh,  legal consultants, and Mr. Mazin Laham and Mr. Said Shehad from Anti corruption commission, young Palestinians stressed that the emphasis should be directed towards nepotism and retirement age. 

Following such activities,  a number of  meetings were conducted with representatives of the four major Palestinian political parties. A meeting was conducted with Mr. Mahmoud Aloul, Fatah member; Mr. Qais Abdel-Karim, member of the Democratic front; Ms. Kahlida Jarar, member of the popular front and Mr. Hasan Yousef, member of Hamas.  The goal of such meetings was two-fold: first, to get their support to the projects themes (nepotism and retirement age) and secondly to include such issues and themes on their agendas. We got the support of the different political parties apart from Hamas who were reluctant to cooperate for security reasons. 

The project was crowned by a conference that PYALARA organized on November 4, 2014 in Ramallah under the title &#x201C;Towards a national campaign to combat nepotism in Palestine&#x201D;.  The conference was attended by a number of decision makers that include: Dr. Mohammad Shtayyeh, Director of Palestinian Economic Council for Research and DevelopmentPECDAR, Dr. Samir Hleileh, &#xA0;the Chief Executive Officer of Palestine Development and Investment Ltd. (PADICO), Mr. Amar Akr, the Palestine Telecom Group CEO, Mr. Mosa Abu Zeid, Director General of Personnel Council, Dr. Sabri Saidam, a lecturer at BirZeit university and an expert in telecommunications and information technology, Mr. Abdel Muneim Wahdan, member of  mobilization and organization unit/ Fatah party and Mrs. Khalideh Jarrar, Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) and many other guests. There was a consensus amongst the participants on the importance of combating nepotism which is a highly spread phenomenon inside the Palestinian society. The conferences yielded in forming a committee that would approach  the Palestinian prime minister Mr.  Rami Al-Hamdallah to  declare 2015 as a year of combating nepotism and urged the government to adopt an action plan to fulfill such a purpose.</narrative>
