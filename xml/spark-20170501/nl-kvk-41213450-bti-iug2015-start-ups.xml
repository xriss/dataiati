   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Gaza strip has become a difficult place to find work with its 1.8M population on its 360 sq. meters (1), suffering limited land and sea access and strict border restrictions on movement and flow of goods and services into and from the strip. The economic situation has deteriorated over the years, which has resulted in the near collapse of most of the private sector, high poverty rates and extreme rates of unemployment. According to the Palestinian National MDG Report in 2010, 55.7% of the Palestinians in the Gaza strip are living below the poverty line with an unemployment rate of 39.3% in 2009 with the trend rising throughout 2010(2). The world bank has estimated the actual poverty rate in the case of not receiving any humanitarian aid and international funding, and stated that the needs of the Palestinians in the Gaza strip will rise to hit 79.4%(3).

Poverty rates among Palestinian households during 2007 totalled 34.5 %:  23.6 % for the West Bank and 55.7 % in Gaza Strip. The World Bank figures released in 2008 broadly reflect PCBS findings; they note that the crisis rate of poverty in the Gaza Strip meant that poverty figures rose overall. Unemployment increased to exceed extreme limits due to the political uncertainty and severe economic conditions since the year 2007 limits. According to Human Development Report in the OPT (published by UNDP, 2009/2010) The overall unemployment rate in the Occupied Palestinian Territories was 26.0% in 2008, however, it shows a high rate of 40.6% in the Gaza Strip comparing with 19.0% in the West Bank.

This project aims to reduce poverty and unemployment among young entrepreneurs through encouraging them to start their own sustainable businesses by transforming the innovative ideas of the entrepreneurs in Gaza strip into small businesses and projects through providing integrated packages of business development professional services and offering means of linking and matchmaking with the external markets and businesses, which will enhance the economic situation, reduce unemployment, create new sustainable jobs, products and services. The program also is aimed to build strategic linkages between business development programs, local and international businesses and firms along with the academic institutions.
