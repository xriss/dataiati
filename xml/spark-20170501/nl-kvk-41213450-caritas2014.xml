   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In Burundi, the &quot;fruit&quot; sector has huge advantages because of the variety of possible productions and favorable characteristics of the production areas. Over the last decade a number of entrepreneurs have emerged from this sector specializing at different levels of the various activities. Caritas has been a supporter and accompanied this development and has brought a new approach to it by encouraging a value chain development approach to the enhancement of the &#x201C;fruit&#x201D; sector. Nonetheless according to the latest survey of the state of fruits value chain in Burundi (Onudi 2014), a number of bottlenecks are still restraining the development and optimization of the potential of this chain.
These are the lack of skills, equipments, and institutional support among many others. In their recommendations, four areas of action have been proposed: training support, technical support, institutional support and material support. This project will aim at addressing some of these issues. An emphasis will be on a direct input to entrepreneurs with high leverage potential, the governance of the chain, lessons from more developed fruits chains in the region and institutional lobby for battening the environment.
One of the main challenges to address is the adequate access to packaging. A direct input is suggested as benchmark for the rest of actors as to see alternatives that are possible. This will be a business partnership between neighboring country Tanzania packaging firm and a Burundian fruits transformation company. The company has been chosen for its existing linkages with the main fruits producers cooperative of Burundi, its considerable growth potential, professionalism and active role in the initiative of a chain governance and inter-professional body. An institutional support will be also given to the governance body of the fruits chain in Burundi by supporting various round tables and learning experiences from other countries.</narrative>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The direct beneficiaries of this project are:
 At least 500 households producers (members of Passiflore cooperative) will benefit through the construction of storage shed, a contract to supply and improvement of transport through the acquisition of a vehicle;
 The members of the interprofessional body through a platform for discussion with the government, leaning experience platform and an access to price information by a price index to be established.</narrative>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">We will build upon the work the partners have already been doing and add some new business elements (input supply shops, packaging, cooling unit) to be explored and developed by Spark and implemented by local partners. Similarly, Caritas Burundi has taking up a concrete role in the value chain prior to Sparks involvement and focused on technical training, facilitating bulk buying of inputs and organizing Multi-Stakeholder Platform for the fruits chain. The enclosed proposal focuses on their strength and the activities they were doing in preceding years.


1. To upgrade the fruits value chain through targeted interventions across the value chain;
3. Prospect and establish new markets for fruits and fruits processed products of Burundi.

Strategic Obj.3: To increase the legitimacy of government authorities and enhance its role in economic and food security
1. To establish a multistakeholder platform (MSP) of the various actors in the chain;</narrative>
