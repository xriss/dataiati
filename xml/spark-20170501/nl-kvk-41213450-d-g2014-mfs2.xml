   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The goal of this Project Proposal is to create favorable economic environment for development and support for businesses in municipalities Gra&#x10D;anica, Ranilug, Gnjilane and Novo Brdo, where the estimated population is some 60,000, with majority (80%) of ethnic Serbs.

Also, this would help them keep their incomes and existence at minimal acceptable level. One of positive reasons for pushing this idea is the fact that minorities have weaker access to labor market, and the project would enable them to get various skills regarding leadership and entrepreneurship through various programs and trainings. This would also mean support for women entrepreneurs.
It is obvious that after 1999 there is lack of freedom of movement in these communities, so there is permanent need for Support to SMEs in said communities. 
This Project Proposal is based on the fact that it proved very successful within the EURED 1 Project funded by EU and YED Project in 2013, funded by Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs and implemented in cooperation with BSC &#x160;trpce, so we can say that these project achieved some of best results, and serve as a model and benchmark for other people.
This project is intended to support start-ups and new businesses in these communities in eastern and central Kosovo, with the focus on provision of higher education, along with learning of entrepreneurial and innovative skills, as well as certain support in getting information on quality of market researches, and all with the aim of spreading the entrepreneurial spirit and</narrative>
