   <narrative xml:lang="EN">1. The main target groups of this project are going to be women entrepreneurs who are running and managing  SMEs, mainly graduated from 2011 &amp; 2013 Business &#x201C;Plan competition program&#x201D; and those who are joining the BDC services, and transitioning to formal business. In Addition, women Entrepreneurs who are willing to join the economy through creative ideas all over West Bank with more focus on North and South areas.

2. For the Business Plan Competition: Female graduates, from low income families, from all West Bank, mainly  North and South, will be targeted, and have the desire to start their own small businesses due to the lack of job opportunities.</narrative>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">BWF believes in the significant role of women in economy, especially, in line with the difficult circumstances that the Palestinian people go through, women are in need to do any activity that would contribute to earning extra income for the family in order to improve the standard of living. 

While women comprise approximately 49% of the Palestinian population in 2012, female labor force participation rates are relatively low at 17.4%. This rate is much lower than the MENA average of 26%, which itself is one of the lowest in the developing world. This is despite generally high literacy rates and gender parity in education. Supporting women entrepreneurs can serve as a gateway from the informal to the formal sector, and the proposed project can be instrumental in helping women get the necessary skills and support to enter to the formal economy. 
According to a study conducted by UNDP, Palestinian women entrepreneurs lack the necessary advanced technical skills which results in products that are uncompetitive due to inconsistencies in both quality and quantity and goes some way to explaining the low participation of women entrepreneurs in export trade. In fact, the study shows that 63.5% percent of business women sell their products in the villages or towns where they live while only 2.7% percent export their products outside the State of Palestine. This situation is a result of the many constraints that women face including access to finance, access to market, access to information, lack of competencies, social norms,  lack of experience and readiness to start their own business in addition to political restrictions.

This situation reinforces the need to economically empower women and help them overcome existing barriers and constraints. Through Spark program, BWF will provide business development packages the capacities of women SMEs, increase the competitive advantage of the products,  link them with new markets, and increase their sales and income.</narrative>
