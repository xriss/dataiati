   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Burundi is a post conflict country  which must solve many problems including poverty, human rights, unemployment and socio -economic development .
In a under developed country, human rights are hardly respected. The unemployment problem in Burundi is a problem that is likely to create family and social conflicts.

With the project of 2014, the CUFORE wants to continue its mission to contribute to the reduction of youth unemployment residing in urban  and rural areas.
With the achievements of the project in 2013, we found that the problem of youth unemployment is also prominent in rural areas  and the most disadvantaged people are the girls who have completed both university and high school but did not find any employment and the returnees.

The CUFORE would like this 2014 to continue to educate these young people about the benefits of entrepreneurship, but also mentor those who are already aware and already have business plans so that they can create something that generates income. It will be a year of checking the impact of what has already been done.

The CUFORE  must find  a guarantee fund in the amount of ten million Burundian francs ( local currency ) of about 4800 Euros to facilitate the application of Bank loans by young people who have developed business plans last year and already in contact with our partner bank.

In rural areas (like Rutana and Makamba), the main activity is agriculture. We will encourage the young who have completed training for the modules on the basic concepts of entrepreneurship last year and who wish, to follow training on modern farming techniques and livestock; then we will help them develop business plans after.

Young people who live in the capital city are supported by their  relatives or not, but they do not encourage them to create something themselves. We will organize an awareness creation activity of the responsible family heads so that they can help the young people who have developed business plans in research to get start-up funds .

As unemployed women living in the countryside are facing enormous difficulties, we will mentor women who have completed training in entrepreneurship to organize themselves into groups and find people who can support them.

Thus, this project is a continuation of the mission that was assigned CUFORE certainly in collaboration with its partners, namely SPARK. Then, the actual project that CUFORE is waging with SPARK aims to  support and to supervise the jobs creation by young who have a training on entrepreneurship or who have business plans.  We will also work with new young people. In fact, entrepreneurship training offered by CUFORE is relatively expensive when taking into account the financial capacity of potential beneficiaries, young people in need   do not have access to CUFORE training due to finance constraints. This project therefore aims to support these young people without jobs to be trained in entrepreneurship and apply their knowledge.

In addition, CUFORE will continue  to extend activities in some provinces/targeted localities (Rutana-Makamba).

We also intend to do the follow up - coaching young entrepreneurs who have been trained in CUFORE and who have already started their businesses.

To catch short, thousands of young people are facing long-term unemployment. This project is going to help young people to provide for themselves their needs. How will we do that? CUFORE will train them to create their jobs. So, to solve these problems, the project will be focused on the following strategies:

To continue to reduce and tackle young people and women unemployment, i.e to train them to develop their own enterprises.

To support the unemployed young peoples financial contribution to the entrepreneurship training which is expensive because they are in a poverty situation.

To help them to get or access the start-ups funds and to follow up-coaching young entrepreneurs in the management at the start up period of enterprises.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The target group for this project is the following: Youth men and women who have business plans, who were on entrepreneurial concepts and others who havent followed any training in entrepreneurship.  In rural areas, the project will work with educated young returnees and having no permanent job.
The beneficiaries of this project are made up of young people who have completed high school, those with a university degree unemployed for over a year, returnees and young entrepreneurs already active and who wish to expand their activities. The project will target three focus provinces: Bujumbura, Makamba and Rutana. We will try to have many women in our project.</narrative>
