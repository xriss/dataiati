   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The main target group is made of the Youth.  While working with the youth, Fountain-ISOKO strategy is to establish a linkage between youth from different universities and unemployed youth who have studied and the youth organizations representatives from the grassroots.  In fact, the main challenge is that people who have been at school do not return in their communities to work together with their sisters and brothers in their community to tackle issues that are affecting their communities. Another fact is that the advocacy must be done at both local and national levels. Fountain-ISOKO would like to build capacities for the youth from rural zones and those from different universities   to work together and make themselves the advocacy instead of being made by some leaders of the civil society who are based at Bujumbura with limited impact due to the negative prejudices from the political actors.
At the national level, Parliament members, the Economic and Social Commission, Political Parties leaders will be involved in the project activities though the fact based advocacy for laws, national budget and government plans which integrated the youth needs and priorities and an increased position for the youth in the decisions making process.
At the local level, fact based advocacy will be done towards local authorities, Communal and Councils Members and Political Parties leaders so that the needs and priorities for the youth are integrated in the Communal Development Plans.

Fountain-ISOKO is a community based organization and this will facilitate the identification of participants and the accessibility to communities in which this project will be implemented.
The training and coaching activities that will be facilitated for this various targeted groups made of political parties, literate and illiterate young men and women, local and national authorities, interest groups, &#x2026; will bring to fact based advocacy and to capacity build for a fully youth participation in socio-economic policies, programs and decisions making.</narrative>
