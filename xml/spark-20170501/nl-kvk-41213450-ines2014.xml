   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The INES-BIC project will involve among others:
The students of INES-Ruhengeri (about 3400 in Bachelor and Masters programs) will be the project direct beneficiaries. They will be provided with entrepreneurship education, training, guidance and counseling on how to start and grow their own enterprises and on how they can create and enhance their future employability. 
The INES-Ruhengeri staff and graduates (both teaching and non-teaching) will be provided with advisory services and support to improve their organizational and managerial skills and also to assist them in the event of becoming entrepreneurs 
Neighboring regional community especially youth and women, business community, cooperatives around the university selected on needs will be assisted and get opportunity to access business information from the Centre</narrative>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">To address the issue, INES seeks to introduce a Business Incubation Centre (BIC) and seeks further support to team up with a university effort and resources that can assist develop its capacity. INES will also need support to train its own staff in the medium and long run for sustainability of the entrepreneurship and business development skills. 

As start-up capital is difficult to secure for graduates without collateral grants are therefore necessary to initiate entrepreneurs. Though providing direct money to business plan winners would be easy for them, linking them with bankers and continue provide them technical support could produce better results. So, INES-BIC thinks in terms of securing the initial start-up capital  through what we can call the revolving guarantee fund which can be deposited in a bank (with whom INES has a MoU) where the winners can be referred and get the money from and pay back. This reduces risks of losing money because the winner will be under full control of the bank and the bank who acts on behalf of INES will develop good partnership with clients through INES. This will enhance the sustainability of the project once it will have ended because as borrowers pay back to banks which manages on behalf of INES, further innovative ideas will be encouraged and supported through this close collaboration. 

This project will be carried out with the main purpose of transforming lives and mindsets of local population by providing business development skills and knowledge&#x201D; that make them good competing entrepreneurs and managers. INES-BIC will be created to provide entrepreneurship education, training, advisory and consultancy services to the prospective and established entrepreneurs as the major components of this project.  The project finally addresses the capacity building needs of the associated academic staff and the related business incubation personnel.

The total budget is 81,139 Euros and the partner contribution is 23,323 Euros</narrative>
