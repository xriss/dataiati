   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The first beneficiaries of the proposed interventions will be startups and more developed digital enterprises, through direct business development support. Secondly, this project will support unemployed youth to find employment at startups, providing them with experience and skills, and at the same time piquing their interest in entrepreneurship. Finally, largely, this project will target Palestinian youth at large, who will participate in pipeline development activities that will help Leaders identify new entrepreneurs and ideas.</narrative>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The proposed project builds on support already provided by Spark to Leaders Organization, as well as other programs developed and carried out by Leaders for the past several years. The last grant given to Leaders by Spark incorporated an organizational capacity-building component. This component helped Leaders review our work since our inception, including best practices and lessons-learned, and put us on a renewed focus to become a regional leader in developing inclusive, sustainable and dynamic economies, helping visionaries step out of their comfort zone, take risks and create opportunities that fast-forward the economy. This new focus embarks us on supporting the growth of startups, small and medium businesses in the innovation economy. 

This renewed focus goes hand-in-hand with our most promising existing programs, including those supported by the Spark 2014 grant. It also fits well within the second strategy of the MFS II programbusiness startup support and job creation. 

The decision to focus on startup support towards job creation, specifically in companies in the innovation economy was carefully made. Palestine currently suffers from an unemployment rate of nearly 28 percent, with the highest concentration among Palestinian youth (which comprise the majority of the Palestinian population) at 41 percent (Source: Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics). Among young university graduates, this rate was even higher, at nearly 50 percent. After a boom boosted mostly by donor aid funds, the Palestinian economy has faced a deep fiscal crisis, leaving the Palestinian private sector with a critical role to play in rebuilding the Palestinian economy. However, to reduce the unemployment rate even by just 10 percent would require the private sector to create at least 1 million new jobs by 2030, which would be roughly equal to doubling the current number of workers (Source: Beyond Aid: A Palestinian Private Sector Initiative for Investment, Growth and Employment, Portland Trust, November 2013). This daunting task would overburden even a healthy economy, much more so one that is heavily constrained by the Israeli occupation. As such, it is not only imperative that more jobs be created, but also that new companies create many of these jobs. 

Adding to this strategic focus on startups, was the realization that many young Palestinian graduates are finishing their studies with strong, competitive skills in fields like engineering and information and communications technology (ICT). Further, the borderlessness of this particular sector, relying mostly on good internet connectivity to provide services to the world, makes the innovation economy particularly attractive as a focus industry. 

Through its existing programs in digital entrepreneurship, including FastForward, Palestines first startup accelerator, and eZone, a new tech hub launched April 2014, Leaders is well-positioned to continue to support the development and growth of new companies in this field. With Sparks contribution, Leaders can continue to provide excellent business development support to startups and more developed enterprises, as well as encourage more young people to consider entrepreneurship or working at a startup as a career path.</narrative>
