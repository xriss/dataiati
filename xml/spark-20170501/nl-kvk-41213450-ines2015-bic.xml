   <narrative xml:lang="EN">It is now one year that the INES-Business Incubation Center is established under the support of SPARK. As a new center that services INES graduates, staff and surrounding community, INES-BIC team, after being trained in managing an incubator, adults learning and M&amp;E, successfully managed to run the business plan competition from April to June 2014 where more than 100 participants acquired knowledge and skills for business start-up. Among them 20 best winners to be incubated within INES-BIC received support involving coaching, mentoring and networking with finance institutions vital for starting their own businesses. Until 20th October 2014, 10 start-ups managed to register at RDB and others are still in the process.

Apart from the competition, in September 2014 Business communities involving Business men and women from Districts of Gakenke, Musanze and Burera that surround INES-Ruhengeri attended Business trainings for their growth and development. This community showed interest and commitment to get linked to INES-BIC for their future success.

During this first year process, a lot of lessons were learned and they show a need for continuous promotion of entrepreneurship and mindset change. The following major challenges that arose are the basis for 2015 project. Among them we can list:
Overcoming the &#x201C;Newness perception&#x201D; for INES-BIC. Mindset that INES-BIC is not different from other Business Development Centers that existed before and failed to deliver
Mindset that INES-BIC is like a funding agency that should provide seed capital although networking events linking trainees to Banks were organized.
Business plan winners who fear to take risks (This delayed starting their business).
The surrounding community that fears attending training provided at University premises because they think they are for students or others with a certain high level of education. They requested training at grassroots level (which were not planned for in 2014)
Securing agreement with individuals or organization that provide hands on skills to our supported team (especially with regard to safety and security of sensitive equipment (lab, restaurant/Hotel) used during training/mentorship)
To address the issues, INES seeks to introduce  new approaches listed here below:
Business capacity building customization
Extension of INES-BIC services to grassroots level (Districts/ Sector)
Establishing and strengthen close relationships with local government authorities from district to the Sector level in order to reach and serve local people easily.
Business oriented conferences ( finding out right approaches to raise mindset of local people using the intermediaries (PSF, business Probers at Sector levels )
Fostering the Young Enterprise Program (Learning Business by Doing) at INES Ruhengeri (INES students and provision of courses based on KSA (knowledge, Skills, and Attitude)
Prepare the action plan of INES-BIC networking approaches specifically during technical support
In Business plan 2015, to form small groups of students and emphasize more on big group from surrounding community
Proper screening (Based on long term vision of applicants) in different activities of INES-BIC such as in trainings, coaching/mentoring, etc.
Continue to provide technical support to those who attended previous events in 2014 but did not manage to start their business


This project will be carried out with the main purpose of promoting and enhancing entrepreneurship mindsets of local population by providing business development and growth skills &amp; support that make them good competing entrepreneurs and managers. INES-BIC will continue to provide trainings (with much emphasis on grassroots level), advisory, technical support and consultancy services to the prospective and established entrepreneurs as the major components of this project.</narrative>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The INES-BIC project will involve among others:
The students of INES-Ruhengeri will be the project direct beneficiaries. Through &#x201C;Learning by Doing program&#x201D; they will be introduced to entrepreneurship education, given training, guidance and counseling on how to start and grow their own enterprises while still at University, and on how they can create and enhance their future employability.
The INES-Ruhengeri staff and graduates (both teaching and non-teaching) will be provided with advisory services and support to assist them in the event of becoming entrepreneurs
Neighboring regional community especially youth and women, business community, cooperatives around the university selected on needs will be assisted and largely get opportunity to access technical support and business information from the Centre and its partners.</narrative>
