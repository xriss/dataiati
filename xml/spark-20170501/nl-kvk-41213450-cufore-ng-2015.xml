   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Burundi is a post conflict country which must solve many problems including poverty, human rights, unemployment and socio-economic development. In a under developed country, human rights are hardly respected. The unemployment problem in Burundi is a problem that is likely to create family and social conflicts.
Over recent years, Burundi does not create employment and youth unemplyment is increasing more and more. To help reduce the youth unemployment, the Light University of Bujumbura through its service, the University Centre for Trading and research in Entrepreneurship, CUFORE, with New Generation ogranized entrepreneurship trening for young people. CUFORE begun in 2010 with few young men and women but in 2013 and 2014, with the option of taking an interest not only to the young people living in the Capital city but also to those of the country side at the two southern provinces of Makaba and Rutana more than 418 young people were trained. Modules that were used to train them are the basic concepts, the cycle of creation and management of a small business and the business plan.
55 young people were trained on modern agriculture and livestock raring technics and (in the field of fruits, vegetables and small lovestock). New generation trained 75 youth with 24 in 2013 and 51 with 2014.
As they could not have access to credits in 2014, 12 projects have to start in 2013 with the limited means but have not grown. At Bujumbura two projects could start with a secured credit by the garantee fund from CUFORE. For New Generation, no business plan was produces while youth have been trained.

For the year 2015, we would like to carry out a supervision and monitoring by the field officers based in Makamba who will also coach these young people who have been trained fot the sustainability of the project. The written 23 business plans will be adapted to current conditions. 75 young people who have not finished writing their business plans will be accompanied for finalizing. 55 young people who have agricultural projects will be trained in technical processing and preservation of fruits and vegetables. All young people who have started up their projects will have an on-site training management techniques.

A space where they will dip tips, experiences and support services and where they will connect with other economic operators and investors will be created with a regular supervision from New Generation. The center will be managed by New Generation with the Monitoring and Evaluation officer with the task of organizing personalized coaching sessions with promoters of SMEs, meetings with holders Success stories, information session with partners from the goverment on legislation in use for business, financial partners and funding opportunities.

There is an amount of 20,000 dollars which is going to be disbursed 2015 by a Partner of CUFORE and it will be playing the role of guarantee funds, thus small credits can be awarded. A fair trade show will be organized to facilitate the promotion of products of young companies created by these young people.</narrative>
