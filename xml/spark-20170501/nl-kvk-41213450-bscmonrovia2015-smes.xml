   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Direct beneficiaries of this program are mostly marginalized and vulnerable youths (rural &amp; urban) men and women with technical/vocational and university skills and knowledge. Focus is on ambitious and innovative youth who have high start-ups and growth potential, all between the ages of 18  35. A second target group are existing businesses that have the potential to grow. These SGBs will, with the right support, grow, generate more revenue and employ people

Also, BSC would target corporate groups such as banks, telecommunications companies, media groups, firms, concessionaires, etc. for income generating purposes as part of the sustainability model.</narrative>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Liberia is transitioning from post-conflict reconstruction to long term economic development since the end of its 14-year conflict in 2003. Though Liberia is endowed with vast mineral wealth, there is a huge potential for infra-structure investments from concessionaires. Liberias economy has experienced high growth since 2006 as post-war reconstruction has continued. Growth in 2012 of 8.9% was driven by the first full year of iron ore exports since the end of the war, timber and rubber exports, construction, and services sector growth.  But, as in the past, growth in these capital-intensive enclave sectors is unlikely to create substantial employment opportunities as they have limited linkages to the rest of the economy.

A dynamic private sector, buoyed by strong entrepreneurship, creates jobs, increases incomes and generates tax revenues. Through the exchange of goods and services, entrepreneurship development can play an essential role in improving socio-economic development and regional and global integration.

Business Environment and Competitiveness: Liberias private sector largely consists of:
i) large foreign companies operating iron ore mining, timber, rubber, and palm oil concessions;
ii) a formal sector in Monrovia largely servicing the Government and aid sector;
iii) an informal sector of micro and small enterprises; and
iv) the rural subsistence agriculture sector that employs the majority of the population.

The International Finance Corporation (IFC)/World Bank reports using key indicators such as: Paying taxes, enforcing contracts, trading across borders and getting electricity. The World Bank Doing Business Report placed Liberia among the 10 Best Business Reforming countries in the world in 2009 after improving its ranking from 178 in 20 07 to 157 in 2008, but reforms since then have slowed and it has only improved to 149th of 185 countries in 2013. It ranked 111 of 144 countries in the 2012 Global Competitiveness Index.

Reforms since 2006 have improved the ease of starting a business, dealing with construction permits, and trading across borders, and a commercial court has been established. Liberia needs to improve on registering property, enforcing contracts, resolving insolvency, getting electricity, and protecting investors. There are still numerous challenges faced by both local and foreign firms, which have become an impediment to their success. Increasing demands from local enterprises/SMEs to National Government to develop policies that would provide better incentives for them to increase their market shares and generate wealth, for example: income tax reduction, establishing a credit bureau, establishing fund for SME Development.

The revised Revenue Code, for example, provides tax incentives for investing outside of Monrovia and also reduced the top Corporate and personal tax rate from 35% to 25%. Since the inception of the current administration, there has been some focus on the sector in partnership with private organizations to promote Liberian businesses. The Micro Small Medium Enterprise (MSME) Division of the Ministry of Commerce has formed a private sector stakeholders group that works together and addresses existing concerns. There has been improvements, but largely the problems still exit.

The services industry comprised the largest component of GDP in 2011, an estimated 44%, led by trade and hotels, government services, real estate, transport and communication, and construction. The sector employs an estimated 45% of the labor force and is supported by the large donor presence. The agriculture, fisheries, and forestry sectors contribute around 41% of GDP, while employing about 47% of the labor force. Forestry and rubber concession exports are the drivers of this sector, followed by cassava, rice, and subsistence production.

The mining and quarrying sector comprised only about 7% of GDP in 2011 and employed around 2% of the labor force, but it is expected to expand to more than 15% of GDP by 2015, as investments from three major concessionaires come online. Oil exploration continues, but potential production would not commence until the end of decade.  Nonetheless, governance concerns in the forestry, palm oil, and oil sectors have slowed growth.  Manufacturing - primarily of cement, beverages, and various consumer goods - will continue to have a limited impact on output and growth. The sector suffers from severely insufficient and prohibitively expensive electricity supply, a shortage of skilled labor, the high cost of inputs, and a limited production capacity. It employs an estimated 7% of the labor force.

Weak institutions, low public sector salaries, lack of training and limited capacity, as well as insufficient and cumbersome regulations have created both incentives and opportunities for corruption across the public sector. It is very important that these issues/problems will be confronted, as with many striving economies, private sector development is the driving force behind economic growth.</narrative>
