   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Republic of South Sudan, independent since July 9, 2011, faces a host of stabilization challenges as it transitions to full and responsible statehood.  The new state faces a complex web of challenges which fuel local tensions and undermine the governments capacity to extend authority over large swathes of its territory. A sprawling sparsely populated landscape with little physical infrastructure challenges the capacity of an under-resourced and over-stretched local government to provide services, including security. Cattle herders compete over scarce resources of water and grass during the dry season, while a culture of cattle raiding, fueled by easy access to arms after the civil war, leads to tit-for-tat raids which can quickly escalate into full-scale conflict between groups.  Moreover, a meager local economy and limited access to education provide few alternatives to life in the cattle camps for youth, who, idle and unemployed, are ready recruits for cattle raids, intertribal conflict and rebel insurgencies.  Against the backdrop of these cultural, economic, and historical factors, a number of deeply-rooted, politically-resonant conflicts with the ability to broadly threaten the viability and credibility of the state raise the specter of potential state failure. In view of this, South Sudans challenge for the immediate post-independence period is transitioning to a stable and viable state willing and able to provide services to all the countrys citizens.

The new Republic of South Sudans long, heavily militarized, and highly politicized border with Sudan is at high risk of conflict in the short and mid-term. Historically, shared economic interests and natural resources, particularly oil, water, gum acacia, simsim and grazing grounds, and a seasonal flow of migratory pastoral populations have linked the border communities in cooperation at vital trading points such as the Warawar peace market in Northern Bahr el Ghazal State.  However, recent troubling developments make effective governance of the border regions of South Sudan more vital and more challenging than ever.  The takeover of Abyei by Sudan Armed Forces (SAF) troops in May 2011 displaced more than 40,000 people and froze negotiations over the fate of this disputed territory.  Ongoing military action in Southern Kordofan and Blue Nile states has displaced hundreds of thousands and led to an influx of refugees and returnees into South Sudan.  Tensions between Sudan and South Sudan have also had economic as well as political and military impacts.  The nominal, but incomplete closure of the border has seriously harmed local economies. Prices of the food commodities upsurges and consequently unaffordable by most of the unemployed youth, women and returnees alike.

Aweil East County is the most populated   county in Northern Bar El Ghazal State by Dinka-Malual, According to 5th Sudan population and housing Census, 2008, Aweil East has a total population of 309,921 which is about 42.99% of the total population of Northern Bhar El Ghazal State.&#xA0; However, disputes over the location of the north-south border could also destabilize the area, given anger in the state over the handling of the disputed &#x201C;Mile 14&#x201D; area in recent negotiations between Sudan and South Sudan. In order to increase the capacity of county authorities to address these challenges, However, Sudan aims to create a local inclusive agricultural development agenda by ensuring economic opportunities for youth. It contributes to structural poverty reduction by integrating a value chain development approach with pro-poor employment creation, in a conflict-sensitive way. The programmes interventions (i) support sustainable agricultural job creation through promotion of income generating activities and rural enterprise development; (ii) focus on marginal groups, demobilised combatants, youth, women and refugees/IDPs, and on conflict affected regions; local and national authorities will be engaged to develop an inclusive and integrated.</narrative>
