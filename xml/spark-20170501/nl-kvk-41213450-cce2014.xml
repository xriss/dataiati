   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In 2014, CCE will continue to work on five components: (i) internal capacity-building; (ii) enhancing sustainability of small enterprises; (iii) growing medium-sized enterprises; (iv) encouraging the establishment of new businesses; (v) advocacy &amp; lobbying 
The first component supposes building capacity of CCEs specialists working with private sector through their participation in different workshops provided in the frame of the UEC project. This is expected to allow CCE to add more BDSs to the scope of work, to enhance the quality of the services, and to rely more on the in-house team in the service provision.   

The second project component will address the problem of vulnerability of local small enterprises. This component will focus on remote regions, which are historically neglected by business service providers. Moreover, these remote communities, and especially rural communities, have been the most negatively affected by the occupation and prolonged socio-economic crisis and cmontinue to sink deeper into poverty and deprivation. In such context, many Palestinian small enterprises were established as an employer of last resort: by many unemployed, launching a small own business is viewed as the only chance to find a living. Laborers who cannot work anymore in Israel; women who have to take over the financial responsibilities in their families because their husbands are unemployed or arrested; fresh graduates who cannot find a job because the stagnated and limited market cannot absorb them  many people from these categories try to start their small business. However, majority of such endeavors fail, leading to worsening the families economic situation because of a heavy burden of loans taken for establishing the business. Hence, by working on enhancing sustainability of small enterprises, CCE will contribute to keeping the vulnerable small businesses alive and to maintaining job places created by these small businesses.
Key reasons, for which the small businesses fail, mainly fall under two categories: 
business owners do not understand the market, in which they operate, and do not know how to watch the market so that to respond to the market needs and trends; and 
owners of small companies usually play all key roles in their companies (e.g., marketing, sales, financial management, operations management, HR management, etc) without having proper knowledge in these fields.    
Therefore, this component will aim at (i) increasing competitiveness of small businesses by assisting them to become market-driven; and (ii) enhancing efficiency of business operations. 

This component will work through the provision of mentoring services to the small enterprises and will entail the following steps: 
Diagnosis of the current business performance based on face-to-face interviews with the owners and key personnel, in addition to observation of the production and warehousing processes. The current business performance will be assessed in all key business fields to include marketing, financial management, HR management, inputs supply, and outputs production. The business owner will be responsible for collecting any missing information regarding target markets, customers, suppliers, distributors, etc, however, the mentors will provide him/her with all needed forms and advices on how to collect the missing information. The findings of the diagnostic stage will be documented in the SMEs Diagnostic Form developed in the UEC/CCE 2012 project; 
Analysis of the data collected and development of recommendations for improving the enterprises performance in key fields described above. All recommendations will be developed in close cooperation with the business owner. 
Continuing assistance to the enterprises in integrating the recommendations developed in the previous stage    
Noteworthy, in the implementation of this component, CCE will rely on a pool of mentors whose capacity was developed during 2011 &amp; 2012 UEC-funded projects.    

The third project component will focus on medium-sized enterprises. This type of enterprises has the greatest potential to create new sustainable job places, especially for fresh graduates. On the other hand, if a medium-sized company closes, many people lose their jobs and join the army of unemployed. 
From our experience in the 2012 &amp; 2013 PROFIT project, the quality consulting services can indeed save companies from bankruptcy. We have several examples that we consider success stories because owing to our consulting services, these companies are still in operations: Birzeit Technical Laboratories whose representatives came to us after the management had taken decision to close the enterprise; Beit Arusa boutique whose owner came to our training to get new skills so that to find a job and close her boutique; ALFA Electronics whose owner was about to emigrate because he didnt see any potential for his company in the local market, etc.
 
The nature of services to be provided to medium-sized enterprises will depend on their actual needs, which will be identified in diagnostic meetings with the enterprises. Potential services include the development of new marketing strategies, feasibility studies for launching new business units or products, export strategies, product branding, business planning, development of a CRM system, etc. 
In addition, in this component CCE will organize a number of training workshops for the business owners and managers from the senior and middle positions. This need was identified in the 2012-2013 PROFIT project, where owners of medium-sized companies were asking us about trainings for their personnel. The most demanded fields were (i) modern marketing; (ii) sales; (iii) financial management for non-financial managers; (iv) production management. As business owners explained, there is a severe shortage of qualified people in local labor market because as secondary as tertiary educational institutions graduate youth whose knowledge is irrelevant to the local private sector and who do not have skills to immediately start implementation of their job duties. On the other hand, business owners themselves tend to establish a business in the fields of their technical expertise (aluminum processing, food production, etc) and, hence, do not possess knowledge in the fields related to the business management. 
CCE team has a strong differentiation point in the arena of business training: the training will be delivered by private sector practitioners who will then continue working with the participants through on-job coaching. This approach is entirely different of those currently used by other local service providers, which engage either university professors, who are far away from everyday life of local SMEs, or young trainers without any practical experience (the latter approach is usually used by local private consulting companies running after profit making). Moreover, the training usually ends with the last training session with no any follow up activities.

In order to select enterprises for the consultancy services and participants for the trainings, CCE plans to participate in local fair trades and exhibitions organized by different industries. Again from our experience, local companies do not value the consulting &amp; training services, and attracting clients for such services (even provided for free) becomes a big challenge. Owners and managers simply say that they do not want to waste their time. Hence, we will prepare promotional materials explaining in a simple way our approach in service provision and demonstrating success stories.       

The forth projects component will address the problem of deficient business skills by potential entrepreneurs. Local education system orients students to be job-seekers; it does not develop skills critical for entrepreneurs such as market screening, ideas generation, problem solving, analytical skills, communication skills, etc. As a result, even those people, who have in mind interesting business ideas, feel fear of launching their businesses, not saying about that they do not know how to make the first steps.    
The entrepreneurship training, which will be a basic element in this component, shall serve as a catalyst for encouraging those, who just think to launch their own businesses, to make a step forward and set up the business on the ground. However, our interventions will not stop with the entrepreneurship training and will provide all needed technical support for the potential start-ups. Briefly our interventions for this category of beneficiaries can be described as below:
Training of potential entrepreneurs on market screening and business conceptualization
Selection of entrepreneurs, who have generated sound business ideas, for the next phase
Training of selected entrepreneurs on business planning
Coaching of the above entrepreneurs on (i) assessing the business feasibility and (ii) development of a business plan
Advising on sources of financing the potential start-ups     
In order to encourage potential entrepreneurs to apply for this type of CCEs services, we will organize a Business Plans Competition where the best plans will be awarded different monetary and non-monetary prizes.  
  
Finally, in the fifth project component, CCE will directly contribute to enhancing business environment through developing capacity of the Ministry of National Economy, which is the key player in the arena of setting and modifying the business regulations, policies, standards, procedures, etc. Recently CCE in partnership with the Italian company EURECNA has won an EU-funded project aimed at the MoNE capacity-building. 
 In the preparatory phase, the project donor  EC - has identified that there are many gaps in the MoNE structure and operations that have adverse effect on the ministrys capacity to carry out its duties and functions, to name a few: 
Lack of job description that match the competencies and skills required for the persons assigned to the jobs 
Lack of standardized operating procedures and stable institutional structure that can resist cabinet reshuffle 
Lack of effective quality management system, quality standard and documented internal policies and procedures 
Overlapping among various directorates and limited staff participation in planning and decision making processes 
Consequently, the project was designed to improve the MoNEs organizational and human resources capacity, to carry out its mandate.
CCE in the project is responsible for development of the new operational systems and quality control mechanisms in addition to development and delivery of the capacity-building program to the Ministrys staff. For the project implementation, CCE has mobilized a new project team, however, the experts from the SPARK-funded PROFIT team will be engaged in many services to be delivered to the ministry (especially those aimed at the development of new systems).</narrative>
