   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Project Goal(s):

- Support entrepreneurship and SME development in isolated regions and among
marginalized group (youth and women) through trainings

- Extend support to starting entrepreneurs as well as existing SMEs through Loan scheme of
UEC partners BSCK and BAC Zvecan &#x2013; direct impact to poverty reduction.
The idea of Loan scheme is to provide good Loan conditions (low installment rate) to
SME&#x2019;s. As one of the criteria for using Loan scheme we can request from SME&#x2019;s to
employ new staff. Also loans could be used only for start-up of business, expend of
production or market. According to experience of other organizations in region that
provided this kind of loan schemes, repayment rate was between 70-80%. This repayment
rate was in 2006 (IOM SEDMIN repayment rate), at that moment still judiciary institutions
were not functioned in full capacities. Information that we received today from FINCA
(Strpce office) saying that current repayment rate is 95%. They have only 5 not repaying
cases on the court. This shows improvement of awareness of entrepreneurs and citizens in
general. According to this information and BAC Zvecan and BSCK experience repayment
rate will be high even more then 90%.

- Identify barriers to doing business for the entrepreneurs and SMEs, leading to a (more)
enabling environment for private sector development.</narrative>
