   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Owners and managers of Micro, Small and medium enterprises (include Cooperatives); Unemployed youth, women, graduates with a drive to become entrepreneurs (graduates of basic nine years/twelve years of education, Technical vocational colleges, Universities) and other vulnerable groups. Moreover, people who havent started business yet and SMEs which are struggling and can perform better and graduates of the past phases of AERG and the HUB who have already started businesses, in order to strengthen and grow. In total the project will directly benefit 500 individuals.</narrative>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The public sector is shrinking, reducing formal employment while there is an increasing number of graduates, woman and other vulnerable groups looking for employment especially those within community and in the country at large.In addition, people are not willing to take the risk to become entrepreneurs, because they have no role models, there is a misconception about entrepreneurship which is seen as a second choice compared to formal employment, people prefer to rely on formal jobs.   In addition, there is limited support to develop entrepreneurship skills. Finally, increasing number of jobless people becomes a burden on the government.

To date, ADC has focused on grass roots, cooperative development and supporting the entrepreneurship hub.  ADC has done this by working with other partners (e.g. to access the cooperatives). The cooperatives and entrepreneurs who have begun work dont have the skills and experience with implementation of their business models to help them to grow and employ others. Whereas, AERG is focusing on supporting graduates and ongoing students in universities to prepare young people for the life after school to become entrepreneurs but also increase the chance of producing employability candidates through different programmes including internship on-job training for non entrepreneurs. Both AERG and ADC work young people both in schools and drop-outs. In the selection of target beneficiaries, emphasis is given to existing companies with growth potential. Further, In the selection of target beneficiaries, emphasis is given to existing companies especially in Kigali province with potential growth. In additional, special attention is given to women entrepreneurs who are expected to constitute at least 60% of direct beneficiaries of our services 
Presently, youth both educates and un educated are not accessing the critically needed support needed to build their skills and expand their business ideas. In addition, youth need more than training and education to build sustainable and innovative businesses  but mentorship, networking, and business guidance too. It is only by addressing each of the challenges facing them  be it extreme poverty, lack of skills and guidance, and capital  that youth will be empowered to start businesses or access quality employment. 
In order to achieve the long term development goals, the Government of Rwanda has formulated a medium strategy. The economic development and poverty reduction strategy (EDPRS 2)s highest priority is growth acceleration and poverty Reduction through its four thematic areas; Economic transformation, Rural development, Productivity and Youth employment as well as accountable governance.
EDPRS 2 aims to achieve the following goals by 2018
Increasing GDP per capital to $ 1000
Reducing the poverty rate to below 30%
Reducing extreme poverty rate below 9%
Quoting from World Bank report 2014.

PROPOSED SOLUTION

Strengthening the hub and expanding AERG business centre and developing internal systems
Create a one stop centre to support various products and services in the value chain, e.g. market information, Business to Business starting with one of the Kigali City district and replicate experiences to all 30 districts of Rwanda. Develop EH Web Site and other promotional materials to make the services known and accessed by the public; Build the capacities of the hub staff through attending professional trainings; Develop a five year strategic business plan for the EH; Develop Entrepreneurship Hub management systems and professional trainings for EH staff. Be a source of information: This will include having business in a box kit for products/services, we will start with 5 kits in line with Kicukiro District priority sector/Cluster namely Weaving/Handcraft, Meat processing, Furniture, Juice-Maize agro-processing and Coffee. 


Contributing to poverty Alleviation: This will be achieved through youth enterprise promotion;  Growing Enterprises access new markets and expansion funding; training women Entrepreneurs on tax education, using IT and internet for tax declaration and  accessing markets and improve Financial Reports; conducting  Business opportunity/inspirational symposia/networking events bringing together various stakeholders including investors/entrepreneurs.  Training growing enterprises on accounting, Financial management among other areas of business management. Moreover, organize fund raising activities for the start-up entrepreneurs to access Technical Assistance and meeting initial start-up costs.

This proposal will have a long term impact in terms of contributing to the Rwanda Economic Development and Poverty Reduction Strategy (EDPRS II) targeting to achieve 11.5% average GDP growth per annum and reduce poverty to below 30%.  This proposal will contribute to governments efforts to transform the economy, the private sector and alleviating constraints to growth of investment by developing the appropriate skills and competencies to allow Rwandan particularly the youth and Women to become more productive and competitive.</narrative>
