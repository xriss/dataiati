Project objectives

YETP will transform the lives of young survivors by enabling them to create and secure income, by accessing employment or establishing and growing market based SMEs, and in so doing eradicate their extreme poverty and that of their dependents.
Contribute to economic development in Rwanda and poverty alleviation through SME development and greater access to quality employment among youth.
Youth not choosing to pursue entrepreneurial ventures will be linked with internships, thus providing them with direct employment opportunities and building the work force of the Rwandan labor market.
Monthly &#x201C;Business Development Club&#x201D; networking sessions will provide entrepreneurial youth in Rwanda with the opportunity to network, collaborate, and build their knowledge of business</narrative>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project will identify and recruit vulnerable graduates with demonstrable entrepreneurial characteristics, and will systematically monitor their involvement in all activities to ensure that at the target group are generating an average income above the national poverty line by the project end. The businesses that they establish will result in income-generation that will alleviate the poverty and hunger of their households, in addition to generating employment opportunities for others.
The high number of Universities and job opportunities in Kigali means that youth require more skills to compete in the job market. As such, the project will take place in Kigali Central, but support and follow up will be provided to pre-existing businesses that exist outside of Kigali as well.</narrative>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project will support graduates of the past phases of AERGs Youth Entrepreneurship Training Programme (YETP) who have already started businesses, in order to strengthen and grow already existing SMEs. In total the project will directly benefit 200 individuals.</narrative>
