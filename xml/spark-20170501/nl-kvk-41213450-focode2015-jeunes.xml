   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Political participation of young people in Burundi remains a problem, however, there are some opportunities which we spotted on the course of this years youth engagement programme. 

Before diving into the details, lets briefly review some of the legally binding documents signed by the Burundian government in favor of increased youth participation:
 
International level
Article 21 in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights recognizes that all human beings have a right to participate in the management of their respective countries and that no one should be discriminated against if they seek to do so: &quot;Everyone has the right to take part in the government of his country, directly or through freely chosen representatives.&#x201D;
Additionally, Article 25 of the International Covenant of Civil and Political Rights states: &quot;Every citizen shall have the right and the opportunity to vote and to be elected at genuine periodic elections which shall be by universal and equal suffrage and shall be held by secret ballot, guaranteeing the free expression of the will of the electors.&quot;
Regional level 
In Article 31 of the African Charter on Democracy, Governance and Elections (ACDEG) also confirms a sense of urgency and commitment towards promoting youth political participation: &quot; 1. State Parties shall promote participation of social groups with special needs, including the Youth and people with disabilities, in the governance process. 2. State Parties shall ensure systematic and comprehensive civic education in order to encourage full participation of social groups with special needs in democracy and development processes.&#x201D; Furthermore, Article 11 of the African Youth Charter gives several obligations to Africans States in the following statements: Guarantee young people&apos;s access to Parliament and other decision-making bodies in accordance with the prescribed laws; Ensure equitable access to young men and young women to participate in decision-making and in fulfilling civic duties. 

The texts quoted above are explicitly in favor of political participation and the inclusion of specific social groups, including young people in the decision-making process. In addition to these international legal frameworks, there are texts at the national level, such as the Constitution and the Electoral Code which also promote youth political participation. For example, Article 19 of the constitution, in Title II, incorporates all the international instruments mentioned above: the UDHR, ICCPR, etc... This article has been utilised successfully to advocate for the use of quotas to increase political participation of disadvantaged groups such as women and the Batwa. Why cant this be utilised to advocate for the marginalized youth leaders? The electoral code also permits a Burundian with 25 years of age or more to be elected as a member of the municipal council. 

Unfortunately, despite the presence of all these legal instruments, political and socio-economic participation of young people in Burundi faces major obstacles including: the non-implementation of these legal instruments, the unfavorable legal framework which restricts certain provisions that can derive from the constitution, the electoral code and the national youth policy. Moreover, due to the precarious situation young people find themselves in (unemployment, underemployment, poverty...) and the lack of unity/solidarity amongst youth leaders with regards to advocating for their needs, young people are continuously manipulated, exploited and marginalized. The youth are absent in the decision-making bodies and in turn; decisions taken by leaders in the political, the economic and social arenas do not reflect their most pressing needs.</narrative>
