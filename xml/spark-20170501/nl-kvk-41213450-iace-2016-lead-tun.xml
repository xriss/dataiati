   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The governorate of Kef is an agricultural region with a great contribution to country. The region has contributed by 13% and 7% of the national production of cereals and red meats respectively, (according to the tunisian office of the northwest development)
The agri-food sector has a huge potential in the region by the transformation some strategic products.
The governorate of Kef also has archaeological heritage. This could be an asset for cultural, sustainable and ecological tourism

      The economy of Kairouan is primarily based on agriculture, cultural tourism, industry and handicrafts
Tourism has made an impact on Kairouan region since it was declared a world heritage site by the UCESCO in 1988. (according to the tunisian office of the centerwest development)

Despite all this, the kef and Kairouan regions are characterized by an unemployment rate relatively High. Young people in these deprived areas are opting for illegal migration and are more tempted by religious radicalization.
This is why entrepreneurship is the optimal solution for these young people to limit unemployment and create value in these areas.

In this context, we can identify multiple opportunities that could lead to profitable and suitable projects for young people and future entrepreneurs in those two regions. The main impact would be to reduce: the unemployment rate, the low entrepreneurial intention, economic migration and religious radicalization of young people.</narrative>
