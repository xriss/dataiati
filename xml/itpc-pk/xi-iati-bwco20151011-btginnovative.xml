   <narrative xml:lang="EN">ITPC&#x2019;s Missing the Target (MTT) research series aims to support civil society advocates to monitor the delivery of HIV services in their countries and hold national governments and other stakeholders accountable to ensuring quality treatment access for all in need. The MTT process includes the provision of funds for community-level research and advocacy as well as training for participating local organisations. Outputs include MTT research reports and advocacy activities based on the findings that are undertaken by the organisations in parallel with the report&#x2019;s preparation and after its release. In 2016, country partners in Tajikistan and Pakistan will begin an MTT project to identify the conditions under which PUDs in each country can be adherent to ARVs. This will have a special focus on the political factors that impact these conditions, as well as the community-level factors that impact these conditions. In Pakistan, research and advocacy will be carried out by country partners with support from MAINline. In Tajikistan, research and advocacy will be carried out by country partners with support from AFEW. Each country may have further focus their research (per discussions during country Launch Trainings; see below) but will operate under this broader theme with guidance from ITPC &#x2013; ultimately helping to share lessons learned and best practices.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Development of report, issue brief and advocacy tool: upon completion of research follow-up, country teams will submit reports using provided templates. These will include narrative, financial and key indicator reports. Reports from each country team will be consolidated into a single external report and issue brief to be published and disseminated widely. Based on the timeline below, publication and dissemination of the final report would strategically coincide with IAC 2018 in Amsterdam. Advocacy: Country teams will also develop an advocacy plan and tool, either based on agreements made during Launch Training or inspired by outcomes of the research. Country teams will begin targeted advocacy activities utilizing the published report and developed advocacy tool. Advocacy efforts will be informed by the outcomes of the research conducted.</narrative>
