   <narrative xml:lang="EN">1. Individual LGBTI know and accept their SOGIESC and can ensure their rights in society are respected. They can meaningfully engage with societal structures. 2 A support system for LGBTI is developed based on discussions about common issues, needs and challenges, creating the motivation to act against discrimination and marginalisation. 3 LGBTI CBOs can strategically engage in societal and political decision-making processes using evidence-based advocacy. 4 Agile LGBTI movements are built that can work collectively to create social and political change and respond flexibly to various situations. 5 Institutions and other allies have an internal drive to include LGBTI in their decision-making and other structures. LGBTI are actively engaged in processes and all policy-making spaces. 6 Strong and reliable laws and policies are in place for LGBTI and are enforced by all relevant bodies. Follow-up on these policies and their implementation are under scrutiny</narrative>
