Project will provide assistance to 1416 elderly people (656 men and 760 women) living in rural area 0-5 km along the contact line, GCA. This total number includes 96 laying elderly people who need home care, 320 elderly people with disabilities who need access to essential infrastructure however 400 of those 416 people reached will be assisted with hygiene kits. Also, overall number of beneficiaries includes 1000 other elderly people who will be assisted by activities related to WASH/Health specific needs in targeted villages. To stabilize coverage of basic needs of the chosen target group, even after project ends, the intervention is based on local markets and community activation. Beneficiaries will  obtain access to essential infrastructure in the nearest towns due to transportation services to be implemented by the project. 12 local activists will provide beneficiaries with home care and 4 activists (1 per a location) will support them with transportation opportunities. Capacity of local communities in provision of assistance in WASH and Health sectors will be maintained with necessary equipment and knowledge. Local authorities will provide activists with a cabinet and Caritas will equip them with office equipment and supplies. Project undertakes professional training for local communities to provide highly needed services for elder people.

Caritas Zaporizhya will operate in Novobakhmutivka ( Yasinuvatskiy rayon), Caritas Kramatorsk will operate in Luhanske (Bahmutskiy rayon), Caritas Severodonetsk will operate in Zolote-4 (Posnyanskiy rayon). Selection of the locations is based on preliminary assessment. The intervention is coordinated with Help Age and Adra as well as Health and WASH clusters. The indicators are divided mostly equally between 4 local teams who are experienced in operating along contact line.
