   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Addressing immediate needs of  people with disabilities living in isolated settlements in GCA</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In the framework of this project proposal, Emmanuel aims at addressing the immediate shelter, health care and food security needs of people with disabilities (PwD) living in isolated settlements of GCA (Krasnohorivka, Maryinka and Pivdenne). 

Shelter Cluster
Response modality: Emmanuel opted for cost-effective in-kind provision of solid fuel and solid fuel heaters where it will be able to use wholesale prices and make sure that the items are delivered to the household, unloaded and properly installed. 
Activity 1. Distribution of solid fuel to 200 vulnerable households of PwD in Krasnohorivka and Maryinka (3,4 tons of solid fuel briquettes per HH, according to the winterization recommendations of Shelter Cluster)
Activity 2. Distribution and installation of solid fuel heaters in 70 vulnerable households of PwD in Krasnohorivka and Maryinka where the gas supply has been interrupted. Emmanuel will recruit local brigades of construction teams to make sure that the solid fuel heaters are properly installed and ready to operate. 

Health Cluster 
Response modality: for activities in this cluster, Emmanuel opted for a mixed modality where the primary and lifesaving healthcare services are provided in-kind and the medications are procured by the beneficiary through cash grants. 
Activity 1. Primary health care services will be provided to 200 PwD living in Maryinka and Krasnohorivka through three 2-day mobile clinics (servicing 30-35 patients per day). Emmanuel&#x2019;s &#x201C;Medical Mobile Clinic&#x201D; will provide its resources (highly skilled medical staff, mobile equipment, express lab and supplies) to enhance the ability of the local health care providers to assist people with disabilities. The suggested package of medical services to be provided by the mobile clinics to PwD includes consultations (general practice doctor, neurologist, ophthalmologist), instrumental and lab diagnostics (Ultra Sound scanning of abdominal organs, retroperitoneal space and thyroid , ECG, blood tests). The local medical representatives will be included into the mobile medical teams and will be able to advise Emmanuel&#x2019;s medical team on the health care services needed for each specific patient. Locations of medical outreaches will be identified by the local administrations taking into consideration the current security situation in the town (risk of shelling, heating in the premises, accessibility, etc). Bedridden patients with disabilities will be attended at home. Patients who are able to walk but have troubles coming to the mobile clinic location will be transported to the location. 
Activity 2. Distribution of 200 cash grants for healthcare expenses. The patients attending Emmanuel&#x2019;s mobile clinics or other PwD in need of medication will be able to purchase prescribed medicines with the help of cash grants amounting to 1000 UAH (based on Emmanuel&#x2019;s experience in providing health care services since 2003, average cost of basic medicines per one course of treatment varies between 800 and 1000 UAH). For the patients who cannot buy the medications by themselves due to disability or absence of pharmacy in the area, Emmanuel will purchase the needed medicines according to the prescription.
Activity 3. Facilitation of lifesaving surgeries of 5 disabled patients in a critical condition. The patients in need of lifesaving surgeries will be identified in course of mobile clinics  and referred to the relevant hospitals, with their transportation, cost of surgery, medical supplies and other related expenses fully covered. Emmanuel will provide full facilitation of the surgery in coordination with the doctors of its &#x201C;Medical Mobile Clinic&#x201D; and local health care providers. 

Food Security Cluster 
Response modality: assistance will be provided in form of cash transfers. 
Activity 1. Distribution of cash grants for food of 2475 UAH  (based on recommendations by Food Security Cluster) to 65 PwD in Pivdenne.</narrative>
