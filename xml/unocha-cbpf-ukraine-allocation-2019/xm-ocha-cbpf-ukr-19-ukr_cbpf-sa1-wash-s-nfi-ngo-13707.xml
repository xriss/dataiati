   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Assistance to the conflict-affected population in isolated settlements in Toretsk and Volnovakha rayon of Donetsk Oblast, GCA</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">As the sixth year of armed conflict in Ukraine takes its toll, the local population still suffers from its repercussions. Problems related to water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) are one of the most acute and if left unaddressed, can create serious health risks for the population. Furthermore, assessments indicate that the problem related to heating systems is still considered as one of the most acute, particularly for the settlements located in the vicinity close to the LoC, which are isolated and usually remain outside of the realm of humanitarian interventions. Therefore, it is extremely important to address the distribution of humanitarian aid to the most vulnerable conflict-affected population as a priority. In light of this, arche noVa (AN) proposes to implement a multi-sector project in the isolated settlements of Hranitne, Novohryhorivka, Starohnativka in Volnovakhskha rayon and Pivdenne and Novhorodske in Toretsk, all within 20km of the LoC in Donetsk oblast, GCA. In order to address the essential shelter needs of 178 people with disabilities, solid fuel will be distributed to households with approximately 288 people who live there and have no possibility to ensure heating during the upcoming winter. At the same time, hygiene kits will be distributed in combination with household hygiene awareness and promotion messages, in order to provide critical WASH-related supplies and information to prevent water- and sanitation-related diseases. In addition, household-level water treatment supplies, as well as portable toilets to improve the sanitation at household level for the elderly and impaired will be distributed. Combining this with water testing, as well as repairing wells and equipping them with sanitary seals, will ensure the immediate and sustainable access to sufficient safe water and minimal levels of sanitation provision for approximately 320 the most vulnerable of the conflict-affected people and 6141 (indirect) beneficiaries living in these communities through the rehabilitation of wells.
Access to these communities will be achieved through Community Outreach Officers, who are based within these areas and therefore have close working relationships with village leads, community members and volunteers. Following the initial basic needs assessment of beneficiaries already having been identified, Community as well as MampE staff will, throughout the project implementation, regularly consult with beneficiaries for feedback, and in turn use this to adjust the project implementation where necessary and possible, as well as ultimately also evaluating the project and the successful implementation thereof.
arche noVa has been implementing WASH and shelter projects from its office in Sloviansk since 2016. Due to previously having implemented comparable projects in similar geographical areas, arche noVa has the structures and necessary technical as well as support staff in place to oversee the implementation of distribution and rehabilitation activities. Where necessary, a network has been established to identify and engage Project, Community and MampE staff, to bring them on board, as and when required for the needs of new projects such as these.
While there are some external risk factors beyond arche noVa&#x2019;s control, particularly with regard to the locality  and unpredictability of the severity of the conflict, as well as the harsh winter conditions and the impact thereof on the seasonality of the project interventions, by carefully monitoring the situation and remaining flexible to adjust the work plan where necessary, these can be largely mitigated and consequently avoid not being able to provide support to the most vulnerable in these isolated areas, as much as possible.</narrative>
