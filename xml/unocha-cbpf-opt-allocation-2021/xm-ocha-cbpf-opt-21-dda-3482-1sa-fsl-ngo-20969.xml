   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Enhance Farmers&apos; resilience through Improving food security for most vulnerable Households in Eastern  Southern Nablus</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The proposed project targets 6 communities in the west bank in area C in Nablus governorate are suffering from high and severe occupation discrimination measures and negative consequences of COVID-19. These 6 locations suffer from settlements expansion and land confiscations in addition to continuous episodes of violence among farmers and settlers. Additionally, within area C, Israel retains near exclusive control, including over law enforcement, access and movement, planning and construction preventing people from accessing their natural resources (land and water), destroying agricultural lands amp animal shelters, water cisterns, uprooting planted trees, these actions forced displacing vulnerable families and disrupting their livelihoods which are against IHRL and IHL. The project aims at enhancing the resilience of 493 vulnerable farmers&apos; HH s (capita 2414) including 688 women, 712 men, 495 girls and 519 boys serving 2950 dunums by improving the food security of vulnerable farmers taking in consideration all COVID-19 safety measures during implementation. This will be achieved through: land rehabilitation by fencing 400 dunums of agricultural lands serving 100 farmers&#x2019; HH (140 women, 145 men, 105 boys, 100 girls) in Beit Hasan and Beit Dajan. This activity will serve farmers by protecting their lands from wild and from livestock animals, some wild animals are released from nearby settlements. Farmers and village councils in both locations will cover installation fencing cost at their own expense as a community contribution. In order to improve productivity further the rehabilitated lands in the targeted locations (fenced lands) will be provided with seedlings at a later time since the planting season is not within project lifetime. Rehabilitation of 8 km of agricultural roads benefiting 240 Farmers&apos; HH (335 women, 347 men, 253 boys, 241 girls), in Beita, Beit Furik, Beit Dajan and Beit Hasan. This activity will protect and improve accessibility and utilization of the served agricultural lands. These roads will also help firetrucks to reach wildfires. Agricultural roads rehabilitation includes several sub activities machinery work, base course and culvert. Moreover,1.5 km of water carriers benefiting 30 farmers&apos; HH (42 women, 43 men, 32 boys, 30 girls) will be installed in Beit Dajan. This aims at providing agricultural lands with water which will enhance farmers&#x2019; and livestock breeders&#x2019; resilience in the targeted area. These water carries will help famers benefit from retreated water from water plant in the village. Furthermore, the proposed project will provide 80 olive harvesting equipment benefiting 160 Farmers&apos; HH (223 women, 231 men, 169 boys, 161 girls) in Beita, Beit Furik, Salem and Deer Alhatab. This activity will reduce the threats farmers (especially women) face from settlers during olive harvesting season by reducing harvesting time. In these targeted locations, farmers need permission from Israeli side to get access to their lands when harvesting.
Once the project is approved, a series of actions will take place to ensure good governance, participation and ownership, information and accountability PARC team will announce and formulate Local Committees (LC) in each location. These LC will have representatives from VC, Municipalities, CBOs, MoA, and they will participate and steer the project in order to ensure participation of local community, accountability in selection and reflect needs of the local community. It will ensure to maintain a voice to women from the targeted groups as project team will encourage women to participate in the LC. Then, tendering and contracting, where PARC and the local committees will ensure the best value of money for different services and quality. All activities implemented will be ensured to abide by protection of COVID-19 SoPs attached, do no harm and gender sensitive approaches. Finally, PARC will implement the project based on a well formulated exit strategy.</narrative>
