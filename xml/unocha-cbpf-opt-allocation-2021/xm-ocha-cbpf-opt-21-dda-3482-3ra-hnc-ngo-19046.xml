   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Ensuring the continuation of providing L2 PHC services to improve the health status of the patients affected by the destruction of the Hala Al Shawa Governmental Center in the Northern Gaza Strip.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project idea responds to the emerging situations resulted by the last Israeli aggression on the Gaza Strip that targeted governmental amp civilian facilities, including health facilities, where 9 hospitals amp 19 PHCCs sustained damage across the Strip. 

The north of Gaza Strip was the most affected by this aggression as it was bombarded heavily by artillery amp airstrikes. Beit Lahia, in the north of Gaza Strip, had its share of these attacks, where Hala Al-Shawa Center which belongs to MoH was severely damaged, this led to the complete suspension of the health services provided by the center, amp it needs reconstruction that may last for 6 months, which led to the deprivation of the patients in Biet Lahia area to access L2 PHC services that were provided by this center.   
Thus, the project idea is summarized in providing L2 PHC services to the affected community in Beit Lahia, through renting a place amp operating it by medical amp admin staff for a duration of 6 months until the reconstruction amp re-operating of Hala Al Shawa Center. Where UHWC will provide the rented place with furniture, equipment amp necessary instruments needed to operate it, amp the project will cover the shortages. 
In order to facilitate the beneficiaries&apos; access to the project services, the place will be rented close to the Hala Al Shawa Center, taking into account that the place will be accessible for PWD. 
The provided services at the center will include:
1-       SRH services.
2-       Nutrition.
3-       MCH Care.
4-       Management of NCD.
5-       General medicine amp emergency.

It is worth mentioning that all these services will be provided free of charge including medication. It is expected that the project will serve 15,000 patients (women, men, boys, girls amp PWD).  To document the No. of the beneficiaries and their information, the UHWC HIS will be used, which will contribute to the ease amp accuracy of the reporting process.

The project idea was discussed with the Health Cluster Coordinator and Undersecretary of MoH where they expressed their support for the idea (support letter from MoH is uploaded in the document tab.).   Moreover, coordination was made with the Ministry to supply the center with the needed medication necessary to operate the center, where they expressed their welling to support the center with part of the needed medication. As due to the sharp shortages at MoH in medication amp medical disposable that reached 50% amp 33% respectively the project will cover part of the needed medication amp medical disposable that the MoH couldn&#x2019;t cover. 
Coordination was also done with UNFPA to provide SRH medicines amp they promised to provide part of those medicines, and UHWC will purchase the other part from this project, in addition UNFPA will provide contraceptives through MoH to cover the needs of all UHWC health facilities.

In order for the local community to access information about the project&#x2019;s activities amp to inform them about UHWC complaint system, 1 radio spot amp 2 Facebook ads will be published.  Furthermore, a local committee will be formed that will consist of local community leaders amp activists to contribute to inform the beneficiaries about the project services amp encourage them to come to the center.  
To fulfill the Accountability to Affected People principle, 2 FGDs will be conducted in the middle of the project duration to engage the project&#x2019;s beneficiaries in the monitoring process. Additionally, 375 questionnaires will be filled out by the beneficiaries to measure their satisfaction about the provided services amp to take their feedback amp suggestions to develop future strategic interventions. Moreover, the beneficiaries&#x2019; complaints will be managed through the UHWC complaints system.     
The project will consider the protection, dignity, impartiality, non-discrimination amp do-no-harm principles. UHWC PSEA protocol will be followed during the project amp the staff will be from both sexes as a response to gender needs.</narrative>
