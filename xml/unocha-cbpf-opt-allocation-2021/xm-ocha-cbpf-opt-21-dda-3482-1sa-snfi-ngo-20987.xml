   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Emergency Shelter Rehabilitation for Vulnerable Families in East Jerusalem</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The implementation of this 6 months project will be a new phase of PHC&#x2019;s Rehabilitation Program that will provide emergency housing rehabilitation to 26 vulnerable families in East Jerusalem (EJ) whose shelter is unfit for weather conditions, does not meet the Minimum Shelter Standards, overcrowded, and unsafe. PHC&#x2019;s theory of change (ToC) underlies the development results in PHC&#x2019;s Strategic Plan 2019-2023, and it underpins and further describes the priorities established in the Strategic Plan to support the different segments of the Palestinians. Therefore, the overall objective of the project is to respond to the immediate shelter needs of vulnerable populations in EJ. This response will follow PHC Results based management strategy will be through a self-help support approach for the most vulnerable families to provide shelter repairs and weather solutions of shelters aiming at: (1) Promote self-reliance, maintain, and support most vulnerable families with shelter-related solutions. (2) Enhance the protection and reduce the likelihood of displacement or forced eviction. (3) Contribute to solving the problem of overcrowding houses by creating new spaces through rearrangement. (4) Promote more environmentally friendly housing, cost, and energy-efficient building practices. (5) Enhance the economic situation for vulnerable families so reduces the probability of renting and/or regular maintenance. (6) Enhance the winterization and summarization conditions for the vulnerable families.
PHC aims to achieve the optimum results regarding beneficiaries by defining the aptness support for emergency vulnerable families at a reasonable cost. To optimize the speed and volume of critical assistance, PHC&#x2019;s proactive approach to emergency preparedness is in place to ensure early action is taken when required. It includes risk monitoring, the establishment of coordination and management arrangements, and preparing for joint needs assessments along with the Palestinian official bodies especially MoSD, MoJA, CBO&#x2019;s, SC, and OCHA. The official bodies will provide and support services inside the community using available resources and skills. In addition, PHC has its internal Program Committee PC (50 per cent are females) that is tasked to set the eligibility criteria of applicants and to track and monitor the project progress. The PC will screen the applications and raise the most vulnerable cases to the Advisory Committee for the final selection. PHC also has an External Advisory Committee (30 per cent are females), which consists of community representatives who acquaint with the areas of the target group and familiar with their needs and challenges to support the program implementation and participate in the selection of the beneficiaries according to shelter conditions and socio-economic situation of families.
To increase beneficiaries&apos; coping capacity and to contribute to building resilience, PHC involves beneficiaries in the different stages of the project cycle. One of the assessment criteria is to involve the families in determining their needs, especially FHH&#x2019;s, the PWDs, and the elderly. Workshops with beneficiaries will be conducted to discuss the project components and to take into account any recommendations from the beneficiaries&#x2019; side in consideration in project design and implementation, to gather their feedback, complaints, and lessons learned in order to take suitable action accordingly. PHC will respond to 26 vulnerable families in EJ (about 132 Direct beneficiaries) with a total budget of ($287,220.35). This program provides financial support in the maximum amount of $12,500 and an average of $8,000 to Palestinians living in EJ. 
The methodology for identifying the level of interventions for rehabilitation will follow the policy of PHC&#x2019;s Rehabilitation Program that is based on the current physical conditions of houses, poverty level, and the income level of people living in.</narrative>
