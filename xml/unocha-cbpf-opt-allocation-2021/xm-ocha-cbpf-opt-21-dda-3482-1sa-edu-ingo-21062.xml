  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The current context in the oPt has been highly impacted by the pandemic of COVID-19, resulting in additional burden on an already stretched education system. This is translated into schools closure and, at times, additional requirements to turn into online education in a context in which a large number of students is unable to follow this approach. According to gender analysis conducted by HI in Gaza and West Bank, 56.4% of children with and without disabilities could not follow online classes due to the lack of internet connection and educational technologies or lack of classes / adaptive didactic support from the schools. The study also shown that girls were more affected (65%) than boys (47%). Whereas the pandemic impacted children and educators&apos; psycho-social aspects and well-being, the escalation during May 2021 on the West Bank and Gaza further aggravated the situation leaving children and educators in an urgent need for emotional and psycho-social support. Observations from the field showed an urgent need of building the capacities of school counselors in providing inclusive psycho-social first aid. The Education cluster estimates that children with disabilities are one the most affected by the protracted and acute crisis: they lack basic assistive devices and education technologies that would facilitate their learning following the mixed approach of face to face and online learning, and are in need of psycho-social support (PSS) and remedial education. Since 2014, HI has strive to improve the access of children with disabilities to education both in Gaza and West Bank (mainly in Area C). Building on this solid experience, the project aims to enhance the access of children with and without disabilities to education services in emergencies. The project will respond to the objective identified by the Education Cluster within the allocation, namely objective &#x201C;1&#x201D; Supporting the mental health and psycho social well-being of students, parents and educators in oPt, through MHPSS support and &#x201C;2&#x201D;, Increase equitable safe access to inclusive, quality educational services for vulnerable children, by identifying vulnerable teachers, parents and children with and without and provide to them PSS individual and group session, adding referrals for specialized services.  Within the second component, the project will support the children&#x2019;s return back to education, providing learning devises, remedial classes and technical support to teacher to develop tailored plans for children with disabilities and most vulnerable ones identified. HI will also support the provision of holistic services &#x2013;alongside PSS kits - through referrals to other stakeholders in both components. The intervention outlines an exit strategy by enhancing capacities of counselors and teachers in continuing providing PSS support through peer-to-peer activities and to children and families themselves. Finally, the project assumes a direct service delivery - with HI being the unique implementers - and targets 1,913 direct beneficiaries.</narrative>
