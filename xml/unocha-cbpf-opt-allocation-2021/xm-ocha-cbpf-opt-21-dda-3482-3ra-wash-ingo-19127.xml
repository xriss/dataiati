   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Rapid response for WASH rehabilitation at HH level</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The main purpose of this action is to support the Humanitarian Coordinator to deliver an immediate response to the critical needs as a result of the recent hostilities on the Gaza Strip. The action will last for six months and focuses on the rehabilitation of WASH infrastructure at household level in the areas of North and Middle Gaza Strip. The aim is to provide support through a Cash for material approach to 500 households and also includes the delivery of 500 PE tanks (1.5M3). A team of engineers will evaluate, in collaboration with the beneficiaries, the different needs for each HH in order to provide tailored solutions. Cash for work and cash for assets will be provided to the beneficiaries to perform the rehabilitation. Dignity, protection and safety of target households will be ensured through their involvement in planning and providing acceptable and tailored WASH solutions for each household. 
The commitment of the beneficiary is ensured all along the project, involving them in each step. Through this approach, for instance, HHs will appropriate the rehabilitation work activity, being protagonist of the tailored planning draft and also during the implementation phase, since they will lead the works and have to anticipate resources to complete all repairs before receiving the 2nd instalment.
In this way, the beneficiary will not perceive the activity as a pure assistance action, but a participating one, requesting their active participation.
Also, during field follow up and monitoring visits, all along the activity implementation, CESVI, ACTED and YEC, with the support of the CBPCs, will ensure to maintain and increase the beneficiary commitment through raising awareness, continuous support in problem solving and clarification/mediation of any issue in any phase of the project.
Throughout the implementation of all activities, COVID-19 prevention measures will be integrated to ensure the safety of all beneficiaries and staff. 

The activities will be implemented by CESVI, ACTED and YEC. CESVI and ACTED are members of ALLIANCE2015 and as such have already started emergency response activities immediately after the ceasefire (21st May) with internal funds. The activities here presented will build upon this initial intervention and allow consortium partners to scale up thereby reaching a higher number of beneficiaries. 
The project will be supported by the mainstreaming of an Integrated Protection Approach (IPA), with a specific focus on the most vulnerable groups, including women, girls, boys, the disabled, and the elderly. Gender principles will be mainstreamed throughout the entire action. Project staff and Community Based Protection Committees (CBPCs) will be refreshed about existing referral mechanisms available for protection cases such as gender-based violence (GBV), with a particular focus given to women and children. Finally, Accountability to Affected Populations (AAP) will be core to the proposed Action by giving account to, taking account of, and being held to account by affected populations.</narrative>
