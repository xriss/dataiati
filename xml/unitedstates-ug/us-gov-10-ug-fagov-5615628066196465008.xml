    <narrative xml:lang="EN">Uganda is a key strategic partner for the United States, particularly with regard to regional stabilization. The United States employs a wide-ranging approach to foreign assistance in Uganda based on diverse economic, political, and security interests. Given its role as a regional stabilizer, the United States has consistently worked with the Government of Uganda (GOU) to resolve regional security threats and conflicts. U.S. support is critical for enabling democratic institutions to function effectively and for fostering more sustainable and equitable national development - elements that are essential to both short and long-term stability in the East Africa region. To achieve these objectives, U.S. assistance includes: promoting good governance, human rights, and multi-party democracy; addressing key health threats, including HIV/AIDS and malaria, through improved service delivery under the Global Health Initiative (GHI); supporting Uganda&apos;s National Development Plan in improving agricultural productivity, food security and nutrition through the Feed the Future (FTF) initiative; professionalizing the police and military; and addressing critical environmental issues, including global climate change and biodiversity.</narrative>
