   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This award strives to support the science and practice of food, feed, and fiber production (including forestry, wildlife, fisheries, aquaculture and floriculture) and its relationships to natural resources, processing, marketing, distribution, utilization (including nutrition), and trade. In addition, this award From March 9-Spetember 30 the Syndromic Surveillance Livestock Health Training was conducted every two weeks for the duration of the training which was held in Uganda. Upon arrival to Uganda we travelled to the West Nile region and taught classes to local MAAIF veterinarians and producers with the intent that they would share this knowledge with their fellow producers and colleagues. The curriculum included clinical disease recognition for transboundary animal diseases, the hierarchy of government agricultural departments to the World Organization for Animal Health and the difference between public and private good diseases..</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">Uganda is a key strategic partner for the United States, particularly with regard to regional stabilization. The United States employs a wide-ranging approach to foreign assistance in Uganda based on diverse economic, political, and security interests. Given its role as a regional stabilizer, the United States has consistently worked with the Government of Uganda (GOU) to resolve regional security threats and conflicts. U.S. support is critical for enabling democratic institutions to function effectively and for fostering more sustainable and equitable national development - elements that are essential to both short and long-term stability in the East Africa region. To achieve these objectives, U.S. assistance includes: promoting good governance, human rights, and multi-party democracy; addressing key health threats, including HIV/AIDS and malaria, through improved service delivery under the Global Health Initiative (GHI); supporting Uganda&apos;s National Development Plan in improving agricultural productivity, food security and nutrition through the Feed the Future (FTF) initiative; professionalizing the police and military; and addressing critical environmental issues, including global climate change and biodiversity.</narrative>
