   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The European society is shaken by the growing of intolerance and discrimination phenomena highlighted by the alienation of its citizens towards policy and by the growing consensus of nationalist and xenophobic positions. The European cultural model is in crisis: the integration between different individuals communities and nations, is challenged by the member states, in part because of the difficulties of the joint management of the growing phenomenon of migration. The others (misfits) &#x2013; being they different by gender, culture, origin, religion or other &#x2013; are perceived as a problem that we can no longer handle rather than an asset to our communities. In this context, the project partners aim at &#xAB;increasing the spreading of a culture based on the plurality of identities and on their mutual acknowledgment amongst the European citizens by fighting against discriminations and violence linked to the gender and cultural differences&#xBB; [OO] developing awareness (Recognize) and the subsequent participation (Change) of European citizens through three themes (&#x201C;relations&#x201D;, &#x201C;discrimination&#x201D;, &#x201C;violence&#x201D;), corresponding to the three years of the project. The Specific Objective of R&amp;C is &#xAB;strengthen awareness raising among the European and extra-European public on individual responsibility through a campaign against discrimination and violence&#xBB; [OC], stimulating individual and collective actions of European citizens that can produce a chain reaction effect in favour of positive changes in the social and cultural processes. In this virtuous dynamic, young people have a key role in stimulating their peers, citizenship and decision and policy makers in particular. For this reason, the main target of R&amp;C are young people (aged 11 to 29 years old), and particularly the High School Student (HSS, 15/19 years old) that will attend education and training activities through laboratories on the three themes of the project and will actively participate in the communication and awareness raising activities.</narrative>
