   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Bosnia and Herzegovina is facing a wide range of challenges regarding air quality. The country&#x2019;s residents are exposed to some of the highest levels of air pollution in Europe, which is caused by a range of different emission sources. Furthermore, there are a range of institutional weaknesses which result in the country being ill-equipped to effectively monitor and tackle the complex problem of air pollution.

The proposed four-years programme aims to capacitate relevant stakeholders in Bosnia and Herzegovina to better manage air quality data and to improve air quality throughout the country. The project will comprise of 6 interlinked components: 
1. National AQ data host 
2. National AQ reference laboratory 
3. Source apportionment study in 6 major cities 
4. Cost-effective and scalable air quality improvement activity(s) 5. Information campaign regarding air quality and public health 
6. Implementation of legislation

The Swedish Environmental Protection Agency (SEPA) will be main implementing partner responsible for managing Swedish contribution and reporting on results. The SEPA has a wide range of expertise in the field of air quality and environment in general. They partake actively in EU and international negotiations and expert groups on air quality, on the authority of the Swedish Government. They also coordinate the implementation of EU and international legislation in Sweden on behalf of the Swedish Government. 

Throughout the performance of this programme, SEPA will transfer skills and knowledge to local counterparts and officials and be able to document that contribution as a means of demonstrating the sustainability of the project.

Project value is 38,400.000SEK for period 2018-2022.</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">Since project start, some of results have achieved certain progress&#xA0; whilst, many of them are facing with challenges of different nature. Overview of achievements and related challenges is presented below: Component 1: Data hosting infrastructure and capacity SEPA&#x2019;s technical partner for this component SMHI had made assessment and proposed options for implementing this activity, which was using a physical server for storing data in BiH, to be linked with two servers in each hydro-mets as they have the competence to do technical work. MoFTER, and FBIH sugested that server should be placed in MOFTER, as it is responsible institution for environmental reporting on behalf of BIH. However, Republika Srpska has not agreed to sending their data to MoFTER and refused the proposed option. Due to a lack of consensus amongst national stakeholders on how to move forward with the implementation of this component, SEPA decided to put this component on hold after the October 2019 steering group meeting. In November 2019 SEPA learned of a project by the European Environment Agency (EEA) to develop a data host in all West Balkan countries. To avoid a duplication of efforts, SEPA and EEA agreed to work together to deliver a data acquisition and reporting system in BiH. There are several advantages to the EEA&#x2019;s system in that - it will be delivered regionally, and that the EEA will update the system regularly to account for any changes in EU air quality reporting requirements. However, the system being implemented by EEA would not deliver everything that was included in the IMPAQ project document for the data host component. SMHI will therefore work with EEA&#x2019;s technical partner NILU to provide additional functionalities in their system, which will be delivered on a regional level. Furthermore, to avoid any risks associated with product delivery in BiH, SMHI has committed to working with NILU to implement the system in BiH. This includes capacity building for air quality managers on how to use the system. Component 2: Reference laboratory infrastructure and capacity The Swedish Reference Laboratory for Measurements (ACES) is SEPA&#x2019;s implementing partner for this component of the project. Work on appointing Ref Labs in BIH has been completed in 2019 and two Hydro Mets in BiH were assumed to be getting the task of functioning as reference laboratories in BiH. Currently, in BIH there is no legally enabling environment for hydromets to formally act as ref-labs, therefore parallel work on legislative amendments will obviously be required. That is why this component also seems to be challenging, nevertheless some progress has been achieved. Knowledge transfer, measurements to local HMIs is continuously ongoing via missions to BiH, frequent Skype meetings and email conversations. Measuring stations were visited by Swedish partner and the placement of locations discussed. Support with localization of measurement stations was planned for early spring period but has been still idling due to COVID crisis. Specifications for procurement of new measuring stations have also been discussed with hydromets but still needs to be finalised. This work as well as knowledge transfer will be continued throughout the life of the project. The task to produce an QA/QC (quality assurance/quality control) manual has been initiated together with the both Hydro Mets in BiH and it is ongoing too. Just recently, SEPA has received formal recognition from both entity MoEs for the entity hydromets to be capacitated as formal reference laboratories within the IMPAQ project. Though this sounds encouraging, there is significant risk that two entities&#x2019; reflabs will not sustain after project completion unless necessary legislative amendments are done in parallel. SEPA has been invited to support this process in parallel of capacitating HMIs. Component 3: Source Apportionment Study (SAS)SEPA&#x2019;s technical partner for this component is SMHI. After two consecutive procurement processed for SAS implementing partner SEPA/SMHI has received no bids. As result entire component has to be postponed for one calendar year. At the beginning of March 2020, SMHI went out with a new procurement for this component and outcomes should be known by July. Implementation of the measurement campaign is expected to begin in November 2020.In December 2019, SMHI completed its pre-study for developing Emissions Inventories in 6 cities in BiH. Component 4: Cost-effective and scalable air quality improvement activitiesThe transport component has been under build up since project start. During the fall SEPA produced a presentation of measures based on Swedish experiences that was evaluated by Sarajevo Canton and the City of Banja Luka. Sarajevo Canton has since confirmed that they have opted for support in the implementation of a congestion fee system in Sarajevo similar to the one in Stockholm, and SEPA will provide further support in this direction. Banja Luka City has opted for alignment with the SUMP -Sustainable Urban Mobility Plan for City of Banja Luka, therefore SEPA will support them in their next stage of expanding their bike sharing system as part of their sustainable urban moblity plan. Component 5: Information campaigns regarding air quality and public healthAfter receiving complaints and subsequent tender cancelation, SEPA finally completed its procurement of a communications firm in Bosnia and Herzegovina at the beginning of March (with 8 months delay). The signing of the contract with McCann in Sarajevo coincided exactly with the start of the Covid-19 pandemic. This is unfortunate timing but SEPA had already prepared an action plan for the agency and they are actively working on the project. It is uncertain, however, when an appropriate time will be to begin an information campaign about air quality. Component 6: Implementation of legislation via inspectors The hiring of the Swedish inspector was conducted in spring 2019 with an official start September . She has since fulfilled intended tasks but has also participated in several different meetings and positioned herself to produce daily support to the inspectorate in Sarajevo and Bana Luka in developing their routines and practices. In addition, she has also reviewed relevant Bosnian legislation to identify gaps and presented solutions based on the Swedish system on how to fill gaps. The employment of Bosnian inspectors, which was intended to take place after the Swedish inspector&#x2019;s recruitment, is facing number of challenges due to admin buriers for employment of these persons (civil servants). It was anticipated that the Bosnian inspectors will be in place in the first part of 2020, but with considerable uncertainty due to the mentioned chalanges which are even worsen by ongoing pandemic that slows down the process considerably since spring 2020. Latest developments within this component are that due to COVID the BIH inspectorates have been ordered to carry out border controls. Even now, when these can be relaxed, SEPA consider that it can be assumed that BIH will prefer to keep this measure as even if internal regulations eases as BiH will seek to secure its borders as movement might start up again. Thus it can be said to be likely that the inspectorates will be lifted from original duties for quite some time ahead. This is becoming issue, which SEPA already raised in their weekly reports as well as need to discuss with the Embassy on how to move forward. Problems are essentially:o SEPA no longer has a partner in this component.o Seconded position will come to an end.o Inspections is not being carried out for them moment.o Updated problem: SEPA needs to conclude the procedure of financing staff for the inspectorates however there is currently no counterpart in this process. Also if procured they will not be mandated for regular duty as the inspectorates have emergency duty at the borders (and this of course not an option in line with the IMPAQ project).</narrative>
