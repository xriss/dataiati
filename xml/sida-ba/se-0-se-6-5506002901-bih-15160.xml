   <narrative xml:lang="SV">International Commission on Missing persons, ICMP bildades 1996 p&#xE5; initiativ av USAs tidigare President Bill Clinton. ICMPs huvudsakliga m&#xE5;l har varit och &#xE4;r att lokalisera och identifiera de ca 40 000 som f&#xF6;rsvann under konflikten i f.d Jugoslavien. &#xD6;ver 70% av de f&#xF6;rsvunna har genom ICMPs f&#xF6;rsorg hittats och identifierats. Ingen annanstans i v&#xE4;rlden &#xE4;r &#xE5;terfinnande siffran s&#xE5; h&#xF6;g.  ICMPs arbete kan delas in i tre omr&#xE5;den; medvetandeg&#xF6;rande och ansvarsutkr&#xE4;vande av regeringar och myndigheter, arbete med civilsamh&#xE4;llet och r&#xE4;ttsmedicinskt arbete f&#xF6;r att kunna gr&#xE4;va ut och DNA matcha l&#xE4;mningar. 
Under utfasningsperioden har ICMP som m&#xE5;l att st&#xE4;rka kunskapen och uth&#xE5;lligheten hos lokala organisationer s&#xE5; de kan forts&#xE4;tta arbetet med identifiering och bidra med underlag till krigsbrottsm&#xE5;l. Genom att st&#xF6;dja familjeorganisationer kan arbetet f&#xF6;r uppr&#xE4;ttelse forts&#xE4;tta efter att ICMP har dragit sig tillbaka. Under projektperioden hoppas ICMP kunna f&#xE4;rdigst&#xE4;lla en verifierad regional lista &#xF6;ver f&#xF6;rsvunna. Den kan tj&#xE4;na som grund f&#xF6;r fortsatt forskning och f&#xF6;rsoning.</narrative>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The International Commission on Missing Persons (ICMP) was established in 1996 on the initiative of USA&#x2019;s former president Bill Clinton. ICMP&#x2019;s primary goal has been and is to locate and identify the approximately 40 000 individuals that went missing during the conflict in former Yugoslavia. Over 70% of the missing people have through ICMP&#x2019;s help been found and identified. Nowhere in the world is the recovery number as high.
ICMP&#x2019;s work can be divided into three areas; awareness-raising and accountability of governments and authorities, strengthening Family Association/ civil society and forensic work in order to be able to excavate and DNA-match the remains.
During the phase-out period ICMP&#x2019;s aim is to strengthen the knowledge and perseverance of local organisations so that they can continue identifying and contributing with the foundation for war crimes. By supporting family organisations the work for justice can continue after ICMP has receded.</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">Sida received the final narrative report 2017-2019 as well as ICMP&apos;s financial and audited report for the same period in late January 2020.&#xA0; Firstly, comments to the narrative report submitted followed by a short analysis of the financial and audit reports.
Narrative report, coverage period 1 September 2017 until end of August 2019 (Contribution ID 5506002901)
Title of the intervention is &quot;Continued ICMP assistance to Bosnia and Herzegovina to account for persons missing from the conflicts of the 1990s&quot;. Target country Bosnia and Herzegovina. Final beneficiaries and/or target group of the interventions have been families of missing persons, Missing Persons Institute of BiH (MPI), Prosecutors office of BiH (POBiH). &#xA0; &#xA0;ICMP is the only international organization tasked exclusively to work on the issue of missing persons. ICMP maintains a unique Identification Data Management system (iDMS), this manages all data pertaining to ICMP&apos;s missing persons process. ICMP has one of the worlds leading DNA laboratory systems. Thus far ICMP has managed over the years (from 1996 and with DNA technique since 2001) to identify more than 23000 of the approx. 31000 missing from the war in BiH. ICMP has furthermore assisted in legislative changes and creation of institutions to secure the rights of families. In 2018 ICMP managed to complete the relocation of the DNA laboratory to its HQ in The Hague. ICMP became a treaty-based organization in December 2014. Nine countries signed the agreement, and which stipulates that ICMP relocate its HQ to The Hague including the Lab. Throughout the entire period of implementation of this action, ICMP provided information on its activities and plans to families of the missing thereby strengthening their engagement in the process. ICMP&apos;s goal of ensuring that the Federation of BiH established an Institute of Legal Medicine was not achieved due to lack of political will and inadequate financial resources. During the period 12 mortuaries have been inventoried and up to 3000 NN cases reviewed (no identified human remains).&#xA0;
ICMP field staff visited 19 locations in BiH, with MPI or Prosecutor&apos;s office representatives, in order to assess the situation and plan further activities at these sites regarding investigations, exhumations or satellite imagery requests. Seven locations were linked to Srebrenica events in 1995, one proved positive. Over the reporting period ICMP participated in 49 excavations in BiH. Throughout the action and the period, ICMP has ensured that the BiH authorities continue to have access to ICMP&apos;s DNA testing and matching facilities. ICMP&apos;s Online Enquiry Center (OIC) increased by 22%, which exceeded the target wit 15%. in large part this was a result of the increased usage of the regional Database of active missing persons cases from conflicts on the territory of the former Yugoslavia, which is accessible via the OIC, by ICMP&apos;s regional partners in; BiH, Croatia, Kosovo, Montenegro and Serbia. &#xA0;&#xA0;The authorities in BiH have received assurances that the laboratory in The Hague will continue to provide access for DNA led identification of missing persons. Lessons learnt: ICMP learnt that relevant BiH institutions responsible for accounting for missing persons in BiH are still highly dependent on ICMP&apos;s technical and consultative assistance. BiH authorities lack a long-term strategy for strengthening domestic ownership of the process, particularly in terms of developing technical capacities for DNA testing and forensic medicine. Additionally there is still no political will or concrete action to amend the Agreement on Assuming role of co-founders of the Missing Persons Institute of BiH.
Environmental sustainability: ICMP seek to minimize its impact on the environment through specific measures: when mass graves are exhumed and advance assessment of mines is undertaken and if required, mine clearance experts are brought into clear the site. This results in more land being cleared of mines, which are a hazard for human and animal life and threat to plant life. ICMP has sought to reduce the impact of DNA processes by replacing the use of certain chemicals with more benign alternatives. &#xA0;&#xA0;
Financial and Audit report (KPMG) - Report for an Expenditure verification of a grant contract EEAS/EU - Continued ICMP Assistance to BiH to account for Persons Missing from the Conflict of the 1990s. The report covers the time period 1th September 2017 until 31th August 2019. The standard used is ISRS 4400. The Audit of financial statements covers financial outlays amounting to 3.765.170 Euro (which includes EU/EEAS funding amounting to 3 Million Euro as well as other funding agencies financing the same program during the same time period: i.e. Sweden (394.722 Euro) and USAID (303.986 Euro). The audit is unqualified and with no any recommendations issued.
Financial and Final Audit report covering ICMP activities 1/9-2017 until 31/08 2019:
Swedish initial funding started to ICMP an its program in 2014; where as total of 19 MSEK was allocated to the project until mid 2017. The usage of these funds were then reported in 2017 and approved by Sida. Hence this audit covers the 4 MSEK spent from Swedish (Sida) sources from 2017 until 2019; i.e. done in two installments (Amendment of agreement Sida/ICMO no.2, signed in November 2017), with an amount of 2.900.000 SEK, followed by a third (no.3) amendment to the said agreement which resulted in time extension of the activity period until the end of August 2019 and with an additional 1.100.000 SEK. &#xA0;
The Financial Excel list included above is not easy for the eye to read and take stock of and when no printing possibilities are there even worse. Nevertheless that being stated and said the financial report is very substantive and detailed, and do follow the original budget accepted by the parties (donors consortium and ICMP) in autumn of 2017. Compared to the original excel sheet with planned spendings under all activities which consisted of 3 pages the final report herein enclosed are 42 pages - detailing each and every cost that has incurred during the activity period. Total sum links well with audit submitted, final spending for the full period amounts to 3.765.170 EUR compared to envisaged initial budget of 3.764.920, hence an over expenditure of a mere 250 EUR (no explained). However this is a fraction of total costs and should be excepted, given in particular that EU and USAID also funded this - and with larger proportion (Sida&apos;s part of all overall funding was 10%. &#xA0; &#xA0;&#xA0;
From Lejla Hrustanovic (EEAS/Sarajevo) we got the following last pieces based on information related to EU&apos;s final financial check up. EUD has questions pertaining to detailed information of the staff, pay slips and staff like, which they then received based on which they deducted around 9 000 euro. EUD paid ICMP final payment was subsequently decreased, with the same amount but the balance paid to ICMP (March 2020) of&#xA0; 300,000 euro.
The Audit is in full compliance with agreement and requirements set by Sida which forms part of the regulatory framework of our cooperation and funding. ISA standard ISRS 4400 used. The Audit reports covers the full period of action i.e. 1 September 2017 until 31 August 2019, and reports back on utilisation of the total funding ICMP received form all 3 donors to the programme (se more below). In all a total amount of 3.765.170 EUR has been audited. On page 8 in the Audit the financial report shows total distribution and use of the Swedish contribution, amounting to a total of 394.722 EUR (or 4 MSEK). Swedish funds has likewise contributions from USAID and EUD been used for all budget lines presented. &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0;&#xA0;
European Union and USAID support to ICMP (in BiH), 2017-2019
EUD has already approved the similar KPMG Audit and financial reporting presented by ICMP. This has been confirmed by the Programme Manager at EUD; se above.The Audit report was deemed fine and clean - unqualified. EUD&apos;s financial payment for the period was pending for a while in early part of 2020 but not paid out (291.000 EUR). EUD is seriously contemplating extending and giving further financial support to ICMP in 2020 and onwards (3 Million Euro&apos;s indicativly), planned for July 2020 (decision prior to COVID 19 should be stated). Hence a strong confirmation in EUD&apos;s views about ICMP&apos;s relevance and good work but also in its trust in existing administrative system and functions.&#xA0;
As also visible from comments made by ICMP responsible programme manager at USAID (e-mail sent for information to Sida controller and head of dev. unit 6 April) a joint decision was made and taken in the autumn of 2017 when EUD/USAID and Sida decided to continue funding ICMP for the next two years than one budget and financial plan would be the firm basis for all parties support and that reporting should be unified.</narrative>
