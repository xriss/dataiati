    <narrative xml:lang="EN">The report summarizes the last 3 years of support to Civil Rights Defenders (hereinafter CRD) covering the years 2016-2018 and where the last year FY 2018 was a phasing out period. During this period CRD has continued its engagement in BiH by providing financial, technical, professional, moral and verbal support to their partner organisations. In the last phase covering in total ten local NGOs/CBOs.&#xA0;
Alongside capacity building of their local partners, CRD has also provided through its local presence a possibility to participate and engage/react do daily political and social developments and issues in synergy with them. CRD has managed to build trust amongst its partners. As stated by CRD the year 2018 has been marked a year of protests in BiH, with more and more localized actions some workers reactions some linked to environmental concerns. And then the Justice for David protests which started in Banja Luka and expanded to a wider audience until clamp down late 2018.&#xA0;
In light of deterioating and declining media freedoms in BiH CRD has since 2018 in agreement with Sida emphasised the freedom of expression work and access to information in the country. Hence access to justice through free legal aid in the field of media freedom as well as advocating for stronger and better laws has been done extensively. Also in the field of hate crimes which are on the raise, targetting different groups such as LGBTI community, migrants and other CRD and partner active participation has been there. Work has focussed on increase access to accurate information, paying special attention to empowering women and LGBTI people to report hate crimes and corruption.In 2018 CRD has succeeded in preventing adopting of harmful Pre-Draft Freedom of Assembly Law in the Federation BiH, by engaging in advocacy with the local OSCE mission and pushing OSCE/ODHIR and the Venice Commission review of proposed law. This resulted in that the suggested law needed to be redrafted completely. Another positive development was that CRD and their partners have finally been invited to take part in drafting legislation and actions plans linked to and in developing the Human Rights Strategy and attended initial meetings on the Anti-Discrimination Strategy during the period in question. At CRD&apos;s request the Ministry for Human Rights and Refugees sought expert advice from the BHJA, BiH Press Council and Ti BiH. Additionally TI BIH was invited invited by the Ministry of Justice to facilitate dialogue about this law with other civil society and government stakeholders in relation to the Freedom of Expression Bill. &#xA0; &#xA0;
Some results from the 3 Outcome areas as follows: Outcome 1: People are empowered to claim their human rights.
CRD has worked to legally empower journalists and media workers who are victims of human rights abuses, working with judical and non-judical institutions. CRD&apos;s work has now resulted in increased access to justice through the provisions of free legal aid. The Freed Media Help Line (FMHL) that Bosnia-Herzegovina Journalists&apos; Association hold has managed to help 57 cases in 2018 (direct legal aid), adding to which 150 free legal and professional advice. In 2017 and onwards BHJA has focussed attention to issues related to female journalists problems, and provided in- house training for 95 of them.
Access to information: Sarajevo Media center (MC) has continued to publish stories about freedom of expression, during 2018 with a total of 141 features. Through social media the media litteracy has increased as well as general awareness of fake news and being critical to material received. The organisation ADI (Sarajevo Association for Democratic Initiatives) has worked with hate crimes, linked primartiy against people with diabilities, ROMA and LGBTI groups. Since the big influx of migrants in 2018 ADI has also been very active in following the &quot;crises&quot; (on the spor in Bihac, and reported directly to Sida) and the hate crimes which is linked to this group and the way they have been received in BiH.
Outcome area 2: State takes better responsability for the fullfillment of Human Rights.
The Advocacy and Legal Advice Centre (ALAC) of the TI BiH has received 1334 calls (open toll free hot line) f&#xF6;r reporting on corruption during 2018. A total of 211 of these calls were proceeded and during 2018 TI BiH won 12 disputes in courts. CRD states that legislation is one of the most important long-term results of their advoacy. In 2016 the enactment of amendments to the FBIH Criminal Law was made to also include hate crimes a major achievement.During 2017 TI BiH along with a group of CSOs successfully urged the Minstry to withdraw the Draft Law on Free Access to Information, from the consultation process and to return it for revisions. A number of lawsuits has been made during the last years in relation to the violation of the Law on Free Access to Information. The issue of monitoring the adoption of whistle-blowers protection laws has also been conducted in the period.
Outcome area 3: Local Human Rights defenders are empowered
One of the biggest results here is Mediacentar&apos;s activities in 2018 was the gathering and working with female journalists on producing in-depth stories on gender gap in the media. Some of the stories produced had the following focus and themes: gender sensitive language in media, female journalists in private and public media, violations of labour laws, parnetal leave. The Bosnia and Herzegovina Press council successfully continued to promote Online School of Media Ethics, for students of journalism. &#xA0;CRD has been active in monitoring cases of women and environmentalist human rights defenders. CRD has added to this also provided crucial supporty to the LGBTI community and is also part of the organisational committee planning for the first Pride March in Sarajevo in late 2019.&#xA0; The work with some youth organisations has been there but to the extent to which those ones has been successful is less clear to Sida; KVART in Prijedor and YIHR (Youth Initiative for Human Rights).</narrative>
