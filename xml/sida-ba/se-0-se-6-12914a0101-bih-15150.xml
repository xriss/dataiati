    <narrative xml:lang="EN">Achieved outcomes and resultsIncreased empowerment of people and partners to take action against corruption and participate in decision-making process. &#x2013;&#x2022; By providing legal assistance to almost 1200 citizens, organisations and activists, and acting upon more than 170 cases within the Advocacy and Legal Advice Centre, TI BiH directly contributed reinforcing the demand for accountability of institutions and public officials and encouragement of citizens to take action against corruption. Moreover, by joining forces with other civil society organisations in its initiatives for anticorruption reform, strengthening their capacities and providing assistance to informal citizen groups, TI BiH contributed to increase its impact on institutions and ensure consistency in anti-corruption efforts. Established and strengthened coalitions and partnerships with all relevant stakeholders.&#x2022; Within the reporting period, TI BiH continued to strengthen cooperation with institutions and other stakeholders through joint activities, such as coordination of workgroups for development of strategic documents, joint initiatives towards institutions with other CSOs, coordination with international organisations within the advocacy efforts for improvement of the anticorruption legislation. Each of TI BiH activities included engagement of relevant actors from each of the respective fields (anti-corruption bodies, judiciary, regulatory agencies, academia, civil society, media, international community, etc.)Improved and strengthened anti-corruption legislation based on relevant international standards and recommendationsBased on the monitoring findings and research that was carried out within the reporting period, TI BiH developed a series of proposals and recommendations for the improvement of the legal and institutional framework. Some of the examples include comments to the laws referred into parliamentary or drafting procedure, proposals within the Good Governance Agenda 2020, proposals to the amendments of Law on Free Access to Information, Law on protection of whistle-blowers, proposals for introduction of vetting procedures within the judiciary and other accountability mechanisms, etc.During the previous period, TI BiH and other organisations faced obstacles in advocacy for improvement of relevant legislation, due to the fact that the Council of Ministers was not appointed, Parliamentary Assembly was not functioning, while the Government of Federation and FBiH Parliament were also in a blockade. This led to a general standstill in drafting and adopting legislation. However, TI BiH still continued to raise awareness on the necessity of legislative reforms through presenting its proposals at meetings with institutions, public events and through the media.Within these efforts, TI BiH succeeded in preventing the adoption of harmful legislation in RS related to the Law on Public Peace and Order and Law on the Police. Moreover, through its participation in the development of Anti-Corruption Strategy, TI BiH pushed for introduction of specific measures related to the adoption of anti-corruption legislation, where its recommendations were included in the Strategy draft. Through its advocacy activities, TI BiH also influenced the adoption of the Action Plan for Open Government Partnership.More effective enforcement of laws and standards and reduced impunity for corrupt acts.&#x2022; Apart from monitoring the enforcement of laws and prosecution of corruption through collecting information from relevant bodies and raising the awareness of the (in)efficiency of the institutions, TI BiH acted on specific cases towards institutions and insisted on their investigation and prosecution. TI BiH informed the public on individual cases of irregularities and law violations, issued more than 50 reports to relevant bodies, 7 reports to the prosecutors for cases of corruption or abuse of power. TI BiH monitored the developments within these cases and informed the public with the aim of putting pressure on institutions to act accordingly. Based on TI BiH actions toward relevant institutions, disciplinary proceedings were initiated against prosecutors, the irregular public procurement contracts were annulled, criminal investigations were initiated for misuse of public funds, irregular employment competitions were annulled, and many citizens were enabled to fulfil their rights in front of public institutions.&#x2022; The reports published by TI BiH on the effectiveness in prosecution of corruption and implementation of other relevant legislation are, as a result, one of the most credible sources of information. Improved implementation of anti-corruption strategies and plans in leading institutions and higher levels of integrity demonstrated by organisations and people.&#x2022; Apart from participating in development of anti-cprruption strategic documents, TI BiH has provided support towards AC bodies when it comes to their implementation. TI BiH actively worked with APIK and lower level AC bodies in implementation of AC plans, including providing training to individual institutions on specific issuessuch as whistle-blower protection, adoption of integrity plans, codes of conduct and transparency mechanisms. Enhanced the capacities and image of Transparency International BiH and improving the organisation&#x2019;s position in the global network. &#x2022; During the reporting period, TI BiH worked on evaluating its capacities and strengthening its resources, both in terms of staff and technical capacities. Based on the capacity assessment, TI BiH developed a restructuring plan which will be implemented in the next period.&#x2022; Within its capacity building efforts, TI BiH strengthened staff capacities in the area of communication of results and promotion of TI BiH work, which resulted in the development of the new communication forms, the increase of citizens who follow TI BiH work and significant presence of TI BiH in the public.&#x2022; TI BiH ground-breaking work and research on corruption and gender issues, as well as its results in providing legal aid to citizens, has positioned TI BiH as one of the leading chapters in these areas. Moreover, the organisation of an international conference that gathered international experts and participants and was promoted across the network contributed to the increased visibility of TI BiH in expert community and TI movement.</narrative>
