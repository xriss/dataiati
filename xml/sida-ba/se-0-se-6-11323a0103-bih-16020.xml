The project aims at improving the employability of the long-term unemployed workforce, particularly youth, women, and people with short or no education or training. The project is part of a larger employment support programme implemented by the World Bank. It engages employment service providers to match unemployed with labor demand. The project tests private employment service provision models and evaluate the impact of support to the unemployed workforce.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project overall objective is to promote job creation. Outcome indicators include percentage of beneficiaries remaining employed 12 months after the intervention, and the percentage of firms with higher number of employees 12 months after the intervention, as well as the number of job-seekers receiving counseling services. The project will do this through engaging with private employment service providers. It will then commission an impact study to check results. Following positive results, the World Bank aims to improve the effectiveness of public employment service active labor market measures, based on the successful pilots with private employment services.
With an amendment request number two, the World Bank requested a 12 month no cost extension of the agreement until October 2022.&#xA0; This is due to delays caused primarily by COVID19 crisis.&#xA0; The World Bank has also updated the overall objective and the target group of the project. &#xA0;
The target group of beneficiaries would be the hard to employ, long-term unemployed and newly unemployed due to Covid -19 pandemic (lower skilled, unemployed youth and women)
The overall objective has been updated as follows:
The development objective of the project is to support hard- to- employ job-seekers and newly employed job-seekers that lost their jobs due to Covid-19 pandemic, to transition&#xA0;into jobs through a suite of individualized and market-driven private employment services.
The overall objective is updated as follows:&#xA0;
Phase II - Economic Inclusion of Women and Improvement of Monitoring Systems aims to deliver individualized employment services to increase number of targeted women to be included in the labor market. More specifically, the pilot intervention will result in economic inclusion of 1000 women and provide evidence and practical experience to institutions.
When it comes to long-term results Phase II builds on the existing work to ensure suitability of this pilot to improve analytical and delivery capacities of government institutions. &#xA0;Improved Social Assistance Beneficiary database will result in better targeting of unemployed, inactive and socially excluded women.
Further, the&#xA0;intervention will result in development of guide policies that would enable governments to tailor measures for the continuous inclusion of women in labor market.</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Conclusion on Performance is made on basis of second annual report received from the World in July 2020.&#xA0;
The target group of the intervention are the long term unemployed in the BiH laborforce, with particular focus on women and youth. An amendment (no cost) was made to include COVID 19 related job losses as well.
The project partners with the public employment services with an impact objective of improving the outreach of their programs (wage subsidies mostly) that World Bank estimates reach less than 5% of registered jobseekers.
The World Bank is managing the project in sequence of three steps. During the first year, a contract was awarded to Deloitte to make a diagnostic of selected companies (small and medium size private companies) in order to determine main obstacles and needs for increasing labor demand. This work was completed during year 1 of the project.
During the 2nd and 3rd year, the World Bank will, through a contract awarded to Kolektiv doo, a private employment agency, pilot a package of services to jobseekers that will improve their ability to find and hold jobs (initially the idea was that the jobseekers will be taken from official lists) Kolektiv will be paid a fixed price per beneficiary placed in a job. The aim of the pilot is to encourage provision of an optimal set of personalized services in the most cost effective way. The beneficiaries will have the same characteristics as those served through the public system.
The project will target 2500 through a public call (instead of pool of registered due to limitations with protection of personal data legislation) At least half will be women, low skilled and long term unemployed. Finally the World Bank at the end of the project will make an evaluation of the Kolektiv pilot which will support the overall development objective of the project which is to inform policy making on the impact of the private provision of employment services.
Due to the COVID situation, the project had to adjust. A 12 month no cost extension (the WB did not ask for additional funds) was agreed in June, and the number of target beneficiaries expanded from 2000 to 2500. A call was published by Kolektiv doo in August covering two cantons (Sarajevo and HN Canton) For the time being, according to the WB, the call will be limited to those two cantons. It is assessed that there will be a huge demand from the call. The report also contains an updated risk analysis which is assessed to contain accurate risks.</narrative>
