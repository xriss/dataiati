  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Syria crisis has had a critical impact on Jordan. According to UNHCR Operations Portal (5 November 2019), there are 654,266 registered Syrian refugees in Jordan. 531,232 Syrian refugees are living out of camps and concentrated in urban and rural areas in the northern governorates of Jordan. Refugees undergo difficult living conditions where most of them are living below the poverty line and they live in the most disadvantaged areas in Jordan. The crisis has overstrained the country&#x2019;s infrastructure and strained social services such as healthcare and education. Refugees are struggling to access health services that are not permitted for free as before and they cannot afford for treatment and medication. The humanitarian conditions of Syrian refugees are worsening and protection concerns are existing. The conflict is impacting severely on women and girls in Jordan, increasing GBV risks and exposure for refugee and host communities, with increased demands on services. Sexual and Gender-&#xAC;&#xAC;based violence (SGBV) among Syrian refugees is manifested in many forms including rape, domestic violence, early and forced marriages, sexual exploitation, and abuse. The project will target 70% Syrian Refugees and 30% Jordanians and host community as per the Ministry of Planning and Cooperation requirements for Syria Crisis Response. IRJ will conduct a baseline assessment in Irbid to identify the beneficiaries with gender-based needs analysis and age markers. A participatory approach will be considered to ensure the participation of the beneficiaries in all project stages.  IR Jordan will coordinate with local CBOs, and community leaders to identify the needs, and will consult with sector cluster and the target groups in the project preparation stage and we will update and verify the intervention (if needed) based on the basic needs cluster priorities. The beneficiaries selection process will be based on the vulnerability criteria including women household, widows with children, elderly persons, persons with disability,  family income, family size, gender, household disability, number of elderly/sick/children in each household, orphan families, and health vulnerability in addition to RAIS and VAF Scoring. According to the Jordanian Response Plan for Syria Crisis (JRP 2019), data analysis across all vulnerability indicators highlights Mafraq, Amman, and Irbid, as the governorates most in need. The overall goal of the project is to work towards mitigating against the risks of the freezing winter significantly impacting the vulnerable Syrian refugees and the Jordanian host communities and thus, IRJ will distribute unconditional cash to families living in Irbid to provide a source of heat through distributing heaters, gas cylinders, gas re-fill vouchers, and blankets, for the families who live in uninsulated accommodation. Children will be the main focus of the project since the distribution of winterization items will reduce the potential risks of cold-related diseases that would severely affect Syrian refugees especially children. IRJ will ensure that community leaders, women and youth will be involved in program implementation and their ideas and feedback will be incorporated. This approach will develop a sense of ownership of the project by the target communities to ensure its success and sustainability. Similarly, the project will strengthen community needs and increase access to resources and reduce the burden over the community.</narrative>
