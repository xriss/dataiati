  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project is targeting the comprehensive response to tackle violations of children rights, including at-risk children and children in conflict with the law through but not limited to juvenile law (child victims of SGBV, exploitation, and child labor), Personal Status law (children&#x2019;s rights, alimony, custody, and kindship law), and documentation for children (birth certificates, kindship deeds, and heritage). Children that are unaccompanied, from disadvantaged communities, or are refugees, tend to be more vulnerable to getting in conflict with the law and have inadequate access and awareness on their right to legal services. The poverty pockets of East Amman and Zarqa will be prioritized as there is a shortage of legal services and assistance within these areas, which the Syrian crisis has further exacerbated. In addition, they have limited to no access to litigation, resulting in unlawful detention, imprisonment, institutionalization, and a juvenile record. This project aims to increase protection and access to legal services for at-risk children and children in conflict with the law, including those with disabilities. It will operate by raising awareness through media, street law methodology, legal consultation, mediation, and litigation. 

In addition to ARDD&apos;s already freely accessible services, this project will provide additional in-depth legal support to at least 1000 children. Based on our longstanding experience with providing legal aid to people residing in disadvantaged communities it is our experience that roughly 10 % of our consultations end up in court. For children in conflict with the law we will push for diversion orders and alternative measures to a custodial sentence. The latter will be further made possible through ARDD&apos;s assessment of what additional support our contracted lawyers require for achieving this goal and through networking and advocacy with relevant governmental and judicial institutions. The street law sessions in disadvantaged communities, a media campaign regarding children&apos;s rights and the accessibility and availability of free legal support, also in order to prevent conflict with the law, are crucial as this will enable children and their parents to find appropriate legal support.

ARDD will conduct reporting in targeted communities with at-risk children, caretakers, and people in the neighborhood in order to assess the major issues of concern with regard to children&#x2019;s access to justice. This will include consultations with various stakeholders to analyse existing referral mechanisms with the intention to develop them further based on the needs of the community. The needs assessment provides the foundation for the initiatives including the access to justice sessions and Psychosocial Sessions, which will reach a minimum of 1500 beneficiaries and aim to increase awareness of children&apos;s rights, availability of free and safe legal support and strengthen community-based safety nets. 

In order to ensure the coherence of this project with child protection priorities at the national level and establish sustainable efforts towards ensuring children&#x2019;s access to justice, ARDD will dedicate time to effectively and maintain communication with the Interagency Child Protection Working Group in Jordan to ultimately contribute towards the identification of access to justice for refugee children and unaccompanied and separated children as a long-term priority. Moreover, in order to foster sustainable recognition for children&apos;s rights ARDD aims to develop a framework of regular communication with judicial bodies and local and national government actors in order to find alternatives to pre-trial detention, reporting children&#x2019;s cases straight to trial court, discontinuing probation officers in children&#x2019;s cases,access to specific services for children with disabilities, and inclusion of social workers within the judicial process through a consultative process.</narrative>
