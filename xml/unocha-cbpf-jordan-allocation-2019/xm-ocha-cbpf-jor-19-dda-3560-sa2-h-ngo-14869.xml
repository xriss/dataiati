   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The proposed intervention responds to the increasing needs and vulnerabilities identified by the health sector in Jordan and it provides support to the target group through granting access to secondary and tertiary health care for priority medical cases of women, children and the elderly at risk as well as unaccompanied children of Syrian refugees and vulnerable Jordanian host communities. JPS will provide free medical referral care for Basic Emergency Obstetric and Newborn Care (BEmONC) and Comprehensive Emergency Obstetric and Newborn Care (CEmONC) for women, children at risk and unaccompanied children, as well as priority medical referrals for elderly at risk from camp and urban settings with specific attention to the northern areas in Jordan.

This project will support priority medical cases of women, children and elderly at risk, and unaccompanied children in need of immediate medical care and access to in-hospital secondary and tertiary health care that is not available otherwise, including pre-investigation, intensive medical care, and emergency surgical intervention. This shall be implemented in coordination with the health sector and key humanitarian actors operating in the same field at refugee camps and urban settings.

The project shall support a total of 311 cases of women, children and elderly at risk, and unaccompanied children for secondary and tertiary health care at JPS network of affiliate healthcare facilities throughout the project duration. The project shall support 35 cases for basic and comprehensive Emergency Obstetric Care (EOC), 27 cases for Neonatal Care (NNC), 207 cases of Assisted/Normal Vaginal Delivery (A/NVD) and Cesarean Section (CS), which represent the primary target for related project activities (67%). In addition, the project shall support 26 cases of Urgent Day-Case/One-Day-Admission (DC/ODA), and 16 cases of Life-Saving and/or Emergency (LSE) which represent the secondary target for related project activities (33%). 

Access to health services shall be facilitated through JPS well-developed referral mechanism that shall enable the provision of secondary and tertiary care, case management and follow-up, and medical and financial review during hospitalization at JPS network of affiliate health care facilities providing comprehensive investigation and treatment services to the group of target population. 

In 2018, JPS initiate the idea of digitizing the business model for Referral and innovate a new concept to offer best approach to manage the referrals and focus on efficiency of managing time, budget and resources by enabling the technology to operate the referral mechanism.

This proposed project shall utilize JPS well-structured centralized referral hub available 24/7. The referral hub shall be coordinated and operated by highly qualified staff medical professionals, with experience in various fields including emergency medicine, nursing science, and health care management, dedicated to providing the highest quality of medical referral and services. The project team shall utilize a clear referral mechanism and Electronic Referral System (ERS) where stakeholders are directly involved in coordination aiming to the delivery of quality health care services to the target population.
ERS is used for organizing and streamlining the medical referral process which involves multiple parties along the chain of service. That in addition to having comprehensive record of patient data. The project team shall utilize a clear referral mechanism and Electronic Referral System (ERS) where stakeholders are directly involved in coordination.

Syrian refugees are the main target group to benefit from the project at 70%, whereas the remaining 30% of beneficiaries is allocated for vulnerable Jordanian host communities with the focus of addressing the needs in northern areas of Jordan in line with the local authorities&#x2019; guidance and instructions represented by MoPIC.</narrative>
