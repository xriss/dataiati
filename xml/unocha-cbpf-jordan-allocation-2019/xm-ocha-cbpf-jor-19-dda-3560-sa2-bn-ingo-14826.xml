   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Provision of Winterization Assistance for At Risk Vulnerable Families in Jordan</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">ICMC proposes a 4-month winterization cash assistance intervention to support families in Northern Jordan who are most in need of basic needs assistance and have specific protection risks and vulnerabilities, including disability. The project will build on ICMC&#x2019;s extensive experience in delivering winterization support and utilizing cash-based modalities to alleviate time-sensitive needs. Winterization cash assistance will be provided to both refugee and Jordanian host community families living in Irbid, Mafraq, Zarqa, Jerash, Ajloun, Balqa, and Madaba governorates, ensuring outreach in remote, rural areas and wide geographic coverage through the project. The project has been designed in compliance with the Winterization Task Force standards for 2019-2020 and closely coordinated with other actors in the task force to achieve extensive reach of beneficiaries and their non-duplication. The project is also aligned with the existing national and regional strategies, including the Regional Refugee Resilience Plan (3RP) and the Jordan Response Plan (JRP) whereby winterization support is prioritized by the social protection sector. In addition to the 500 families that ICMC has already identified through its existing BPRM-funded winterization program, ICMC will outreach an additional 450 families in need as well as refer to its existing database to re-assess families for potential winterization assistance. Families living in urban and rural areas with high levels of vulnerability will be referred to ICMC by community based organizations and assisted through the project. ICMC will coordinate closely with UNHCR to obtain lists of potential Syrian refugee beneficiaries as well as the Ministry of Social Development for lists of Jordanian families in need. ICMC&#x2019;s commitment to assisting the most vulnerable, at-risk families will be reflected in the project through utilizing its comprehensive vulnerability assessment tool, which has been designed after UNHCR&#x2019;s Vulnerability Assessment Framework (VAF). The assessment includes the short set of Washington Group questions to ensure people with disabilities are identified. ICMC&#x2019;s assessment tool will ensure highly vulnerable families with protection needs due to their specific profiles are prioritized including women and older individuals (age 60+) at risk, people with disabilities, children at risk, and single parents/caregivers. Examples of risks faced by these specific groups may include but are not limited to being a survivor of GBV, high levels of household debt, threat of eviction, living in sub-standard conditions, individuals that have serious medical conditions or chronic illnesses, and individuals who are risk of further protection issues. Provision of winterization assistance will follow the Task Force&#x2019;s standard assistance packages based on family size. The selected 375 families will benefit from unconditional cash assistance, ensuring dignity and choice as they determine what items are most essential for their families to cope with the winter season. Cash will be distributed through a contracted money lender (Alawneh) in branches that are both accessible and centrally located to the project&#x2019;s beneficiaries. ICMC is currently in the process of transitioning to the Common Cash Facility (CCF) for all its cash distributions. If the process is completed by the start of the proposed project, the CCF will be used for distribution of winter cash assistance this year. Through this project, ICMC aims to complement existing efforts to meet the basic needs of the most vulnerable families, recognizing that a high need remains for targeted, winterization support this year, particularly in the Northern governorates which are most impacted by the winter season. The impact of the project will be assessed using the Task Force&#x2019;s common post distribution monitoring form and contribute to the collective results documented by the basic needs working group.</narrative>
