   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Providing essential and life-saving support to Palestine Refugees from Iraq IN Jordan (PRI)</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Of those that sought refuge from the war in Iraq, a number of PRI were admitted into Jordan in 2003 by a Royal decree. Upon arrival in Jordan, a total of 640 PRI (131 families) sought shelter inside and outside Palestine refugee camps in the Kingdom. During the last quarter of 2003 and the first quarter of 2004, UNRWA provided in-kind and cash assistance to PRI to support their resilience during their refuge. After this period however, the Agency could not sustain this support due to budgetary constraints. Consequently, to ensure the continuation of assistance, UNHCR agreed to cover PRI&#x2019;s essential costs from July 2004 until December 2008, after which both parties signed annual agreements that extended support until December 2018.  It is noted that UNHCR agreed with UNRWA to provide PRI with assistance similar to what was given to the families enrolled in the social safety net Programme (SSNP) with the funds being covered by UNHCR. Each person was eligible to receive the following items on quarterly basis: 3 kg of rice, 3 kg of sugar, 3 L of sun flower oil, 1.5kg of whole milk, 3 kg of two kinds of pulses (broad beans/chick peas/lentils), in addition to 7JD/person per quarter. The estimation of this food basket was approximately JD 21 (per person per quarter) based on UNRWA&#x2019;s purchase costs (comparable to 35 JD based on the local market). It was agreed with UNHCR to provide the assistance in cash modality instead of the mixed assistance for the integrity of refugees in 2015. 
The UNRWA-UNHCR partnership has allowed PRI to receive cash assistance on quarterly basis to cover their needs, including food and non-food items. When sufficient funds have been available, it has also allowed PRI to receive winterization assistance in 2015 and 2016 (once a year and the value was about 200 JD/family).  In 2017, winterization was offered at the value of JD 65 per person to take into account the increasing prices of energy and the needs of PRIs to stay warm.  

UNRWA, almost entirely funded by voluntary contributions, is currently facing severe financial constraints. Its operating budget for 2019 is US$ 1.2 billion, and this has not factored in UNHCR&#x2019;s recent decision to no longer assist PRI due to their own budgetary situation, leaving this small yet one of the most vulnerable population without financial support and access to essential and life-saving services. Therefore, it is essential that the 156 PRI (34 families) recorded in Jordan as of January 2019 continue to receive assistance to cover their most pressing needs and thus to decrease their chances of falling into abject poverty.  Accordingly, with this concept note, UNRWA is seeking OCHA&#x2019;s support to provide PRI in Jordan with cash and winterization assistance for 12 months starting in March 2019.</narrative>
