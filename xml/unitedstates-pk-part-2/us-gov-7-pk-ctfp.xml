    <narrative xml:lang="EN">Pakistan remains critical to U.S. counterterrorism efforts, nuclear nonproliferation, regional stability, the peace process in Afghanistan, and regional economic integration and development. The United States therefore has a deep interest in a stable, democratic, and prosperous Pakistan, as well as long-term constructive bilateral cooperation. The United States will continue its intensive engagement with Pakistan to advance our joint interest in a democratic Pakistan that is developing economically, countering militancy, and contributing to peace and stability in the region. This is facilitated both through the U.S.-Pakistan Strategic Dialogue and through U.S. assistance aligned with and supportive of these policy goals.The United States and Pakistan enjoy a positive security partnership and are working collaboratively to address security threats faced by both nations. In FY 2017, Pakistan will continue to face significant and broad challenges to its internal security, economy, and social sectors, all of which threaten its long-term trajectory. Through security assistance, the United States is enhancing Pakistan&apos;s capabilities to address its counterterrorism and counterinsurgency challenges in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA). Other U.S. assistance to Pakistan supports development, cooperation, and reform in five key areas: energy, economic growth, stabilization of areas most vulnerable to extremism, education, and health. This five sector-strategy is coordinated under the U.S.-Pakistan Strategic Dialogue and aligns with U.S. and Pakistan government priorities. Programs also aim to increase trade and investment bilaterally and regionally; improve infrastructure; leverage the private sector; and strengthen Pakistan&apos;s governance and services. Pakistan&apos;s efforts at countering violent extremism within its territory have continued to expand and achieve results. Since 2014, Pakistan has carried out a number of large-scale operations in the FATA, an area on the Afghanistan-Pakistan border that is used by violent extremist groups, including those targeting the United States and the Pakistani state. These operations, while necessary to root out extremists, have also displaced more than 700,000 individuals. The significant number of internally displaced persons (IDPs) underscores the long-term importance of expanding economic opportunity and establishing stability in areas vulnerable to violent extremism. Support to the FATA will continue in FY 2017, including anticipated ongoing needs for the relief, return, and rehabilitation of IDPs and their communities, as well as longer-term stabilization and development. Assistance to Pakistan complements U.S. national security policy in neighboring Afghanistan and remains critical to the stability and prosperity of the region, as well as U.S. national security interests.</narrative>
