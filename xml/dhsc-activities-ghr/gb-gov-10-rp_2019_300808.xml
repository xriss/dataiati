   <narrative xml:lang="EN">NIHR Global Research Professorships: Stopping mothers dying From Sepsis in Africa</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The NIHR Global Research Professorship scheme is open to all professions and all Higher Education Institutions (HEI), based in England and the Devolved Administrations, to nominate health researchers and methodologists with an outstanding research record of clinical and applied health research and its effective translation for improved health. Global Research Professors are required to have existing strong collaborations or links with collaborators or partners in institutions in countries on the OECD DAC list and the award should plan to strengthen these/support training and capacity development/mentorship in these partners.  Maternal sepsis is one of the most important causes of death and harm to mothers and their babies during or after pregnancy. It disproportionately impacts women and their families in low income countries. This research will improve our understanding of the epidemiology of maternal infection, optimise approaches to better prevent and diagnose maternal sepsis, and rigorously test at scale a facility level intervention aiming to improve maternal sepsis outcomes. The research will be focused in Malawi, and an important part of this programme will be working collaboratively with Malawian researchers to build maternal health research capacity.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This research aims to make major advances in the understanding of maternal infection in Malawi, and how to better prevent and manage these infections in order to reduce mortality and morbidity from maternal sepsis in Africa. The research programme workstreams are 1.) Understanding maternal infection in Malawi; 2.) Preventing infections; focussing on caesarean section and miscarriage surgery and 3.) Improving the management of maternal sepsis. Additionally, the research programme has two cross-cutting themes &#x2013; 1) training and capacity building and 2) Communication with the public, practitioners, and policy makers.</narrative>
