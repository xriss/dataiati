   <narrative xml:lang="EN">1. To provide essential context about needs and strengths of youth and of organisations and systems supporting youth in our research communities.                                      
2. Develop and agree implementation theory for delivering youth mental health interventions, and the pathway to primary mental health care and specialist care for youth with more complex needs.
3. Inform content and implementation of relevant interventions, and measurement of clinical outcomes.
4. Learn about youth and caregiver views of mental health and mental health interventions.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">African Youth in Mind (AYMI) will bring together researchers, youth and a range of government and non-government stakeholders to learn how best to treat depression and anxiety in youth aged 15-24 in Ghana and Zimbabwe. We will build capacity on youth-focussed mental health interventions in these two countries and also in Malawi. 
Depression and anxiety prevent youth from productivity and innovation and from reaching their full educational and social potential.  This is critical in African countries, where 60% of the population are aged under 25. Depression and anxiety are key risk factors for self-harm and for suicide, which is the third leading cause of death globally in this age group.  Various treatments which help with thinking, behaviour and emotions are known to be able to restore health and functioning for depressed and anxious youth. These could feasibly be delivered by non-specialists in low-resource settings.
Our plan is to work with youth and caregivers to adapt and test a stepped care intervention for youth with depression and anxiety, which is tailored to the needs of communities in Ghana and Zimbabwe. We will build on lessons from African innovation, especially the Zimbabwean Friendship Bench. Based on country priorities and context, we will shape the intervention in Ghana for those aged 15-18 enrolled in Ghana&#x2019;s free senior high school system and in Zimbabwe for youth aged 15-24 in schools, colleges and community health settings including sexual health services. We will then evaluate the clinical and economic benefits of the intervention through running a clinical trial in senior high schools in Ghana. 
By the end of our program, we aim to have four completed PhDs for African early career researchers in youth mental health (in Zimbabwe, Ghana, and Malawi), two post-doc fellowships completed, and ten publications in open access journals, with at least 80% of these to be first or senior authored by an African researcher. Our longer-term vision is a strong interdisciplinary group of African-UK researchers in youth mental health, and for our stepped care intervention to be taken up by governments and NGOs to improve youth mental health.</narrative>
