   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Background
African healthcare was developed to focus on infectious diseases like HIV. This means that African healthcare is not set up well to cope with non-infectious diseases becoming more common. The most common non-infectious diseases are &#x2018;cardiometabolic diseases&#x2019;. These includes heart disease, diabetes and high blood pressure. All of these can lead to early death. It makes sense to tackle cardiometabolic diseases together because they can be treated in similar ways. For example, losing weight and increasing exercise can help with all of them. 

Aims
The aims of this work are to develop care models to improve outcomes and control of common risk factors for cardiometabolic diseases for adults in 3 low-income countries: Ghana, Kenya, and Mozambique. 

Workplan
Researchers from University of Leicester will work together with researchers and doctors from these countries to determine what healthcare needs are most important to patients and health workers. This will support development of a care model which can be used to provide better healthcare to patients with cardiometabolic diseases. A study involving patients, healthcare professionals and community participants will be conducted prior to design and planning of a randomised controlled trial to test the care model developed. 

Themes within this project will focus on training and capacity building and establishing a programme of community engagement and involvement. Capacity building will be tailored to develop future leaders in research management and expertise in sub-Saharan Africa. Community engagement will be utilised to shape delivery of this research programme, maximise impact and build lasting capacity to support future research. 

The primary impact will be a substantial improvement in cardiometabolic health management for those living in Ghana, Kenya, and Mozambique, with improved research and community engagement in healthcare. These benefits will likely translate to substantial economic benefits for the patients, health systems and local healthcare providers.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Objectives: 
&#x2022;	To identify and prioritise healthcare needs for patients with cardiometabolic diseases, in Ghana, Kenya, and Mozambique. 
&#x2022;	To develop a model for people with cardiometabolic diseases, ready to be used in Ghana, Kenya, and Mozambique.
&#x2022;	To investigate the practical implications of delivering the model developed in this research and the parameters required to design a randomised controlled trial (RCT).
&#x2022;	To maximise impact, uptake and implementation of the Group activities, by putting in place enablers to secure sustainability beyond the funding.</narrative>
