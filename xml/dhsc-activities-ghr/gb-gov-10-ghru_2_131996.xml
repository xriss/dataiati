   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Scientific Objectives: 
1.	investigate pathogen genetic diversity and/or host susceptibility to each condition
2.	improve understanding of the disease burden and distribution of each condition through a combination of field-based mapping and geo-spatial modelling
3.	identify new diagnostics and treatments for scabies
4.	evaluate services to improve prevention, diagnosis and care of these conditions, in particular integrating these with other skin-NTDs

Strategic Objectives:
1.	develop a network of researchers studying podoconiosis, mycetoma and scabies across three DAC countries
2.	increase societal awareness and expand the evidence base for national and international policy relating to these three NTDs

Capacity Strengthening Objectives:

1.	support endemic-country PhD and postdoctoral training posts so that capacity for research into NTDs is expanded
2.	strengthen the research environment in which our collaborators and trainees work</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Since 2017, the NIHR Global Health Research Unit (GHRU) on Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs) at Brighton and Sussex Medical School has carried out a highly successful needs-driven research programme in partnership with Addis Ababa University and the Armauer Hansen Research Institute in Ethiopia, and the Mycetoma Research Centre, University of Khartoum, Sudan. 

Our GHRU has focused on three conditions considered severely neglected in terms of research, public attention and political will: 
1.	podoconiosis (a progressive, disabling form of leg swelling seen in barefoot farmers)
2.	mycetoma (a destructive infection of the skin and underlying tissues) 
3.	scabies (a profoundly irritating skin condition caused by burrowing mites)

Our studies have spanned wide-ranging disciplines to address questions directly relevant to national and global NTD elimination agendas. 

This research has been conducted within a strong framework of capacity strengthening which has developed infrastructure and financial management at partner institutions and trained 11 PhD students and five post-doctoral researchers. All early career researchers have benefitted from training opportunities within and beyond their countries, and from the NIHR Global Health Academy. We will build on these strong foundations in the next five years and expand the partnership to include the University of Rwanda.

We will use a range of methods to investigate new research questions clustered into four interrelated themes: 
1.	mechanisms of disease
2.	geospatial mapping
3.	diagnostics and drug development
4.	implementation research

The questions have been prioritised through a process of: 
1.	identifying the areas in which our GHRU has had the most impact
2.	participating in WHO and disease-group identification of research gaps in these areas
3.	consulting with stakeholders including patients, communities, implementers and policy makers. 

Our research will contribute evidence important to disease treatment and prevention strategies and continue to enhance research capacity to ensure sustainability.</narrative>
