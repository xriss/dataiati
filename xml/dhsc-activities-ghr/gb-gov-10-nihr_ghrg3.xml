  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The NIHR&apos;s third Global Health Research call for Groups. UK universities and research institutes were invited to submit applications, working in equitable partnerships with researchers in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC), to develop their ambitions to deliver world-class applied global health research to address under-funded or under-researched global health areas specific to those countries.
Global Health Research Groups are defined as a partnership of specialist researchers within universities and research institutes in LMICs and the UK:
1. Either new to delivering applied health research globally, or expanding to new global partnerships to deliver applied global health research addressing unmet needs in new health areas or geographies in ODA-eligible countries;
2. Who, through a planned start-up phase, will develop or expand equitable research partnerships and networks, to undertake LMIC-led needs analysis designed to refine relevant research questions and priorities through engagement with policy makers, evidence users and local communities, as appropriate;
3. Who will establish a new programme of applied health research delivered through ambitious, structured plans for e.g. scoping studies, needs analysis, economic analysis, pilot studies and potentially trials;
4. Who are able to develop the strength of the partnership to improve practice and inform policy based on scientific evidence;
5. Who will set up and deliver a focussed programme of capacity and capability strengthening at individual and institutional level appropriate to the respective goals.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The strategic aim across the Global Health Research Groups programme is to:
1. Address locally-identified challenges in LMICs through equitable research partnerships between researchers and institutions in the UK and ODA-eligible countries
2. To generate the scientific evidence that can improve health outcomes for people in low resource setting through improving practice and informing policy.
3. Strengthen research and research management capacity and capability to support future sustainability of research in partner countries.</narrative>
