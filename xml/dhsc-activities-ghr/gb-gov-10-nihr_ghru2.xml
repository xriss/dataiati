  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The NIHR&apos;s second Global Health Research call for Units. UK universities and research institutes were invited to submit applications, working in equitable partnerships with researchers in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC), to develop their ambitions to deliver world-class applied global health research to address under-funded or under-researched global health areas specific to those countries.
Global Health Research Units are defined as a well-established research partnership or network of universities and research institutes in LMICs and the UK:
1. With an existing track-record of delivering internationally recognised applied global health research addressing unmet health needs in ODA-eligible countries;
2. Who wish to consolidate and expand this work, supporting and developing thematic research and capacity strengthening networks, through regional and global hubs;
3. Who will deliver a large scale, ambitious programme of applied health research through a range of trials and studies;
4. Who are able to leverage the strength of the existing partnership consortium to improve practice and inform policy based on scientific evidence;
5. Who will set up and deliver a substantial and sustainable programme of capacity and capability strengthening at individual and institutional level.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The strategic aim across the Global Health Research Units programme is to:
1. Address locally-identified challenges in LMICs through equitable research partnerships between researchers and institutions in the UK and ODA-eligible countries
2. To generate the scientific evidence that can improve health outcomes for people in low resource setting through improving practice and informing policy.
3. Strengthen research and research management capacity and capability to support future sustainability of research in partner countries.</narrative>
