   <narrative xml:lang="EN">SUMMARY OF PROJECT INFORMATION (SPI)      Project Name :   			MALI - IMPRIM COLOR     Region :   				Sub-Saharan Africa     Sector:	   			Printing and Publishing     Project No:   				009412     Projected Board Date:    		June 21, 1999     Company Name:   			IMPRIM COLOR     Technical Partner and/ or Major Shareholders:     Mr. Abdoulaye Sylla is the main sponsor of the project. He holds 40% of the companys shares. The financial partner Mr. Amadou Sinsy Coulibaly holds the remaining shares. Both are Malian nationals and are reputable in the business community.  Amadou S. Coulibaly is involved in various businesses especially in communication activities. Since inception, Abdoulaye Sylla has been the managing director of IMPRIM COLOR. He is assisted in the day to day management by Mr. Faustin Sylla, the commercial and production manager, who is in charge of all technical operations.     Project Cost Including proposed IFC investment:     Total project cost is estimated at US$1,150,000 equivalent.  IFC has been requested to provide a local currency guarantee of US$434,000 equivalent for a loan with a 6-year term and 18 months grace.     Location of Project and Description of Site:     IMPRIM COLOR is located in cite du Niger, a residential area of Bamako. The project will be implemented on the actual plant location which is built on a 1,000-sq.m land. It involves the construction of a new 500-sq.m building comprising a production unit and administrative offices.      Description of Company and Purpose of Project    (include IFCs role and development impact):    IMPRIM COLOR is a modern printing and publishing company created in 1994.  Since inception, the company has managed to become one of the leaders of the Malian printing industry. The company enjoys a solid reputation and is particularly known for the quality of its pre-press.    Since 1996, the Malian government has launched a long-term program (PRODEC) designed to improve the countrys literacy rate and has decided to contract the printing and publishing of schoolbooks. Under this policy, IMPRIM COLOR proposes to engage in the production of schoolbooks and to expand its operations by acquiring additional industrial equipment.    By creating facilities for the local printing and publishing of schoolbooks, the project will help reduce imports and consequently improve the trade balance. Furthermore, it will have a positive impact on Malis educational system by making schoolbooks available and affordable.    IFC will support the project by providing a loan guarantee and encouraging a local bank to provide funding alongside IFC.     Environmental Category and Issues:     This is a category B project according to IFC&apos;&apos;s environmental and social review procedure.  Environmental, health and safety issues include site location, water and power supply, storage and handling of chemicals and spill management, waste management, air emissions and occupational health and safety issues including workers exposure to noise and air emissions and fire protection. The sponsor has indicated that there is no fuel storage onsite and that chemicals are kept in a locked room and handled by employees wearing protective gear. Solid waste is either reused or incinerated on site. At IFCs request, the sponsor has agreed to analyse emissions from the incinerator as well as waste-water prior to their release into the septic tank and to implement corrective actions should either the air emissions or the effluents not conform to IFCs guidelines. The sponsor has also undertaken to implement a formal procedure for employees health and safety, including emergency response.      Based on its review of available information regarding potential environmental impacts and the measures described above, IFC concludes that the proposed project will be in compliance World Bank IFC policies and with World Bank Group environmental, health and safety guidelines in force at the time of appraisal.  IFC will monitor ongoing compliance during the life of the project by evaluating monitoring reports submitted annually to IFC by the sponsor and by conducting periodic site reviews during project supervision.
