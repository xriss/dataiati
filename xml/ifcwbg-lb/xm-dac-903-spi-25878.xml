  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">- Maintain and/or increase bank lending:   With the destruction and economic downturn in Lebanon, private banks may reduce their loan exposures at the expense of SMEs, corporations and consumers. Any such reduction would cause loss of jobs and increases in the poverty rates. The proposed IFC investment should help maintain and/or increase bank lending to these groups, maintaining the economic well being of the underlying communities/stakeholders.  - Support for the private sector lending including SMEs and corporate clients:   SMEs and corporate clients make up a large share of Lebanons economic output and including vital contributions such as employment generation in impoverished area. Increased access to finance to these target markets can re-start these currently under funded enterprises.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project involves IFC providing a senior corporate credit line and SME risk sharing facility to Fransabank s.a.l. (Fransabank or the Bank) of up to $50 million in total, to be on-lent to the Banks existing and new clients as a response to the post conflict needs in Lebanon.   This project is part of the Lebanon Rebuild Program: IFCs first phase investment response  as part of IFCs corporate-wide strategy  to the reconstruction needs in post-conflict Lebanon. Through this program IFC will provide investments to up to five selected banks in Lebanon, either in the form of credit lines or risk management facilities or both, in the amount of up to $200 million in aggregate.      Headquartered in Beirut - Lebanon, Fransabank was established in 1921 and is now the fifth largest private bank in terms of total assets ($4.9 billion in consolidated total assets as of December 31, 2005). It also ranks third by return on assets and cost to income and fourth by return on shareholders equity.  Fransabank has pursued over the past few years and achieved a strategy to become a full-service financial institution, a universal bank. The Bank provides a wide range of commercial and retail banking and related financial services primarily to Lebanese individuals and private sector companies and, increasingly, to foreign companies seeking to operate in Lebanon. The Bank also provides specialized financial services such as private and investment banking through its fully owned investment banking subsidiary, Fransa Invest Bank sal, lease financing through its subsidiary, the Lebanese Leasing Company sal, selected and very well planned insurance products through its subsidiary Bancassurance sal.</narrative>
