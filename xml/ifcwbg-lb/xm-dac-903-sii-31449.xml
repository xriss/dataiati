   <narrative xml:lang="EN">(i) Funding: IFC will provide medium/long term funding, that is not available in the market, to enable the Company to continue supporting and further grow its client base. The loan would also assist the Company to diversify their funding and better manage their asset and liability position at the time of limited funding opportunities.   (ii) Access to finance: The proposed Project would support AMEEN Lebanon, one of the main microfinance providers, expand its outreach and serve a larger number of low-income people in Lebanon.  (iii) Job creation: MSMEs are key contributors to job creation in the Country. Developing a vibrant MSME sector, with reliable access to finance, can play a significant role in private sector led economic growth, generating employment and providing opportunities to the poor and under-served groups.   (iv) Demonstration effect: Through this project, IFC is expected to act as a catalyst by encouraging other investors, especially local banks, to fund the microfinance sector and bridge the financing gap facing this sector. Furthermore, the fact that IFC&apos;&apos;s first microfinance investment project within Lebanon is with one of the only two microfinance players in the market that adopt best practices and are regulated by the Central Bank, would amplify the value and credibility derived from adopting best practices and falling under the supervision of the Central Bank, hence encourage other players to apply best practices and convert to NBFIs, thereby developing the microfinance market.</narrative>
