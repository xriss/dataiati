   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The team had asked for the pad to be laid so that they could get on with block laying on arrival and it was prepared exactly as asked. At meetings with Robin before the trip it had been stressed that the group would work faster than the locals expected so all blocks required for the building should be made before the team got there and all materials ready. The local community had made what they thought was enough blocks for a couple of weeks but by the end of the first week the team were running short and although more bricks were made, it was touch and go whether the locals could keep ahead. Work progressed steadily, 12 local volunteers had been requested to work with the team and they were pleased that six of those were skilled in building work.</narrative>
