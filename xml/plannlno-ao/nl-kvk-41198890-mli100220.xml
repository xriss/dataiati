   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Fight against FGM</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">By changing social norms, this project is driving a permanent change in the way people see FGM/C. Once social norms in a community change, that change is usually irreversible, meaning that, thanks to this project, FGM/C prevalence rates will continue to drop after it has ended. 

By connecting and strengthening civil society organisations the project is installing structures that will remain in place after its completion. This will help the relevant organisations to jointly influence change at governorate and national levels and give girls and young women a point of entry where they can stand up for their rights.

The project is also strengthening the linkages between the various types of change makers. This will improve cooperation in stopping FGM/C and give girls and young women access to important actors at local, state/district and even national levels.

Once they have been adopted, specific legislation and policies on FGM/C will continue to be effective.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">FGM/C involves the partial or total removal of the external female genitalia, or other types of injury to the female genital organs for non-medical reasons. It is viewed as a traditional practice, despite it being very painful and risky for the health of girls and women. It can also cause many complications during menstruation, pregnancy and childbirth, and can even sometimes result in death. 

FGM/C is a violation of human rights and an extreme form of violence and discrimination against young women. Although FGM/C is more or less against the law in Mali,- although not explicitly in the criminal law- , in rural areas of the country there are insufficient resources and support to enforce the law. Furthermore, the infrastructure to protect girls (and boys) from violence is weak.

Many people in Mali want to continue the practice of FGM/C. This attitude, together with a high FGM/C prevalence in various regions of the country, poses a significant challenge in the fight against this harmful practice. Although government efforts have been made to improve the legal and social status of women, between 89 and 94 per cent of girls in Mali are still subjected to FGM/C. Furthermore, women there are still legally disadvantaged by the current family law (Code de la Family</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Mali is a country that is deeply rooted in traditions, one of which is Female Genital Mutilation (FGM/C). This practice is one of the biggest violations of girls&#x2019; rights and it also poses a serious risk to their health. This project will strengthen the partnership between the State, NGOs and local communities by synergising actions and sustainably and effectively promoting the human rights of women and children in Mali. The project is being implemented by Plan Mali in 70 villages in the 6 communes in Mali. The project runs from 1 July 2017 to July 2019.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">SUMMARY 
Mali is a country that is deeply rooted in traditions, one of which is Female Genital Mutilation (FGM/C). This practice is one of the biggest violations of girls&#x2019; rights and it also poses a serious risk to their health. This project will strengthen the partnership between the State, NGOs and local communities by synergising actions and sustainably and effectively promoting the human rights of women and girls in Mali. The project is being implemented by Plan International Mali in 70 villages and will adopt a community approach with a strong component of transfer of responsibilities and skills to municipalities and community leaders.  The role of partner organisations of the previous phase will change from being leading actresses of the sensitization to a role of facilitator of the transfer of the fight to the communities themselves. Successful actions of the previous phase will be upscaled. Project duration is over a period of 24 months until July 2019.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project is implemented in the 2 regions Koulikoro and S&#xE9;gou targeting 6 communities with a total of 70 villages. Total population of this villages is 109 748. Specific target group are the 13 799 girls living in these villages</narrative>

  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">To eliminate FGM/C, the social norms and values that fuel it must be changed. Furthermore, legislation against FGM/C must be improved and enforced. 
The evaluation of the previous phase showed that the practice of excision is not zero in the villages having officially declared the abandonment of the practice and reasons for this state of affairs (resistance to traditional authority or made of migration etc.)have to be identified. 
Local vigilance committees with the customary and communal authorities will be established to advise and reinforce the application of the abandonment measures. This will create a synergy between the traditional customary tradition of village chiefs and the communal authority of local elected representatives. Sensitization for behavioral change will use diverse channels, ranging from traditional local channels to modern channels such as community radio and television. In addition, the approach based on capacity building of Community Based Organizations (CBOs) and children&apos;s organizations to raise awareness among their peers on the themes of excision and child marriage that have been proven during the previous phase will be continued under the auspices of local authorities.
Furthermore the project will continue to advocate with national authorities for the adoption of legislation to ban the practice of FGC and child marriage at the country level.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Up until 2006 the fight against FGM/C was part of an integrated reproductive health and HIV/AIDS/family planning/FGM programme. This project, which has a specific focus on FGM/C, has evolved from that programme. Since 2006, Plan Mali has extended the interventions that were part of the original programme in five regions with 15 national NGOs in over 400 villages, jointly funded by several European Plan offices. The programme has regularly adjusted its strategies, based upon mid-term reviews and evaluations during the first phase. The programme is now in its third phase and including more the Sexual Reproductive Health and Rights issues, as the root causes of FGM are about how sexuality of girls and women is seen and accepted in society. Focus will be on changing the negative social norms.
In addition to sensitization and advocacy for change, the project will provide medical and psychosocial care for women and girls who are victims of the complications of child marriage and female circumcision.
Finally, the project will have a social reintegration component of girls and women victims of excision and marriage of children including obstetric fistula carriers through the financing of group income generating activities (EPC) or individual.</narrative>
