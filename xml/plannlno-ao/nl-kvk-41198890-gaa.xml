   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Learning and reflection are important aspects of the programme. In 2016 a learning agenda will be worked out and this will focus on the continuous assessment of the assumptions underlying the programme&#x2019;s design and Theories of Change. These will be reviewed critically every year at country, regional and alliance levels, resulting in strategic adjustments where necessary to ensure the maximum effectiveness of the interventions. 

Learning will also be an outcome of the programme&#x2019;s evaluation agenda. A baseline will be conducted in the first half of 2016 and a mid-term review and final evaluation are scheduled for 2018 and 2020 respectively.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">SUMMARY 
The Girls Advocacy Alliance (GAA) is an initiative of Plan International Netherlands, Defence for Children - ECPAT Netherlands and Terre des Hommes Netherlands. Through its Girls Advocacy Programme, the Alliance aims to promote equal rights and opportunities for girls and young women, reduce poverty and stimulate inclusive economic growth. Special emphasis is placed on eliminating violence against girls and women and ending their economic exclusion. The programme is about lobbying and advocacy; it does not work with girls and young women as a direct target group. It started in January 2016 and will run for five years in strategic partnership with the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs. It is being implemented in 10 countries (Bangladesh, India, Nepal, the Philippines, Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, Liberia, Sierra Leone and Uganda). Furthermore, it has four cross-country components aimed at influencing policies and practices of multinational bodies at African, Asian and international levels.</narrative>
  </description>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The GAA programme builds on the outcomes realised, lessons learned and relationships built up by the three Alliance organisations. Examples of this are the Commercial Sexual Exploitation of Children (CSEC) programme by Plan Nederland and Defence for Children &#x2013; ECPAT Nederland in Brazil and the anti-child-trafficking programme in the greater Mekong Sub-region by Terre des Hommes Nederland. Another notable example is the Girl Power programme that was implemented between 2011 and 2015 by an alliance of six Dutch NGOs, including lead organisations Plan Nederland and Defence for Children &#x2013; ECPAT Nederland.  

The Girl Power programme referred to in the previous paragraph was implemented in 10 countries in Asia, Latin America and Africa. It focused on the political and economic empowerment of girls and young women, making them better protected against sexual and other forms of gender-based violence (GBV) and improving their access to secondary education. The GAA programme will build on the thematic and strategic expertise and experience that was gained during the Girl Power programme, including partnering, networking and lobbying and advocacy. 

In six counties (Ethiopia, Ghana, Liberia, Sierra Leone, Bangladesh and Nepal), as well as in the regional programmes in Asia and Africa, the GAA will build directly on the results of some projects of the Girl Power programme and the processes of change to which that programme contributed. Examples of these include the adoption of the Sexual Offences Act in Sierra Leone, and more than 200 villages in Bangladesh in which child marriage was eradicated.</narrative>

  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Theory of Change for the GAA follows five interrelated paths. 

The first three of these paths lead to legislation, understanding, adherence and monitoring of public and private policies and practices regarding violence against girls and young women and their economic empowerment. Each of the three paths focuses on a specific type of actor: (1) government officials at national, state, province, district and community level, and representatives of customary systems; (2) private-sector actors (national, Dutch and multinationals) in the programme countries; and (3) girls&#x2019; and women&#x2019;s organisations and other Civil Society Organisation (CSOs) and CSO networks with enhanced organisational and advocacy capacity. 

The fourth path leads to the abandonment of social norms and practices that discriminate against gender. It also leads to a change in deeply rooted and widely upheld beliefs that negatively affect policy makers, local government officials, local courts and/or service providers&#x2019; willingness to adopt and implement gender-equality policies. The main actors are community-, traditional- and religious-leaders and other key opinion leaders. 

The fifth path leads to the promotion of national policy change by international (including Dutch) and regional public actors and by private parties acting as corporate &#x201C;pioneers&#x201D; of gender equality.

Each of the paths will entail three levels of change: agenda setting, policy setting and, ultimately, changing practices.</narrative>

  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The changes that will be instigated by the GAA will be sustainable. Moreover, the main strategies of the programme, which are capacity development and lobbying and advocacy, will underscore sustainability. Institutional sustainability will be ensured by the focus on strengthening the capacity of all local partner organisations. This will be based on carrying out assessments of individual organisational capacity and then annual assessments of the progress on custom-developed capacity-strengthening plans. The financial sustainability of the programme&#x2019;s outcomes and, more notably, the processes of change it will initiate, will depend on the financial and organisational sustainability of local partner organisations after the completion of the programme. These aspects will receive plenty of attention during the capacity-strengthening trajectories that will be developed and rolled out with all local partner organisations. Inclusivity is an important principle of the programme and this will also be embedded in the capacity-development activities.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The end beneficiaries of the GAA programme will be girls and young women (up to the age of 24) in 10 countries in Asia and Africa.</narrative>
  </description>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The expected long-term effects of the Girls Advocacy Programme are the reduction of GBA towards girls and young women in the target areas, and the economic empowerment of this target group. 

The Alliance will measure progress in realising different impact indicators, including the percentage of young women married before they reach 18, the percentage of girls and women subjected to female genital mutilation, and their participation in the labour force. By 2020, we expect these impact indicators to have changed for the better in at least x of the 10 programme countries. 

The programme aims to change behaviour and attitudes regarding GBV and the economic empowerment of girls and young women by communities, CSOs, private-sector agencies and governments. It is expected that the programme will result in the effective government-implementation of legislation and policies, the promotion of positive norms, values and behaviour by community leaders, the effective monitoring of government and corporate performance by CSOs and the implementation of corporate policies by private businesses. As a first step towards these changes GBV and the economic empowerment of girls and young women will be put on the agenda of community leaders, CSOs and private-sector and government agencies. Secondly, the programme will work on improving policies and legislation. The indicators for progress towards these changes will differ per country. 

Furthermore, the programme will improve the ability of CSOs to lobby and advocate for girls&#x2019; rights. To assess progress in this area, the Alliance will use an adapted version of the five core capabilities methodology.</narrative>

  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The programme focuses on four strategic goals.
1.	Public support for the eradication of GBV and for the economic inclusion of girls and young women will be increased.
2.	The influence of CSOs and networks (particularly girls&#x2019; and young women&#x2019;s organisations) on governmental and corporate/private-sector actors to eradicate GBV and support the economic inclusion of girls and young women will be increased. 
3.	The policies and practices of corporate/private-sector actors that support the eradication of GBV and support the economic inclusion of the target group will be improved.
4.	Legislation and public policies, as well as improved practices of governmental actors, that support the prevention of GBV and support the economic inclusion of the target group, will be effectively implemented.

The programme embraces two main strategies. 
The first of these involves strengthening the capacity of CSOs and networks (particularly girls&#x2019; and young women&#x2019;s organisations). This will make them better able to influence government and corporate/private-sector actors to eradicate GBV and support the economic inclusion of girls and young women.
 
The second of these strategies entails lobbying and advocacy for increased public support, improved policies and practices of corporate/private-sector actors, as well as for the effective implementation of legislation and public policies. It also includes improving the activities of governmental actors that support the prevention and eradication of GBV and that support the economic inclusion of girls and young women.</narrative>

  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Violence against girls and young women and the denial of their economic rights stand in the way of achieving meaningful gender equality. Serious violations of their human rights affect millions of girls and young women.

According to a recent study, the total global costs of partner violence are US$4.4 trillion, or 5.2 per cent of global Gross Domestic Product (GDP). The estimated global costs of child abuse are $3,6 trillion, or 4.21 per cent of global GDP. Other studies have shown that paying women less and excluding them from work costs the global economy 15.5 per cent of GDP. Increasing women&#x2019;s participation in the workforce and their access to and control over productive assets and skills can improve productivity and the competitiveness of national economies. This would make it much easier for households in these economies to sustainably improve their income and standard of living.

Physical and economic aspects of gender-equality are intertwined. A lack of economic opportunities makes it very difficult for girls and young women to refuse child marriage and makes them more vulnerable to child trafficking and commercial and sexual exploitation. Equality in laws and policies does not necessarily mean that girls and young women enjoy the same development outcomes and benefits as boys and men.

The 10 programme countries were selected on the basis of the situation of girls and young women there, existing relationships, the local experience and expertise of the Alliance organisations and the expected synergies from collaborating in them.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Visibility in the Netherlands will focus on lobbying the Dutch government and corporate companies and multinationals. There will also be opportunities through newspaper and magazine (Vice Versa) articles, radio interviews and presentations during forums and conferences by (representatives of) the Dutch alliance organisations and Plan&#x2019;s Girls Rights Watch and other youth-led lobbying initiatives. 

The programme&#x2019;s lobbying and advocacy activities, and its thematic orientation on GBV and economic empowerment, will provide ample opportunities for visibility in the programme countries, including the Netherlands. This will mainly be through newspaper articles, radio and television interviews, and media and public campaigns. Details are included in country project reports</narrative>
