   <narrative xml:lang="EN">ECHO Bringing lifesaving protection to the most at risk population in YEI,  South Sudan</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="3">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Estimated total number of direct beneficiaries targeted by the action: 10.130

Beneficiaries are chosen because they are in need of life saving child protection, especially vulnerable
groups such as: UASC, children engaged in the Worst Forms of Child Labour, IDPs and returnee children,
children especially girls at high risk of/survivors of SGBV, CAAFAG, disabled children and adolescent girls.

A special focus is paid to adolescents as they represent a critical group that are often overlooked in
child-focused programming. Adolescents are largely missing out on psychosocial support, education and
skills-building programs as they are increasingly either forced to stay indoors for their safety or to work to
support the family. Currently, with few opportunities for travel, study or decent employment, models for
peaceful and constructive action are rare for young people in Yei. Adolescent girls in particular are
disadvantaged, menstrual hygiene, teen pregnancy, female teen headed households and early marriage
have been identified as critical areas that increase barriers to access services and have mobility.

Furthermore to guarantee the resilience and the sustainability of the intervention, the action targets:
Community Based Child Protection Networks (women representatives, youth, health workers, police,
teachers and IDPs), some of them identified in collaboration with UNHCR. Context shows a significant
prevalence of male teachers due to difficulty to find female teachers and animators, to ensure better gender
balance, more female teachers, school mothers and child care facilitators will be targeted to achieve at
least 30% female teaching staff.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Major child protection concerns identified in rural and urban Yei. The children assessed
under told of family separation, as parents chose for their children to escape to town while they
hid in the bush to stay closer to their livelihoods. Family violence was more likely with absent parents. Adolescent girls reported violence by extended(instead of immediate) family. Adolescent girls also spoke of stepmothers (in the case of absent fathers), aunties and grandmothers as perpetrators. Many children among the IDPs were forced to integrate with armed groups and fell out of the education system. They are in high need of PSS and mental health services. The threat of SGBV was the form of violence that concerned girls the most. Adolescent girls of all ages identified driving forces behind SGBV experienced in Yei. They emphasise that this is further heightened by conflict, displacement, economic and food insecurity, and the rise of violent crime. CEFM is the most common form of GBV cited. Both adolescent girls, parents and other community members, reported CEFM as coping mechanism in humanitarian crisis. The findings of PI&#x2019;s needs assessment show that children are involved in paid work in Yei town. There were more girls in Child Labour with adolescent girls having the highest number, then girls between 9-12 years. Girls are more involved in petty trade (buying and
selling small items) as well as working in restaurants. Boys of both ages were involved in petty trade and washing vehicles. Situations of armed conflict placed significant strain and in some cases caused psychological distress for children. 92% of girls reported that they have experienced distress while 67% of boys confirmed experiencing distress.

The prevalence of the conflict since 2016 in areas of Greater Yei has severely disrupted
provision of and access to education. Many school facilities were destroyed or occupied by parties to
the conflict, furniture, learning and teaching material was looted, while in parallel many of the teachers
and other education personal fled from the rural areas. Focus groups found that only 1 school out of 33 cited by the participants had been functioning since 2016. In rural Yei area most of the schools have suffered damage and cannot be functional without support for the rehabilitation and renovation of the facilities and provision of furniture. In urban Yei, both host communities and IDPs have been able to access formal and non-formal education opportunities. However, due to the influx of IDP children, schools generally lack sufficient space, capacities and resources. Moreover, both in urban and rural areas of Greater Yei, the conflict has worsened an already weak provision of educational services: there were few secondary schools, no ALP opportunities and even within the town, the schools lack furniture and equipment to function properly. A major barrier to education is the low number of qualified trained teachers and female teachers. 

The absence of female teacher and non-teaching personal in schools and male-dominated environment in school exacerbated the feeling of insecurity by girls. The conflict exacerbated social and gender norms prevalent in the South Sudanese society leading to families giving priority to boys&apos; education, as females are expected to bear household chores. Girls are also more at risk of Child Early and Forced Marriage, which is a common practice and used to generate income for the household but prevents girls to complete education.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Principal objective: Reduce the exposure to and ensure timely protection from violence, abuse, neglect and exploitation for
at-risk IDP and host community children and adolescents, through enhanced access to education and
protection services in rural and urban locations in Yei River State South Sudan.

Specific objective: To provide and sustain access to quality, gender sensitive and age appropriate protection and education
services for vulnerable children and adolescents in Yei River State</narrative>

  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">SUMMARY 
This action started in July 2019 and is responding to the needs of conflict affected children and adolescents in Yei River State. Plan International and Terre des Hommes will respond to needs of recent influxes of Internally Displaced Persons and vulnerable host community children and adolescents in urban Yei. At the same time it reaches communities in rural Yei. Under result 1, vulnerable children and adolescents see their psychosocial well-being improved through access to age-appropriate, gender sensitive child protection services. This includes structured psychosocial support, case management and child protection activities. Under result 2, the project will address access to quality, safe and inclusive Alternative Learning Program (ALP) in urban Yei and primary education in rural Yei. Protection mechanisms in schools will be strengthened by rolling out child safeguarding mechanisms, delivering tailored capacity building to teachers and Parent-Teacher-Student Associations.</narrative>
