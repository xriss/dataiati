   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Cyclone Idai Mozambique: Provide life-saving protection assistance to affected children and youth</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Cyclone Idai ripped through Mozambique as a high-end Category 2 storm with 175 kph winds. While the official death toll stands at 468 (acaps 27 March) in Mozambique, it&apos;s expected to rise significantly. Due to continuous heavy rains floods are still imminent and the damaged cause is unprecedented. Families residing in rural areas where poverty levels are high and coping mechanisms low are most effected.More than 1.85 million people are affected in the region of whom 780,000 are children (UNICEF). Plan has identified Sofala as the worst impacted area - 90% of Beira has been destroyed and more than 600,000 people affected including 260,000 children(Plan RNA), and 136,000 people in temporary evacuation centres (UNOCHA, 27 March). Beira is largely comprised of families residing in rural areas where poverty levels are high and coping mechanisms low.Plan interventions are based on the RNA findings form the National Institute of Disaster Management  and Plan&#x2019;s own  Gender and Protection Needs assessment done in Buzi distict (April 2019). Plan has identified Sofala (rural Buzi and Beira), through its RNA, as the most affected area. Families residing in rural areas where poverty levels are high and coping mechanisms low are most effected.</narrative>

  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Plan will partner with local organisation AJOAGO and build on existing protection programs in the affected area. Plan and AJOAGO will build on existing protection programs in the affected area. Implementation is local-partner led. Plan and AJOAGO have a long standing partnership since 2015, including protection and disaster response. Drawing on their combined technical capacity and reach Plan and AJOAGO will engage communities to strengthen existing child protection and PSS mechanisms (building on their existing programs).
The Response is coordinated through the INGC. Plan takes active part in cluster coordination meetings (WASH, Protection, Education, Logistics) and aligns with the OCHA coordination mechanisms wherever and whenever possible. During the course of the intervention the RNA will be updated regularly. Plan partner &apos;Food for the Hungry&apos; is active in Buzi and Beira in the sectors WASH and FSL. Coordination is ongoing (both Plan and FH are member of the CHEMO disaster consortium) and referral pathways  for victims will be established in harmonisation and coordination with partners on the ground, including INGC and UN organisations.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">SUMMARY 
Plan International scaled up its programming in Mozambique to respond to the devastating impact of cyclone Idai in Sofala Province in April 2019 until November 2019 by establishing a satellite office. Interventions were based on the findings of the National Institute of Disaster Management (I.N.G.C.) and Plan&#x2019;s rapid needs assessments including on SRHR (Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights), child protection and MHM (Menstrual Hygiene Management). Plan identified rural Buzi Locality and Beira District as the most affected areas. 90% of Beira District was destroyed and more than 600,000 people were affected, incl. 260,000 children. The high poverty levels here result in low coping mechanisms and limited preparation efforts. 4,363 houses were partly damaged, 11,020 completely destroyed and 40.000 people were evacuated from flood areas. In this short term rapid response, Plan responded in the sectors of Child Protection in Emergencies and Shelter/Non Food Items (NFI) distribution.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Strategic Objective Idai response: Deliver immediate, life-saving assistance to girls, boys, women and men most urgent need in line with national response plan and sphere standards.
Specific Objective project proposal: Provide life-saving NFI and Protection assistance to the most vulnerable people/population in Buzi and Beira. 
1.000 families targeted with NFI kits including hygiene items
1750 women and girls provided with dignity kits.
1750 women and girls educated on MHM
5 safe spaces created for 2500 young people 
PSS and case management for 100 traumatized children</narrative>

  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The National response will last much longer than the proposed project cycle of  six months. It is expected that more funds will come to allow to continue the intervention till at least September 2020, according to the Mozambique DRM strategy.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The immediate needs of the affected population, but particularly the needs of those who are often invisible (for example in rural Buzi) are our first priority. The different needs and accessibility of the young and old, male and female, abled and disabled will be analysed in the RNA that will be updated during the next weeks to ensure that everyone has safe and equal access to support. The program specifically targets: children, child-headed households, unaccompanied minors, adolescents, female headed households, people with restricted movement. There will be a central role of women in selection of beneficiaries to ensure equitable and dignified access to distributions and ensure that these materials are appropriate for users.

NFI: At  the moment 4,363 houses are confirmed to be partly damaged and 11,020 completely destroyed (INGC sitrep 20/30/2019). 40.000 people are evacuated from flood areas, and many more seek refuge on rooftops and high grounds. Plan proposes a first-line NFI response through the provision of NFI  kits  including mosquito nets and water purification tablets, following INGC standards. 
Protection: In cyclone affected areas, sexual violence and transactional sex particularly for adolescents and young women young due to competition over scarce resources can substantially increase. Plan aims to strengthen existing community based child protection mechanisms, that were already supported by AJOAGO (Plan&apos;s local partner), and establish youth-friendly spaces including case management where prevention and response to SGBV and PSS is provided as well as dignity kits for young women.

Result 1: 1.000 families provided with non-food items and hygiene support including MHM.
Activity 1: Families are provided with NFI kits according to INGC guidelines. The kit will contain cooking utensils, blankets, impregnated mosquito nets and water purification tablets. These items will contribute significantly in the prevention of water borne diseases and malaria and will be accompanied by mobile IEC campaigns (see protection). 
Activity 2: 1.750 women and girls  supported with dignity kits and MHM education.
Result 2: 10.000 persons receive an appropriate protection response.
Activity 1: Mobile teams revive community structures (e.g. child protection committees, youth clubs, community leaders) that are already supported by local partner Associa&#xE7;&#xE3;o dos Jovens e Amigos de Guvuro (AJOAGO) and set up community-based protection mechanisms and provide awareness on SGBV, menstrual hygiene and child protection 
Activity 2:  Establish 5 safe spaces for children and youth where, amongst others  SGBV issues will be addressed and girls and boys can discuss and share their specific needs taking into consiseration gender equality and inclusion. 
Activity 3: Psycho Social Support for 100 traumatized children and referrals are provided. As soon as possible survivor-centred multisectoral services for prevention, response and building resilience on SGBV and referral systems will be established.
Result 3:  Targeted population has access to feedback mechanism
Activity 1: Complaint and feed-back mechanisms, through score-cards/suggestion box/hotline &amp; through sex-age disaggregated information from FGD, are activated and included in M&amp;E actitities in order to adjust project activities in line with changing needs of the population.</narrative>

Community awareness raising activities and community resilience building including strengthening of  community protection committees and community DRM committees will create support and give sustainability to the interventions. In the youth safe spaces, SGBV issues are addressed through gender-sensitive approach for girls and boys. As soon as possible, PSS for traumatized children and referral mechanisms are established. Survivor-centred multisectoral services for prevention of SGBV and response are strengthened.</narrative>
