  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Ethiopia is dealing with large numbers of refugees and internally displaced persons, in addition to recurring climate induced disasters (droughts and floods). UNHCR (May 2021) reported that there are 806,541 refugees (65% children) including 372,067 from South Sudan; the majority of them being hosted in Gambella. The influx of refugees from South Sudan has continued throughout 2020/21, with a total of 8,220 refugees registered at Pagak reception center, of whom 7,824 were relocated to Nguennyel refugee camp (Gambella). To release the pressure on Gambella, more and more refugees have been relocated to Benishangul-Gumuz. Although increasing influx is expected to persist, the Regional Refugee Response Plan is severely underfunded. 
This deficit has had a direct impact on the delivery of assistance to at-risk population, including unaccompanied and separated children, female headed households, survivors and at-risk children of different forms of abuse, violence, neglect and exploitation. The high number of vulnerable children, coupled with the deterioration of the context due to Covid-19,
flood disasters, and the current crises in Ethiopia, place CPiE and EiE as high priorities in both Gambella and Benishangul-Gumuz refugee response program.</narrative>
  </description>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In order to guarantee an adequate and sustainable delivery of assistance, Plan International maintains a well-functioning organizational set-up in the target areas. The regional office in Gambella with 78 national staff and the Assosa office with 35 staff (in Benishangul-Gumuz) ensure that the support to refugees in both areas is of high quality. In addition, PI has more than 500 incentive refugee teachers, case workers and social workers. Project staff involved in the response are trained in CPiE, EiE, child rights, PI code of conduct, child safeguarding policies, SGBV, Gender equality, Prevention of Sexual Exploitation and Abuse (PSEA), Project Management and Safety and Security. Regular coaching and mentoring is also provided to national staff, incentive workers and community structure members so as to able strengthen the ownership and sustainability the project. PIE has good relationships with relevant government bodies and is an active member of several clusters and co-chairing the PSEA networking group in Gambella, ensuring complementarities and a smooth continuation of the response. PIE is well placed to sustain CPiE and EiE for current and new-influxes, while making full use of experiences, organizational set-up and investments already done in infrastructure.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">SUMMARY
This 25-month action starting on 1 June 2021 aims to improve the wellbeing of South Sudanese refugee girls and boys through integrated education and child protection interventions. The action is implemented in four refugee camps in the regions of Gambella (Nguenyyiel and Kule) and Benishangul-Gumuz (Gure-Shembolla, Tsore), Ethiopia. The action is managed by Plan Netherlands and implemented by Plan International Ethiopia, targeting 63,739 beneficiaries (26,110 Female and 37,629 Male) of which 48,027 are children below the age of 18 years. Through this project, Plan provides enhanced and safe access to primary education in an inclusive environment for vulnerable boys and girls in refugee camps, supporting schools and addressing barriers to accessing education. Further, child protection systems are strengthened through psychosocial support, case management, in compliance with the Minimum Standards for child Protection in Humanitarian Actions.</narrative>

  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Action benefits from existing cooperation modalities, built during the 6 previous ECHO projects. Plan contributes to the UNHCR led Best Interest Determination (BID) panel. Plan facilitates the process across the camps through its Child Protection Information Management System (CPIMS), which links with UNICEF and Save the Children. Plan cooperates with ICRC for cross-border tracing and feeds information into the East Africa Regional database. Plan has a role in the facilitation of in-country tracing. Plan conducts adult and/or child verification upon request from the UNHCR regional office and the Protection working group in Gambella. The Action benefits from the cooperation with UNICEF with regard to guidance on the quality provision of psychosocial support to girls and boys in Child Friendly Spaces (CFS) and schools.</narrative>
