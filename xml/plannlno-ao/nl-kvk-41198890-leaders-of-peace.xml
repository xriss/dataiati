   <narrative xml:lang="EN">2020 marks the 20th anniversary of the adoption of UN Security Council Resolution 1325 on women, peace and security. Therefore, it is time to re-emphasize the important role of (young)  women in peacebuilding in South Sudan. The voices of young people, girls and boys, need to be heard in these dialogues and reconciliation processes &#x2013; especially those at the heart of conflict. It remains crucial that the positive contribution of women and youth to sustainable peace and state building is recognized, supported and celebrated. 
In this prospect, a multi-sectoral and multi-level approach is required, which will lead to improved implementation of policies and regulations on GBV and protection of W/G including psychosocial support and self-care (Result area 1 of our Theory of Change), changed attitudes and beliefs of civil society to facilitate inclusion of W/G and promote gender equality (Result area  2); and increased and effective participation of W/Y in leadership and peacebuilding (Result area 3).</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Beneficiaries are community members in the different locations. More specifically, women and youth as well as influential persons in the community will be targeted. Moreover, the programme will strengthen capacities and learning between consortium members and their local partners.</narrative>
  </description>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Capacity building on PSS and legal protection services of community groups; training case workers in age, gender-appropritae PSS, GBV, legal protection information; Lobby and Advocacy on the importance of legal protection for women and girls (including GBV survivors); provide capacity building to traditional authorities to develop/adjust/implement regulations related to protection of W/G; capacity building on gender equality, protection and W/Gs meaningful participation; awareness raising on gender equality, human rights and UNSCR1325, training on agents of change to key persons/youth in communities; provision of subgranting to female activities/CBOs,CSOs; awareness raising about and provision of responses to COVID-19, lobby and advocacy, monitoring, learning,  evaluation and documentation, capacity building of alliance partners, Collaboration and coordination with partners around joint events, capacitation of gatekeepers and policy makers (incl. female politicians, international gatekeepers CBOs, CSOs and business leaders) to lobby and advocate on the WPS agenda, developing joint advocacy strategy. 

Working with local actors like the police and the traditional courts, engaging men and building the capacity of the community of gender equality and UNSCR 1325, including youth, are the core strategies.</narrative>

  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">It will be important to maintain the same key actors during the lenght of the project.  Ownership by the local community will be important as well; for that the local context and prevelent social norms have to be taken into consideration.</narrative>
  </description>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Result Area 1: Improved implementation of policies and regulations on GBV and protection of W/G including psychoso- cial support and self-care.
When W/G know their rights, have access to and use MHPSS and legal protection services, while in parallel formal/ traditional authorities will implement laws and policies against GBV as well as protect survivors after being informed on these topics, W/G will be less vulnerable to physical and emotional harm . 
Result Area  2: Changed attitudes and beliefs of civil society to facilitate inclusion of W/G and promote gender equality.
Changing harmful norms and attitudes includes transforming violent masculinities by targeting influential powerholders (men/boys) as allies and positive role models, to jointly advocate with women and youth groups for GE, as well as for equal participation of W/Y groups. 
Result Area  3: Increased and effective participation of W/Y in leadership and peacebuilding.
Increased, influential participation of W/Y in leadership and peacebuilding is possible when W/Y facilitate political positioning and influencing across ethnic/religious/conflict lines, together with male counterparts (as well linked to RA2).

The overall strategic objective of the Leaders of Peace programme is, that by the end of 2025, women and girls live in a more empowering and inclusive environment in South Sudan, where they feel safer and better enabled to realise their rights, so they can play an influential role towards conflict prevention and sustainable peace.
To achieve this, the alliance will enable civil society organisations with the capacity, resources and legitimacy to influence government, and societal actors in various areas. CSOs are supported and complemented in their advocacy activities by their counterparts and/or the Ministry. At the same time, the programme mobilizes key decision makers to work towards inclusive laws, policies and norms and practices. Through lobby and advocacy of our CSO stakeholders LoP will change duty bearers&#x2019; attitude towards gender equality and female participation in decision making and the peace process.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">SUMMARY: 
South Sudan has been engaged in a peace process for years. It remains important to emphasize the role of women and youth in peacebuilding. The consortium consisting of Plan International, AMA, EVE, HealthNet, and PAX implements the Leaders of Peace Programme in Eastern, Western and Central Equatoria, Unity, and Lakes. Juba will be the central location to link advocacy work to national platforms and decision-makers. The alliance is coordinated by Plan International (consortium lead) from January 2021 to December 2025 and aims to achieve and sustain a more empowering and inclusive environment in South Sudan for women and girls. To achieve this, we enable and support civil society organisations (CSOs) with the capacity, resources and legitimacy to influence government and societal actors. At the same time, the programme mobilizes key decision-makers to work towards inclusive laws, policies, norms and practices to achieve gender equality and female participation in decision-making.</narrative>
