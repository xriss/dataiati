   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Following the massive explosion in the port of Beirut that shook the city on the 4th of Agust 2020 more than 157 people were killed, and an estimated 5,000 people were injured. More than 150 people remain missing. According to the Governor of Beirut up to 300,000 people have had their homes destroyed or completely destroyed. As a result of the explosion there was widespread damage to infrastructure: Numerous residences and businesses in the GReater Beirut Area have been damaged or destroyed, and several medical facilities have suffered structural damage. These events have had massive impact on young girls and boys whose lives have been (partially) uprooted. There are high needs in terms of psychosocial support, especially for children, who&#x202F;are&#x202F;now&#x202F;pushed&#x202F;further into hunger. Prior to the explosion, more than half a million children in Beirut were at risk of hunger; this figure will likely only increase. Girls&#x2019; and boys&#x2019; well-being&#x202F;is&#x202F;also affected as they suffer from distress impacting them on the medium and long term. Also, as many are displaced from their homes they&#x202F;are at risk of violence,&#x202F;abuse&#x202F;and exploitation. There are also children who find themselves separated from their parents and these are at an even higher risk.</narrative>
  </description>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Our primary investment objective is to effectively support young girls and boys in their protection and educational needs, caused by the impact of the devastating explosion. In doing so, primary caregivers and teachers will also be equipped in various ways to support these young girls and boys in meeting those needs. In terms of protection, Psychological First Aid (PFA) and Psychosocial Support (PSS) will be provided to affected girls and boys. The aim of this support is to decrease the psychosocial distress, improve girls&apos; and boys&apos; well-being and their emotional resilience, and refer medium to high risk cases to case management and other service providers to address urgent needs. In terms of education, the students are in need of back-to-school kits that include stationery and essential scholastic year requirements especially following the recent deteriorating economic situation in the country that has affected the prices of Educational necessities such as stationery and learning materials. Distributing these kits would allow the children affected by the Beirut Port explosion to enjoy some sense of normalcy while resuming their education and would lessen the economic burden off their families as well.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Plan International&apos;s intervention is part of a wider response of the SHO (collaborating aid organisations behind Giro555) to the acute crisis (quick onset) which followed after the port explosion in Beirut. These organisations joined forces to take action for Beirut. Immediate emergency aid has been undertaken, such as medical care, rescue work, drinking water and shelter. But also psychosocial help for the traumatised victims of the disaster and educational needs. The relief organisations continue to provide assistance to the victims for up to two years after the disaster. Plan International Lebanon will focus on the Protection and Education needs of affected young boys and girls, also through activities involving their parents, caregivers and teachers.</narrative>
  </description>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Plan International&#x2019;s response will cover the period between 26th August 2020 and 28th February 2020 and involves the following activities:

1. Child Protection and PSS support aimed at improving psychosocial wellbeing and positive coping mechanisms of girls and boys affected by the disaster in partnership with local NGO Himaya:  
&#x2022;	Providing group-based psychosocial support activities to 400 affected girls and boys
&#x2022;	Distributing psychosocial support kits to 200 affected girls and boys
&#x2022;	Providing individual case management services to child survivors and/or at-risk girls and boys including referrals to multi-sectoral services (180 girls and boys)
&#x2022;	Providing key messages and awareness sessions to 250 parents and caregivers of affected children on how to help children cope with distress
 
2. Education support aimed at improving access to quality and safe education to girls and boys affected by the disaster: 
&#x2022;	Distributing educational kits including stationery supplies to 200 affected girls and boys
&#x2022;	Distributing remote education kits, including tablets to 530 affected families
&#x2022;	Dissemination of information leaflets to 530 affected families (children, parents/caregivers) on remote learning as part of the remote learning kits, including 
        information resources and guidance for parents on remote learning
&#x2022;	Distributing remote teaching kits to 205 teachers in affected public schools enabling them to support their students through remote teaching</narrative>

  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Plan focuses on building human and social capital as it is integral to strategic community investment; it leverages and multiplies the impact of the intervention by strengthening local partner organizations, increasing the likelihood of project success and sustainability. Within this response community investment is shown by including local partner Himaya as an integral part to the protection activities. Quality case management including referrals to multi-sectoral services as needed will ensure that the psychosocial needs of young girls and boys will be examined through multiple perspectives and will be monitored over a longer period.
The inclusion of parents, caregivers and teachers in the response will ensure that even after the project comes to an end primary beneficiaries will benefit from the intervention.</narrative>
