   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Child Protection: The project builds on the socio-ecological model of Child Protection and aligns with Plan&#x2019;s Global Child Protection Strategy and logframe, composed of 3 overarching CPiE Objectives : 1. Strengthen the protective environment: children, caregivers and communities recognize risks and prevent and respond to them; 2. Promote access to age and gender appropriate services: children and families can access quality services to prevent and respond to violence, abuse, neglect, and exploitation appropriate to the best interest of the child and in line with minimum standards. 3. Child protection monitoring, coordination, policy and advocacy: Plan International is part of inter-agency efforts to improve (sub) state level advocacy and policy change to improve the lives of children affected by violence, abuse, neglect and exploitation before, during and after emergencies.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Inter communal conflict erupted between Guji Oromo and Gedeo ethnic groups in April 2018. Communities/household&apos;s assets were damaged, massive displacement occurred and death and physical injuries were recorded. As of September 2018, a total of 822,187   displaced girls, boys, women and men are living in different IDP sites in Gedeo zone. The overall security situation has improved but multiple protection concerns remain/were exacerbated, discriminations and tensions between IDP and host communities are apparent. Main child protection concerns and needs identified are presence of unaccompanied and separated children, trauma and psychological distress among children and high risk of gender based violence, especially for women and girls. Insufficient quantities of water and firewood prompt girls and women to walk long distances outside IDP sites, which exposes them at heightened risk of GBV. It was reported that, when they fled their homes, women were raped, including experiencing gang rape. After the government decided that IDPs should return to their place of origin in September 2018, there has been a massive relocation of people within Gedeo Zone, from Gedeo to West Guji zone and from West Guji to Gedeo Zone, adding forced returnees to the IDP population in the sites. The returnees lack NFIs and shelter and require both material and psychosocial support. Parents decided often to return without their children, wanting to check the security situation before. The return program is spearheaded by officials from the political offices, hampering the work from the Woreda Child Affairs. Large number of IDPs do not want to return and move to the host community, making it more difficult to follow-up on UASCs and other vulnerable children who were already identified.</narrative>
