  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Currently we are witnessing a rise in girls and young women&#x2019;s activism and protest. The She Leads programme will partner with existing GYW-led groups and feminist organizations. Importantly, special efforts are made to support existing informal groups of girls and young women, for example girls clubs, associations, student groups and unregistered organizations, which have started to organize and mobilize but are often excluded from many funding mechanisms.

In Ethiopia, the programme builds directly on the experiences of the previous Girls Advocacy Alliance (2016-2020). 

FEMNET is a  network organisations, and will be working in all countries through selected members of their respective networks. Plan International and Terre des Hommes will work through their country offices and with local contracted organisations to implement projects under the overall She Leads programme. 
Finally, She Leads will seek alignment and collaboration with the Dutch Embassy and other consortiums funded under the Strengthening Civil Society framework of the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Trade and Development Cooperation. In particular, She Leads will seek alignment with the four other consortiums funded under the Women&#x2019;s Rights and Gender Equality (WRGE) theme of the Power of Voices funding mechanism.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Girls and young women&#x2019;s (GYW&#x2019;s) rights to engage in public decision-making are enshrined in international agreements and national laws. In reality, however, GYW voices are excluded from the socio-political domain,  particularly those of GYW who experience intersecting forms of discrimination. 
GYW&#x2019;s meaningful participation is obstructed by three interrelated factors. Firstly, discriminatory gender- and age-related social norms limit GYW&#x2019;s rights to move freely, voice opinions and engage in public life. 
Secondly, GYW groups in civil society are under resourced and lack strong ties with more established CSOs. The latter are not always responsive to the specific needs and perspectives of GYW-led groups. Furthermore, the global phenomenon of shrinking civic space is affecting GYW-led organizations, making it even harder for them to express their opinions, assemble and associate. Groups that challenge the ruling gender ideology are increasingly being intimidated, threatened and exposed to violence. In conflict and humanitarian contexts, GYW actors risk additional security threats as easy targets of militarized and extremist forces. 
Thirdly, political institutions at local and national level are dominated by elites consisting of mainly male, elder leaders, with no interest in institutional reforms that would make decision-making processes more inclusive, transparent and accountable. Existing consultation mechanisms (such as youth parliaments and advisory bodies) are usually poorly resourced, dependent on donor support and functioning irregularly.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">SUMMARY: While Ethiopia has made impressive strides in, for example, GYW&#x2019;s access to education and the introduction of new laws against GBV, their socio-political participation continues to be much lower than that of boys and young men. Within the population of girls and young women (between age 14 till 24 years of age), there are specific groups of GYW in She Leads countries who suffer most from (intersectional) discrimination and exclusion.
The She Leads consortium brings together child rights organisations, feminist/women&#x2019;s rights organisations, and GYW-led groups and aims to increase sustained influence of girls and young women (GYW) on decision-making and the transformation of gender norms in formal and informal institutions. In Ethiopia, She Leads members FEMNET, TdH and Plan will implement the programme.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">She Leads contributes to a lasting transformative effect on engagement of GYW in decision-making. The following strategies will be implemented: 

1.	Strengthening and resourcing GYW-led organizations: investing in the resource base of GYW-led organizations will help them access other funding in the future. 
2.	Support social movements: social movements can accelerate lasting change in societies&#x2019; structures and norms. She Leads will bring together child-rights and feminist organisations and GYW-led groups to push collectively for transformative change in gender norms, and for institutional reform. 
3.	Engaging boys &amp; men, parents, and traditional and religious leaders: these actors are crucial allies to ensure structural change and permanent effects when it comes to norms change. Because of their status and their role in socialisation processes, these actors promote structural change in societies. 
4.	Engaging media: She Leads will use media as a tool to amplify GYWs voices, and will target media as a powerful agent of change. Opening space for GYW&#x2019;s voices and leadership in the media will ultimately influence broader communities, and has lasting effects beyond the programme.
5.	Organisational capacity strengthening of CSO&#x2019;s: investments in advocacy capacity, building relationships with decision-makers, strengthening fundraising skills will have a lasting effect on their influencing work beyond She Leads. 
6.	Linking local, national, regional and global: She Leads is implemented at different levels that are strategically interconnected. Interventions and results in one domain trigger change in other domains, and changes at local, national, regional and international levels are connected and influence each other.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The long-term aim (impact) of She Leads is that GYW&#x2019;s perspectives are included in gender responsive laws and policies and societal norms and practices. The strategic objective is to increase the sustained influence of GYW on decision-making and the transformation of gender norms in formal and informal institutions.
Central to the She Leads programme is the enhancement of collective action of girls and young women in a gender-responsive civil society (civil society domain), support by increased acceptance of positive social gender norms (socio-cultural domain) and by enabling meaningful participation of girls and young women in decision-making by political institutions (institutional domain).</narrative>
