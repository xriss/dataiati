   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Learning and reflection are important aspects of the programme. In 2016 a learning agenda will be worked out and this will focus on the continuous assessment of the assumptions underlying the programme&#x2019;s design and Theories of Change. These will be reviewed critically every year at country, regional and alliance levels, resulting in strategic adjustments where necessary to ensure the maximum effectiveness of the interventions. 

Learning will also be an outcome of the programme&#x2019;s evaluation agenda. A baseline will be conducted in the first half of 2016 and a mid-term review and final evaluation are scheduled for 2018 and 2020 respectively.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">SUMMARY 
The Girls Advocacy Programme in India is part of a broader initiative by an alliance comprising of Plan International Netherlands, Defence for Children-ECPAT Netherlands and Terre des Hommes Netherlands. It promotes equal rights and opportunities for girls and young women. Particular emphasis is being placed on improving policies and practices for the eradication of violence against girls and women and ending their economic exclusion. 
In India, the Programme is being implemented by Plan India and Terre des Hommes together with local CSO partners. 
The Girls Advocacy Programme runs from January 2016 to December 2020 in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. Through lobby and advocacy, the programme works with government, community and religious leaders, private sector agents, local CSO&#x2019;s and youth advocates to reduce child marriages and child trafficking and improve women&#x2019;s access to good technical and vocational training and increase opportunities for them to find decent work.</narrative>
  </description>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Girls Advocacy Programme builds on the outcomes realised, lessons learned and relationships built up by the three alliance organisations during various programmes. An example in India is the Missing Child Alert programme. This is being carried out by Plan, together with its partners in Bangladesh and Nepal, and its goal is to reduce the cross-border trafficking of children. 

Thanks to its various programmes all over India, specifically in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, the States selected for the Girls Advocacy Programme, Plan India has extensive expertise in the area of child trafficking, child marriage, and the economic empowerment of women.</narrative>

  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Theory of Change for the Girls Advocacy Programme in India follows four interrelated paths. 
Three of these lead to legislation, understanding, adherence to and the monitoring of public and private policies and practices regarding violence against girls and young women and their economic empowerment. Each of these paths focuses on a specific type of actor: (1) government officials at national, state, province, district and community level, and representatives of customary systems; (2) private sector actors; and (3) girls&#x2019; and women&#x2019;s organisations and other Civil Society Organisations (CSOs) and CSO networks with enhanced organisational and advocacy capacity. 

The fourth path leads to the abandonment of social norms and practices that discriminate against gender. It also leads to a change in deeply rooted and widely upheld beliefs that negatively affect policy makers, local government officials, local courts and/or service providers&#x2019; willingness to adopt and implement gender-equality policies. The main actors are community, traditional and religious leaders and other key opinion leaders. 

Each of the paths will entail three levels of change: agenda setting, policy setting and, ultimately, changing practices.</narrative>
  </description>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The changes that will be introduced by the Girls Advocacy Programme in India will be sustainable. Moreover, the main strategies of the programme, which are capacity development and lobbying and advocacy, will underscore sustainability. Institutional sustainability will be ensured by the focus on strengthening the capacity of all local partner organisations. This will be based on carrying out assessments of individual organisational capacity and then annual assessments of the progress on custom-developed capacity-strengthening plans. The financial sustainability of the programme&#x2019;s outcomes and, more notably, the processes of change it will initiate, will depend on the financial and organisational sustainability of local partner organisations after the completion of the programme. These aspects will receive plenty of attention during the capacity-strengthening trajectories that will be developed and rolled out with all local partner organisations. Inclusivity is an important principle of the programme and this will also be embedded in the capacity-development activities.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The end beneficiaries of the Girls Advocacy Programme carried out by Plan India will be girls and young women (up to the age of 24) in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana.</narrative>
  </description>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The lobbying and advocacy part of the programme and its thematic orientation on GBV and economic empowerment will provide plenty of opportunities for visibility in India. This will mainly be through newspaper articles, radio and television interviews and programmes, presentations during conferences and media and public campaigns.</narrative>
  </description>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The programme focuses on four strategic goals.
1.	Public support for the eradication of GBV and for the economic inclusion of girls and young women, will be increased.
2.	The influence of CSOs and networks (particularly girls&#x2019; and young women&#x2019;s organisations) on governmental and corporate/private-sector actors to eradicate GBV and support the economic inclusion of girls and young women, will be increased. 
3.	The policies and practices of corporate/private-sector actors that support the eradication of GBV and support the economic inclusion of women, will be improved.
4.	Legislation and public policies, as well as improved practices of governmental actors, that support the prevention of GBV and support the economic inclusion of women, will be effectively implemented.

The programme embraces two main strategies. 
The first of these involves strengthening CSOs and networks (particularly girls&#x2019; and young women&#x2019;s organisations). This will make them better able to influence government and private-sector actors to eradicate GBV and support the economic inclusion of girls and young women.
 
The second of these strategies entails influencing policies to increase public support and improve the policies and practices of private-sector actors, as well as the effective implementation of legislation and public policies. It also includes improving the activities of governmental actors that support the prevention and eradication of GBV and that support the economic inclusion of girls and young women. Specific methods used to influence policies are lobbying, advocacy (including media campaigns and ICT), research and linking and networking.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Violence against girls and young women and the denial of their economic rights stand in the way of achieving meaningful gender equality. Serious violations of these human rights are affecting millions of girls and young women. Societies pay a high price for not tackling these issues. 

Gender inequality has been a persistent area of concern in India. According to UN gender statistics in 2012, despite high rates of economic growth, the participation of women in India&#x2019;s workforce and their lack of control over their livelihood remain very low (27 per cent). A 2014 UNDP report that surveyed 186 countries ranked India 127 on the gender-inequality index. Many forms of gender-based violence (GBV) are widespread in India. These include child marriage, trafficking and commercial sexual exploitation, the dowry system, the abortion female babies, domestic violence and sexual violence. All these lead to women having a low status and to their social and economic exclusion. 

Physical and economic aspects of gender-equality are intertwined. A lack of economic opportunities makes it very difficult for girls and young women to refuse child marriage and it makes them more vulnerable to child trafficking and commercial and sexual exploitation. Equality in laws and policies does not necessarily mean that girls and young women enjoy the same development outcomes and benefits as boys and men.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Visibility in the Netherlands will focus on providing input for evidence-based lobbying of the Dutch government (&#x201C;dialogue and dissent&#x201D;) and of corporate companies and multinationals. There will also be opportunities for visibility through newspaper and magazine (Vice Versa) articles, radio interviews, and presentations during forums and conferences.</narrative>
