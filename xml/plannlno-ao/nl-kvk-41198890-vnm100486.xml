   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The joint response commits itself to 2 of the 4 objectives set out in the Viet Nam Flood HRP, namely:
1.	Deliver immediate, life-saving assistance to those with the most urgent needs, in support of the Government response and in line with Government requests for assistance.
2.	Ensure access to multi sectoral assistance and re-establish critical services. Promote the repair of key public service infrastructure in affected provinces, ensure food security, by restoring lost food stock, livestock and livelihoods, ensure access to sustainable drinking water, sanitation facilities and hygiene supplies, housing, replacement of productive assets and household items, and access to basic medical, social and public services to support the affected population transition to recovery and rebuild their lives and livelihoods.

Plan will implement the programme in Quang Tri and Quang Binh fully through local partners, providing technical and management support where needed and to ensure oversight. Plan International has a track record working in partnership with Commune People Committees (CPC) which coordinate closely with health sectors and schools, among others, on the implementation of project activities. In addition, particularly to ensure the strengthening of CFSs and in order to mainstream CP within the response, Plan International works with the Provincial Department of Education in Quang Binh and Quang Tri. For the FSL and MPCA activities, including cash-for-work and early recovery of agricultural lands, technical training, etc, Plan International works with the Provincial Department of Agriculture and Rural Development in both provinces. In addition, Plan International and CARE will both work closely with the Viet Nam Women&#x2019;s Union, though only Plan International will hold a direct grant relationship to enhance efficiency. However, CARE, Plan and the VWU will collaborate to align programmatic approaches in the different localities.

FSL:
