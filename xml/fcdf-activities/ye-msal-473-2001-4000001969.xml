     <narrative xml:lang="EN">In order for the Family counseling and Development Foundation to play a more effective role in the field of Mental Health and Psychosocial Support, it had to generally review its approach and performance during the past three years, think about organizing and empowering the organization on the one hand, and in organizing and empowering the mental health sector to ensure its response to the continuous and incremental needs and take advantage of emerging opportunities on the other hand. The Strategic Plan for the Family Foundation and Development Foundation (2020-2022) is an important event in the organization development timeline for two main reasons: The first is- along with a focus on service provision -, the orientation towards institutional building to ensure integrative standards, integration of services and their quality, efficiency and institutional governance. The second is the foundation interest in organizing and empowering the mental health sector to ensure access and equal distribution of MHPSS services among the various regions of the Republic of Yemen and all segments of the society by activating mental health facilities, training health personnel to provide basic mental health services, and establishing partnerships to coordinate efforts, exchange benefits and enhance mutual support. FCDF hopes through the strategy (2020-2022) to - Increase the number of beneficiaries from MHPSS services, - Work to provide MHPSS services in areas of need in the main cities, districts and remote areas - Enhance the opportunity of NGOs to contribute in developing the mental health and psychosocial support sector through partnerships with the government, the private sector and donors, which also provides an opportunity to improve governance and accountability on the one hand, and on the other hand it provides an opportunity for FCDF and other NGOs to provide their expertise to the government and other stakeholders as key partners and contractors in service provision. This strategic plan identifies the main challenges that FCDF faces, which are: - Gaps in completing the administrative, programmatic and operational institutional structure. - Lack of resources and technical capabilities. - The Foundation ambitious vision, mission and strategic goals in light of insufficient infrastructure for the mental health sector and weak ability to Enforce work standards such as integration, quality, efficiency, governance, and effective partnership. To overcome these challenges, the Family Counseling and Development Foundation will focus in the next three years on: - Institutional development of the institution to improve institutional performance, - enhance the integration and integration approach to improve service delivery, - enhance research, monitoring, evaluation, communication and communication and benefit from them to improve service delivery, governance and accountability, including meeting ongoing health needs in the sector as well Partnership needs, activating mental health facilities in various regions and increasing the capacity of health personnel, including doctors and specialists. As a first step to achieve the strategic directions of FCDF, an organizational structure has been developed which is appropriate to the nature of the its work in order to enhance the program unit and the ties of integration with the administrative units, facilitates the process of reporting and information flows and communication. They are all necessary for an effective implementation of the 3-Year Strategic Plan. A Balanced Scorecard &amp; Key Performance Indicators (BSC &amp; KPIs) to help shorten strategy description, focus on important actions, and facilitates successful implementation of the strategy. The process of developing the strategic plan for the FCDF That last for 3 Months , from October- December 2019 was a participatory process that included literary reviews of the foundation&#x2019;s documents from relevant reports, policies, procedures and media publications, as well as the collection of primary field information through interviews with beneficiaries, as well as secondary information collection by reviewing studies And researches related to the state of mental health in Yemen, and national plans such as the humanitarian response plan in Yemen, in addition to 7-days workshops to analyze, plan, verify, discuss and consensus on priorities, Objectives and strategies. This process was facilitated and supported by ITAR foundation for Social Development, which designed the methodology, collected and analyzed information, implemented the workshops, and prepared the final report.</narrative>

From family, social to psychological issues. For cases that need psychiatric counseling and either calling from remote areas or cannot reach our centers, the counselors redirect the call to 2 assigned psychiatrics working for 6 days a week to provide basic help. War, family and social problems are dominating and the largest number of callers were female as phone calls are the easiest and most suitable way for help to them because they do not have to leave their residents which put them under the pressure of seeking their family permission.</narrative>
