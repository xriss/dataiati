   <narrative xml:lang="EN">1. City administration signed on to the Paris Declaration (and joined the Zero TB Cities Initiative, if the scope of work permits), including commitment and action plan to achieve 90-90-90 targets, particularly among the key populations.
2. Key populations included as priority groups and partners/service providers in the municipal plans; and the progress on key populations&#x2019; related targets tracked.
3. Increased city funding and endorsed HIV (and TB, if the scope of work permits) city improvement plan/s to strengthen response among the key populations.
4. Strengthened partnership between municipal government and NGOs, including key populations representatives on relevant city coordination group/s.
5. Strengthened advocacy capacity among representatives of the key populations communities, particularly new leaders, to effectively collaborate with municipal government, across the key populations groups, as well as with public health, human rights and other organisations relevant to the HIV/AIDS (and, where feasible, TB) response.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">AFEW International and partners EVA, St. Petersburg and AFEW Kyrgyzstan, Bishkek&#x37E; co&#x2013;created a project strengthening civil society (CS) engagement with receptive public officials (city administration, politicians, health, law enforcement, finance). The project builds CS advocacy and influencing skills to engage with existing decision-makers and enlarge this pool of supporters at municipal level, contributing to strengthened political commitment and endorsement of international protocols on Key Population (KP) HIV services/budgeting. There is a cross-cutting focus on adolescent girls and young women (AGYW) as a priority group impacted by specific HIV drivers. The project leverages increasing responsibility at municipal level leading on HIV and health initiatives, balancing community activism with nuanced diplomacy to effect change.

With the proposed activities, IFRC and Red Cross Red Crescent National Societies of the CIS will engage civil society organizations and representatives of key populations to create a common platform for a professional dialogue with CIS parliamentarians, the Eurasian Economic Union, the Secretariat of the CIS, state health institutions, academic
communities, as well as mass media with the aim to develop and adopt model legislation, creating friendly  environment for people living with HIV (PLWHIV), reducing stigma and discrimination, and ensuring better access to
HIV-related services.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The proposed programme will contribute to strengthening political support among municipal level governments for effective HIV/AIDS response among the key populations in two cities in the Russian Federation and EECA region affected by HIV/AIDS, and should cater to two or more of the key populations: LGBTI, people who use drugs, and sex workers, including adolescent girls and young women. This will contribute to cities in the Russian Federation and EECA region joining the fast-track city initiative and building political support for an HIV/AIDS response focused on key populations.</narrative>

   <description>
    <narrative xml:lang="EN">For this outcome Stigma refers to both the internal stigma (self-stigma) experienced and expressed by KPs and AGYW themselves, as well as
external stigma and discrimination expressed by decision makers and those with widespread influence (government, media etc) as well as communities,
religious and traditional leaders, service providers, families etc toward KPs and AGYW. This outcome focuses on achieving changes in the beliefs, attitudes
and behaviour of those who express this external stigma and discrimination, in the hope that KPs and AGYW experience less stigma and discrimination
because of their HIV status and/or gender and sexuality over the course of PITCH. Our assumption is that as levels of external stigma reduce, incidences of
self-stigma also reduce, contributing to an increase in public demand for access to HIV-related services for KPs and AGYW.</narrative>

important that the focus of partners&apos; reporting is on explaining in what ways their capacity to document evidence has improved, and what they have done
with this evidence. This should be described and analysed by partners from the perspective of planning and implementing their advocacy. Where partners
feel that their evidence-based advocacy has contributed toward a change in policy, when reporting against the indicators below, please provide evidence
that illustrates how your advocacy contributed to this policy change.</narrative>

We are also looking for evidence of these advocacy targets amending or introducing new policies and encouraging practice and behaviour that responds to the needs and rights of KPs and AGYW. Moreover, we are looking to draw connections between the increased capacity of PITCH partners and the effective engagement of these advocacy targets.</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">This outcome is concerned with achieving a long-term increase in the influence of civil society over government policy and funding of the national HIV response and, fundamentally, a reduction in barriers faced by Key Populations and AGYW to accessing services. Through this outcome PITCH will seek to achieve increased political commitment for HIV and SRHR services that target KPs and AGYW, and to develop the capacity of PITCH country partners to hold governments to account for the implementation of policies and other political commitments at all levels. With this outcome we hope to achieve a more informed and organised movement of community-led CSOs (KPs and AGYW) working together and engaging decision/opinion/policy makers, health care providers, religious leaders etc towards improving HIV and SRHR services (including implementation &#xE2;&#x20AC;&#x201C; funding, decriminalization, promoting harm reduction) for KPs and AGYW.</narrative>

justice networks; local, district and national level authorities; and international organisations including AU, UNAIDS, Global Fund, and WHO. We are
looking to better understand how PITCH is having an impact on the ability of partners to confidently engage in dialogue and collaborate with a range of
stakeholders that have an influence over changes in policy and practice in relations to meeting the needs of KPS and AGYW. Changes in the levels of
interaction are measured through the number of meetings etc between implementing partners and the stakeholders referred to here where advocacy is
carried out. Through this outcome we also seek to understand changes in the level of capacity and confidence to advocate with country, regional and
global level advocacy targets, and the impact this has on changes in levels of engagement between PITCH partners and these same stakeholders.</narrative>
