   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Majority of the people in Dato Odahe Kebele earn low incomes from daily labor work, working as guards in the City, keeping some animals, farming, renting some rooms (in their compounds) and undertaking some petty trade. On the contrary households are big in size with many children in each family and hence large child population in the community. In Hawassa City, 682 of the  total of 41,548 people who undergone HIV testing in 2013 were found to be HIV positive, making the rate of prevalence 1.6%. Due to poor economic opportunities, inadequate HIV/AIDS prevention and impact mitigation intervention, the engagement of young girls in sex work, the vulnerability of the community at Dato Odahe Kebele is believed to be high. The Kebele is inhabited by high HIV risk groups such as daily laborers and young people who migrated from rural areas in search of job within the city of Hawassa. Many of female sex workers in the city prefer to rent residential rooms and live in Dato Odahe Kebele.  They rent rooms in group and spend the days there until they go out to the center of Hawassa city for sex work at nights. The female sex workers prefer to live in Dato Odahe where cost of house rent is relatively lower than the prices in the other parts of the city.</narrative>
