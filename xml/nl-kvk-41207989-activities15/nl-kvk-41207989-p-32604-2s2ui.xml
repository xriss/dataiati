  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">ARF operates in a complex social and epidemiological environment. As of December 2016, the number of PLHIV in Russia reached 1,114,815 (official data from the Federal AIDS Center; the real number is estimated at least twice as much). In the past few years HIV incidence has been growing at 10% per year. Unsafe injecting still fuels the epidemic (52.8% of all new cases in 2016), and heterosexual transmission is on the increase. PLHIV lack access to antiretrovirals (according to the MoH only 30% of PLHIV in need were receiving them). In spite of the grim statistics, the Russian government vigorously opposes harm reduction programs and creates obstacles to NGOs doing HIV prevention among key affected populations. Prevention was until recently almost entirely funded by international donors and the current HIV strategy accepted by the Ministry of Health does not envision harm reduction. At the end of 2017 the core funding for our harm reduction project &#x2013; the Global Fund HIV grant&#x2013; is coming to an end and no extension of it is expected (Russia is not eligible for GF HIV or TB grants anymore). This could have serious consequences for the harm reduction services we provide to PWUD on the streets of Moscow as if we will not manage to find alternative sources of funding it means a termination of our key services and losing a great number of our experienced staff. 
The funds for the legal and human rights advocacy are still sustained, but also under threat if service delivery will be interrupted or stopped.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This program will contribute to the long term goal to ensure all people who use drugs to have equal access to sexual and reproductive health services, including HIV-related services. 

To come to this, we are now at a stage that first the existing harm reduction services need to be saved, as these are threatened by the funding crisis. Financial support to sustain the services will both lead to life saving basic harm reduction services AND to resources for human rights and  legal advocacy work (as the last will be funded if the service delivery is moving on).

After years of advocacy towards the Russian authorities the assumption that the national authorities will take over the funding for the HIV prevention is proven wrong. When it comes to key populations, it has become clear that no targets are set and no budget allocations done.

That is why the role of civil society in Russia, linked to the support of the international community is now essential.

By showing the international world the real life situation in Russia on HIV, ARF with their community proposes to ally with her international partners as AFEW International and others and conduct international and regional advocacy for harm reduction.</narrative>
