   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Ethiopia has one of the largest populations of orphans in the world with nearly half of the children having lost at least one of their parents: total AIDS orphans are 792,840. In addition to this, Bole Sub city has one of the highest rates of HIV infection in Addis Ababa and despite being the central part of the city it has been lacking services available to assist children and youths affected with HIV &amp; AIDS. Fulfilling these conditions in the target area is challenging while significant segment of the population live below poverty line. In such situations, the fate of OVC is obvious; they lack parental love, which would have been very crucial for their psychosocial development. They do not have access to basic needs like food, clothing, education and shelter. Their access to health care is very limited, which already is not readily accessible to the general population. Moreover, their future is largely darkened by lack of proper education. The situation in the target areas/villages are even worse as this city is growing and there are large numbers of OVC migrating from the nearby regions. In addition to this, the high traffic movement and fast growing urbanization has exposed the target area to high HIV&amp;AIDS infection. As many studies revealed it, the number of OVC increases in areas where there is high HIV&amp;AIDS prevalence.</narrative>
