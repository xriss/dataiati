This indicator is targeting: WROs, Yellow Movement leaders and WWDs through trainings and events. 

Here youth movement participants are mainly targeted (75%) while WRO leaders (25%) are expected to be welcoming and give recognition to those gender movements in University.</narrative>

It mainly targets at increasing the self-confidence of members and an opportunity to get friends. In the sessions, women own the space without any intervention; it is chaired and managed by WWDs themselves. All openly share their experience and problems, as most of the issues are similar, they feel belongingness and safe to open up.</narrative>
