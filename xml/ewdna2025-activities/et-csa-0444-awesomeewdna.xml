      <narrative xml:lang="EN">AWESOME recognises that strengthening women&#x2019;s organisations is crucial in maintaining and widening the space for voice, visibility, advocacy and evidence about violations of women&#x2019;s rights in their regions. We also acknowledge that &#x201C;L&amp;A capacities&#x201D; is a very subjective statement in terms of both the nature and the magnitude of change. AWESOME is committed to supporting partner organisations (and our own organisation) to build their sustainability, resilience and capabilities, through feminist organisational development and exchange, and connection to a wider network of similar organisations. Because partner organisations are very different in terms of capacity, staff size, budgets and so on, we&#x2019;ve worked with partners during the inception period to understand the individual support needs from each organisation, ensuring a tailored and comprehensive approach to capacity strengthening.

 

By increased capacities we mean all types of capacity building and support offered through AWESOME (such as the FOCS funding, safeguarding training, MEL training, Disability and Inclusion training etc).

 

EWDNA is a member based organization who needs to do diverse interventions to make sure that our organizational goal is achieved and to ensure that the rights of WWDs are well recognized in Ethiopia. But its capacity to deliver in terms of finance, human resource and networking is limited. Using the organizational capacity building support in AWESOME (using FOCS resources), EWDNA would like to see:

&#x2022;         Its visibility and networking improved/increased

&#x2022;         Increase its organizational capacity to deliver through increased finance and human resource base

&#x2022;         Would like to have a digital data management system(this is already in progress with FOCS support)

&#x2022;         Organizational level M and E system in place(already in progress)

&#x2022;         Increase participation of our members in planning, implementation and monitoring and Evaluation cycles</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">EWDNA&apos;s target is to evidence increased acceptance of the stakeholders on the legal gaps in Penal Code of Ethiopia. The current penal code does not make provisions for WWDs and EWDNA will be working to get the penal code improved by ensuring it is inclusive of WWD. This will begin with identification of legal gaps in Year 2. In Year 3, EWDNA will raise stakeholders&apos; awarenes on the lgeal gaps. In Year 4, we hope to see willingness of concerned government officials to make revisions.

Penal Code: a&#xA0;code of laws concerning crimes and offenses and their punishment.
 
Acceptance of gaps means (or would look like)&#x2026; commitment of the national government, inclusion of gaps in their next annual plan is the ultimate aim, taking EWDNA&apos;s inputs as valuable will be considered as a success (if they accept Penal Code has a gap will be a milestone achivement, may not be written, might be about them giving a welcoming environment and oral discussions).

[EWDNA&apos;s work in year 2 will identify the legal gaps in the Penal Code,</narrative>

      <narrative xml:lang="EN">WWDs stated that their issues are not well addressed by the movements. Only 15% of WWDs knew the existence of any active movements for WWDs, gender equality, disability, and SGBV. 

This indicator is targeting: WROs, Yellow Movement leaders and WWDs through trainings and events. 

Here youth movement participants are mainly targeted (75%) while WRO leaders (25%) are expected to be welcoming and give recognition to those gender movements in University.</narrative>
