       <narrative xml:lang="EN">Data collection methodology has been discussed and will include focus group discussions (of 8-12 individuals each) in three main areas outside of Beirut (the north, south, and bekaa regions of Lebanon). Moreover, we reviewed possible questions to include in the data collection survey later on in the project. This will cut down the work load for later once outreach officers have been recruited. The outreach officers will be local individuals recruited from each of the designated areas, they will recruit individuals from marginalised individuals&#x2019; hot-spots in the areas in order to participate in the focus group discussions. Outreach officers must me trustworthy and known by the community in order to facilitate the smooth collection of data and must have a good command of the Arabic language. They will also help devise the discussion guide and will be trained accordingly. A training session will be given to the outreach officers prior to data collection in order to ensure proper facilitation and documentation. Also, a focus group discussion guide will be developed and tested.</narrative>

Due to government regulations following the outbreak, we continued to provide quality services while adapting to the measures. In March, we continued to support the marginalised community amid the procedures of the government and our safety protocols. We have been able to provide those services, answering inquiries and referral via the hotline, email, social media, and provision of services for urgent cases only. We have provided 462 services in the first quarter of 2020 and 262 services in the second quarter of 2020 including voluntary counselling and rapid testing, medical consultations and psycho-social counselling, for marginalised groups in Lebanon. The number of voluntary counselling and testing services stands at 434, while that of Medical Consultations provided stands at 104, and psycho-social support stands at 186.

Part of that lies, in connecting mothers of marginalised individuals whom we already know are supportive (5 moms some of which are part of an upcoming video campaign to introduce parents to the marginalised groups rights debate in Lebanon and to announce the service) so mothers and fathers with questions about their children or in need of support can find it in the closed parent meetings instead of resorting to individuals/organisations showing hostility to marginalised groups rights. A vetted psychologist will be attending each of the meetings and a manual will be produced to assist additional parents moving forward answering all major questions and offering support for parents in doubt and pain.</narrative>

We contacted the video production company and finalised the script and cast for the family outreach programs inaugural video, in addition to identifying the youth participants for the family support program. We are aiming at conducting 2 sessions per month starting September adding up to 8 sessions in 2020, whilst continuing the sessions in 2021.
