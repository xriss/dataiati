   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project aims to create and promote access to private green finance products to state and municipal governments by providing support and creating capacities to select and prepare bankable projects, matching the projects to financial services offering, developing tools for financial analysis (applicable and aligned to private banks&#x2019; and financial institutions&#x2019; evaluation activities) including environmental and social indicators, and developing dissemination material of successful cases, lessons learned on overcoming barriers and measuring sustainable growth (triple bottom line) to share to as many cities as possible in Mexico.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Our contribution has supported 10 low-carbon projects to identify direct or indirect private investment (through innovative business models) and &quot;prepare&quot; these projects to access or unlock the sources of funding. Of the 10 projects, 2 are at bank&apos;s pipeline, 3 have secured public investment (seed capital) and others are underway. Ten different financing mechanisms have been explored and documented. 

We created capacities through different activities: 1) during one-to-one technical assistance to project&#x2019;s promoters, 2) an open series of webinars, available to beneficiary cities and interested stakeholders, on identification and technical preparation of climate action projects in 4 urban focus areas (mobility, renewable energy and efficiency, water and waste management), and 3) A mission to London about public green finance. Thus, we have reached over 100 people out of which 65 are public servants from many different cities including all four beneficiary cities and Mexico City (Women 48%, Men 52%).

IDOM developed a tailored methodology to assess, and prepare bankable initiatives in different Mexican municipalities, together with complementary tools and templates, all distributed to direct beneficiaries and available for public access online to any interested party.</narrative>
