       <narrative xml:lang="EN">Trainer assessment: Indicator 1: Participants were selected by UNDP and ranged from various countries and experience levels. Some had many years of experience as a mediator while others only recently started their work in mediation and had no (academic) background in conflict resolution. For other trainings it is recommend that clearer selection criteria and a more effective process in selecting participants is needed.</narrative>
