A Post-Investment Shareholding structure, in which IFC is considering an equity and loan investment, is anticipated to consist of Drobe Management, composed of current and former employees; Alliance ScanEast Fund LP, a US-chartered private equity fund headquartered in Helsinki, Finland, focusing on direct investments in Central and Eastern Europe; and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD). The size of each stake is still to be determined.    Project Cost Including proposed IFC investment    The total estimated project cost is US$23.5 million of which    IFC is considering an equity and loan investment of up to US$6 million in total.    Location of project and Description of site   	   The project company currently has four separate units: (i) a spinning and yarn twisting mill 6 km from Kaunas (25,000 spindles); (ii) a second spinning mill in Vieciunai, 120 km from Kaunas (17,000 spindles); (iii) a weaving mill in Silute, about 180 km from Kaunas (90 looms); and (iv) a weaving and finishing unit in Kaunas (230 looms).  The consolidation will close the spinning mill 6 km from Kaunas and relocate all yarn production and dyeing operations to Vieciunai; the Silute weaving mill will be closed, and all weaving and finishing operations relocated to Kaunas.   	   Description of Company and Purpose of Project    Drobe produces wool-based worsted woven fabrics for tailored suits and other menswear.
