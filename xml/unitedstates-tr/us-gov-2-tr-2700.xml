    <narrative xml:lang="EN">Situated at the crossroads of Europe, the Middle East, and the Caucasus, Turkey is a vital partner for the United States. Turkey is a key North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) ally participating in a range of NATO operations in Afghanistan, the Balkans, the Black Sea, the eastern Mediterranean, and off the Horn of Africa. Turkey is also a close partner in contributing to U.S. national security interests in the Levant and across the broader Middle East. Bilateral military-to-military relations between the United States and Turkey remain strong, and are a key pillar of the U.S.-Turkey bilateral relationship. For example, the International Military Education and Training (IMET) program in Turkey, currently the third-largest bilateral IMET allocation globally, plays a major role in ensuring strong cooperation and interoperability between U.S. and Turkish armed forces. The Government of Turkey (GOT) provides funding for travel and expenses to allow as many Turkish participants as possible to benefit from training at U.S. institutions. Due to the deteriorating situation in Syria and instability in Iraq, Turkey hosts more than 2.5 million refugees from Syria and over 200,000 from Iraq, and bears the commensurate security risks, making cooperation with the GOT on nonproliferation and border security issues of paramount importance. Turkey also remains a transit point of interest to traffickers of nuclear materials and weapons-of-mass-destruction (WMD)-related items, underscoring the need for training in the detection of illicit weapons, improved licensing procedures, and enhanced border controls. U.S. assistance will advance defense reform, build capacity, and strengthen partnerships in the region to more effectively counter Russian aggression and other emerging threats.</narrative>
