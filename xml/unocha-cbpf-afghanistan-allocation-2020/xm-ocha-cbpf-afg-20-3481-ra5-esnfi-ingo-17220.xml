  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In accordance with the AHF Reserve Allocation Strategy of 2020, the HRP 2018-2021 Strategic Objective 1 - ESampNFI Outcome 1.6) necessary ES/NFI assistance is provided to affected communities and people in a timely manner Cluster priorities, HNO and the Joint Winterization Strategic Objective: Save lives in the areas of highest need through rapid provision of a winter response package of relief items and services. The proposed response is designed based on gaps and needs identified by the ESNFI cluster and confirmed by recent assessments (Annex A).

Kapisa as compared to Kabul, is located on a little more height above the sea level and hence it is cold in winter and if frequently affected by natural disasters (flash floods). The Province has Parwan province has dry and cold climate and is hot and dry while winter is extremely cold with midwinter temperature is as low as -20 &#xB0;C. Variation in temperature during the day may range from freezing condition at dawn to the upper 12 &#xB0;C at noon in winter season. The weather during the winter months (November through February) is very cold to freezing in both the provinces and Northerly winds usually bringing blizzards, freezing rain, lashing winds and blankets of snow and hence snowfalls are fairly frequent and heavy. Both Provinces had been recently hit hard by Natural disasters, heavy rain and floods destroying 390 houses and 483 severely damaged and effecting more than 500 families. 

DAARTT through the proposed action will respond to the needs and gaps of 3400 families (23,800 individuals) in the priority provinces Kapisa and Parwan, identified under category 1 by the ES/NFI. DAARTT will make sure to meet the mentioned needs through heating and fuel assistance in cash, and winter clothes in-kind which both are in line with (ES/NFI) cluster strategy under 5th reserve 2020. Combined packages of winter clothing assistance (in-kind) and heating support (in-cash) will be provided to the households that meets the criteria for all the packages and household that do not meet the criteria for all packages will receive only the relevant assistance. The proposed project will target vulnerable host communities in Parwan and Kapisa Provinces for winterization support through a standard package for heating/ fuel and clothing that meet cluster specifications, for affected households.

DAARTT will closely coordinate with regional ESampNFI cluster, UNOCHA and other partners for the identification of target communities and groups to avoid duplication. They will establish a Beneficiary Selection Committees (BSC) that will conduct a door to door assessment using the winterization assessment tool and select the beneficiaries based on the cluster criteria. Cash will be distributed to beneficiaries through mobile money or Hawalla in both Parwan and Kapisa Provinces. Pre-distribution monitoring will be conducted as an extra verification to ensure eligibility of the beneficiaries. Selected beneficiaries will receive a token, and will be fully informed about the assistance (amount), their rights and how to access the complaint amp feedback systems, in coordination with Awaaz. 1200 of families (660 in Parwan and 540 in Kapisa) selected will be receiving (cash) for heating (200$) in one-off installment, while 2200 families (1210 in Parwan and 990 in Kapisa) will receive warm winter clothing in kind, in accordance to ESampNFI cluster standards. Data from market assessment confirms that the markets have been badly damaged and in addition, DAARTT team also conducted a market assessment during the month of September 2020, according to the assessment it has been found out that the markets are functional and available for fuel and heating materials, however, the winter clothes are available at the provincial level but there are some quality and quantity issues and are available in a very small amount and not with a standard quality.</narrative>
