   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Shelter Upgrade or Repair, Transitional Shelter, and Latrine Construction for Conflict-affected Families in Northeastern Afghanistan</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In Northeastern Afghanistan, the scale and complexity of emergency and transitional shelter needs remain high, with a large majority (72%) of displaced families reporting critical shelter needs (WoA). In 2019, Takhar and Badakhshan&#x2014;the proposed provinces of Concern&#x2019;s intervention&#x2014;witnessed over 113,900 newly displaced people and a further 68,700 cross-border returnees from Iran and Pakistan, many of whom lost vital remittances to support their families and remain vulnerable to escalating humanitarian needs (UNOCHA 2019). At the national level, 80% of displaced families residing in damaged shelter are unable to make repairs&#x2015;the primary reason being an inability to afford materials and/or labor (WoA). With 20% of families living in poor shelters, 2% living in unsafe shelters, 49% reporting damages, and a further 66% unable to make shelter repairs&#x2015;Badakhshan has been identified among five of the highest priority provinces with shelter needs (WoA). Overlapping sectoral needs are greatest among shock-affected families in Takhar, with Badakhshan among the main province of origin and displacement for conflict-affected communities (HNO). As conflict and disaster are the drivers of poor access to basic WASH services, Takhar is facing an especially high degree of WASH needs, particularly among protracted IDPs and acutely vulnerable people who have been affected by past shocks (HNO). Despite a worsening situation, the Northeast Region has witnessed a decrease in partners since 2018, with remaining humanitarian actors voicing a lack of resources to meet the escalating shelter needs of shock-affected populations.
 Considering the rapid deterioration of the Northeast Region in 2019, Badakhshan and Takhar continue to exhibit acute shelter needs and serious access challenges, particularly relevant to this allocation. Building on technical experience, our strong operational presence in the region, combined with clear needs and gaps outlined by quality assessment reports, Concern Worldwide is proposing a targeted multi-sectoral response entailing Shelter Upgrade or Repair and the construction of transitional shelter and latrines to contribute to the security, safety, health, and well-being of 373 of the most vulnerable families in the Northeast Region. Specifically, Concern is proposing the following interventions:

&#x2015;Support 231 at-risk families in Jorm of Badakhshan, and Taloqan and Khwaja Ghar of Takhar, whose houses have been identified as partially damaged due to conflict, through the distribution of in-kind Shelter Repair Toolkits ($50 value) coupled with Shelter Upgrade/Repair cash assistance ($300 via two instalments).

&#x2015;Facilitate the construction of transitional shelter and gender-appropriate latrines as an integrated, multi-sector package for 142 families in Jorm and Warduj districts of Badakhshan and Taloqan and Eshkamish districts of Takhar, whose shelters have been identified as completely destroyed by conflict. Transitional shelter support serves as an intermediate housing solution and will be dispersed in four cash instalments (totaling $1,250). In complementarity of the first distribution, families will receive a standard cash package ($225) for the construction of latrines with hygiene and sanitation sensitization. 

Project engineers will be responsible in leading the technical inspection of the damaged or destroyed shelters, and will develop family implementation plans with BoQs and clearly defined milestones for each cash instalment. Regular onsite monitoring will be conducted to ensure the appropriateness of cash expenditures, the quality of work being done, and that all construction or repairs align with the standards and specifications of the ES/NFI Clusters. The project demonstrates a multi-sector response, recognizing the significant overlap between shelter and WASH needs while contributing to a more durable shelter solution.</narrative>
