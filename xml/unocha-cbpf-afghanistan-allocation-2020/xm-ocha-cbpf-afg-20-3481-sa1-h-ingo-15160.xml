  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">According to the Afghanistan HNO 2020, conflict denies people access to vital medical treatment by interrupting services where they do exist and preventing a scale-up of services in new areas. In the first eleven months of 2019, approximately 24,000 hours of healthcare delivery were lost, and 41,000 consultations missed due to the forced closure and destruction of health facilities as attacks against health workers and medical assets increased in frequency and severity. Ongoing conflict continues to hamper maternal and child health service delivery, particularly in rural areas where some Seventy-five per cent of women live. Thirty-four per cent of shock-affected households reported that they did not have access to a health center in or in proximity to their village in the three months prior to data collection for the WOA Assessment. According the Afghanistan DHS, the 2015 the infant mortality rate declined from 66 deaths per live births in 2005 to 45 deaths per 1000 live births, under five mortality rate dropped from 257 to 55 per 1000 live births, skilled birth attendance has increased from 14% in 2003 to 40% today, and maternal deaths reduced to 396 per 100,000 live births. 
In the most recent 2015 Afghanistan Demographic Health Survey, the maternal mortality ratio estimate increased drastically to 1,291 per 100,000 live births. This worsening indicator serves as an alert for poor maternal and child health outcomes. The increase in maternal mortality has occurred amidst increasing insecurity since 2010. Pregnancy-related causes remain the leading risk of death for women in their childbearing years (41%), hemorrhage is the leading cause of maternal deaths (56%), followed by eclampsia (20%), obstructed labour (11%), sepsis and infections (5%). Infectious diseases such as diarrhea (16%), pneumonia (25%) and measles (2%) account for almost half (43%) of deaths among children under 5 years of age. In order to ensure that lives are saved in the areas of highest need, World Vision Afghanistan (WVA) is proposing to provide life-saving Health assistance to target communities in Bala Murghab and Jawand districts of Badghis as well as target communities in Gulran and Pashtun Zarghun of Herat province including the IDPs who are living in Herat District (HRP Priority Districts). There is a significant need for the provision of emergency health services in these locations, which are frequently impacted by conflict and natural disasters and are currently under-served by humanitarian actors. Therefore, the proposed intervention will focus on the provision of health services in hard to reach areas through establishing four Mobile Health Teams (MHT). The MHT is in composition of 1 medical doctor, 1 midwife, 1 nurse, 1 vaccinator and 1 community health educator. The MHT provides primary lifesaving health services for the general population reproductive, maternal, new born and child health services for women of child bearing age newborn babies, immunization and nutrition services for children under five, the project focus on provision of mental health and psychosocial counseling and referral for those who need secondary and tertiary health services, the project will cover the cost of severely ill clients who will be referred to the services referenced. The MHT schedule will be developed and approved in a joint effort between WVA, Department of Public Health (DoPH), Basic Package of Heathcare Services (BPHS) implementing partners and other agencies engaged in health inactivates in the targeted districts.</narrative>
