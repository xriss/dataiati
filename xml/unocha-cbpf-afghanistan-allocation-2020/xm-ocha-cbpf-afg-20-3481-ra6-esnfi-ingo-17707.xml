   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Winterization Assistance for conflict, natural disaster-affected vulnerable families in Kapisa, Parwan and Faryab provinces.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Afghanistan still remains one of the world&#x2019;s most complex humanitarian emergencies, driven by escalating conflict and natural disasters. These shocks and disruptions have depleted the resilience of displaced, host, and natural disaster affected populations. This vulnerability is further exasperated by the harsh winter conditions in Afghanistan, where monthly temperatures can reach as low as -12.1 degrees centigrade including widespread food insecurity, and a multitude of pre-existing needs, households remain unprotected and unprepared for the upcoming winter season. The project target districts - Nejrab and Tagab of Kapisa, Shinwari, Koh e Safi and Gorband of Parwan and the Centre and rural areas of Maimana and Pashtunkot districts of Faryab Provinces &#x2013; were identified based severe winterization needs attributed to critical climatic conditions (altitude, temperature, and weather), remoteness and associated lack of humanitarian assistance, and exposure to shocks. 

Given sustained levels of conflict and displacements, the potential for further natural disasters, and the resulting vulnerability of affected populations, given its altitude and population in need, Kapisa, Parwan and Faryab were prioritized and categorized among the provinces with the highest need consideration during winter. Kapisa as compared to Kabul, is located on a little more height above the sea level and hence it is cold in winter and if frequently affected by natural disasters (flash floods). Parwan has dry and cold climate and is hot and dry while winter is extremely cold with midwinter temperature is as low as -20 &#xB0;C. Variation in temperature during the day may range from freezing condition at dawn to the upper 12 &#xB0;C at noon in winter season. Faryab have been a living place for thousands of IDPs and returnees. According to the ESNFI target 2020 sheet, the winter temperature in Parwan reaches to -6.1 C Kapisa -5.4 C and Faryab -2 C and even lower and a total of 207,251 people in Faryab, 48,711 in Kapisa and 85,156 in Parwan are in need of emergency assistance. 

In line with ES/NFI Cluster priorities as detailed in the Joint Winterization Strategy, DARRTT through this action will provide assistance to 3,148 vulnerable households (22,036 individuals) in the target areas of Parwan, Kapisa and Faryab Provinces with a standard winterization assistance packages (fuel/heating materials and winter warm clothes). While this support is intended to be distributed jointly, households that do not meet the criteria for all two packages will only receive the relevant assistance. A beneficiary selection and distribution committee will be established which will include representatives from local communities (e.g. CDC heads), Government departments (e.g. ANDMA, ARCS and DoRR) and DAARTT staff. Beneficiaries will be selected according to ESNFI vulnerability criteria to ensure the poorest and most vulnerable are targeted, including displaced people, women-headed households, widows, orphaned families, elderly, people with a disability and families with a large number of dependent children.

800 families (400 in Parwan and 400 in Kapisa) selected will be receiving combined packaged of (cash) for fuel/heating (200$) in one-off installment through mHawalla or M-Paisa or Local Saraf, and winter clothing in kind, while 2,348 families in Faryab that will be supported by DAARTT&#x2019;s other humanitarian projects through Multi-purpose case (MPC) will only receive warm winter clothing in kind, in accordance to ESampNFI cluster standards.   In addition, DAARTT team also conducted a market assessment during the month of September 2020, according to the assessment it has been found out that the markets are functional and available for fuel and heating materials, however, the winter clothes are available at the provincial level but there are some quality and quantity issues and are available in a very small amount and not with a standard quality.</narrative>
