   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Winterization Assistance to the Vulnerable Families in Central Highland Bamyan Province of Afghanistan</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Afghanistan remains one of the world&#x2019;s most complex humanitarian emergencies, driven by escalating conflict and natural disasters. Each year, freezing winter temperatures, especially in high altitude locations drive the need for the provision of life-saving winter assistance as the majority of the affected persons do not have the financial capability to purchase fuel and heaters to supplement their heating requirements.

To reach the most vulnerable families, IRW has designed the lifesaving proposed project, which will be implemented in Bamyan center, Kahmard, Panjab, Saighan, Shibar, Waras, Yakawlang-1 districts of Bamyan province. The proposed location for the winterization intervention is because of the vulnerability of the area to extreme winter conditions (temperature goes down to -12 degrees celsius) from November to March every year. The local economy is also very weak because of remoteness and the short crop season. Poor people cannot afford heating during the winter season while income goes down and family expenditure increases. These poor households need external assistance to survive during the winter seasons. The proposed project aims to ensure that 1,000 poorest and vulnerable households, 7,000 individuals (Men-1330, Women-1330, Boys-2,240, and girls-2,100) are protected from harsh winter conditions through winterization assistance. The project will follow both the voucher and the in-kind distribution modalities. To holistically address multiple needs and reduce the incentive to sell-off winterization assistance to purchase other needs, IRW, according to the joint winterization strategy, will make sure to use complimentary response strategy and provide a combined package of heating support and in-kind assistance to the same beneficiaries. The project will provide vouchers to 1,000 households to cover the fuel cost of heating for their home, besides among them a total of 600 families who are large in number, have children and PLWs and are lacking blankets will be provided with standard winter blankets, and 400 who have low income and are the poorest families will receive winter clothing. These families will be selected based on the pre-defined set of criteria for each of the packages. IRW will pay greater attention to the direct involvement of all sections of the target population (women, girls, men, boys, people with disabilities, and the elderly) through a participatory and inclusive approach. Winter clothing kit and standard blankets will be provided by in-kind distribution and fuel for heating will be provided by vouchers through local vendors. Specific vendors will be contacted at the district level to distribute/provide the heating materials to the selected beneficiaries. Each of the beneficiary households will receive 06 vouchers ($40*5+60$=$260) for covering heating fuel. All vouchers will be distributed to the beneficiary in one installment. The vouchers will have a four months period of validity. The beneficiaries will have the choice to collect the fuel and heating materials from the selected vendor at a time or more than one time, based on their convenience. The project will reimburse the voucher amount to the vendors after verification.

The poorest and most vulnerable households will be selected as beneficiary households. Preference will be given to households as per criteria women-headed households, widows, orphaned families, elderly, people with a disability. 

IRW will ensure that a complaints response mechanism is fully functional. IRW will closely work with the ESNFI cluster, relevant government directorates, and local authorities to implement the project effectively and on time. IRW will also follow the &#x201C;Do No Harm&#x201D; principle that guides to ensure beneficiaries&#x2019; security and safety.</narrative>
