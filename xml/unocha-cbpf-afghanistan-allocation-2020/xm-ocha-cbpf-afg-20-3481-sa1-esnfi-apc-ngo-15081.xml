  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The HRP 2018-2021 targeted planned people to reach in 2020 for all clusters is 7.1 million in which 1.1 million for shelter cluster. From 1.1 million people in need (IDPs, returnees, non-displaced shock affected and vulnerable people) for different responses Transitional shelter support (two-room shelter), Transitional shelter support (shelter Improvement/ upgrade), NFI, Emergency shelter (tent amp two tarpaulins), Cash for rent, Winterisation assistance and Shelter repair and reconstruction assistance. Total 55,072 people is in dire need of Transitional shelter support. As per the cluster prioritize provinces and districts located either from the 1) Eastern Region (Nangarhar) 2) South Region (Zabul and Uruzgan), North Eastern Region (Kunduz, Badakhshan and Takhar) and North region (Jawazjan) for the 1st Standard Allocation 2020. 
The current needs in North Eastern Region is very high due to the onset conflict between government forces and NSAGs as many harsh clashes happened during the 2019 in Kunduz and most of the Kunduz city residents evacuated and their houses were severely damaged and the insurgents approached to the vicinity of Kunduz capital. Many families displaced from their origin or destroyed their shelters now they are in dire need to construct transitional shelters for them. Most IDPs and non-displaced families who have been affected by conflict and damaged shelters families are residing in poor transitional shelter, makeshifts and overcrowded shelters. Majority of the families are unable to construct and repair their damaged shelters due to high cost and their low economic status. Besides the transitional shelter, Mine Action (MA) Mine Risk Education (MRE) is a high need of targeted beneficiaries especially children. The Explosive Ordinance (EXO) and Explosive Remnants of War (ERW) victims were children, with ERW is the leading cause of all child casualties from conflict. Furthermore, the impact of explosive ordnance not just the death and injury, shock-affected households reporting the presence of explosive ordnance imposed them to move or relocate and have also psychological and social and economic impacts. ORD will implement the transitional shelter construction and MRE in close coordination with UNMAS in order to obtain confirmation of land for shelter construction and well deliver the MRE component to beneficiaries.
ORD will ensure that the most vulnerable people in need among affected population group prioritized for the transitional shelter interventions and use the specific vulnerability criteria for identifying the extremely vulnerable among the affected population that include female-headed household child-headed household disabled headed household elderly headed household very large family (8 members or more) very poor families families with chronically-ill members or having other pressing vulnerability. These criteria are adopted by the ES/NFI cluster and to a large extent are in line with vulnerabilities endorsed by other clusters in Afghanistan.
ORD has been working in North-eastern Region since 2018 and constructed many transitional shelters in the region especially in Kunduz province and will scale up the response through this allocation for construction of 150 transitional shelters (Two rooms) for 150 families (1,050 individuals) which is in dire need of transitional shelter and Mine Risk Education (MRE). ORD has been conducted market assessment survey in Kunduz province and recommended to deliver this response in kind due to the lack of shelter materials availability in the local market and as well the human capacity of beneficiaries to purchase and transport shelters materials to the project site on time especially female, and disabled headed HHs. Just labour wages will be distributed in cash through HAWALA system which is the safer system and the money transfer and distribution for labor in site is the responsibility of money dealer each transfer value for wages will be around $5,000.</narrative>
