   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Sustaining Competitive and Responsible Enterprises (SCORE) is a practical training and workplace improvement programme to increase the productivity of small to medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) while promoting respect for workers&#x2019; rights and improving their working conditions in the work places. The programme demonstrates best international practice in manufacturing and service sectors and helps SMEs to participate in global supply chains. The programme consists of in-class trainings and in-factory consultancies on specific subjects such as work place cooperation, quality management, human resources management, occupational health and safety as well as energy efficiency. The Pilot Implementation of the SCORE Programme was initiated in Turkey with the aim of supporting the SMEs in their efforts to improve their productivity and contributing to the improvements on the working conditions of the workers in their workplaces. The Project has a region and sector focus that the targeted enterprises are from selected manufacturing sectors such as metal processing, automobile sub-industry, textile and garment. Furthermore, the pilot implementation focuses on creation of the local capacities and resources for conducting SCORE Programme with the national and local capacities. This is done through training of trainers, development and adaptation of training materials in Turkish, resource mobilization and promotion activities and establishment of partnerships at the national level. The main project partners are the employers&#x2019; organizations, chambers of commerce and industries as well as the international brands operating in Turkey. The ILO cooperates with the international brands namely INDITEX and H&amp;M to extend the SCORE Programme in their selected supplier SMEs operating in Turkey in garment and textile sector. This cooperation includes introducing the SCORE to the SMEs through these international brands, financial contribution for the implementation of the programme as well as monitoring and assessing the results of the implementation in the participating enterprises.</narrative>
