  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Executive Summary: This project builds on the GoSL approach on youth employment generation through its pro-poor growth strategy in the PRSP and it anchors on the UN Joint Vision for Sierra Leone. It responds to the Government&#x2019;s call for employment creation for youth as means for consolidation of peace and security in Sierra Leone. It forms a core component of UNJV Programme 19-Youth Development and Employment in that it links access to employment, markets and social services for young people. The Quick Impact Employment Intensive Project (QEIP) will provide rapid employment opportunities for youth and income generating activities for youth while strengthening the capacities of local governments and MDAs to facilitate job creation at the local levels. The Project will work in close collaboration with other initiatives by UN agencies and development partners in Bombali District. The Project will serve as an ILO-led pilot and it is expected that, once proven, this approach will be institutionalised by the Government and participating national institutions. The Project will combine up-streaming - policy and planning capacity building of SLRA and small/ medium private sector, and down-streaming &#x2013; programmatic interventions that directly create employment. Feeder roads will be selected on identification where development is constrained by lack of infrastructure and where related agriculture interventions are being carried out. This project will focus on the capacity of small-medium scale private contractors to carry out rehabilitation and maintenance of rural roads. Staff from SLRA will be trained in technical, administrative and financial aspects of road rehabilitation and maintenance. This project will thus guarantee the existence of institutional capacity for any future expansion to other districts. The training strategy will draw heavily on the experience of SLRA and successful ILO supported projects in Africa (e.g. Ghana and Liberia). The project is designed as stage one of a three year programme of employment creation and institutional strengthening.</narrative>
