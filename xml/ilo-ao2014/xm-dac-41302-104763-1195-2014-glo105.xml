   <narrative xml:lang="EN">On 20 March 2014, during the 320th session of its Governing Body (GB), the ILO organised a high-level panel on decent work in fragile states &#x2013; a joint event with the permanent representatives of New Zealand and Timor-Leste. The event was very successful and the high-profile panellists attracted a large audience from the UN system, permanent missions, academia and wider civil society. The event concluded with the signing of a cooperation agreement between the ILO and the g7+ Secretariat (the ILO is the first UN agency to sign such an agreement with the g7+). On the same day the GB deliberated on the ILO&#x2019;s current and prospective role in assisting countries in fragile situations in their pursuit of socio-economic development. The discussions covered both operational and conceptual issues regarding the organisation&#x2019;s involvement in fragile states and were based around a background paper that was prepared specifically for that purpose, and which included an analysis of over 150 technical cooperation projects and provided recommendations for the ILO&#x2019;s future involvement. These recommendations were subsequently endorsed (in document GB.320/POL/9), and the ILO has now been tasked to prepare a comprehensive strategy to expand the organisation&#x2019;s involvement in fragile states. In light of the adopted GB paper, the ILO&#x2019;s Fragile States and Disaster Response Group (FSDR) has decided to establish a joint initiative with the Graduate Institute&#x2019;s Centre on Conflict, Development and Peacebuilding (CCDP) in order to generate a labour/employment-related concept of fragility to guide the organisation&#x2019;s prospective engagement in fragile situations.</narrative>
