  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Zambia Green Jobs Programme is based on a Human (and Environment) Rights-based approach to improved livelihoods through Private Sector Development. It seeks to unlock the job creation potential of the rapidly growing building construction sector in Zambia and has a competitive focus on the value chain for green building goods and services, from local production of environmentally friendly building materials through to more energy efficient building design. The Programme intends to create at least 5,000 decent green jobs particularly for young people, improve the quality of at least 2,000 jobs in MSMEs which in turn will improve the incomes and livelihoods of at least 8,000 households that depend on the building construction sector. At the same time, the UN Green Jobs Programme will promote better adherence to occupational safety and health regulations as well as access to better managed and more gender equitable basic social security benefits to motivate and enhance employee productivity. The programme will make a direct contribution to the conservation and improvement of environmental quality in Zambia, measured in terms of the number of newly erected buildings or retrofitted existing homes utilizing green building materials including sustainably produced timber as well as a comparative reduction in water and energy utility bills during occupation. The Programme forms part of the UN response through the United Nations Development and Assistance Framework, in line with the aspirations of Zambians as a self-starter country for &#x201C;Delivering as One&#x201D;. It contributes to Zambia&#x2019;s Vision 2030, Sixth National Development Plan (SNDP), National Employment Policy (NEP), Decent Work Country Programme (DWCP), Micro, Small and Medium Enterprise (MSME) Development Policy, as well as the sectoral private sector and financial sector reform programmes funded by Finland and other Cooperating Partners.</narrative>
