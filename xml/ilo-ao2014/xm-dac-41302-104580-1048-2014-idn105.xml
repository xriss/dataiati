  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project aims at improving access to employment for women with disabilities in the garment sector by providing vocational training to especially women with disabilities in collaboration with the International Garment Centre (IGTC). For the admission to the trainings, the junior high school trainees&#x2019; selection criteria will be developed in consultation with the expert who will advise the training centre. The IGTC will collaborate with the garment sector (BWI factories), as well as disabled people&#x2019;s organizations in disseminating the information on the training possibilities for this project. The IGTC is a vocational garment training centre, which has been established to fulfil requirements of the garment industry by providing productive and effective training by highly qualified staff. It collaborates with Vocational Schools all over Java Island and provides teachers&#x2019; training with the support of the Ministry of national Education. The project will operate through the BWI project, in collaboration with the MAMPU project, and with technical support from PROPEL Indonesia and the ILO Disability Team based in Geneva. It will focus on piloting the training programme with the IGTC. The ILO has had good experiences and outcomes of the collaboration with IGTC previously. Since 2001, IGTC educates highly skilled workers for the garment industry, and is focusing on teaching practical and technical skills supplemented by general knowledge such as life skills. Throughout the training programme, the employers (chosen BWI factories to be part of the pilot) will be engaged and included in the process. The aim will be for the trainees to be placed in the pilot BWI factories for employment.</narrative>
