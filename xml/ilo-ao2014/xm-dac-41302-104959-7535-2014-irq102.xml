  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The KRG 2020 vision set four strategic pillars, these are :People,infrastructure,economy and governance.The &#x2013;Programme will contribute to two priority areas,i.e. people and economy as it empowers the Kurdistan youth socially and economically and support the development of the private sector through provision of skilled labour force. Also the Kurdistan Regional Development Strategy indicated the unemployment phenomena among the adult in Kurdistan as the most serious concerns of the regional government. It also refer to high rate of unemployment among the youth .The disadvantaged youth ( un-educated, un-skilled and youth with disabilities) face more difficulties in securing decent jobs which creates serious problems in the local communities especially most of the dis-advantaged youth are not active in their communities because they do not have the right skills in community leadership and civic engagement. The project is addressing the above mentioned issues,i.e the high rate of unemployment among the dis-advantaged youth and their weak participation in the social and political lives of their local communities through equipping them with market oriented technical skills, business skills and employment services to empower them economically in addition to develop their life skills and community leadership to strengthen their community en-gagement. The Programme will build on the government plans through introducing new programmes to enhance the social and economical participation of the dis-advantaged young girls and boys.ILO and UNFPA will support the Ministry Of Labour and Social Affairs(MOLSA) to lead the intervention to achieve the above goals with the support of ILO and UNFPA in addition to Ministry Of Culture and Youth(MOCY) and local NGOs. The Joint Program pursues the individual, economic and social empowerment of the most vulnerable/dis-advantaged youth in Kurdistan three governorates,Erbil,Soulymania and Duhok. The rationale behind this ap-proach is that through the further development of vocational and business skills, and where relevant, civic en-gagement and life skills training, disadvantaged youth will be empowered to take part actively in the labour market through entrepreneurship or job placement. In this way, they improve in a meaningful way their own ability to provide for their families, are empowered to make independent choices, and increase their social standing as participants in the market and as role models for their communities.</narrative>
