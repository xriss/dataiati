  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The ILO and the FTA wish to enter into a public private partnership (PPP) collaboration to support SMEs in China, which, currently, or in the future will, participate in the supply chains of BSCI participating companies, to grow and create more and better jobs by becoming more sustainable through being cleaner, more productive and competitve. In this context, the project aims at providing specific and customized support to help managers and workers in increasing productivity and quality, as as a healthier workplace and secure employment for the workers involved. This public private partnership between ILO and the FTA is based on the larger recognition that supplier capacity development efforts musz go beyond the first tier of the supply chain and engage with small and medium enterprises (SMEs) with approximately 50-250 employees, including exporters and subcontractors in industries with high job creation potential and significant decent work deficits, to help capacitate them to implement better working conditions and environmental compliance. Buyers also benefit from stronger confidence in supply chain compliance, stronger relations with suppliers, and reduced risk of supply chain disruption. More specifically, the objectives of this PPP are: 1. To strengthen coordinating institutions and local service providers (in China, the China Enterprise Confederation, other business industry organization and the local training consultants) so they can become independent providers offereing enterprise upgrading services. 2. To develop and demonstract growing demand for business training services among SMEs that can be encouraged by internationally active companies. 3. These internationally active companies request enterprises in their supply chains to upgrade their quality, productivity, environmental and social performance in response to development goal and decent work agenda. 4. To demonstrate SCORE training services can build capacity among SME suppliers to improve their productivity, competitiveness and sustainability. Expected results: 1. ILO SCORE will continue to organize and conduct Training of Trainers (Tot) courses, refresher Tot courses and certify SCORE trainers under the standard SCORE trainer certification criteria to ensure that high quality SCORE training is delivered to participating factories. 2. ILO SCORE will enter into implementation agreements with appropriate local industry associations, who will act as the coordinating organization and service provider, and develop a sustainable strategy to independently deliver enterprise upgrading services and organize cluster action in colloaboration with the local cluster stakeholders. 3. This PPP will assist the ILO SCORE project to move toward a sustainable financing model independent of donor support, for SCORE training in China though engagement with the private sector. 4. FTA and ILO promote SCORE training services to SMEs in China, thereby scalling the effort to capacitate SMEs to be cleaner, more productive and competitive and provide more sustainable and decent employment.</narrative>
