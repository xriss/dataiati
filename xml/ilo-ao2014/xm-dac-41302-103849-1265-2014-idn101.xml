   <narrative xml:lang="EN">PROMOTE: Decent Work for Domestic Workers to End Child Domestic Work</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The PROMOTE project implements a unique strategy to affect lasting change to end child labor in the domestic work (DW) sector. The project will concentrate its efforts in building the capacities of national organizations in Indonesia, specifically the National Network for Domestic Workers Advocacy in Indonesia (JALA PRT), Action Committee for Protection of Domestic Workers and Migrant Workers (KAPPRT &amp; BM), the Network of Indonesian Child Labor NGOs (JARAK) and will also work with the International Domestic Workers Network (IDWN). The project will be implemented for a period of 42 months, starting 31 December 2012 &#x2013; 30 June 2016 with a funding from USDOL in an amount of USD 4,999,970. The project has five focus areas as follows: i) expanding legal protection to child and adult domestic workers; ii) broadening the outreach and responsiveness of domestic worker organizations at the national and regional levels to tackle the complex phenomenon of child domestic work and decent work deficits in the domestic work sector through targeted capacity building; iii) promoting in-country and regional knowledge sharing; iv) breaking new ground in raising awareness using non-traditional media and innovative partnerships; and, v) ensuring analysis and documentation of outcomes as well as transparency and accountability which are key tenets of this work. Building on Indonesia&#x2019;s expressed national commitment and a decade of pioneering work in this area, The project key strategies are: a) Promote the ratification of ILO Convention 189 on decent work for domestic workers in Indonesia; b) Promote the adoption of a national Bill on Domestic Work through technical support, making full use of the ILO&#x2019;s contacts with key ministries, and other key stakeholders; c) Promote the adoption of provincial and district regulations providing specific protection for 15-17 year old child domestic workers; d) Promote strategic partnerships involving international groupings such as the IDWN and Anti-Slavery International in strengthening the capacity of at least three burgeoning Indonesian domestic worker organizations; e) Build capacity on rights awareness and self-empowerment of domestic workers through collective action reaching at least 20,000 domestic workers during the life of the project; f) Promote a major national awareness raising campaign involving domestic worker organizations, traditional media, using information communication technologies, and innovative partners; g) Foster learning and catalyze sustained action across Asia on decent work for domestic workers through the production of two major regional and in-country training and knowledge sharing tools and regional knowledge sharing workshops; and h) Conduct research including analytical research on domestic workers&#x2019; working conditions and wages, development of monitoring tools for domestic workers to assess their working and living conditions, and a methodology to generate new estimates of the number of child and adult domestic workers in this &#x201C;hidden&#x201D; sector, upon which to frame sound policy, law, advocacy and action.</narrative>
