   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Typhoon Pablo (international name Bopha) is the second strong typhoon that hit Mindanao in the recent year. The typhoon barreled through eastern Mindanao provinces in the early hours of Tuesday, December 4, 2012 and brought death and destruction to areas that never before experienced calamities of such magnitude. The hardest hit provinces are Compostela Valley, Surigao del Sur and Davao Oriental. Survivors tell how powerful winds and raging floodwaters caused landslides that blocked waterways, eventually releasing huge volumes of water and mud destroying everything in its path. The ILO has developed and applied a crisis response and recovery strategy in recent typhoon affected areas in the Philippines. The most recent response strategy, also in Mindanao, in the Typhoon Sendong (Washi)-affected areas will now also be also applied in the Typhoon Pablo (Bopha)-affected areas. Economic activities will be started by providing immediate but short-term income to survivors through cash-for-work. This will then transition into a longer-term sustainable employment and livelihood development for the affected communities to recover. The project PHI/13/50/JPN (under umbrella of RAS/11/01/JPN) was selected and approved by the Selection Committee on an ad hoc basis in January 2013 in order to urgently responds being set up in order to urgently respond to the crisis in Philippines, that caused enormous damage and one thousand deaths. The project will initiate local job generation programmes anchored on infrastructure repair and maintenance involving the meaningful participation of the affected communities and local government units. This will serve as a model for future crisis response.</narrative>
