   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Leaders called for each G20 member to prepare an employment action plan and an overall growth strategy for the 2014 Leaders&#x2019; Summit. Such strong proclamations by the G20 Leaders for integrated and coordinated macroeconomic, financial, labour market and social policies suggest that employment action plans should be explicitly integrated into national growth strategies. This renewed commitment by the G20 to develop a coherent and collective strategy to respond to the global employment challenges is reflected in the setting up of a Task-Force on Employment (TFE) in 2013. The ILO has been requested by the TFE to provide analytical and advisory support to its work. It is against this specific background that this project is proposed. It will analyse the role of integrated macroeconomic, sectoral and labour market in promoting the agenda of more and better jobs in five middle income G20 countries - China, India, Indonesia, Mexico, Turkey. They are taken as regionally representative exemplars of countries that display diversity of employment outcomes. As the statistical annexe shows, India and Mexico are two countries in which employment outcomes in the late 2000s have been modest, while Indonesia stands out as a country in which employment outcomes &#x2013; at least in quantitative terms &#x2013; have been impressive. On the other hand, Indonesia displays the second highest incidence of informality (72.5 per cent) among all G20 countries. China, which has a significantly lower per capita income than Mexico, has a much lower incidence of informality (30 per cent). Based on the above analyses, which will be conducted using relevant data and information for last ten years, the project will be utilised to develop broad-based and country-specific recommendations to enhance the role of integrated macroeconomic, sectoral and labour market policies in promoting more and better jobs in systemically important G20 countries . Thus the project aims to respond to the aspirations of the G20 Leaders and to support the ILO in its quest to support the work of the TFE At the same time, the project will provide highly relevant background studies that can serve as critical inputs to the analytical and programmatic work that is being undertaken under ACI 1 on the theme of &#x2018;more and better jobs for inclusive growth.</narrative>
