   <narrative xml:lang="EN">With funding from the David and Lucile Packard Foundation, Pathfinder is implementing a two-year project aimed at improving pre-service trainings at Regional Training Institutes, with focused work at Lahore (Punjab Province) and Hyderabad (Sindh Province). The project harmonizes the efforts to expand and enrich quality family planning/reproductive health services through the government network of family welfare centers in two selected districts Kasur (Punjab) and Khairpur (Sindh) in a cost-effective and sustainable manner. This project is built on Pathfinder&#x2019;s previous advances and is recognized by the Health and Population Department as part of a consistent and continued contribution for better family health in Pakistan.
Since the project&#x2019;s inception, Pathfinder staff completed a review and revision of the existing training, &quot;Curriculum for Family Welfare Workers.&quot; Pathfinder has worked with the Pakistan Nursing Council to incorporated training on healthy timing and spacing and post abortion care developed by Pathfinder into nursing training curriculums.</narrative>
