  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Field Research has two elements: (1) detailed studies of existing lighting initiatives in up to 9 locations identified during the desk review in both formal and informal camps based on Oxfam and CARE current work (incl. South Sudan, Myanmar, CAR, Lebanon, Tanzania, Philippines, Haiti, Uganda etc). Quantitative and qualitative data on usage will be collected through user surveys (potentially using digital tools), FGDs and key informant interviews including separate sessions with women and girls. Oxfam field teams regularly carry out field studies disaggregated by gender, age and other relevant factors, and take into account different types of latrines from blocks to single/multi household. They will capture the experience &amp; perspectives of different sanitation users with a specific, but not exclusive, focus on women and girls. Field teams will be consulted to ensure tools are appropriate and feasible, and to address variables which might impact on results. Data will be disaggregated by age, gender, ethnicity, disability and LGBTIQ factors as far as possible.  (2)  Field Testing of different handheld lighting devices in 3 camps (1 unlit, 1 partially, 1 WASH unit only). Ethical considerations prohibit us from contriving a situation where risks of Gender Based Violence (GBV)/abuse is likely to increase so we will identify sites where there is no, or only partial lighting to test additional solutions. Each option will be fully risk -assessed and carefully monitored. Various devices will be trialled in camps where there is no lighting at all or where there is partial lighting/latrine only lighting. In order to ensure consistency, this may be within the same camp or country, where camps/sections of camp are lit where others are not. Data from field testing will be elicited using the same methodology outlined above supplemented by comparing usage rates and perceptions of safety through observation and automated counting mechanisms.</narrative>
