    <narrative xml:lang="EN">Costa Rica&apos;s relatively limited land and sea border-patrolling capabilities make it vulnerable to the rising violence threatening other Central American countries. U.S. foreign assistance seeks to equip and train Costa Rican security authorities to secure national borders and create safe communities. U.S. assistance focuses on blocking transnational criminal organizations from penetrating Costa Rican society, reducing the tide of drugs transiting the country en route to the United States, and protecting the hundreds of thousands of U.S. citizens who annually visit or reside there. The U.S. Strategy for Engagement in Central America (Strategy) focuses on three overarching lines of action: 1) promoting prosperity and regional economic integration; 2) enhancing security through continued and expanded Central America Regional Security Initiative (CARSI) activities; and 3) promoting improved governance. The FY 2017 request of $750.0 million in bilateral and regional assistance for Central America - a part of the Administration&apos;s $1.0 billion whole-of-government request for appropriations and financing assistance to support the Strategy - includes and aligns the resources necessary to comprehensively increase economic opportunity, reduce extreme violence, strengthen the effectiveness of state institutions, address climate change and food insecurity, and challenges resulting in increased migration.</narrative>
