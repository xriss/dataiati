   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Currently, Bhutan receives limited support and assistance from development partners on trade related issues. ElF Tier 1 funding therefore has given much needed impetus for taking forward trade agenda in the country. Bhutan is still working on to diversify its export basket to include more local produce and support SMEs. Currently, a major chunk of revenue is generated through export of hydro electricity. With ElF Tier 1, National Implementation Unit (NIU) under the Department of Trade, Ministry of Economic Affairs, has been successfully established but there still is a need for capacity development within the ministry and other relevant stakeholders. The Tier 1 phase 1 has been beneficial for Bhutan as validated by the recent mid-term evaluation report. The Tier 1 phase 1 also enabled NIU to put various sectoral representations in Bhutan&apos;s ElF process, supported the development of one tier 2 project (which was approved in April 2017 by the ElF Board).</narrative>
