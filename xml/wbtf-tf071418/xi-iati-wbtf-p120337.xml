   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The objective of the Climate Change Trust Fund Program in the Maldives is to support the development and implementation of climate change strategy and action plan for Maldives, which will aim at building a climate resilient economy and society in Maldives through adaptation to climate change as well as mitigation for a low carbon development path. The Government of Maldives has formally requested the World Bank to administer a Climate Change Trust Fund (hereafter CCTF) Program of Euro 6.5 million (approx US$ 10 mln) to be funded by the European Commission (EC).  The Fund will be executed by the Government of Maldives (also referred to as recipient executed). GoM would like the strategic direction of the Trust Fund to be led from the President&apos;s Office under the oversight of the Vice President, who is also the chair of the Climate Change Council. SCOPE OF ACTIVITIES The Program consists of the following Parts: Pillar 1: Adaptation: Building a Climate Resilient Economy Carrying out activities with the involvement of the Recipient&apos;s ministries and agencies, civil society organizations and the private sector to deal with the short and medium-term impacts of climate change through inter alia: (a)   Designing and implementing pilot activities, including awareness and training programs, in the areas of sewage and solid waste management, coastal protection and biodiversity conservation, water and livelihood options and disaster management; (b)   Providing technical assistance to identify good practices, regulatory frameworks, climate-friendly technologies and PPP and other institutional structures in order to mainstream climate change into the national, sectoral and spatial development planning, and service delivery; and (c)   Developing technical capacities of the sector ministries and other authorities to participate in strategic policy dialogue and international events on climate change. Pillar 2: Mitigation: Promoting Low Carbon Development Carrying out activities to lower carbon development and reduce carbon emissions including inter alia: (a)   Strengthening capacities of the Government to develop a strategic proposal, a policy, and an implementation plan for low carbon development; (b)   Promoting a range of energy sector solutions including demand-side management for energy, energy efficiency, renewable energy (solar, wind and hybrid systems with diesel) technologies by identifying the enabling policy and regulatory environment and leveraging private-public partnerships; (c)   Promoting low carbon technologies in the waste management and water and sanitation sector by leveraging private-public partnerships; (d)   Reducing the carbon footprint of the tourism sector through innovative financing schemes with private-public partnerships with local private resorts.</narrative>
