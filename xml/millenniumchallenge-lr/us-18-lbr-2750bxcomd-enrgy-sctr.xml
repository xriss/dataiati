   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Liberia - Energy Sector Project: The Project is comprised of four interlinked activities aimed at enhancing power generation, strengthening the capacity of key sector institutions, and supporting the development of foundational policies as the sector modernizes and becomes more commercially viable.  The Mt. Coffee Rehabilitation Activity aims to increase the amount of electricity generated in Liberia, facilitate a decrease in the overall electricity tariff, and contribute to increased reliability and adequacy of electricity. This activity addresses the overarching problem in the energy sector, i.e., lack of access to affordable and reliable electricity, by targeting the insufficient supply of electricity in Liberia.</narrative>
