   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This IATI activity file represents the grantees receiving AmplifyChange funding for their projects in Guinea Bissau. Certain projects may have been anonymised in the data for safety and security reasons. AmplifyChange is a multi-donor fund that supports civil society organisations who advocate for improved sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR).  AmplifyChange offers both financial and capacity-building support to selected civil society organisations through a challenge fund model, where organisations submit applications in competitive funding rounds. AmplifyChange is managed by MannionDaniels in consortium with the African Women&#x2019;s Development Fund and Global Fund for Women. 

AmplifyChange was tendered in 2013, established in 2014, and the first funding rounds were held in 2015.  The number of donors have increased since the beginning to a current total pot of approximately &#xA3;90 million available for grant making (correct as of end-2017); the additional donor commitments have been extended to 2021. The donors include the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Denmark (Danida), the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Netherlands, the David and Lucile Packard Foundation, the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation, ViiV Healthcare, the Department of International Development (DFID) the Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation (Norad), Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (SIDA) working with the Swedish Association for Sexuality Education (RFSU), and one anonymous donor.
