   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The action is a response to the call to promote agribusiness and innovative farming in Sierra Leone through the Boosting Agriculture and Food Security (BAFS) project. 

The overall objective will be to provide targeted economic empowerment and resilience strengthening of key rural communities in Port Loko and Kambia Districts in Sierra Leone. The specific objectives will be increased food and income security for medium-scale youth-led farmer groups and enhanced performance of the local and national vegetable value chain. 

The action will contribute to the development of a diversified and efficient agriculture sector that promotes sustainable growth and creates jobs by focusing on economic empowerment of youth through capacity development and job creation in the agricultural sector. At the same time, the initiative will also support the collaboration of Private Sector, Farmers and Non-State Actors in developing economic, social and environmentally sustainable Agriculture Value Chains by contributing towards a vegetable value chain that is economically, environmentally and socially sustainable.
 
The project will target youth, especially young women, in the creation of medium-scale youth-managed farms. In order to ensure that these farms are sustainable, the project will prioritize careful identification and capacity-strengthening of youth, land planning and management, and enhanced coordination among value chain actors. The environmental impact of each farm will be carefully assessed and the most sustainable and profitable methods for production will be prioritized. Technical support on production, marketing and value chain addition will also be provided. The project will facilitate sustainable service provision and will use social media and digital platforms to enhance connections between youth, strengthen information-sharing and access to markets, as well as offer ongoing technical support and financial services, including mobile money and linkages to lenders. 

This is one of two similar projects in Sierra Leone, each with a different partner.</narrative>
