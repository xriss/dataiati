   <narrative xml:lang="EN">FINISH Mondial: Safe Sanitation and Improved Health for All by 2030</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">FINISH Mondial aims to 1. Kick-start the PPP for sanitation market development in 6 countries: India and Kenya (inclusive scale), Uganda, Ethiopia, Bangladesh, Tanzania (market development). A FINISH Mondial ToC has been developed. It distinguishes pathways towards BoP sanitation market development and subsequently towards reaching inclusive scale (below). The present proposal details expected status towards inclusive scale by June 2019 for India and Kenya, as well as expected status of BoP sanitation market development by June 2019 for Uganda, Ethiopia, Bangladesh and Tanzania. 2. Develop FINISH Mondial PPP with a 2030 horizon to boost scale, including a roadmap for strategic partnership building and multi-annual multi-country financing.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Having a safe toilet is still a privilege of the happy few. By 2015, only 39% of the global population (2.9 billion people) used a safely managed sanitation service. People at the base of the pyramid (BoP) face largest challenges to improve WASH conditions and solid waste management services. At the same time, this group represents the largest opportunity in terms of potential health gains and economic empowerment. There is momentum for inclusive sanitation and health. The 2030 horizon set by the SDGs is inspiring and moving many actors into action. The ambition on sanitation is high and the scope and interrelatedness of goals is such that these cannot be addressed by single purpose or single party approaches alone. National governments have put sanitation more predominantly on their agendas, supported by a growing evidence base of alternative approaches. Improving health outcomes and poverty indicators therefore requires an inclusive approach to sanitation and health. An approach that strategically uses donor funds with a focus to scale. And which links behaviour change in communities with government leadership as well as business development and finance opportunities. So markets are developed that service base of the pyramid populations, and change sanitation behaviour for good. FINISH aims for sanitation market development for BoP populations. As a public private partnership it fosters stakeholders from four domains, ie communities, government, business and finance (Diamond approach, see figure 1) to work together on this objective. So that by the end of the day: - people know they need a toilet (through health awareness creation) - people want a toilet (through demand creation) - people want to buy a durable toilet with safe management of human waste (through sanitation marketing) - local people can build those (through mason training) - people can afford those (through financial inclusion and loans, design improvements and economies of scale)</narrative>
