   <narrative xml:lang="EN">i-PUSH is a five year programme that aims to improve maternal and child health outcomes in Kenya by introducing and bringing together three existing, scalable mobile innovations &#x2014;M-TIBA, Leap and m-Jali&#x2014;from Amref and PharmAccess in three counties in Kenya. These innovations are designed in-house but in close collaboration with major private sector players. Leap, which is owned by Amref, is aimed at building capacity among community health workers using mobile phones. Through mobile learning or m-learning, community health workers are trained on topics such as family planning, mother and child nutrition, and sexual and gender based violence. M-TIBA, owned by PharmAccess, is a digital platform for inclusive healthcare that enables people to save, send, receive and pay money for medical treatment through a mobile health wallet on their phone. Since its introduction in Nairobi last year, more than 300,000 users have signed up. Lastly, M-jali, also owned by Amref, is a mobile application used by community health workers to capture data on household level on health indicators to improve efficiency of health reporting at the community level.</narrative>
