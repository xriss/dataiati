   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This Project contributes to enhancement of high quality GBV services, and works on putting the suitable services in place to prevent and reduce risks of GBV, through this project,in the project area(Daret Azza,Bennsh,which are the main two locations and Madiq Castle with a small CM component)
This project is mainly based on promoting the existing community protection mechanisms and is based on the need of the region as a kind of filling the gap of gender-based violence services in northern side of syria as possible, It focuses mainly on providing services to the most  vulnerable categories of population (who will be selected and prioritized in coordination with the CBOs, Community leaders , other NGOs in the locations , Women associations and initiatives , and all civil society actors.
The project will primarily depends on integration GBV services (Prevention amp Response )with existed community centers, two of them with existed NGO offices (daret azza and madiq castle) and the third one with CBO for women(bennsh),so one of them is CFS which is running by IHSAN organization in Daret Azza(Tqad) and women and youth empowerment center in Madiq Castle which is newly established by ISWA, where the beneficiaries taking the lead,and integration with women community based organization called _Henaa_  in Bennsh village in Idlib city district and they will be two mobile teams from the centers in Daret azza and in Bennsh to provide gender-based violence services especially prevention and awareness raising services outside the center in both Daret Azza and Bennsh communities,with two case workers in Madiq castle to manage the GBV cases by integration this services with women and youth empowerment center there managed by ISWA in addition to high quality coordination with SRD organization to integrate GBV specialized services in their RH center in Daret Azza and make an active refer between the two centers in this community,
The idea of this project to integrate in the provision of GBV services with a center located in Daret Azza the center provides CP services but currently does not cover the need of GBV services, 
Culture and social sensitivities will be highly considered when planning for all activities. We will ensure that the timing and nature of all proposed activities are compatible with the daily routines of women and girls and there is always a new suggestion taking place coming from women and girls.
The proposed activities are:
* Outreach activities including (awareness sessions on GBV topics, distribution of IEC materials, life skills, parenting Skills, PSS sessions). 
Outreach Team will target households, local community associations, schools, and any reachable places that are considered suitable for such activities, in the targeted area (Daret Azza and Madiq Castle).
The center based activities will include (vocational training such as computer lessons, hairstyle courses and sewing sessions, group PSS sessions and individual consultations, case management they will be a qualified case worker who provide consultations to survivors and refer them to proper services espiccially health services if needed after getting their approval , recreational activities) taking into consideration that we will have different groups depending on the age, psychical and social situation (married or not for example) and the preferences of beneficiaries. 
After trust building stage with the community and providing some services, we will also seek to form a women support voluntary committee of influential women and men who will play a role in the sustainability of protection from gender-based violence and we will provide appropriate training to them.
one last important point that the staff members will receive a training on different protection topics based on their needs and a follow up training based on the training gaps which may appear after real dealing with survivors with continues supervision and follow up and ongoing learning.</narrative>
