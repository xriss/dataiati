  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Mainly and practically, we aim to support the warming of students during the winter season by providing these targeted schools with fuel and heaters, which helps to provide warmth in classrooms and thus improve the quality of education in these schools. In this project we will target 35 schools in total within Ar-Raqqa Governorate in 4 Sub-districts as following:
9 Schools in Mansura Comunity (5 primary schools (Basic 6-12), 1 secondary school ( Secondary 13-15), and 3 primary and secondary schools).
9 Schools in Al- Thawrah Comunity (6 primary schools ( Basic 6-12), 1 secondary school ( Secondary 13-15), 1 primary and secondary schools and 1 Early childhood).
5 Schools in Ein Issa Comunity (All of them are primary schools.
12 Schools in Tell Abiad Comunity (6 primary schools (	 Basic 6-12), 4 secondary schools ( Secondary 13-15), and 1 Technical school 16 -18).
In fact, the number of targeted classrooms in this project will be approximately 756 classrooms and the number of targeted students is approximately 23,708 students and about 800 teachers (Male and female).
It is to be hoped that the matter of properly warming and ventilating schools will have attention through the activities of this project before the cold weather sets in. While the first thing that springs to mind when you think about schools is learning and grades. But these are impossible without proper basic conditions like warmth and good light. 
Providing Heaters to be installed at schools in order to be operated by the Diesel Fuel to support the warming of students during the winter season and in this context, we would like to refer to that we will involve the parents (especially women-headed families) in the process of installing the heaters and this will make the process go faster.
Provision of Diesel Fuel to be used at schools to support the warming of students during the winter season.
Silk Road will start actual Education activities with the humanitarian standards and Sphere standards in the Education sector with checking for the last time of schools&apos; status, especially with regard to the number of students enrolled because the schools have then settled in relation to this.
After that SRO will select the contractor and providers by announcing through its website and its page on Facebook and local councils and all available media to implement the tenders or quotations according to SRO&apos;s procurement, technical conditions approved and financial policies. After that, we will provide Heaters to be installed at schools in order to be operated by the Diesel Fuel to support the warming of students during the winter season and we will provision of Diesel Fuel to be used at schools to support the warming of students during the winter season. It is estimated that each classroom will need 3 l per day where we have 5 days a week. Also, Silk Road will ensure that each of the above-mentioned activities and works will be always under continuous monitoring through the monitoring and information mechanism that will be followed in this project where we will create a database for all schools and we will monitor the fuel consumption accurately and will be recording and keeping these documents and follow-up and update periodically.
