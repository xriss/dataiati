  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">As winter is approaching soon after the start of the 2017/2018 academic year, the educational sector in Eastern Ghouta is suffering from a lack in all the basic needs and resources necessary to carry out the educational process effectively. Most of the girls and boys come to school in old and worn out clothes, which reflect their harsh living conditions. These clothes do not protect them against cold weather and make them more susceptible to catching a cold, flu and respiratory infections.

Not having a source of income and the high prices of clothing, because of the siege imposed on Eastern Ghouta, are some of the main obstacles that prevent parents from buying clothes for their young girls and boys.

Additionally, the security situation and the ongoing violence has forced many families, most of them women and children, to become internally displaced in the various towns of Eastern Ghouta. These families fled their homes carrying only a small portion of their belongings and some families fled their homes with the clothes they had on only, leaving what is left to be buried under the rubble. They then reached overpopulated towns, where schools are under tremendous pressure, and they are currently working hard to accommodate the flow of displaced children fleeing from frontline areas.

This project will respond to the winter clothing needs for students both boys and girls, especially the internally displaced ones, as well as the students with special needs in some towns of Eastern Ghouta: (Ein Tarma, Zamalka, Hazeh)


These towns were selected according to several criteria:
-	Ein Tarma is a war-torn town at the, frontlines of the conflict between the two sides.
-	Zmalka is a town adjacent to Ein Tarma and it received many displaced people from the neighborhoods of Jobar and Ein Tarma.
-	Hazeh is a town adjacent to Ein Tarma and it received many displaced people from the neighborhoods of Jobar and Ein Tarma.

The project aims to cover the schools in these towns as they have become a last resort to a large number of IDPs and particularly children at the age of school. A good quality and full winter clothing kit will be provided to 2650 elementary and middle school boys and girls, especially the displaced ones, in addition to raising their morale and giving them psychosocial support.

After analyzing the needs according to sex and age disaggregated data (SADD), the winter clothing kit will include:
