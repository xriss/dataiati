   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project (women and girls safe space) activities are focusing on  villages and communities related to Sarmin sub district. The number of population within these locations reached more 30000 with an estimated rate of IDPs 31%. The main WGSS center is located in the city of Sarmin and its activities will reach the other targeted locations through two mobile teams after coordination and cooperation with COBs within the targeted locations. However, the targeted locations have recently experiencing hard humanitarian situations affected the life of population especially in terms of protection services as the services there continue to be underfund besides the fact that these locations are receiving large numbers of IDPs who are in need for protection services especially women, girls and boys. 
(WOS) Gender Based Violence Assessment Findings Report, October 2017, indicated that the main types of gender-based violence identified by the report were domestic violence, child marriage, harassment, sexual exploitation and the fear of sexual violence. The change of gender roles for Syrian women is challenging for all members of a Syrian household. In a recent research study by CARE entitled: WOMEN, WORK amp WAR, the research states that, &#x201C;both women and men explained that it was challenging for everyone to adapt to women&#x2019;s new roles and responsibilities. &#x201D;When women were supported in their new roles, they became empowered and proud. However, failing to cope with the gender roles changes can have serious protection risks that include different forms of GBV like sexual exploitation, sexual harassment.&#x201D;
This Project contributes to enhancement of high quality GBV services and measures, and works on putting the suitable services in place to prevent and reduce risks of GBV. Throughout this project, activities will try to make up the shortfall in terms of psychological and social support, where a large segment of women and girls within the targeted locations (Sarmin sub district and its villages and communities) are in urgent need to the projects related activities in order to reactivate their role and live with dignity. Sadad Organization will also work on reaching out to community leaders, representatives and local councils to coordinate and target the beneficiaries according to identifies priorities to the most acute needs.

1. Training of GBV staff on psychosocial support, GBV basic concepts, GBV Standard operating procedures(SOPs),Life Skills and First Psychological Aid.
