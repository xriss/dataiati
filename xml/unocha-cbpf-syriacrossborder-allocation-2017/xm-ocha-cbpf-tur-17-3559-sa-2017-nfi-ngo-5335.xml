   <narrative xml:lang="EN">provision of shelter and livelihood assistance (cash for - work) to IDPs in northern Syria (Al Bab  Atareb  sub districts /Aleppo Governorate)</narrative>

  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The aim of the project is to provide a shelter for 307 IDPs families (1828 beneficiaries) in vulnerable situations affected by conflict ,
Through rehabilitation of one school in Akhtarin  and 40 unfinished buildings in Al Bab sub district and Al atareb sub district /Aleppo  governorate. 
The project aims to provide shelter interventions  through repair /improvement and quick  impact employment &#x2013; generating activity ,including cash for &#x2013; work  schema project  for shelter repair 
The overall aim is to identify a total of 307 IDPs families in sub districts of Al Bab and Atareb to provide shelter , and to provide cash &#x2013; work for  60 (sixty) vulnerable beneficiaries  through shelter rehabilitation .
shelter rehabilitation includes:
Installing bathrooms ,toilets, washing and water supply, doors and windows.
Building of external and internal walls by hollow bricks (40cmx20cmx15cm).
 ensuring design  is gender sensitive ( includes separate spaces for males and females) and meets minimum criteria of 3.5m2/person and 2m height
The conflict and sanctions have resulted in degradation in assets, productive sectors, livelihoods and resilience.
Multiple waves of displacement, conflict damage and destruction have resulted in overcrowding, rising rents, occupancy of substandard shelters, poor security of tenure, and barriers to accessing services in many areas
Conflict related damage and destruction coupled with high levels of displacement has resulted in populations in many areas exceeding available capacity of adequate shelter and services.
According HNO almost 6 years into the Syrian crisis over 60% of the Shelter interventions are still emergency based These shelter options do not provide adequate physical protection, safety, security, privacy and access to essential services (including WASH).
As the provision of shelter meets one of the basic survival and dignity needs of women, girls, boys and men and can strengthen protection in a physical sense
 Improving the shelter structures will help reduce the vulnerability of the households, arising from the type of shelter they have and the related conditions. The project will ensure that the needs of women, men, girls , boys and elderly people are considered during selection and design of the shelter structures. Age and gender will be key consideration during selection of beneficiaries and implementation of the project activities 
The project strives to address the root of the housing crisis, contributing to an increase in the adequate housing stock , as well as impacting on the local economy and social cohesion through the clear investment in the host community.  The project takes an integrated approach to the needs of IDPs by first providing access to adequate shelter and then working to meet other housing needs, including security of tenure, providing conflict dispute resolution and giving support with documentation and legal assistance as required. 
While the financial resources provided by CfW programming are short-term in nature, the positive results can endure far beyond the end of program activities .  Employment opportunities generated by CfW programming enable many individuals who would otherwise be forced into migration</narrative>
