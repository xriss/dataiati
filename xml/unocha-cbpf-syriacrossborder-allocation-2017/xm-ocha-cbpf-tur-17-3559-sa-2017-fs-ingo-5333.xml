  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The proposed project seeks to improve the livelihood situation of 850 households (4250 individuals) through livestock and agricultural support in Ghadqa, Maaarrat Anuman sub district of Idleb. The project is developed based on the primary need assessment conducted through focus group discussions and key informant interviews in three villages namely Ghadga, Abu Makki and Telamnas in sub district Maaarrat Anuman. Ghadga is prioritized due to large number of female headed households as well as IDP residing in the village. The total estimated population of village is 9000 including 6000 residents and 3000 IDP. 

Islamic Relief will conduct a detailed household level need assessment to identify, 500 families to provide with agricultural input ( winter) including seeds, fertilizers and basic tools. These families will be provided with on going technical support to improve their knowledge and practices to get best yield each planting season. The estimated yield will be sufficient to cover the food needs of the household and any excess can be sold in the market to create income generation. The direct recipient of Agriculture support will be 250 men and 250 women. 

350 families will be provided with locally procured mature EWE sheep. Each targeted household will be provided with 2 pregnant EWE sheep. The sheep will be vaccinated to prevent them from prevailing diseases. During the last four months of gestation period the sheep will be provided monthly feed. Before the start of lactation period, livestock kit will be provided to support in milking, cheese production, wool and manure collection. The expected milk production is sufficient to cover the household diary needs and any excess can be sold in the market to contribute to the income. The direct recipient of this component will be 175 men and 175 women.  

in addition to the regular field visits by the project team and M amp E team visit, post distribution monitoring will be conducted after major distribution activities including distribution of agriculture inputs, livestock, feed, and livestock kit. The post distribution monitoring will capture the beneficiary satisfaction level and the use of the inputs by the beneficiaries.

Both beneficiary groups (livestock and agriculture)  will continue to receive follow-up advice over the course of the project from field project team hired for this purpose. it is anticipated that this improved knowledge will be shared by the direct beneficiaries with their relatives, PEER and friends living in the close by area. hence the knowledge transfer will help to improve the agriculture based livelihood practices for the indirect beneficiaries also.

Given the particular sensitivities related to women engaging in project activities a careful weighing of the risks associated with providing such support will be undertaken to ensure that no harm comes to beneficiaries or field staff. The project will seek to prioritize women and those with disabilities by tailoring the support provided, in an effort to better respond to their specific needs and concerns. 

The project will target both the IDP (30%) and host population (70%) so that the social tensions among the two groups are minimized and equal opportunities are provided to help the extremely vulnerable families to stand on their own feet and build a culture of resilience.  

As part of exit strategy, all relevant stakeholders will be informed about project closure. End line survey will be conducted to gauge the outcome and output  level results. Lesson learnt from the implementation will be shared with FSL cluster members to improve the quality of the programmes. it is anticipated that the intervention results will continue after the project closure hence the results achieved will be sustainable. As with the agriculture and livestock inputs and improved knowledge the targeted households will continue their cycle of securing household food and income generation after the project.</narrative>
