   <narrative xml:lang="EN">BINAA will distribute fuel for heating (Diesel in Norther Syria and Firewood in Norther Syria) to 396 classrooms (52 schools, 16 in Besieged areas of Rural Damascus and 36 in Southern Aleppo) where 11,381 children (5,493 boys and 5,887 girls) (9,371 Host communities, 4,516 boys and 4,854 girls) and (2,010 IDPs, 977 boys and 1,033 girls), and distribute appropriate, gender and age specific winter clothes to 6,294 children (3,269 boys and 3,025 girls) of them (5,115 Host communities, 2,649 boys and 2,466 girls) and (1,179 IDPs, 620 boys and 559 girls) in time of winter with the aim of sustaining lives by increasing access to education in protective and heated learning spaces for conflict affected girls and boys in Rural Aleppo and Rural Damascus to ensure that they have adequate protection to cope with harsh winter weather. The project will be implemented in Zarba and Tal-aldaman subdistricts in Rural Aleppo and Arbin, Duma, Harsta, Kafr batna and Nashabiyah subdistrict in besieged areas of Rural Damascus.

Children are at particular risk of exposure to harsh weather, acute respiratory infection and indoor pollution in winter as families are in lack access to fuel or electricity and lack purchasing power to buy warm clothes for children. Therefore, BINAA prioritized the distribution of winter clothes to reach these children in besieged areas of Rural Damascus and in Rural Aleppo. Also, BINAA assessments showed that the learning spaces suffer from lack of resources to heat classrooms and schools administration are unable to afford the basic heating materials and this will put children in the hazard of harsh winter weather conditions. Therefore, BINAA will distribute fuel for heating to 396 classrooms in 52 schools.  

The content and sizes of the winter clothing packages were reviewed based on the education cluster recommendations. BINAA winter clothing kit will consist of the following items winter jackets, wool sweater, warm winter trouser, wool hat and scarf set, wool socks, pair of winter boots and pair of gloves. Since younger children are the most vulnerable to extreme temperatures, the provision and distribution of winter clothing also will take into account age and sex of the children. BINAA will target children under 10 years (1,2,3 and 4th grades) of the targeted schools by these kits as they are the most vulnerable group. However, all children attend classes will benefit from school heating services. Basing on field assessments and consultation with schools staff, we found that schools operates for around 4-5 hours a day in both Northern and Southern Syria. 2 liters of diesel will require to heat a classroom in Northern Syria and 4 Kg of firewood are required in Southern Syria. We selected firewood in southern Syria as the population nowadays use this material for heating because the cost of diesel in very high (it reached 6.5USD during September 2017). 
BINAA prepared an initial list of schools will benefit from the project (please see the attached document) basing on pre-established selection criteria include that school is operating and ventilated in high severity scale communities do not face ongoing fighting or very bad security situation provides services to IDPs and hosting communities and does not receive any support for heating purposes.
However, this list may change according to the results of the pre-distribution assessment which will be conducted at the beginning of implementing project to identify the accurate targeted schools in coordination with other actors in the target location. This exercise will identify the final list of schools and children and will adjust the initial list in away prevents any overlapping the services will be provided.
The winter clothing kit will be distributed directly to children in the targeted schools and the fuel will be distributed to the schools represented by their headtechers to sign the received note. The fuel will distributed on monthly basis for 3 months.</narrative>
