   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Improving Access to Trauma and Primary Health Care Assistance for Conflict-affected Syrians in Northern  Southern Syria.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project aims to provide primary health care and surgical services in facilities, which are located in under-served and besieged areas, whose people are suffering from the lack of medical services and are having difficult living conditions particularly the most vulnerable people (IDPs, women, children and the elderly).
By supporting these facilities, SEMA tries to combine between primary health care and surgical services in northern Syria and besieged communities of Rural Damascus. In the targeted locations civilians are suffering from extreme deficiency and severe destruction in health centers, which led in the past 6 years of conflict to high morbidity and mortality rates between populations. Therefore, the project intends to decrease this harm and compensate the tremendous deficit in all health services by introducing live-saving and life-sustaining emergency aid and facilitates the access to these services.
The supported facilities by this project are located in highly damaged and under-served regions, which are extended from the north to the middle of the Syrian desert in north-east of Hama
(Alhawayes) and reaching the besieged area of rural Damascus with Albalsam PHC center.
