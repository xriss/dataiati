   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Improving access to non-formal education in Azaz camps</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">As we analyzing the situation of education in (Azaz district) in the north of Syria, we define the non-formal education &quot;necessary process in situation of crisis until formal schooling could be restored&quot;, all statistics and reports refers to:
- The weakness of formal education system.
- Many years of dropping out of formal schools especially in the camps.
the project will seek to provide &quot;non-formal education&quot; through catch-up classes for students in the north of Syria (Azaz district) based on the four characteristics that give the high-importance degree for non-formal education:
- Relevance to the needs of disadvantaged groups.
- Concern with specific categories of person.
- A focus on clearly defined purposes.
- Flexibility in organization and methods.

the project will target 1871 students (925 Male amp 946 Female) in the camps areas surround Azaz in Aleppo suburb through utilizing the existed resources in four camps, such as:
(Caravans - Furniture - Public utilities...) with providing maintenance for these resources, in addition to provide operational and financial support for these centers after restoration the shortages from all aspects.

the centers will provide safe and equitable access to non-formal education for crisis-affected children 5 to 15 years old mainly by provide them with catch-up classes, literacy and numeracy programs, in addition to many related services which ensure better delivering of the project deliverables for the beneficiaries, the main services are:
- Provide teachers and education personnel with teaching resources and kits.
- Provide children learning supplies and materials (Stationary kits and curriculum).
- Provide children with PSS activities and life skills program.
- Provide a protective learning environment (utilities, heating, school furniture, WASH facilities, running costs).
- Train teachers and education personnel on Design Thinking and Learning Through Play focusing on pedagogical and psycho-social topics.
- Provide teachers and education personnel with incentives.

To promote equal access to education services, activities should be designed to be as inclusive as possible, Accordingly It is imperative to provide educational support that brings children to their expected learning level by providing a protective and productive education environment. Learning spaces should provide sufficient water, sanitation, light, ventilation and heat. Adequate numbers of furniture, teaching tools, text books, teaching/learning supplies, fire extinguishers, first aid kits, etc. should be supplied. Education personnel should be adequately trained, supported, coached and remunerated. Communities and parents should be encouraged to be active supporters of learning spaces and their children&#x2019;s education. Education programs should focus on modalities that focus on condensed learning such as catch-up classes, accelerate learning and literacy/numeracy and ideally lead to pathways to formal education in the future.

The centers were used previously as schools and its were not supported for a long time, so we will invest the assets and findings to turn these school into non-formal education centers in the following camps:
1- Al-Iman camp: can provide 22 daily class.
2- Al-Haramen camp: can provide daily 23 class.
3- Ikde camp: can provide daily 18 class.

All beneficiaries are IDPs and they are living in the targeted camps.
WATAN will ensure that all project activities can be implemented by participation and coordination with all stakeholders: (local councils, education directorates, parents of students, institutions and other NGO&apos;s who work in education in the targeted areas, employees, and students by identify their specific needs and coordinate with all aforementioned stakeholders to meet their needs through well-planned response plan, WATAN will depends directly on its own implementing team to ensure conduct all activities perfectly.</narrative>
