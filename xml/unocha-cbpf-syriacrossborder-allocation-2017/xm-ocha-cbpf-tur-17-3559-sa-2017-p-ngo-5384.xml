The initial protection monitoring will be a two phase approach, including a first rapid assessment based on interviews with key informants (community leaders) in order to identify key protection needs and trends, and a more in-depth assessment conducted a few days later at individual level. These assessments will be carried out based on the standard protection monitoring form developed by PMTF and based on its SOPs and the Turkey protection cluster, and that has been field tested by Ghiras in the context of the Aleppo crisis. PM are carried out by Ghiras Staff that are trained on data sensitivity, protection risks, etc.

The collected information, in addition to be used for direct identification of vulnerable people, will be compiled in order to contribute to improving evidence-based advocacy towards duty bearers. Based on protection monitoring findings, reports will be produced and shared with Protection cluster and other actors who needs information for humanitarian situation and protection risk that may support them when they plan for new project or campaign, and advocacy will be considered to ensure humanitarian actors are aware and act to safeguard protection principles.</narrative>
