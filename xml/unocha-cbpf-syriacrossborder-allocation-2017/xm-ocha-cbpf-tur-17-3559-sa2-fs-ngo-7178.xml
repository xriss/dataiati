According to the latest FSL report on priorities and Responding to the need assessment that IYD has conducted in Rural Homs in coordination with the local councils, this project will assist the targeted poor and vulnerable IDPs amp Host community  through reducing the financial burden by supporting 400  local farmers who own lands but they are in need for agricultural inputs through support them to plant 0.5 donum as homestead garden with seeds, fertilizer, agriculture tools (shovel, Axe, garden Hose 25 m, Farming Rake) to plant winter vegetables (pea, Spinach and Chard ), pea crop will contribute to improve soil properties  through motivate denitrifying bacteria to nitrogen fixation, and other crops (spinach and chard) are considered economic crops because they will be harvested more than once in the season.
Plant 0.5 donum with winter vegetable crops will produce nearly 0.5 ton vegetable crops that will improve the basic need from winter vegetable.
Moreover, will hold training sessions on new agriculture methods by using new network irrigation, therefore MWL has been selected 5 fields, which owned and rented by expert farmers from the benefited families. These five fields will be the training locations and these expert farmers will contribute in this training based on their experience. Therefore, the beneficiaries who are the 400 targeted families will be able to learn practically from the agronomist who will deliver his experiance to the beneficiaries.
The other part of this project depends on choosing 125 vulnerable families Who own 1 cow with fodder to provide the protein, energy, and menials in the fodder ration, veterinary serves and follow up reproductive health through insemination the cows to increase the number of cows and increase the production of milk after birthing a, after three months of  fodder distributing stage, each family  will benefit from fodder and veterinary service will give 2.5 liter of milk at no cost to a poor families led by a woman and have children under five years age for three months.
