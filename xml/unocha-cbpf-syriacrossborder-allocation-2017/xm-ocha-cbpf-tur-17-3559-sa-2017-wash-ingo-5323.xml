  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This intervention is designed as complementary action for PAH wash assistance in self-settlements and camps located in north Syria which started in January 2016. The organization has decided to renew its intervention in the same areas where it was working since the beginning of 2016 due to increased need for WASH services after the security situation in Aleppo and Idleb worsened since the last fighting development. Since 2011 north Idleb is considered the target for IDPs e.g. in September 2015 the IDPs influxes increased following the Russian intervention. Additionally after east Aleppo evacuation in Dec 2016 the influxes of IDPs increased and the number of IDPs settled in north Syria camps.

This planned intervention will analyze and take into consideration the needs, priorities and capacities of both the female and male population to improve the life of affected population in addition to mainstreaming the protection principles in all project phases. PAH will provide equitable access for men/women and boys/girls to the same amount of water during the project period, as well as sanitation services in the self settlements and camps by consulting the beneficiaries man/women and boys/girls about the location and the design of the latrines. Additionally the content of consumable hygiene kits will be selected in consultation with women and teenage girls, through the PDM surveys which PAH was conducting during the intervention in the camps since Jan 2016, to address the needs of women, girls and children.

PAH will provide 5648 HHs living in self settlements and camps in Idleb and Aleppo governorates with basic WASH services, drinking water, solid waste removal, discharging latrines septic tanks, rehabilitation of some open sewer lines in 5 camps, ,address the gap in latrines numbers in the targeted camps by building 64 new latrines taking into account the needs of women and men, in addition to serve the elderly and disabled beneficiaries, additionally consumable hygiene kits will be distributed to displaced families in all targeted location, and segregated session for men, women and children to raise the personal and environmental hygiene awareness between the affected population.

PAH will hire female staff in distribution and monitoring team to consult with women and girls in designing and implementing the activities in the proposed action, as well as training some females from the affected population in the targeted location as hygiene promoters to take the lead of raising the hygiene awareness of the beneficiaries in all targeted locations. Beside the WASH services which will be provided by PAH, affected vulnerable people in the camps and self settlements will be supported to organize general cleaning campaigns in whole target location, by applying cash for work intervention which will result in two main goals, the first is clean environment and the second will be strengthen of vulnerable beneficiaries by the wages from the campaigns</narrative>
