   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Solidarity Center builds Worker Community Associations (WCAs) that can effectively organize and mobilize workers, especially women workers, in their communities. The WCAs assist their communities by advocating for services such as legal assistance&#x2014;particularly for reporting worker rights violations and gender-based violence (GBV)&#x2014;health care and safety in the workplace and the community. The Solidarity Center also trains and mentors women leaders within the WCAs to build the leadership skills they need to take active roles in their WCAs, their workplaces and their communities.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Solidarity Center promotes transformative change in Bangladesh&#x2019;s readymade garment (RMG) sector that goes beyond factory walls. Every year, thousands of young women migrate to work in factories in Bangladesh to support themselves and their families. However, they are vulnerable to exploitation and have limited ability to advocate for their rights. Many of these workers move into and become part of communities surrounding garment factories, which depend on the earnings of RMG workers. The Solidarity Center assists in building sustainable, community-led platforms that provide women in these communities with opportunities to become leaders not only in the workplace but also in their larger communities.</narrative>
