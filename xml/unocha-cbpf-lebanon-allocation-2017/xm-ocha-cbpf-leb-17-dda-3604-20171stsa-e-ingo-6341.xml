   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Education programs for the disabled and access to learning opportunities for children and youth with disabilities</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project proposes a set of activities that responds to the needs of some of the most vulnerable communities in Lebanon, notably children and youth with specific needs and disabilities, while contributing to the Lebanese Crisis Response Plan 2017-2020 in contributing to inclusive education. The project&apos;s aim is to enable children with special needs to have equal access to education, while ensuring they are surrounded by capable public school staff and a safe, inclusive environment.
24 public schools in the Bekaa region will be targeted to improve their capacity to include children with disabilities in their educational programs. 5 public schools will be refurbished to provide accessibility to disabled. 
FPSC has worked on Education projects in the Middle East and in other countries, with a first project in Lebanon back in 1996 and more than 50 million Euros invested in 132 Education projects. FPSC has a longstanding relation with the Ministry of Education and Higher Education, which has been involved in some of its projects. The Ministry has been contacted and informed about the project proposal and a meeting has been scheduled to take place after project approval.
Around 360 public School staff of 24 targeted public schools will receive coaching, which will be given by trainers specialized in disabilities-related matters such as psychomotricity, orthopedagogy and speech therapy. The public school staff will be able to comprehend the different disabilities and learning difficulties, and how to deal with them. They will also be supported in adapting the puplic school curricula to the specific needs of the children and youth. 
To ensure an inclusive and safe public school environment 4,800 children between the ages 6-14 will also be subject to awareness sessions. These sessions will incorporate an easy to comprehend educational video on disabilities, which will help them grasp the specific needs students with disabilities may have and how to integrate them on an equal basis.
Reaching children&#x2019;s parents in order to ensure a widespread acknowledgement of people with disabilities, as well as the normality and importance of their inclusion in every aspect of life such as education. This will be done by performing awareness sessions during the parent committee reunions. Parents committees will in turn be involved in spreading more awareness on the different matters to which they will have been sensitized. Community workers will reach out families who have children with disability who are not enrolled in public schools so that they are informed of the ongoing project, highlighting the possibility and importance of enrolling children into public schools, allowing children to have equal opportunities to access education.
FPSC will ensure that throughout the entire project, a psychosocial supporter will be present at each step of the awareness process within the public schools. S/He will become a familiar figure for the teachers, children but also the caregivers, which they can refer to for support and advice. He will closely follow the 31 children with disabilities registered in the targeted public schools so far, evaluate their needs, improvements and environment. S/He will conduct daily visits to the public schools, ensuring a regular presence for all 24 public schools on a regular basis, and refer beneficiaries internally and externally as needed to Arcenciel Centers and to FPSC&apos;s Mental Health Clinic in Zahle to receive the appropriate care and services, respecting confidentiality and the rights of the beneficiaries. These interventions meet the SDGs, given that Arcenciel is a Global Compact (GCNL) signatory, by tackling 4 of the goals:#4 Education: by ensuring inclusive and quality education for all,#10 Reducing inequalities, #16Contributing to a peaceful and inclusive environment with the society,#17 Partnerships for the goals.</narrative>
