  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Originating in the 1990s, the unsolved conflict involving Georgia and the de-facto entities of Abkhazia and South Ossetia poses severe challenges to the security and democratic development of the region as well as to the protection of human rights with IDP
s and refugees left with no tangible solution to their situation, worsened by a lack of humanitarian access for international actors to the de facto regions. The renewal of open hostilities in August 2008 has led to the establishment of both the Geneva Int
ernational Discussion (GID) and the Incident Prevention and Response Mechanisms (IPRMs). Both formats were created in order to prevent instability and facilitate regular contact and exchange of information among the participants.Whereas all parties to the 
conflict agree on the general dysfunctionality of the process, they do not attribute the lack of progress to the same reasons. One key obstacle to the process lies in the fact that there is no shared understanding of who the conflict parties are and what e
xactly are the issues to be discussed on the various platforms provided by the peace process. Additionally, the peace process in Georgia is impacted by the turbulences of the local and regional political environment as well as the divisions between the Geo
rgian population and political elite.CMI supports the agency of key mandated actors of the peace process in Georgia by providing conceptual, practical and technical knowledge and skills to them as well as by facilitating spaces for exchanges on issues rela
ted to the reconciliation and peace process. This is further supported by ensuring coordination and complementarity with regional and international actors involved in the peace process. Current work builds on previous efforts undertaken over the period 201
5-2018, during which CMI has provided support to Georgian government officials through its Peace Competence workshops on issues related to peace process design.</narrative>
