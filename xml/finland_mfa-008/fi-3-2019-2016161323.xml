 in the four project countries. The study confirms that adolescent with disabilities do not have any access to SRH services, which is exactly the matter that the My Body, My Future program intends to address. In all the planned interventions of the program
, an effort will be made to ensure these interventions are disability inclusive. Plan Finland has signed a partnership with Light for the World, a leading disability organization with expertise in mainstreaming disability inclusion and experience in inclus
ive SRHR, as to ensure technical expertise within reach in all the four project countries. The main objective of the Partnership is to ensure that all stakeholders in the My Body, My Future program of Plan realize what the main barriers to disability inclu
sion are within society and what they and the communities can do to put a stop to these barriers, particular related to Sexual and Reproductive Health + Rights (SRHR). In order to do so the following areas of collaboration have been identified: 1) To ident
ify the focus intervention areas for inclusion of persons with disabilities in sexual and reproductive health activities, as well as to assist in tracking and tracing the process of disability inclusion by contributing to monitoring, evaluation, (action) r
esearch and studies; 2) To enable trainers and disability inclusion focal persons to train implementing partners on inclusion of persons with disabilities in sexual and reproductive health activities by developing resources and training packs; 3) To ensure
 Plan and implementing partners raise their commitment, strengthen their capacity and seek collaboration to include persons with disabilities in sexual and reproductive health activities by strengthening capacity through training, coaching and mentoring; 4
) To demonstrate and the factors that impact the inclusion process, the lessons learned are documented and disseminated among the project countries as well as in Finland as in the wider development community. Ultimately these efforts should ensure the adol
escents with disabilities are not left behind.</narrative>
