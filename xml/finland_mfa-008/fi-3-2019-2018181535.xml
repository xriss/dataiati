   <narrative xml:lang="EN">F.a: Scaling up Solar PV Drip Irrigation Systems in Myanmar&apos;s Dry Zone</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In this project, the PV Drip Irrigation Systems that were introduced in 2016 in the Dry Zone of Myanmar&apos;s central region, will be expanded to nearby villages.  Seeing the great success of the piolot project, over 100 neighbouring farms have expressed stron
g interest to establish their own Solar PV Drip Irrigation Systems but lack financing and technical support. This project will see the expansion of the system to 60 family farms. Direct beneficiaries will include some 700 persons, in addition to the 60 fam
ily members, they include other villagers working on these farms. The long-term development aims are the reached climate resilience of the agri livelihoods in the Dry Zone, increased role of renewable energy in Myanmar&apos;s rural development, increased divers
ity of agri value chains in the Dry Zone, agro-economic development of the Dry Zone, reduction of migrant works from Dry Zone and healthier family diets in the Dry Zone. The participating farmers will receive technical assistance and funding from the Ayerw
addy Farmers Development Bank (A-Bank) which covers most of the drip irrigation system installations. Siemenpuu and EKOenergy funding is less than one fourth of total project costs and acts as catalyst for the success of the scheme. The expected project ou
tcomes are: A total of 60 family farms, across 5 villages of the Dry Zone, have received capacity building to efficiently increase yields and crop diversity: Technical capacity building on Solar PV Pumping, Drip Irrigation, Aquifer Protection, Seasonal Agr
iculture, and Agro Processing, Families are trained regarding financing to establish their Solar PV Drip Irrigation System, REAM has established a revolving fund to finance 5 more family farms every 3-years, A total of 60 family farms have initiated agro-p
rocessing with technical support from and financing support from A-Bank, An increased awareness of the role of renewable energy for rural development -- among civil society organizations, policy makers, international development partners. The project partn
er Renewable Energy Association (REAM) has an official expert and advisor role in Myanmar energy issues. REAM is well networked also among civil society actors and internationally, and does research and advocacy work on renewable and sustainable energy pro
duction.</narrative>
