   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Vietnam is a producer of footwear furniture clothing and many other goods (defined as articles in the EU REACH regulation). Many Vietnamese businesses are unfamiliar with the tightening EU regulations. The REACH regulation is set to introduce significant c
hanges to the import of chemicals and other raw materials for the European industry. The legislation also affects chemical mixtures (such as cosmetics detergents and paints) as well as articles. Sufficient communication with authorities consumers and impor
ters in the EU is essential for the continuity of Vietnamese companies trade operations to Europe. If trade partners fail to fulfil their obligations all importing must be ceased. This poses a risk for Vietnamese companies to lose their position in the EU 
market. The EU has established a coordinated enforcement system operated by national enforcement authorities and customs. Any non-conforming article mixture or substance will be returned from the EU border back to origin. In addition failing to fulfil the 
REACH requirements may cause serious penalties whilst Vietnamese suppliers risk financial loss from lost business if failing to demonstrate REACH compliance. The purpose of the project is to support Vietnamese SMEs in adopting the EU REACH regulation and t
he acquisition of certification. The Vietnamese textile industry the furniture industry and all Home Decoration / Gift Items are directly the subject of the new regulation and in craft industry where the companies are overwhelmingly small the know-how does
 not exist. There are many women in the handicraft industry whose share of income to the family is an essential part of the well-being of the whole family. The loss of these jobs when the export market closes due to insufficient certificates can cause cata
strophic financial burden to families as well social unrest. After preliminary discussions with authorities and industry organizations it has come to light that the preparation for the topic is very bad partly because of lack of information partly because 
of the lack of services. Acquiring certificates requires expert service laboratory tests and local players are not in the market.</narrative>
