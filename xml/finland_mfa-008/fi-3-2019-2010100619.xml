   <narrative xml:lang="EN">F.a: PROMOTING THE RIGHTS OF THE CHILD TO INCLUSIVE AND COMPREHENSIVE EDUCATION AND DEVELOPMENT IN IRAQI KURDISTAN</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Programme focuses on children with disabilities and those coming from minority groups, and has a positive impact on the lives of 3 930 people directly and indirectly on 20 580 peoples lives. Programme implementation is built on partnership with local o
rganizations. During this Programme, partners will have increased capacity to raise awareness on the rights of those people who do not yet have opportunities or capacity to speak about their own rights. Halabja Handicap Organization works in Halabja on the
 eastern border of Kurdistan, which became sadly known for the chemical attacks in the 1980s. Through the Programme children with disabilities in Halabja will have increased quality of life and improved opportunities to go to school. The other partner of t
he Country Programme is the Assemblies of God in Kurdistan  a church that works in the Kurdish capital Erbil. Amidst war and an influx of refugees our partner has continued their work for the benefit of children and families in their community and has esta
blished a kindergarten that is well trusted by different ethnic and religious groups. The partner also serves the community through their music and language school.#In Iraqi Kurdistan, all children do not have an access to education and schools are lacking
 needed materials. The value of the child and opportunities given for play and comprehensive development are narrow. Therefore the Country Programme focuses on the rights of children with disabilities and children from minority groups to education. The Cou
ntry Programme supports the establishment of kids clubs, starting extracurricular activities and running summer schools to support the comprehensive development of children. Children with disabilities are part of field trips and activities together with al
l the children. Children have the right to an education, where they develop not only in theoretical subjects but also in arts and life-skills. The Programme supports also the establishing parents groups where parents are given knowledge on the healthy and 
comprehensive development of the child. Special emphasis is given to the parents of children with disabilities to ensure that there is enough support to keep children in school to finish their education. The Country Programme also trains teachers and paren
ts on the rights of the child and supporting structures that enable the well-being of the child.</narrative>
