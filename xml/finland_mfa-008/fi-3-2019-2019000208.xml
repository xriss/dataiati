   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Adressing informal sector sexual and gender based violence: core support for the implimantation of 2019-2022 strategic plan</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The support will contribute to Equality for Growth overall objective which seek to empower Tanzania?s informal sector women. Informal sector women experience GBV in their daily operations and they have limited access to justice GBV remains a chronic proble
m facing women and girls in Tanzania?s informal sector. The Tanzania Demographic and Health Survey 2015-2016 indicates that about 2 out of 5 women aged 15-49 experience physical violence and 17% of them experience sexual violence. In markets of Dar es Sala
am 40% of female traders experience sexual harassment 33% are verbally abused and 24% experience other forms of violence from male traders and customers2. Unfortunately women?s access to justice is limited due to low understanding of the law legal procedur
es and high costs of filling pursuing cases as well as engaging advocates. The National plan of Action to end Violence against Women and Children in Tanzania (NPA-VAWC) of 2017/18 ? 2012/22 was launched in 2016 by the government of the United Republic of T
anzania but its  enforcement is very low and operationalization still lags behind. The funds will contribute to  the achievement of the following  specific results of their 2019- 2022 strategic plan: Outcome 1.1 Informal sector women operate in safe cities
 and public spaces and the working environment space that is freed from GBV/VAWG and other insecurities so they are able to exercise their human and economic rights to the fullest. Output 1.1.1: Local authorities market leaders and law enforcers possess im
proved knowledge and skills related to handling GBV/VAWG incidences and other safety related issues. Output 1.1.2: Increased knowledge and assertiveness of informal sector women to end GBV/VAWG and they take action to address safety issues. Output 1.1.3: T
ailored community based legal work is promoted to facilitate operations of informal sector women. Outcome 1.2: Informal sector actors such as LGAs the media and local organisations are empowered to effectively address gender related policy barriers affecti
ng women. Output 1.2.1: Improved knowledge and skills of policy implementers on policies relevant to the informal sector. Output 1.2.2: Best informal sector models (including EfG models) are shared and/or adopted by LGAs institutions and local organisation
s nationally and where relevant internationally.The Equality for Growth is the implementing agent of the programme.</narrative>
