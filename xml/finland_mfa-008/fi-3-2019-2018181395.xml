tion. Yet, youth involvement in governance is very limited and the youth are not invited to take part in decision-making or peace processes. While there is great potential for young leaders and their role as agents of change to promote social cohesion is e
ssential, many do not acknowledge the importance of youth participation. Few opportunities and channels exit for the youth to engage in and exercise their leadership at community and regional levels. The youth and the local communities also find it difficu
lt to engage in official processes due to lack of information and language barriers. Currently there are few capacity building initiatives aiming at addressing the various barriers to youths effective participation. #4. The main objective and expected resu
lts: #The projects main objective is to promote the targeted youths effective participation in peace building and to equip them with the skills and capacities to engage in vertical and horizontal peace dialogue processes. The project also aims at empowerin
g the youth to lead and contribute to advocacy efforts promoting community development and peace building. The youth will be equipped with the necessary skills to effectively participate in the peace processes and decision-making on community and national
