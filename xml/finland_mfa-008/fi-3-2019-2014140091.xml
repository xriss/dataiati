   <narrative xml:lang="EN">1. Project: 11435 Land and Livelihood Advocacy Project (LLAP)#2. Project area and Country: Pursat and Kampong Speu Provinces in Cambodia.#3. Project justification: #Accessing land titles is still a constraint for many people in rural Cambodia. The vulnerab
le people in the communities often have no land titles, which then results into land conflicts with their neighbours and newcomers as the lands of the poor people are easy targets for powerful people and private companies. When land conflict cases have bee
n brought to the provincial court, the ruling is often against the poor people due to corruption. The majority of community people are illiterate and do not understand the processes to obtain rights to land, besides which they lack information form the rel
evant authorities on Land Law and Land Registration. In addition, the duty-bearers have poor knowledge and skills on Alternative Disputes Resolution (ADR) and have to send all land conflicts to district and provincial courts for decision-making.#4. The mai
n objective and the expected results:#The main objective of the Land and Livelihood Advocacy Project is to improve the quality of the dispute resolution process and to increase access to justice by the poor in Pursat and Kampong Speu Provinces. The project
 seeks to provide the commune councils with the necessarily skills to mediate and resolve conflicts related to land and family issues at the local level. It also aims to build the capacity of the district officers to work together with the commune council 
to solve the land and family conflicts. The project will continue the capacity building on basic Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) started in the previous phase.#At the end of the project, the targeted community members will have increased knowledge and
 understanding of Land Law and Rights and basic Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) and Family Law. The project will also promote dialogue platform on land conflict resolution for right holders and duty bearers at national level and will carry out case in
vestigation on the reported disputes.#5. Right-holders/ beneficiaries: 4,560 beneficiaries (farmers, youth, and elderly)#Duty bearers: District officials, commune councilors, and village chiefs#6. Implementing partner: Life With Dignity (LWD)</narrative>
