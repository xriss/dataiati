   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Tanzania Network of Legal Aid Providers (TANLAP) aims to; strengthen the capacity building on legal literacy and Human Rights among legal aid providers; extend and improve legal aid provision in the country; initiate promote support as may be deemed expedi
ent any proposed legislation or other measure affecting the interests of its members; build mutual understanding and coordination amongst legal aid providers and legal aid clients in the country; to tap advocacy issues in the grassroots level for policy an
d law reforms. In Tanzania Legal and Human rights awareness and education is relatively low. As a result of low level of such legal and human rights education there is prevalence of violations of human rights incidences of lawlessness and abuse of rule of 
law. In addition previously in Tanzania there was no clear legal framework and or national policy on legal aid. However there was only one law on legal aid which was legal aid (criminal proceedings) Act 1969. The law was very limited it was only for crimes
 with capital punishment which are murder and treason. Now Tanzania has enacted the new Legal Aid Act in March 2017 which will regulate issues related to the provision of free legal aid and paralegals in the country hence this project.70 Legal Aid provider
s organizations will be trained on the newly enacted Legal Aid Law and its regulations; Database of legal Aid providers and directory will be developed and maintained; 3000 copies of legal Aid Act of 2017 will be disseminated and made available to the publ
ic; 35 Radio and TV educational programs will be aired on Legal aid Law; the poor and vulnerable groups in the community will be informed of their legal and human rights and provided legal aid. Expected impact of the project include; enhanced capacity of L
egal Aid Providers to promote access to justice and human rights in Tanzania; increased recognition coordination and harmonization of legal aid services in Tanzania; enhanced access to justice to the poor and marginalized groups of people in the community 
and policy practice and legal framework changed for protection of women&apos;s rights and Human rights in Tanzania. Beneficiaries are NGOs providing Legal Aid. TANLAP is the implementing Agency for this project. TANLAP was selected for this support because it i
s a national network working in the legal sector which envisions a society with access to justice.</narrative>
