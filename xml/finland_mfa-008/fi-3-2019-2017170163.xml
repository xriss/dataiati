   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project is a precursor for a larger group of projects aimed at transferring Finnish know-how and technology for electric distribution networks to Indonesia. Electricity transmission and distribution have seen rapid development in the past few years but
 still the electrification percentage remains at 80-90% (depending on the source) and 10 million households don&apos;t have access to electricity. A big part of distribution is unreliable and/or implemented as microgrids. Comprehensive and reliable electric dis
tribution system is the cornerstone of modern society and efficiency of the network is a considerable environmental factor. This project focuses on project planning and identifying a local partner for delivering supporting and further developing informatio
n systems for electricity distribution.Trimble Solutions Oy has been developing and delivering information systems for electricity distribution since 1987. Trimble?s solutions are in use in more than 200 utilities in Europe and the US. Trimble has long exp
erience in delivering demanding systems mainly with own resources and through subsidiaries. The goal in this project is to grow the capabilities of a local partner so that the partner can build and expand its business around services built on Trimble?s Fin
nish technology. For the utilities these system are critical tools so the support and additional professional services need to be available locally and with short notice. Typically the systems include a maintenance contract that provides the partner with s
teady revenue for maintaining and developing resources.  The target model means a long-term partnership between the end customer Trimble and its partner.The larger group of projects targets to provide a development package containing services Finnish techn
ology and know-how with significant impact in developing the electricity distribution in Indonesia. The package will contain documenting the existing networks creating development plans renovating and building the networks as well as continuous operation. 
In all phases the local capabilities will be developed in order to ensure the sustainability of the improvements and further development.</narrative>
