   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The vision and main target of the FS Global program is to provide people with opportunities for a dignified life where all people are equal and where human rights are respected. We want to reach this goal through the activities of the program by contributi
ng to improved living conditions for people and to a change of attitudes in societies. FS Global wants to work for health and education for all people in a world characterized by democratic values and sustainable living.Our task is to help poor and margina
lized people to achieve improved living conditions. We accomplish this by strengthening local organizations and their skills and by doing so we want to influence the local civil society. We also help poor and marginalized people by helping these organizati
ons support groups and individuals. Through collaboration with both individuals and local actors we want to contribute good values.Through our program we want to contribute to a world that is more fair equal and democratic with better public health reduced
 poverty and a world that promotes human rights. Through education people are given employment and income-generating opportunities which leads to reduced poverty. Fair educational systems where girls boys and people with disabilities have equal opportuniti
es in education promote human rights and independence and offer possibilities of choice and influence in their individual lives. People have enhanced initiative and an awareness that they can influence their own situation and thereby be able to exit povert
y.We want to contribute to better public health especially among mothers and children for example through traditional health care but also by educating people on health and hygiene. Through preventive health care improved diets and eating habits we want to
 raise health awareness to make people less dependent on outside help as their own health improves. When people&apos;s living conditions improve they can experience dignity and also be met with respect in their own context.</narrative>
