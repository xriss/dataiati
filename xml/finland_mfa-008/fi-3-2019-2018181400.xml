  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">1. Project: 12002 Increased participation in Myanmars peace process in Kayin State#2. Project area and Country: Kayin State, Myanmar#3. Project justification: #Extremely poor infrastructure throughout Kayin have historically constrained access to informati
on and social services, and economic and livelihood opportunities. There is a lack of structures and trust for dialogue between right-holders and duty bearers, as well as low capacities. Most communities in rural Kayin State are not aware of the ongoing pe
ace process and public consultation is very limited. For the peace process to be successful, there needs to be buy-in and support of the wider population. While lack of awareness and access to information impacts people in remote areas equally, some groups
 are especially excluded because of ethnic, linguistic, religious, socio-economic, gender, age or other factors. Inclusion of youth and women in the national peace process is seen as a priority for most stakeholders, but barriers stemming from gender and a
ge continue to persist. #4. The main objective and expected results: #The main objective of the project is to enhance inclusion and participation of communities and civil society in the peace process in Kayin State through increased awareness, capacities a
nd opportunities. Access to information will be a contributing factor to enhanced inclusivity and participation. In addition to supporting peoples awareness of their rights, the project will also support their efforts to claim these rights and duty bearers
 capacities to act accordingly.#Both rights holders and duty bearers are engaged through a range of activities. To help ensure sustainability, local authorities are collaborated with. As the main duty bearers with regard to peoples rights, they will take a
n active role in ensuring improved compliance with existing laws, regulations and agreements. Women Empowerment Committees (WEC) are co-opted to act as a community-based platform at the village level, and they will be supported to play an active role in pr
oviding and sustaining access to information and learning in their respective communities.# 5. Right-holders/ beneficiaries: People in remote villages in Kayin State#Duty bearers: Government of Myanmar, Karen National Union (KNU)#6. Implementing partner: K
