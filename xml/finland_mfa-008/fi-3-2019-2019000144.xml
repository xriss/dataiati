  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This specific Finnpartnership project is intended to pilot the PPA business model for SLA&apos;s first customer deliveries with this business model. This pilot project will serve as a business validation project and as a reference for the following clients and 
financiers who will need to be in quickly after the first project in order to grow the business. Because of the importance of the project the customers and the target have been selected with care and also the price of electricity and hence the portability 
of the project has been somewhat tinged to the normal target level in order to remain customer relationship good and stable.The main customer of the pilot project is Barbara Cafe Hargeisa&apos;s Deero Mall. The owner of the client is SLA&apos;s long-time acquaintanc
e the owner of the customer business has also helped SLA in business development so it is expected that the customer relationship will be working. In addition electricity will be sold at least to the FlyDubai Hargeisa office (Emirates airline low cost airl
ine that also fly between Helsinki and Dubai) ans several other outlets in located in the same mall.The system itself is a 100 kW (DC) / 90 kW (AC) photovoltaic system (100 kWp panel power and 90 kW inverter power) with 221 kWh battery capacity (16 x 13.8 
kWh BYD batteries). There is more demand for electricity in the mall but the size of the project is currently limited by a roof area that does not allow a larger number of solar panels. The investment cost of the entire physical system (iron) including log
istics customs local transport installations etc. is approximately USD 206000. In addition the launch of the PPA business requires an enterprise resource planning system enabling remote reading control mobile payment etc. which will also cost USD 27000. Th
e system generates about 178000 kWh of electricity annually of which approximately 70000 kWh is sold to Barbara Cafe and the remaining approximately 110000 kWh sold to other shopping mall users already discussed and because the price of electricity from ot
her customers is remarkably high it is clear that all electricity can be sold. Negotiations for other PPAs are ongoing.</narrative>
