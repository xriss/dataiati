   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Pilot project for improving livelihoods through solar powered irrigation and market access for smallholder female and youth farmers in Western Province.Entrepreneurship and Technology Park (ETP) is a non-profit company whose aim is to improve livelihoods a
nd job creation in Zambia by promoting entrepreneurship sustainable agriculture market linkages and income generating activities and private sector-led cooperatives and linking smallholder farmers to rural financial services. The Organisation aims to work 
particularly with women and young people in rural areas to imrpove their livelihood through training and linking them to sustainable markets over the long term. ETP has a total of 14 full-time employees in Lusaka and Mongu. Under this pilot project ETP wil
l form a women and youth private sector-led cooperative composed of about 300 smallholder farmers (200 women and 100 youth). The smallholder farmers will be from within a 5km radius of Kasima in Mongu area and will form a cooperative that will use up to 40
 hectares of ETP&apos;s demonstration farm. The farm will use the two solar powered centre pivots to be purchased in this project to grow crops under rotation. In addition ETP will provide seeds land preparation some key equipment transportation of produce to m
arkets nurseries for some vegetable crops and help farmers keep production records. The pilot project will will also provide farmers with training in value addition particularly processing and packaging. The organisation has good cooperation with key partn
ers inclduing Kasisi Agricultural Training Centre (KATC) which has implemented this business model of farmers paying for irrigation services. ETP will also continue working with RUFEP and NATSAVE bank in Mongu to educate farmers on financial management and
 encourage them to save. With partner MUSIKA the project will continue to identify reliable markets for farmers&apos; crops. This project fits very well with the Zambia Country Strategy and Finland&apos;s Development Policy as it focuses on improved livelihoods for 
vulnerable persons in this case rural youth and women in an undeveloped part of the country. The project is human rights progressive and looks at women and youths&apos; rights to food and economic empowerment within the context of climate smart agricultural pra
ctices such as the use of organic fertilizers composting and solar powered irrigation and hence a promisingly holistic approach to job creation.</narrative>
