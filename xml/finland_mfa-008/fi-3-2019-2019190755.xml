   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Aware of the digital transformation and its opportunities and challenges the UN Secretary-General set up a High-level Panel in 2018. It was tasked with consulting widely with stakeholders and reporting to the Secretary-General. From the beginning Finland f
ollowed actively the Panel&apos;s work. In April 2019 Finland hosted a joint meeting of the Panel with the EU Global Tech Panel and the last meeting of the Panel itself. The meetings were financed from development cooperation funds.The Panel&apos;s June 2019 report 
has received much attention in the UN and in the media. It contains a number of recommendations that are important for sustainable development and human rights. The Secretary General has launched advocacy work to gain broad support from Member States and s
takeholders. A small unit has been set up in the Office of the Secretary-General to carry out this work and to implement the recommendations. The Panel&apos;s work relied on voluntary funding as it was not included in the UN?s regular budget. The same will appl
y to the follow-up. The unit&apos;s budget for the period 1.1.2019 - 31.12.2020 is $ 863000. Finland will support the project with ? 400000.The main objective of the project is to advance the UN&apos;s Sustainable Development Goals by enhancing digital cooperation t
hrough multistakeholder coalitions. The Panel&apos;s recommendations establish a short- and medium-term agenda for the development impact sought through digital collaboration. The agenda is comprehensive and ambitious and the Secretary General is strongly commi
tted to its implementation. Although the lead role in the multistakeholder coalitions (Champion) for each recommendation belongs to small groups comprised of Member States and different UN organizations (as well as other actors) the role of the Secretary-G
eneral&apos;s Office in ensuring coordination and coherence is vital.Therefore the main objective of the project is to optimize the coordination and coherence of a key UN process in support of sustainable development. In this way virtually all SDG?s are affecte
d: digital collaboration creates opportunities to maximize the development impact and minimize the harmful consequences of digitalization and new technologies.For the reasons stated above it is proposed that the Quality Group support the allocation of EUR 
400000 from the 2017 appropriations to the UN Secretary-General&apos;s Office to support the follow-up to the report.</narrative>
