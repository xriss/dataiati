  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Sera Helsinki creates jobs for over 160 people in Ethiopia most of them are people with disabilities (PWD). The goal of the project is to create 450 new jobs for PWDs. Globally every fifth person who lives in extreme poverty has a disability. If we want to
 reduce extreme poverty we need to find new ways how to empower PWDs. Sera Helsinki wants to have the whole production chain for PWDs starting from herding the sheep producing the thread until the carpet production. With wool production we want to empower 
100 PWDs and with thread production 300 PWDs. Sera&apos;s carpet production needs to grow and we need 50 more PWDs for carpets.The planned project is pervasive and it includes all nine phases of Finnpartnership funding. We have started identifying new PWDs at t
he countryside but it is very hard and time consuming because of the circumstances and stigmatization of PWDs at the countryside. We will do preliminary project study this means working closely with governmental officers and Ethiopian NGOs with PWDs. In th
e project study we need to find out will we establish new NGOs/businesses/communities. When we have new groups we can start making a business plan. The sheep need land for grazing and we need to figure out the environmental impacts that it has. When we are
 empowering hundreds of PWDs we want to assess the social impacts as well.Doing business is new for PWDs and for NGOs working with PWDs. This creates prejudice towards Sera Helsinki. We need to develop and train our partners to understand the possibilities
 of business better. We also continue teaching the new weaving technique for new groups of PWDs for the carpets. The equipment used at the countryside for thread production needs piloting. We need to give vocational education for PWDs to herd to sheep and 
for thread production. This means that the vocational education needs to be given in a location where the PWDs are.</narrative>
