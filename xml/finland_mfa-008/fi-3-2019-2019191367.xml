   <narrative xml:lang="EN">F.a: Establishment of zero carbon emission power plant for education and income diversification in Nepal?s Kalikot district</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project has plan to establish a 20 Kilowatt solar PV system, which would produce electricity for 200 households of Rarakatiya area in Kalikot district?s Suvakalika rural municipality in Western Nepal. Target village is far from national power grid and 
there is no agricultural machinery for food processing. Thus, people live under the poverty line, food security is poor and both children?s growth and education are lacking behind. Many young people are migrating to cities or abroad. In the project coordin
ated by local NGO HuRENDEC, a community-owned solar power plant will be built to provide lightning for 200 households and energy for hauler mill; also other small entrepreneurship will be supported. The project is expected to have positive impacts on child
ren?s schooling, food security and diversified income generation. Direct beneficiaries include 200 households including about 500 women and girls, 500 men and boys as well as 300 small children. Renewable energy and environment related knowledge will be pr
ovided for another 200 households, that already have solar lightning systems, and home gardens will be developed for 100 households. Indirectly, the project will support the wider development of the area with diversified income generation, and reduce defor
estation and climate emissions by reducing burning firewood. The project will be implemented together with district and municipality authorities, Suvakalika mothers? and youth associations and local community forestry association. Power plant operations, m
aintenance and user fees will be handled by electricity user committee, which will be registered as cooperative. Local awareness will be raised e.g. via Kalikot community radio. Aim is to make the project as an example of rural electrification in remote ar
eas of Karnali province. The project will be implemented by Kalikot-based Human Rights and Environment Development Center (HuRENDEC), hurendec.org.np</narrative>
