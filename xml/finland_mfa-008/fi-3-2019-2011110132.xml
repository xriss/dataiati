   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Phase 1 the ?hand washing with soap? (HWWS) project was successful in increasing hygienic practices and reducing health-related problems. However during this project it was noticed that a lack of clean water during the dry season was a big problem. To ensu
re the sustainability and and enhance the results of the HWWS project a continuation project is needed concentrating on water access and quality.The continuation project will take 3 years in which the intervention activities (building water supply system a
nd monitoring water quality) will be rolled-out to two communes of Lao Cai city. During the roll-out process the local authorities will gradually be given the responsibility in project management supervision of field work and field staffs as well as the im
plementation of interventions activities. It is hoped that by the end of the project all of the local stakeholders can manage operate and monitor the quality of water resources by themselves (without financial support from the project) and after the projec
t finishes they can based on their own funding or other external funding implement similar activities to expand interventions at a larger scale (whole province all people of different groups) and therefore can sustain the outcomes of this project.The direc
t beneficiaries of this continuation project are family members of the poor households in ethnic minority communities of highland villages including: heads of households (the elderly) father mothers and children who have difficulty to access clean water.Du
ring end-line workshop different project stakeholders will be invited to attend the workshop and to share lessons learned and results with CERETAD-Health. WaterFinns will use the results and experience gained in this project in its future projects.</narrative>
