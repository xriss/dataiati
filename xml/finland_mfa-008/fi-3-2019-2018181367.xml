   <narrative xml:lang="EN">1. Project: 11689 World Teacher Programme#2. Project description:#Finn Church Aid (FCA) and the Teachers without Borders (TWB) network offer teachers and educators a possibility to volunteer in developing countries. The World Teacher program (WTP) will be 
implemented in collaboration with the FCA Uganda office. The purpose of the project is to support the pedagogical capacity of the local teachers and school management. FCA will train and send 18-20 educators to Uganda for two weeks in July 2019 as part of 
FCAs programme work and the UNICEF funded SCORE-project in West Nile region, Uganda, which targets the lowest performing schools in each district. This is a pilot, previously the programme has taken place within the Dutch development NGO Edukans work.  The
 aim is to repeat similar training weeks during three years in the same schools and to achieve more sustainable results in learner-centered pedagogy and in active and positive learning methods. In 2019 the work was based on the STAR model developed by Eduk
ans, however, in 2019 FCA will develop its own model based on the new FCA education strategy.#Another aim for the project is to support global citizenship education in Finnish schools. The volunteer teachers experiences allow them to contribute to this.#3.
 The main objective and the expected results:#The main objective of the project is to promote sustainable results in the development and improvement of quality education through the increased pedagogical capacity and motivation of the teachers and school m
anagement in six targeted low-performing schools in West Nile region in Uganda. This will be accomplished through the effective promotion of learner-centered pedagogy and active and positive learning methods by the skilled and trained European teachers and
 their close cooperation with the teachers and schools management, as part of FCAs programme.#4. Project beneficiaries/rights-holders: The local teachers, headmasters and education officers who participate in the World Teacher Program and its capacity buil
ding activities, while the end beneficiaries are the learners who benefit from a higher quality education. Another beneficiary group is the Finnish volunteer teachers who participate in the programme in Uganda. #5. Implementing partners: Finn Church Aid</narrative>
