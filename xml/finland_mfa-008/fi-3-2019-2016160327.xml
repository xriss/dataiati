  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Finnish Churches for Justice and Peace (FCJP) is a human rights campaign of all churches and many Christian faith-based organizations in Finland originating in 1979. In 2017?2018 the theme of the campaign is ?Empowered by Life?. The project will be carried
 out by the Finnish Ecumenical Council (FEC) Filantropia and Caritas Finland. According to the campaign message: ?The human rights of women and the girl child are an inalienable integral and indivisible part of universal human rights.? (Beijing declaration
 1995.) By advocating participation the campaign points out that promoting inclusion of women and girls fosters peace and the fulfilment of human rights. FCJP 2017?2018 focuses on women&apos;s and girls&apos; ownership of their own lives and equal participation in s
ociety in developing countries and countries affected by conflict. The theme is illustrated by sharing real life examples of women and girls impacted by conflicts some forced to flee their homes or lured into immigrate into unhuman working conditions and e
xamples of women and girls facing various forms of violence and exploitation. The examples will highlight the importance of women&apos;s economic independence to the whole society and the importance of women&apos;s inclusion in peace processes and fostering peaceful
 dialogue in societies.  Having previously been executed as a one-year awareness raising campaign the project will now be extended into a two year advocacy campaign including a pedagogic dimension. The project adds value to the teaching of several universi
ties and colleges with lectures about the theme. Alike to previous years the campaign reaches a significant public in Christian congregations through its ambassadors communication media coverage and events. Accordingly to previous statistics FCJP 2017?2018
 will reach approx. 2 million Finns. The audience reached will be informed about the lack of women&apos;s and girls&apos; rights and the importance of gender equality for development. Problems caused by gender inequality and the necessity to promote equal rights wil
l be discussed in public. The target audience will be encouraged to take action for equality through advocacy campaigning.A grant of 61 000  euro has been given by MoFA to this two-year project.</narrative>
