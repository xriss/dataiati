   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Young people constitute one-third of the total population in Ethiopia, and especially girls and young women are the one who suffer from different harmful practices such as child marriage, female genital mutilation and gender based violence. High dropout ra
tes of girls especially in secondary education correspond directly with age of marriage. These are further complicated by limited access and poor quality of SRH information and services. The project seeks to transform the underlying social norms that contr
ibute to harmful practices and empower adolescents to realize their SRHR. Girls and boys will take an active role in challenging the status quo in their communities, through intergenerational dialogues, peer-to peer-support, awareness raising, and engaging
 in local level advocacy together with, and as a part of civil society. In order to shift the power relations and change norms in a sustainable way, the project will work closely with families, traditional and religious leaders, communities and duty bearer
s. It is implemented in 157 kebeles in Amhara, Oromia and SNNPR together with three local partners (Hundee, PADet and KMG) all of them having a long experience in respective areas and partnership with Plan International Ethiopia. By end of the project, ado
lescents have become more resilient and assertive to decide on their own lives and bodies. They have developed increased confidence and appropriate attitudes to enable them to claim their rights and will have an improved access to information and services 
relating to their SRHR. At the same time, peers, parents and traditional and religious leaders have been supported to better understand adolescent?s rights to such services. Peers, parents and traditional and religious leaders have engaged in actions that 
demonstrate values of gender equality and do not tolerate gender-based violence including HTPs. Young girls and parents have become economically more resilient and do not need to expose young girls for GBV and other HTPs. CSOs and CBOs are supported in net
working and engaging in advocacy actions to support of adolescent SRHR and the right to be free from violence. Government, local authorities and service providers? commitment and capacities have increased to implement existing laws and legislation to provi
de adolescent friendly SRH services at different levels.</narrative>
