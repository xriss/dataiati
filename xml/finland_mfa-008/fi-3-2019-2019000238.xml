   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project tackles the challenges of protecting preserving and elevating the work of HRDs in Burundi Rwanda Tanzania Kenya Uganda South Sudan Sudan Ethiopia Eritrea Djibouti and Somalia. Its overall objective is a safe working environment for human right
s defenders at imminent risk in the East and Horn of Africa through enhanced access to protection capacity building and advocacy for duty bearers to fulfil their national regional and international obligation to protect HRDs.The project is multi-modal with
 results sought under distinct output areas: 1) HRDs under imminent threat will be able to access critical emergency protective services; 2) HRDs individual and organisational capacity is built in realms of preventive security management digital security w
ellness and stress management with special output focus on country capacity in Somalia and on women?s capacity on digital security and online GBV responses and 3) closing space for civil society is countered through advocacy research secure documentation s
trategic advocacy training and online campaigning support.The project is human rights transformative based on a theory of change that human rights defenders emerging from local communities are best placed to change the norms and customs of their own commun
ities and polities. Through protection and capacity building of these human rights defenders as well as by initiating and sustaining policy dialogues at national regional and international levels the project seeks to impact root causes of human rights viol
ations. Consideration and disaggregation for gender LGBT indigenous minorities and other vulnerable groups as well as for the individuals and organs which defend their rights is represented.Project outputs and results fundamentally align with Finland?s dev
elopment cooperation policy as it provides a critical protective function enabling civil society to exist and to take risks towards its goal of realising human rights fulfilment in the region. It supports Finland?s 1st 3rd and 4th Development priorities su
pports SDG?s 5 10 16 and 17 and nearly completely overlaps with Finland?s geographic priority countries in East Africa. Internationally the project works to implement the UN Declaration on HRDs the EU Guidelines on HRDs and the African Commission on Human 
and Peoples? Rights declarations and special procedures on human rights defenders.</narrative>
