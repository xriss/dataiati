   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The purpose of the Laos Country Programme is to contribute to holistically healthier youth in Savannakhet City through the better fulfilment of childrens rights. This can be achieved through increasing capacity of young people in making healthy choices in 
their lives and by empowering youth, volunteers, parents and teachers to become active members in their society to act as strong societal advocates, especially for those who are vulnerable and in risk of social exclusion. The improved equity of the girls a
nd other vulnerable groups is emphasized. The aimed impact of the Programme is increased justice, strengthened human dignity, and peace in Laos.#The target area is located in Savannakhet city. The Programme works in close cooperation with four high schools
 and runs one youth centre, directly targeting young people, parents, volunteers, teachers and officials to ensure the wellbeing of young people. Also, awareness raising events like campaigns are organized in the district. The estimated number of community
 members benefiting directly from the Programme activities is 17 000 and the number of community members estimated to benefit indirectly is 51 000. The most vulnerable groups, such as young people with disabilities, ethnic minorities, and victims of human 
trafficking, are reached in collaboration with other stakeholders. The Programme is implemented in cooperation with the Ministry of Education and Sports of Lao PDR. However, the operations are carried out by the Fida team including local staff, trained vol
unteers, committees and expatriates. If possible, a local NGO will be established to continue the work of the Programme in the future. Since 2013, Fida International has had a Youth Resource Centre in Savannakhet to encourage the youth, offer them opportun
ities to develop their skills, and help them to adapt healthier lifestyles. Wellbeing of the members of the Centre has improved during the Projects time. Young people have learnt new skills, become more confident and active, because they have had meaningfu
l activities, such as sports, music, arts, campaigns, trainings and voluntary activities to help society.</narrative>
