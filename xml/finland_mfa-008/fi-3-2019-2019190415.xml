   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In 2014 Lao PDR was ranked 139th in the world on the Human Development Index. Amongst Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) member states only Myanmar ranked lower. Specifically Lao PDR is frequently ranked very low in terms of promotion and prot
ection of human rights. According to Lao law women and men should be guaranteed equal rights but discrimination and abuse against women is widespread through the country. Similarly ethnic minority groups especially those living in rural areas are often dis
criminated against and marginalized.The Action defines local Civil Society Groups as village level groups including VDC Disabled People?s Organisations (DPOs) and informal groupings such as youth groups and children?s clubs. The Action will target groups w
hose rights are vulnerable as well as Community Development Workers (CDWs) who work closely with children in communities. At the conclusion of the Action these groups will have gained awareness and knowledge of their own rights and those of others had expe
rience in planning and implementing micro-projects and built confidence to be involved in and communicate processes where these rights can be promoted. The Action will target VDCs to identify gaps in the attainment of human rights and development standards
 at village level. The Action will then support VDCs to work with district government and other duty bearers to incorporate activities to address these gaps in village and district planning processes. This will result in deeper and more meaningful village 
engagement that will lead to the attainment of basic human rights objectives.</narrative>
