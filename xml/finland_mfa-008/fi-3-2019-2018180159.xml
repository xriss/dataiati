   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Somalia is recovering from decades of war and collapse of state structures. The core state functions are now operating and state formation is underway. The legitimacy of the state however is still weak. Conflicts and violence remain a significant challenge
. The biggest threat is still Al Shabaab but violent conflicts between clans and militias as well as organized crime are also common. The weak security situation hampers development efforts and attempts to address the difficult humanitarian situation.Finn 
Church Aid (FCA) and the Network for Religious and Traditional Peacemakers have been active in mediation and local-level democratisation and institution building in Somalia for several years. In 2017 an expert was seconded to the Ministry for Interior Fede
ral Affairs and Reconciliation (MoIFAR) at the request of the Somali government. The expert has held a key position in the team in charge of drafting the strategy for reconciliation. During the years 2018-2019 the Ministry for Foreign Affairs of Finland ha
s supported national and local-level reconciliation processes through FCA and the Network. The first phase of the project saw the development of a nation-wide National Reconciliation Framework based on consultations with state and civil society actors. In 
February 2019 the draft was validated at a national conference in Mogadishu. Altogether 300 representatives from the federal government federal member states and civil society took part in the conference. The National Reconciliation Framework was approved 
by the Cabinet in in March 2019. It has become one of the key priorities of the Somali government and especially MoIFAR.The second phase of the project supports MoIFAR in the implementation of the national reconciliation process while advancing the partici
pation of women and youth in the process. The project also includes support to local-level reconciliation. Finland supports the second phase of the project with 461 384 euros. The project will be implemented over a period of 12 months in 2019-2020.</narrative>
