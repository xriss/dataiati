   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Unlocking doors to education for children with disabilities related to hearing and vision in Bara district Nepal</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In Nepal children are not screened for visual or hearing impairments. Knowledge of eye- and ear health is generally poor. Traditional beliefs and treatments can be detrimental to sight and vision. Having a disability is still greatly stigmatised. Although 
the majority of children in Nepal have access to education differently abled children are still mostly excluded from it. This is a major risk for marginalisation. The project which is a 2-year pilot in Bara district in the Terai region in the south of Nepa
l aims to increase the enrollment of 3 to 8-year-old children with vision or hearing impairment in public preschools. The inhabitants of the district are poor and the number of children not attending school is considerable. The majority of pupils in Bara a
re boys and the project aims to promote girls&apos; right to education.Grass-root level volunteers are educated to identify children with problems with vision or hearing. The children identified through screening are examined at eye + ear camps to diagnose cond
itions affecting sight and vision. It is estimated that most of these children have problems that can easily be cured with simple treatments. Children with a severe visual or hearing disability will undergo a 4-6 month rehabilitation to enable life outside
 home and attending school. Awareness raising campaigns regarding eye- and ear health as well as rights of disabled children will be organised among local inhabitants during the camps.This project is as a collaboration between a Nepalese NGO B.P. Eye Found
ation and PSR Finland. The collaboration was initiated from Nepal. Like the previous work of B.P. Eye Foundation this project aims to screen for and promote treatment of disabling conditions as well as contribute to a change in the Nepalese view on the rig
hts of people with disabilities remove barriers and stigmas associated with disabilities and enable children with disabilities to become productive citizens. The Department of Education (DoED) Nepal has signed a Memorandum of Understanding on implementing 
these pilot protocols in other districts in Nepal.</narrative>
