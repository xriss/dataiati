   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project will strengthen organizing in key service sectors of ASPEK, especially commerce. Special focus will be given to activating women and youth to trade union work. Capacity building and campaigning is intended to increase awareness on the importanc
e of dues collection, enhance negotiation skills and strengthen ASPEK?s regional and sectoral structures. The project will support ASPEK?s participation in tripartite and regional advocacy work for example on issues related to sectoral minimum wage and ski
lls development of workers in the sector. The challenge of ASPEK remains to be weak organizing, structural dispersion and low financial sustainability which would be needed to combat the ever-growing challenges of working life. Long-term development object
ive for ASPEK is to be a strong and financially sustainable trade union that can effectively enhance the rights of its affiliates on branch, regional, sectoral and national level. As results of the project it is expected that ASPEK improves effectively the
 working conditions in its key sectors and regions through tripartite mechanisms as well as collective agreements. Membership base in the strategic commerce sector strengthens and more women and youth participate in the decision-making bodies of the union.
 The dues-collection reaches a sustainable level so that ASPEK can continue its work independently. The beneficiaries of the project are the workers of service sector in Indonesia, ASPEK affiliate unions, leaders and activists on local, regional and nation
al level (especially women and youth). Project partners are UNI and ASPEK.</narrative>
