  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The effectiveness of the global multilateral mechanisms is challenged by shifts in the geopolitical environment, growing tensions between major powers and unpredictability, which in turn bring a serious threat to peace, stability and development in the are
a of Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) member states. Mediation actors have fragmented and exclusive dialogue between themselves in the region, with limited peer exchange and learning of best practices, as well as have limited str
uctured mediation support mechanisms able to provide rapid access to thematic and process expertise rooted in local and international networks of specialized practitioners. In this context, CMI applies efforts to create thematic and geographical platforms 
with these key actors to reflect on their strategies, practices, lessons learned and efforts in managing challenges of peace processes, security and stability in the region.  CMI seeks to support the OSCE and other regional organisations, states and actors
 to respond effectively to conflict prevention and resolution in Eurasia region. This effort involves both operational support and thematic and targeted capacity-building support, increasing linkages and fostering complementarity among regional, state, nat
ional and non-state mediating actors in the region, targeted capacity-building interactions, and knowledge sharing.</narrative>
