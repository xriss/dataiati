   <narrative xml:lang="EN">F.a: Giving voice to the youth of Sierra Leone</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project aims on giving youth in Sierra Leone a stronger voice in developing their communities and society in general through facilitating the improvement of their life-skills and education and reduction of the barriers the youth face in accessing educ
ation. The current social and economic situation in Sierra Leone has been shaped by the civil war which ran from 1991-2002. During the war mistrust between the older and younger generations was created as youth were seen to be the reason for the conflict t
o start and endure. Even after the war young people have been seen as a ?flash-point? of social instability which has been growing again since the end of the war. One of the key challenges for youth in Sierra Leone is that their education is inadequate e.g
. in terms of employablity. That leaves young people with little opportunities to contribute meaningfully in their lives and society. Resulting hopelessness and frustration create undesirable actions. This project recognizes the role of youth in the decade
-long civil conflict and offers opportunities for young people to transform their own status and other peoples&apos; perception about them.                                                                                                                          
                          The overall objective for the project is to empower the Sierra Leonean youth to engage meaningfully in decision making processes that affect their lives. Special focus is given on the most vulnerable youth that are young women and
 youth with disabilities. Especially in the rural areas of the project districts (Moyamba, Port Loko, Bo and Western Area) their rights to education and participation are violated. The approaches of the project relate to facilitation of education and life-
skills for the youth as a basis for meaningful contribution in society. Also the project aims to capacitate the youth with skills and means to participate in decision-making processes that affect their lives and the development of their communities. While 
emphasis is put on trainings and capacity building, through advocacy on education and also gender and disability related policies the project supports resolving the underlying barriers in the community, district and national levels that currently hinders y
outh accessing education. The project was initiated with help of other Finnish NGOs and Sierra Leonean community in Finland.</narrative>
