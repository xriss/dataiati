   <narrative xml:lang="EN">F.a: Strengthening Womens Political Influence in Conflict Resolution</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The inclusion of women and their interests in peacemaking is not only pivotal from the standpoint of equal rights, but also necessary for a qualitative transition process in the short and long term. Involving society at large significantly increases the le
gitimacy of a peace process and its outcomes. Women?s inclusion at these critical junctures can thus pave the way for democratization and more just, equitable societies in the long run. Against this backdrop, increasing women?s meaningful participation in 
the prevention and resolution of violent conflict has become one of the top priorities for the international community over the past two decades.  The challenge is to transform international commitments into real gains in conflict-affected countries. Build
ing on its strong track record in this regard, CMI targets support to organic national actors in targeted conflict-affected countries to strengthen the role of influential or potentially influential women in the political processes of achieving sustainable
, quality peace. Due to political marginalization, women?s collective strength is crucial to amplify their power. This is particularly challenging in socially divided societies. Flexible third-party support can foster broader coalitions of women across civ
il society, politics, and public institutions; and enable these coalitions to develop common political agendas and to effectively engage with political and institutional change processes. This requires appreciation of the plurality of women?s voices and in
terests, which is at heart of CMI?s approach. Moreover, there is a need to constructively engage with relevant power-holders to expand the political space for women?s meaningful participation in a context sensitive manner. Due to its trusted relations with
 civil society and political institutions in target countries, CMI is well placed to work with relevant decision-makers to incentivize them to foster gender-responsive structures. This project focuses on countries where CMI has wider program portfolios in 
order to capitalize on synergies between different work tracks. The project also targets technical advisory support to other CMI?s country files that could potentially lead to wider country-level engagements or to deepening integration of women?s inclusion
 in CMI country projects.</narrative>
