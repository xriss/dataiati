   <narrative xml:lang="EN">According to estimates from the World Health Organization (WHO) nearly 22 million unsafe abortions take place each year  resulting in approximately 44000 deaths and at least 7 million injuries including long-term disabilities. Unsafe abortion accounts for 
approximately 13% of maternal mortality globally and takes a far greater toll in many countries; 98% of unsafe abortions occur in the developing world. Ipas?s comprehensive approach to addressing unsafe abortion?honed throughout our successful 45-year hist
ory working in Africa Asia and LAC?can add tremendous value to the Government of Finland?s sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR) strategy by directing resources effectively to this entirely preventable global problem. Ipas implements an integrat
ed multi-disciplinary strategy to increase the availability accessibility acceptability and quality of comprehensive abortion care. Ipas?s expertise includes: ?Building the capacity of public and private health-care systems to provide integrated sexual and
 reproductive health services including high-quality comprehensive abortion care (emergency treatment for complications of unsafe abortion; induced abortion to the full extent of the law; and post-abortion contraception to help prevent future unintended pr
egnancies) by training and equipping a wide range of health-care professionals at all levels of the health-care system ? Ensuring the sustainable supply of abortion care commodities and technologies including manual vacuum aspirators and medical abortion (
MA) drugs recommended by the for abortion care?Working with communities to expand women?s men?s and young people?s knowledge of their reproductive rights and enhance women&apos;s and girls? ability to prevent and manage unwanted pregnancies including reducing a
bortion stigma and barriers that impede access to comprehensive SRHR information and care ?Strengthening capacity of local national regional and global civil society organizations to build movements in support of comprehensive SRHR advocate for reform of r
estrictive laws and policies related to abortion and contraception and promote respect for women?s human rights and full implementation of human rights standards in relation to women?s reproductive health ?Addressing women?s and girls? neglected need for s
afe abortion and contraception in humanitarian settings</narrative>
