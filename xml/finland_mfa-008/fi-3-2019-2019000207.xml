   <narrative xml:lang="EN">There is  shrinking of civic  space which is  manifested in different ways including enactment and enforcement of the cybercrime statistics and information laws since 2015 which among other things limit freedom of expression and opinion; banning on all pol
itical activities (democratization rallies) which were used in the past as platform to raise civic awareness amongst public members; and limitation of freedom of press due to alleged censorship fining and banning on some of the media outlets; hijacking and
 mysterious missing of HRDs. The worst cases of violations included direct attacks to outspoken politicians and bloggers; and generally such threats and intimidations of HRDs as making up some cases against them intimating that they are not citizens of Tan
zania.                                   The funds will contribute the achievements of  Tanzania Human Rights Defenders Coalition&apos;s  key objactives and results of their strategic plan 2018- 2022: The overal objective  of their  strategy is to improve   liv
