   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Sera Helsinki is a Finnish company that was founded 03/2016. It has two founders and ownersHanna Puharinen and Anna Suoheimo. Sera imports woolen carpets from Ethiopia to Finland.Vulnerable groups people with disabilities and single mothers in Ethiopia are
 producing Sera?scarpets. Since autumn 2016 Sera?s carpets have been sold in Finland with a good success.Sera has been an interesting subject for media and has provided good sales. At the momentSera doesn?t have carpets on stock. The carpets are produced b
y order and we have so manyorders that the delivery time is starting to be too long. We have to produce carpets with a biggercapacity because the production is very time consuming. At the moment Sera?s carpets areproduced in three workshops in Addis Abeba 
by 65 weavers.In Ethiopia the situation of women and people with disabilities is very bad. Especially peoplewith disabilities end begging on the streets. They don?t get education or jobs. Sera has wantedto improve the lives of these groups and create jobs 
for them. We have already started trainingblind weavers and we hope to train more. We have a training team of 9 people and we needsupport for them. When we are building capacity Hanna and Anna need to travel to Ethiopiaand provide education as well.We have
 wanted to give an overall support for the people with disabilities. Most of them areilliterate and don?t know how to write. This is the reason why we have connected with twoFinnish NGOs Kynnys Ry and Abilis Foundation. At the moment blind weavers are knot
ting carpets. We want that the whole carpet production is done by people with disabilities starting from the sheep owners and thread production. The resources of Sera Helsinki is not enough to do this all so we need support from our partner who have a long
 history of working with people with disabilities in developing countries.</narrative>
