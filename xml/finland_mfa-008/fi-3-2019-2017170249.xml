   <narrative xml:lang="EN">CIVICUS:World Alliance for Citizen Participation/DataShift 3.0: Using citizen-generated data to drive people-powered accountability</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">DataShift is a global multi-stakeholder initiative that leverages the potential of new technologies for more creative and effective social accountability. It does this by helping civil society organisations produce and use data especially citizen-generated
 data (CGD) to directly influence policy making on the issues that matter most to them. It is an initiative of CIVICUS in partnership with a number of other leaders in the Information Technology for Development sector. Following an initial period of intens
ive consultation and scoping DataShift has recently completed a two-year pilot implementation phase and is now in the process of scaling up its most impactful activities to new audiences and geographies. Through ground-breaking research an extensive capaci
ty strengthening programme ongoing engagement with government and other key stakeholders and extensive work on two priority thematic areas (gender equality and the protection of fundamental freedoms) DataShift has made significant gains in each of its init
ial four pilot countries and at the global level.Having focused in on which approaches are most successful and where the initiative can add the most value DataShift will employ a growth strategy that will allow it to scale activities and reach more actors 
in more countries. In addition the DataShift will work to change the way the development sectors thinks about data and accountability and ensure that citizen-generated data is utilized by other stakeholders worldwide. This strategy will involve focusing on
 four specific activity areas:  1.Continued hands-on CSO capacity building on CGD generation and use at the local level. 2.Lighter-touch large-scale virtual capacity strengthening for CSOs building core skills for CGD generation and its use in powering cam
paigns. 3.Community building and engaging high-return partners and networks including through distributed digital campaign design and execution.4.Aggregation and advocacy using CGD (primarily around SDGs 5 and 16) and support on ?CGD storytelling?.By build
ing knowledge disseminating resources and coordinating action DataShift will continue to bring people-powered accountability to the heart of sustainable development. It will work to ensure that citizen voice plays a central role in driving progress on the 
Sustainable Development Goals and that the data revolution directly engage and empower people.</narrative>
