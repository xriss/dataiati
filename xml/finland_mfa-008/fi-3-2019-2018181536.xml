   <narrative xml:lang="EN">F.a: Improving Rural Livelihoods in Nepal with Pico-Hydro               Electrification and Improved Water Mill</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project  consists of electrification of two rural villages (Nachne and Himma) in Nepals Udaipur district with pico hydro power and building of water mills for grain milling next to the picohydro plants. Very small hydropower (pico or micro hydro) is ve
ry appropriate technology in mountainous Nepal, in this project the water flow of streams is not blocked, but only small part of water flow is diverted to electricity generation and water mills. The direct beneficiaries are 155 families and the project bri
ngs remarkable social and developmental impacts into communities. Two far flung villages will receive electricity, which brings positive social benefits, promotes livelihood opportunities and reduce climate emissions by replacing the use of biomass and fos
sil fuels. Increasing of mechanical energy by constructing water mills will reduce the work load (of carrying grains for milling to other villages), enhances food security and promotes processing of agricultural products. The project will improve especiall
y womens status in communities. The expected outputs of the project are:  Installation of two Pico hydro system having 5 kW power for each project, Electricity access to 155 households for lighting, operating radio and TV, Use of low electricity such as LE
D lamps (for all households), Establishment of at least 8 home based micro-enterprises operating directly or indirectly from the use of generated electricity, Capacity development of at least 20 beneficiaries (50% at least women) for micro-enterprise and i
ncome diversification activities, Effort will be made to link the project with financing from the financial institutions, Banks specially for promoting project based enterprises, Capacity building of 8 community members as operators and technicians for ope
ration, maintenance of the Pico hydro system and house wiring related works involving women, Capacity building of local partner organization in the technical aspects of Pico hydro and project implementation. Project partner is Nepalese organisation Centre 
for Rural Technology, Nepal (CRT/N), which has a long experience with renewable energy and appropriate technology installations. CRT/N has cooperated since 1990s to develop rural conditions and livelihoods with many funding organisations and is active in s
everal international renewable energy networks. www.crtnepal.org</narrative>
