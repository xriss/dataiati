  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In the project, five solar-powered street lights as well as charging points will be installed in central village of Pimperna rural municipality. They would provide lightning for the community as well as charging points for tools, agricultural equipment and
 mobile phones. Especially mobile phones could provide better opportunities for local employment and for receiving micro credits. With the provided trainings, the aim is to identify new livelihoods especially for women and youth. The development challenges
 of the village include the climate change impacts on agriculture, lack of alternative employment and emigration of the working age people to cities and abroad. There is no national or local electricity grid in the community. The beneficiaries are the 1100
 inhabitants of Pimperna, who will benefit of street lights and charging points. The municipality and regional electricity authority will be implementing and monitoring partners. A technical group selected from the local people will be responsible for the 
admisnistration of the system and collecting the user fees. Youth group will be trained to maintain the charging points. The project will also build the capacity of municipality administration to promote renewable energy as part of the development planning
 and searching funding for it. The project will be implemented by NGO Terre Douce D?Afrique (TDA).</narrative>
