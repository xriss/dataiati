   <narrative xml:lang="EN">F.a: Intensifying Organizing in Myanmar Wood, Forestry and Construction</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Construction and wood processing industry are among the top sectors of Myanmar?s economic development and employ according to estimates at least a couple of million people. The BWI affiliate BWFM represents workers of these sectors and has, despite the rat
her difficult situation of the country, managed to achieve good results, especially in wood processing where the project work started in 2013. Later, the support has expanded to cover also construction sector where a more detailed mapping was carried out i
n 2017 to form basis for an organizing strategy. In the context of Myanmar very basic level work takes several years, before the union gains power through higher density and people?s awareness on basic rights and negotiation skills. The organizing team of 
BWFM, trained with support of the project, acts at workplace and regional level to develop local branch structures, through which company level negotiations are possible. The membership is still low, although a few thousands of people have recently joined 
the union, as the culture of fear gradually decreases. CBA negotiations are slow and tedious, but there are a few tens of agreements, and in their contents significant improvements especially in OHS. It is remarkable how strongly women participate and are 
empowered through awareness of their rights. In a country of a young population the work force is also young, and this is seen in the unions too: the young energy coupled with the experience of the elders who have been through a lot when working in exile g
ives a good basis for organizational development. When successful, the project will benefit hundreds of thousands or even millions of forestry, wood processing and construction workers. For BWI Myanmar is strategically important and it makes plenty of effo
rt to coordinate and monitor this project.</narrative>
