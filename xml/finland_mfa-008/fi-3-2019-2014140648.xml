   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The institutional capacity-building project between the MTT Agrifood Research Finland and the National Engineering School of the University of Sfax (ENIS) aims to improve the food security of Tunisia by developing a sustainable and national potato producti
on system. The ICI project builds the capacity of the Laboratory of Plant Biotechnology of ENIS to produce new national and disease-free potato varieties which are more adapted to the environmental conditions of Tunisia chacterised by drought and high sali
nity compared to currently used imported potato varieties and which have a higher tolerance to biotic stress factors. The project develops the whole potato production chain from the micropropagation technology at the laboratory level to the marketing of ne
w commercial Tunisian potato varieties in which private sector actors play a key role. The direct beneficiary of the project is the Laboratory of Plant Biotechnology of ENIS but the project will ultimately benefit the whole Tunisian population particularly
 people living in the poorest agricultural regions and small-scale farmers.  The duration of the project is three years and its budget is 690 000 euros. The activities capacity-building and training of the project aim to achieve three results: the developm
ent of the field research capacity and laboratory of ENIS particularly the establishment of the micropropagation technology for the development of national potato varieties; increased knowledge and capacity at ENIS to carry out research on potato bioactive
 compounds; and the enhancement of the production and marketing chain of Tunisian seed potato. The possible risks identified in the project include unexpected changes in the political economic or security situation of the country and challenges involved in
 the introduction of new technologies.</narrative>
