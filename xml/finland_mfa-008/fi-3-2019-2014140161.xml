  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The objective of the project is to strengthen the capacity to act of the Mozambican Confederation OTM-CS, so that it can more effectively defend workers&apos; rights, take advantage of better justified arguments in tripartite negotiations and collective bargain
ing. The project will strengthen trade union movement as workers&apos; representative and its credibility in the argumentation. Project activities consist of research and studies (constant follow-up of changes in the labour market and responses to them, as well
 as one comprehensive study per year on specific topics), training of labour researchers, distribution of studies and using them in sectorial collective bargaining processes and tripartite negotiations, training of trade union leaders and negotiators (on t
opics such as social dialogue and collective bargaining), formulating and publishing of joint  position papers of the Confederation and its member organizations, and training of trade union trainers. The trade union movement of Mozambique is weak and worke
rs&apos; rights are being violated constantly. The best way to empower workers is to strengthen the trade union movement as workers&apos; official representative. Information based on scientific research is an important tool for the trade union movement in promoting
 labour rights and in making visible the defects of the labour market structures. The project will generate as minimum four comprehensive studies on current topics related to labour markets, joint position papers of workers to labour issues, and provide su
pport to OTM-CS&apos;s member organizations&apos; collective bargaining processes. In addition, OTM-CS will advocate to improve the labour law revision in 2018, defending the benefits already gained for workers, and lobbying to include new benefits. During the proje
ct, 47 labour market researchers, 50 collective bargaining negotiators and 55 trade union trainers will be trained to improve their skills. The project will benefit Mozambican workers, the Confederation OTM-CS and its member organizations. The training pro
vided by the project will benefit particularly the three new and weak member unions: domestic workers, informal sector workers and public sector workers. Women&apos;s participation in project activities is promoted. The project is implemented by the Confederati
on of trade unions of Mozambique, OTM-CS.</narrative>
