   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In 2017, the Government of South Sudan, in concurrence by UNOCHA, has declared Unity State of South Sudan was under famine situation.
WFP estimated about 174,000 civilian population were in IPC phase 4/ 5 (famine situation) in Leer, Mayendit and Koch counties of Unity State. These counties suffered from prolonged conflicts between government forces and the opposition, leading to massive internal displacement and cut-off from humanitarian supplies at times.
Urgent response was paramount for timely life-saving assistance. 
Since early 2017, increased conflict in Wau also led to increased number of IDPs staying in Wau &#x2013; with 35000 IDPs at its peak. These IDPs were stranded in Wau town without any livelihoods means and Wau was also ranked under IPC level 4 in 2018.

After coordination with other agencies, Cordaid decided to respond in Wau (self-implementation) and Mayendit county with partner UNIDO.</narrative>
