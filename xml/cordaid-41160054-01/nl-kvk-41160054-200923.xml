   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project will have 300 direct beneficiaries in the pilot phase from the age of 15-24 out of which 70 % are girls. The number is very small compared to the unemployed youth in the City and Amhara region in general but expected to grow during the scale-up.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Triggerise Ethiopia has been awarded an innovative grant by EKN Ethiopia to implement a pilot project whose aim is to contribute to reducing youth unemployment in the cities of Addis Ababa and Bahir Dar through the use of a digital platform called the TIKO system to connect young people aged 15-24 to employability training (primarily soft skills and digital skills), short-term vocational training and structured work experience and apprenticeships and job matching. This program will primarily target unemployed urban youth aged 15-24 who have completed at least secondary school level education, reside in Addis Ababa or Bahir Dar, and are neither in education nor training. However, the program is not restricted to this target group and will seek to include opportunities for other groups by integrating with relevant programs. While Triggerise Ethiopia is active in Addis Ababa, it doesn&#x2019;t have any operational presence in Bahir Dar. Therefore, due to its strong presence and project implementation capacity, Cordiad is supporting the operational implementation of the project in Bahir Dar which has a huge scale-up potential.</narrative>
