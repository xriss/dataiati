   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Cordaid and RRAA conducted a joint multi-sector needs assessment in Ghor Province from 2 to 5 March, 2020 (annex 1). The main purpose of the assessment was to provide a quick and evidence-based overview of the current humanitarian situation in selected districts in Ghor, to identify the immediate impact of the crisis, the needs of the affected population and define priorities for humanitarian action in the sampled areas. A mix of methods, capturing both quantitative and qualitative data sets were used in the assessment. A household survey (HEAT) was used, collecting quantitative data from 121 households. Market surveys (12 in total) were also conducted across the target locations. The quantitative data was transcribed and analysed using content analysis and themes approach. While the quantitative data provided statistical impressions of the situation, the qualitative data gave explanations for the prevailing current conditions for Shelter &amp; NFI, Food Security, Protection, WASH, and Education. 
The assessment in Ghor found that 61% was under 18 years old and 50.6% was female and 49.4% was male. The respondents mentioned that conflict (54%) and drought (46%) were the main reason for their displacement. 97% of the interviewed people also indicated that they couldn&#x2019;t return to their place of origin because of conflict, drought and homelessness. The vast majority of people in the assessed areas (77%) had not received any support until date. The 23% that had received assistance in the past, indicated that they received cash and food assistance. More than half of the breadwinners (63%) are unskilled labourers and unemployment at 36% was very high. People monthly income had reduced by an average of AFN 5067 (70%) and many people had debts of AFN 2,000 or higher. Only 10% of the responding families were debt-free. In general people have drastically eroded rural livelihoods, which have pushed nearly half of the population to resort to negative coping strategies (51% was applying medium coping strategies and 44% high coping strategies), such as child labour. 70% of the children were not attending school and 30% cited that the reason for not attending school was the high costs of education. People were found highly food insecure, nearly 50% of the respondents having food stocks for 1 week and 10% having no food stocks at all. Reportedly, women were most affected by food insecurity, followed by children. The assessment indicated that 5% of the population had low or no coping Strategies, 51% had medium coping Strategies while 44% had high coping Strategies. Based on the food consumption score only 4% of the assessed population had acceptable food consumption (FCS = &gt;42.0) 52% of the population had borderline (FCS = 28.1 to 42) while 44% of the assessed people had poor consumption (FCS = 1.0 to 28) which show majority of the people in need of emergency food assistance. The lack of food is affecting women the most. The assessment also showed that food constituted the first priority of 52% of the assessed families.
Markets assessments were also conducted. Assessments showed that in all 4 target districts, markets were functional and sufficiently stocked with food and NFIs supplies. Although the markets are small, at the time of assessment, markets were not facing any shortages of commodities. However, if demand is to increase by 20% within a period of five days, markets will have difficulties to supply sufficient food and goods.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The overall objective of the project is to increase access to food of multiple shock affected people who are in IPC3 or IPC4 in Ghor, though conditional cash, contributing to a minimum household food consumption score above 42.5. This will be achieved through cash for food assistance of half food basket for 3 months, to complement beneficiaries&apos; existing food stocks.</narrative>
