   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Sierra Leone is a developing country in Africa, with a poverty rate of 54%. This is reflected in a largely informal, underdeveloped and unproductive private sector. However, the country has a vast potential for faster, more inclusive growth that could create jobs for youth, make it more competitive globally, raise tax revenues and lift it out of its dependence on international aid.

Invest Salone is working to reduce the cost and risk of doing business in Sierra Leone. It also helps firms to grow using a spectrum of tools, including brokering links between producers and buyers and technical assistance.

Invest Salone works across four key sectors: agriculture, fisheries, manufacturing and tourism.</narrative>
