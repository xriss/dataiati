   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Uganda has been hosting refugees from South Sudan, DRC, Burundi, Somali and others. The refugees are still arriving in the country especially for the DRC and South Sudan. As of March 2021, the total number has increased to 1,470,858 from 1,411,098 as of February 2020 implying that there is an average influx of 4,597 into the country every month where the majority are coming from SSD and DRC. Out of this, 62% are South Sudanese and 29% from DRC. The borders have remained closed for asylum since March 2020 due to COVID-19. However, spontaneous movements to and from South Sudan and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) continued through porous border points. 
With COVID-19, by the end of March 2021, there were 41,016 confirmed cases in Uganda, of whom, 399 were refugees and 293 humanitarian workers. Deaths reported were 335 since March 2020, including 7 refugees and 1 humanitarian worker. A total of 80,836 people had been vaccinated by the end of March 2021, including 542 refugees and 1,080 humanitarian workers.
It is also important to note that since the beginning of 2020, many INGOs (International Non-Governmental Organisations) and NGOs have phased out their implementation due to reduced donor funding.
The ongoing influxes have continued to tremendously increased demand for service provision in both the refugees and Host communities. 
Currently, on average over 20 million litres of potable water are supplied daily to refugees living in the settlements by WASH partners, ensuring a per capita access of about 16.5 litres per person per day, through almost 100 water systems. But this effort has not yet brought the water coverage to 20 Litres per person per day which is the UN standard. To realize long term clean water sustainable solution and to decrease the carbon footprint, efforts are made by the Ministry of Water and Environment, UNHCR  and other sector players to solarize water supply systems for both refugees and Host communities.
The sector aims at ensuring that refugees and hosting populations have safe and sufficient access to quality water and to improved sanitation and hygiene services, including at household level and in institutions such as schools and health facilities. The overall goal is to ensure that refugees can fulfil their basic right to water, sanitation, and hygiene, in line with Sustainable Development Goals 6.</narrative>
