   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In the National Development Plan 2018-2027 (NDP Burundi 2018-2027), strengthening the education system is one of the national priorities.  Its strategic objective is to develop an efficient education system that meets national needs and international standards. Since 2005, a major reform involving the abolition of school fees in primary education and the introduction of the basic cycle from 2013-14 has made it possible to achieve a high gross enrolment rate for the first six years of basic education. However, the number and quality of infrastructures have not kept pace with this, resulting in a critical shortage of classrooms and latrines that meet standards. Indeed, in 2019, the 4091 basic schools had 35 212 classrooms and 25 123 pupils, i.e. 72 pupils per class. In addition, the statistical yearbook for the 2019-2020 school year reports that out of 1697 schools, schools have an average of only 0.7 toilets for girls and 1.4 toilets for boys in good condition per school. In addition, a significant number of schools are regularly hit by bad weather, for example during the 2019-2020 school year, out of 4,359 schools, 361 (or 8%) including 781 classrooms were hit by bad weather.</narrative>
