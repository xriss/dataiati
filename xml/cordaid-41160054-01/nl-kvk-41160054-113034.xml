   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Syria is entering its fifth year of conflict in 2015. Humanitarian needs have increased twelve fold since the 
beginning of the crisis, with 12.2 million in need of humanitarian assistance, including 7.6 million internally 
displaced persons and more than 5.6 million children in need of assistance. An estimated 4.5 million people are 
in need of humanitarian assistance in hard to reach areas and locations. Food security remains of the primary 
humanitarian needs among IDPs. 
The main constraints affecting food security in Syria, are both on the demand-side and supply-side. The primary 
constraint in accessing food across Syria is economic. With decreased income-generating opportunities and 
increasing prices, households are experiencing increasing difficulties in meeting basic food requirements. On 
the supply-side, inadequate levels of local food production are reported as one of the main issues affecting 
food availability. Lack of inputs, reduced availability of products on the market, and reduction in cross-border 
access all severely affect the supply-chain</narrative>
