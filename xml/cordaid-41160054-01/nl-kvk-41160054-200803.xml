Short-term Objective:

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The humanitarian context in Ethiopia has been dominated by multiple factors including climate change, local ethnic conflict, and high level of displacement which in some cases have overlapped or exacerbated each other. The combination of more intense and frequent climate-related shocks, violent conflicts and instability, natural resource degradation and other socio-political vulnerabilities have led to a protracted crisis and high levels of fragility in the Liben Zone of Somali Region and bordering Zone of Oromo Region. Furthermore, as the consequences of the protracted crises the number of Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) increased in the past five years. In late 2016 tensions over territorial issues and unresolved inter-ethnic conflict between the Oromo and Somali people were exacerbated by a prolonged drought and increased competition for scarce resources, leading to clashes between the two communities which displaced over 80,000 in December 2019. Cordaid Ethiopia has been implementing separate humanitarian aid and resilience programs along the border of the Oromo and Somali Regions as people have started to return to their villages. This project will allow Cordaid Ethiopia to showcase how it can implement the triple nexus approach in area of fragility by linking humanitarian aid interventions with activities that enhance community resilience and addressing conflict risks. Humanitarian aid will address the temporary urgent basic needs for WASH, food and basic livelihood restoration (livelihood kits) for the affected people with special focus on the most in need while reducing the level of negative coping mechanism. The resilience component will ensure that the basic needs are sustain through more sustainable WASH services and livelihood (livestock, agriculture, off-farm and non-farm) support for communities affected. Mainstreaming conflict resolution and peacebuilding activities will be also crucial for contributing to conflict mitigation in the future. With the recent opening up of the government for CSOs to be engaged in peacebuilding, this project plans to ensure conflict mitigation is incorporated in the humanitarian response activities such as repair or construction of community WASH and infrastructure. The project will also support livelihood security activities of the returnees. The focus will be on activities that address vulnerability before, during and after crises. The humanitarian action will adopt a conflict-sensitive strategy, enabling aid delivery respectful of humanitarian principles, while laying the foundation for livelihoods and peace activities, avoiding negative impacts, and maximizing positive ones. Additionally, Cordaid and local partner RACIDA, together with the target population, informal justice actors and local government, will work on conflict risk analysis and conflict risk reduction (mitigation) activities. 
Longstanding ties between Oromo and Somali communities were in constant challenge by extreme attitudes affecting peaceful coexistence between these communities. Traditional justice structures were used by communities to resolve disputes especially in remote areas where there are limited law enforcement facilities. However, these informal structures have not been supported to function effectively so this will one pathway the project will address. The project will be implemented in kebeles in Liben zone of Somali Region bordering the Oromo Region where IDPs have returned. Cordaid Ethiopia plans to work in partnership with RACIDA in this project to build on the pilot started in 2019, ongoing resilience programming in the area as well as the ongoing capacity building activities in the SCORE project. No major risks are foreseen in the project area with the cessation of hostilities between the two communities and the ongoing concerted efforts of the government on addressing internal conflicts in the country.</narrative>
