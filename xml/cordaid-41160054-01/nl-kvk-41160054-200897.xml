   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Since 2003 continuous conflict, instability and less Government attention severely affected agriculture and agro-based industry in Iraq. Whereas use of low-quality inputs, low yield, limited protection of national products and cheap import of agricultural products restricted growth of agro-based industry and high-quality agricultural production in Iraq.

The project will be focusing on the increased farm production of at least 400 small-holder farmers including farmers at Ataa AlKhaleej farm and agricultural area around Latifaya farm and in Al Rasheed area. To increase crop yield, the project will encourage farmers to use improved agriculture inputs e.g. Dutch seed potatoes from Interseed Holland company (Consortium private partner) and advanced agricultural mechanics. The improved yield will be sold to food processing businesses and to crop retailers in local market &#x2013; the businesses will establish contract farming with targeted farmers groups.
ZOA, together with Cordaid and Al Khamiyat and Interseed will train and encourage farmers to participate in the project by attending on-farm capacity building training sessions, forming farmers groups and by adopting advance agricultural and irrigation methods for potato crop.

As a result, 100 farmers and their families, currently not being able to farm on their land, or having a limited yield, will be able to increase their income by more than 50% and more 30% of their farm production. Whereas all 400 farmers will learn climate smart agriculture practices to enhance their farm production.

The project contributes to National Development Plan 2018-2022 for agriculture sector and is in line with the policy of the Netherlands Development Cooperation for Iraq, which focuses on the development of the agriculture sector and stimulating employment and entrepreneurship opportunities in Iraq. The project and partnership contribute to SDGs 5, 8 12 and 17 by improving agricultural practices and engage local businesses.</narrative>
