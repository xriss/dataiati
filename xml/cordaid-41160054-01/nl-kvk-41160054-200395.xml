   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Severe drought conditions continued to affect Somalia as a result of 4 seasons of poor rains in the south Somalia Region. Recurrent drought and subsequent famine risk have become devastating and increasingly unsustainable cycle in Somalia in recent decades. Coupled with increased insecurity in parts of South central Somalia, internal displacement has been on the rise reaching 2.1 million by end of 2017. Out of this over one million were displaced in 2017 (UNICEF Somalia Humanitarian report for 2017). Based on Oct, 2017 Displacement Situation report for Gedo region, there are approximately 168,000 IDPs in Gedo with 56% being from rural Gedo, 34% from Bay and Bakool regions and 4% from other regions of Somalia. Water remains among the 5 top priorities needs for the IDPs with food and medical services being the top most priorities. As of January 2018, Kabasa was home to 5500 households while Qansahley was hosting 2900 households (IOM-ICCM Gedo, Jan 2018). A report by FEWSENT on February &#x2013; September 2018 outlook indicates a likelihood of further deterioration in food security in the absence of assistance. IGAD ICPAC that predicts a normal to below normal rainfall season between March and May 2018 in much of Somalia. Despite the improvements owing to the humanitarian assistance in 2017 approximately 2.7 million are in need of emergency assistance through the lean season. Continued assistance is needed in 2018 to prevent further deterioration and by so doing protect lives as well as livelihoods. Historic levels of humanitarian funding, large scale and sustained famine prevention efforts and easing drought as a result of below average yet better than expected Deyr rains, helped reduce the risk of famine in year 2017. However, the fragile gains could easily be reversed and nearly 500,000 people in IPC 4 (Emergency) might face a catastrophe, if aid is not sustained.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project intends to reach approximately 1050 children with severe acute malnutrition from about 890 households who will be direct beneficiaries. The 890 household will where this children come from will therefore be the indirect beneficiaries.

Trocaire proposes to continue provide lifesaving Nutrition services in the IDP camp and other affected population in Luuq district targeting children under the age of five years with severe acute malnutrition. Currently, Trocaire is supporting five nutrition sites providing this service. However, Trocaire has applied for additional funding to support IDPs in Luuq and if this succeeds, the number of sites is likely to increase to about nine sites. Targeting for the intervention will be done using middle upper arm circumference (MUAC) and weight for height standard deviation and in line with the Somalia guidelines for management of acute malnutrition. This will bridge the gap in supplies that is anticipated because of increased caseload. Tr&#xF3;caire will integrate its nutrition activities with WASH and health activities which Trocaire is also implementing in order to provide a holistic intervention aimed at reducing malnutrition, morbidity and mortality rate as well as in reducing the risk of another AWD/Cholera outbreaks that could occur as a result of flooding.

The average caseload for severe malnutrition in Luuq has been 525 per month with an average of 50 new cases per month. With the current situation and a scale up to the IDPs, the above is likely to increase to an average caseload of 750 per month and at least 75 admissions per month. In this project we are therefore targeting to reach 1050 children with severe acute malnutrition in the next four months with 300 of the target being new cases.</narrative>
