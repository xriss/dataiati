   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Primary Healthcare for returnees and host communities of Ninewa</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Despite the ongoing crisis, the fact that thousands are able to return to their places of origin is a sign of hope. The majority of returnees are concentrated in 3 governorates: Salah al-Din (53%), Ninewa (24%) and Diyala (15%). The 3 most reported reasons for return are: the possibility to recreate economic activities (livelihoods) (35%); safe conditions in the area of return (25%); and a decision to stay after checking the conditions of residence (16%). Returnees face risks such as physical danger, legal entanglements with the local authorities, threats from armed groups, and even targeted violence on the basis of ethnoreligious affiliations. The Health system in Iraq and especially in Kurdistan is facing major challenges and gaps mainly due to the humanitarian and economic crises. All levels of health care services are overloaded and their capacity is exhausted, there is huge and immediate need to support in provision of essential and life-saving medications and laboratory equipment and tools. There has been a huge wave of migration of the health personnel especially medical doctors due to cut down and delay in provision of their salaries. Since the private sector is small and also affected by the economic crisis was not able to absorb or contribute to encouraging the health personnel to stay. Another challenge for the health system is lack of appropriate health awareness of the community and bypassing of the primary health care levels and seeking secondary and tertiary levels. Health system in Kurdistan does not have capacity to provide healthcare for all. Health system in Ninewa is destroyed by the war (infrastructure is destroyed, loss of equipment and resources, lack of sufficient health personnel because have not received their salaries for last 2 years).</narrative>
