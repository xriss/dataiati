   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The humanitarian situation continues to deteriorate in Afghanistan. This is caused by on-going fighting between ISIS/ Taleban and Afghan Forces. 
One of the provinces severely affected by the fighting and ISIS clearance operations is Nangarhar province. Most of the districts in Nangarhar were under the control of ISIS or either Taliban where humanitarian and development actors were not allowed to operate since 2014. Because of unavailability of basic services in these (formerly) ISIS/Taliban controlled areas, the situation deteriorated and people lost access to basic services including access to basic WASH services. In 2019 ISIS were defeated and their stronghold Achin district was cleared by the Afghan security forces. The security forces extended the cleanup operation to Speen Ghar, Nazyan, Deh Balah and Pachir-u-Agam districts. These districts were also cleared and became accessible by the aid agencies.
Cordaid started working in a formerly ISIS held areas last year, providing food and WASH assistance in Achin where nobody received any assistance since 2014. Cordaid together with RRAA conducted an assessment in other recently cleared districts in Nangarhar during January 2021 and found the urgent WASH needs in Speen Ghar, Nazyan, Deh Balah and Pachir-u-Agam districts.</narrative>
