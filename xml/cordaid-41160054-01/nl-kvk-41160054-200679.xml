   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Addressing Needs of Returning Conflict-Affected IDPs in Somali Region</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Conflict in the Oromo and Somali regions in the past few years caused major displacement and with the cessation of hostilities, IDPs have moved back to their villages where shelter, water and sanitation and community infrastructure have been damaged or destroyed. IDPs from the Oromo and Somali ethnic groups have returned in these villages and where they have co-existed in the past, inter-ethnic relations have been affected by the recent conflict and displacement. Additionally, with the recent opening up of the government for CSOs to be engaged in peacebuilding, this project plans to ensure conflict mitigation is incorporated in the humanitarian response activities in the repair or construction of community WASH and infrastructure.

 This project primarily aims to address humanitarian needs of returning IDPs while also piloting in Ethiopia the new Cordaid focus on triple nexus approach. The project will be implemented in villages in Liben zone bordering the Oromo and Somali region where IDPs have since returned. Cordaid Ethiopia plans to work in partnership with RACIDA in this project to build on the ongoing resilience programming in the area as well as the ongoing capacity building activities with RACIDA in the SCORE project. No major risks are foreseen in the project area with the cessation of hostilities between the Oromo and Somali ethnic group and the recent concerted efforts of the government on addressing internal conflicts in the country.</narrative>
