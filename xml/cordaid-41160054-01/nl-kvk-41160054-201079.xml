   <narrative xml:lang="EN">MUF Coop thus needs a well-trained pool of experienced lead farmers and extension staff, ready to take on board and induce systematically new lead-farmers (especially women) to reach out in a pyramid system to at least 10% of the members in Heho region in one year and realise with them the required increase in production and food quality. And we need to be able to organize this service within the cooperative in a sustainable manner. 

The aim is to create a more sustainable form of horticultural crop production through technical training to ensure year-round production in protected structures, optimize the use of fertilizers, water and plant protection chemicals. Finally, to ensure the production of healthy and safe products for the consumers.  Therefore, this training program will contribute to enhancing food and nutrition security as efficient extension is expected to contribute to overcome inefficient production and to reduce its reliance on natural resources.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">MUF Coop was originally set up in 2010 representing a farmer group named Heho Fruit Flowers and Vegetables Producers Cluster which has 800 producer&#x2019;s farmers. Due to restructuring, it was formed as a cooperative in 2019 but it is still representing the Heho Fruit Flowers and Vegetables Producers Cluster.

As a well-established organization, it listens to its members&#x2019; needs and also has eagerness to learn and improve operations. For MUF Coop&#x2019;s growth and realization of its ambitious long-term plan to bring their members to a higher level innovation and modern growing techniques are key. 

MUF Coop has the scale to facilitate training to its members to create a more sustainable form of horticultural crop production. Through technical training MUF Coop aims to ensure year-round production in protected structures, optimize the use of fertilizers, water and plant protection chemicals. So on, productivity has a chance to increase and the food quality will improve to ensure healthy and safe products to the consumers. 
MUF Coop&#x2019;s ambition is to train on indoor crop cultivation, making Heho&#x2019;s agricultural activities more sustainable, increase productivity and making its members less dependent on changing climatological conditions. Its potential outreach, through the 10 villages, is promising.</narrative>
