  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Objective: The overall objective is to strengthen resilience of vulnerable farmers, IDPs and pastoral communities to human induced and natural disasters, through improved early warning system bridging scientific forecast for grassroots user, so as to reduce their loss in livelihoods means and threat to basic needs (food and water) due to hazards.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">People in South Sudan face multiple natural and man-made hazards. Over the past 30 years, the country has been among the most rapidly warming locations on the globe, with temperatures increasing as much as 0.4&#xB0;C per decade. (South Sudan INC Report 2018). Regional analysis by ICPAC showed that summer rains in South Sudan declined by 15&#x2013;20 percent, and temperatures rose by &gt;1oC. Rainfall pattern has become increasingly erratic, increasing the incidence of both floods and droughts. Frequency and severity of extreme climate events and depletion of natural resources have increased leading to i) internal conflict among communities as a result of competition for scarce natural resources will increase in certain parts of the country, (ii) water flow in major rivers is reducing and small streams in parts of South Sudan are drying up, thus causing water scarcity, (iii) higher incidences of disease spread such as cholera, typhoid and dysentery as a result of droughts and floods, and (iv) prolonged droughts in addition to human starvation are causing food crises, loss of livestock, internal displacement and migration of people to neighboring countries. 
Droughts, floods, pollution, deforestation, and conflicts have worsened South Sudan&#x2019;s humanitarian crisis, food insecurity and jeopardize the livelihoods of over 90 percent of the country&#x2019;s 12 million people (South Sudan State of Environment Report, 2018). The situation is being worsened by the return of over 2 million refugees and internally displaced people (IDPs) and migration of pastoralists with their cattle, in search of water and pasture in the dry season invading agricultural land, leading to further tensions and conflicts. These unplanned internal and external migrations of people and their livestock are one of the major sources of conflict in the country as the migratory routes have changed due to conflict - thus causing conflict between the host communities, IDPs, and migrating people at the local levels over access to natural resources. Moreover, due to droughts and floods, people are being internally displaced or migrating to neighboring countries. This human displacement puts further pressure on scarce natural resources. 
The impact of these events is further induced by the vulnerable socio-economic conditions the people live in and by the degradation of and reduction in ecosystem goods and services from natural resources.  
Development partners, including Cordaid, have tried to address the effects of these hazards by supporting the host communities and IDPs to anticipate risks and implement preparedness and mitigation measures, adapt to changing risks, and transform systems and structures to address underlying factors and root causes. One key challenge for farmers and pastoralist communities is the lack of climatic information as well as early warning indicators on rainfall patterns, seasonal forecasts on vegetation coverage, and water source&apos;s availabilities especially during the dry season, magnitude, and severity of droughts and flooding. People have to depend on traditional knowledge to anticipate hazard events. 
Thus, the key problems are a high disaster risk due to frequent occurrence of drought, flood and conflict hazard events, high vulnerability due to limited access to water and other natural resources, and livelihood/food insecurity, and an inadequate capacity to manage this disaster risk due to lack of sufficient and reliable data to inform pastoralist about migratory routes, to feed early warning and provide knowledge about appropriate early actions, and to support proper, fact-based, participatory disaster risk analysis and joint action planning.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Total beneficiaries: 36000 people 
Women:  10000 
Children: 18000 
Men:          8000 
Elderly: 
Disabled:  
 
Explain how direct beneficiaries are selected or targeted: 
 
For the selection of beneficiaries, Cordaid will directly work with lead farmers, CMDRR committees, FEMA groups, RRC, representative of local authority and community leader. The climate /weather information once generated, will be disseminated through that project networks to the farmers and general publics.  
 
The actual location of the early warning system will be selected in consultation with the local community, meteorological department and relief and rehabilitation commission (RRC).</narrative>
