   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The southern &amp; south-western coastal areas of Bangladesh are particularly vulnerable to cyclones, in terms of frequency, intensity, uncertainty and scale of impact. Among coastal populations, poor people who rely on small scale agriculture and wage labor are the main victims of cyclones. In most cases of cyclone hit, they lose all of their means of livelihood. The proposed action intends to strengthen resilience of institutions and cyclone vulnerable communities through improving DRM governance. It aims to improve local DRM governance by strengthening institutions/communities in identifying &amp; managing risks through FBA. This will enable coordination and collaboration between FbF/A taskforce, implementing agencies, communities and the local authorities.</narrative>
