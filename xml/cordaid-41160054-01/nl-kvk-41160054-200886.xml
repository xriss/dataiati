   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Cordaid conducted rapid needs and market assessments in Kunduz and Nangarhar. 
Kunduz (annex 1): Cordaid conducted a rapid needs and market assessment in Kunduz City, Imam Sahib, and Khanabad in September 2020. A household survey (ICCT endorsed tool HEAT) was used to collect quantitative data from 1,263 HH by 4 teams consisting of 12 people (8 males and 4 females) and 9 market surveys. The assessment found 98% of the respondents is recently displaced, mentioning conflict as the main reason for their displacement. . 70% of the HH has a poor food consumption score and only 9% has an acceptable food consumption score. . With winter arriving soon, there will be even less job possibilities. Consequently people are resorting to negative coping strategies: 67% of the respondents stopped sending their children to school in order to be able to work and ensure to meet the basic needs of the household. 96% borrowed money or asked help form neighbours for food and household essential needs. Many HH (79%) are living in rental accommodation but 60% cannot afford the rent and is at risk of eviction. 25% is living in overcrowded shelters, representing a protection risk for women and girls in particular as they lack privacy and dignity. People&#x2019;s top 3 reported most critically needed NFIs during the last winter period was firewood/charcoal/gas for heating (72%), blankets &amp; quilts and winter clothes (49%) (REACH Winterization evaluation). This is confirmed by Cordaid assessment, almost all respondents mentioned to be in need of winterization assistance. Market assessments showed markets are functional and are sufficiently stocked with food and NFIs supplies. Market traders are getting their goods regionally (Kunduz main market, Kabul) or abroad (Tajikistan) and are able to restock. Transportation is expensive and prices have increased over the past 6 months.
Nangarhar (annex 2): A multisectoral needs assessment in Achin, Nazyan, Kot and Batikot was conducted from March &#x2013; August 2020. In total, 1,273 HHs surveys were conducted and 12 market were assessed. 1/5 of the HH reported having at least 1 member with a disability or chronic illness (REACH). Because of high coping strategies (82% of the respondents are resorting to negative coping mechanisms) combined with the majority of the people (83%) having a poor food consumption score and 99% having no food stocks, people in the assessed areas are severely and acute food insecure. With the lean season ahead job opportunities are likely to reduce further. Although the majority of the people is living in houses, more than half of them live in partially destroyed shelters and nearly half of them are living in one-room shelter. With winter arriving soon, the assessed people raised the need for heating materials (69%), and warm clothes (87%). With reduced income, increase in cost of living and limited job opportunities (2/3 is unemployed) people lack the means to protect themselves against winter. The respondents mentioned that they are inclined to reduce the number of meals (27%) per day potentially exacerbating their already precarious food security situation with Nangahar in IPC3 level. Or, they will be incurring debts (13%). 96% will send the children out to collect fire wood, potentially increasing protection risks for their children. 
Market assessments showed that in all 4 districts, markets were functional and sufficiently stocked with food and NFIs supplies. Marko and Jalalabad were the main markets supplying materials to the districts market. Although the markets are small at district level, they have the capacity of restocking within 24 hours. During the lockdown the markets were functional and accessible because of the remoteness (rural) but it had some impact because dependent on the major cities (Jalalabad, Kabul and Peshawar) and the prices were gone up- as indicated in the JMMI</narrative>
