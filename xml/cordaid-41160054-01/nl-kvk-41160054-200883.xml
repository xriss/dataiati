   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Pigi/Canal county is one of the Nine most affected counties in Jonglei state. In Pigi/Canal County, 78,000 people have been displaced, 191 tons of cereal production lost (32% of total county production) and 5,286 reported total number of animals that died amongst 72,366 affected animals. The most affected locations in Pigi/Canal include Kurwai, Wunlel, Dhiel, Panam and Khorfulus. The impact of the flood exacerbates on the IPC 4 July-September projections of Canal/Pigi County. In addition, the flood has displaced thousands of people with women and children the most affected, houses are destroyed, properties lost, and water infrastructures are made unsafe for drinking. The lack of shelter and safe and sufficient drinking water is a major public health risk, as people cannot protect themselves against the weather and waterborne diseases are on the rise. There is also a spike in malarial cases. Women, children, elderly and disabled are disproportionately affected by the floods, violence, and displacement, making them extremely vulnerable for (S)GBV increasing their protection needs.
Despite already efforts to assist people from some of the affected counties, no assistance has reached people of Pigi/Canal County to date. As such, 78,000 people in Pigi/Canal are in immediate need of food assistance as well as seeds and fishing gears to allow them to rebuild their livelihoods. Household water treatment products including WASH NFIs are needed as well, to ensure immediate access to safe drinking water as water infrastructures are being restored. People also need Shelter and non-food items to ensure proper shelter and protection against weather, reducing protection risks of women, girls, boys and the elderly who are disproportionately affected. Lack of proper shelter and non-food items of recent have seen rise in many cases of pneumonia, Rheumatoid and Malaria among the elderly and children. Furthermore, lack of safe water and sanitation facilities is a major public health risk with a looming outbreak of cholera.</narrative>
