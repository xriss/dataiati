   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Cash grant for Livelihoods and Food vouchers: This project plans to assist 600HHs who were the FS beneficiaries of 2017 in Wau and Upper Nile (under SHO &amp; SSJR3) to move from emergency phase to recovery by restoring their livelihood capacities or having food consumption improved. Some of these 600 beneficiary households can become more self-reliant and do not need to rely on external assistance on food. Some of those 600 households who do not have the capacity to take up cash grant to develop their livelihoods at this stage, they will be provided with food vouchers to improve their food security.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Cordaid South Sudan has to upgrade the equipment and skills in provision of safe water supply to the most vulnerable. In acute emergencies (e.g. massive IDP movements), emergency water supply units like Village Drill are required to provide timely support. For host communities that have hosted IDPs for longer period, many of them have boreholes beyond repairing, and a rig for drilling boreholes is required. We have visited discussed with IOM on the use of Village Drill in Unity which found that the boreholes done by Village Drill are efficient and effective. We have also consulted Dorcas who has a rig for drilling boreholes in Wau and it is feasible for NGOs to operate. It is more cost-effective in the long run. 

As there are more IDP movement in Upper Nile, one VillageDrill system is requested to be procured and preposition in our Malakal office (Upper Nile). In places like Guit of Unity, there are only 2-3 functional boreholes for the whole county and the prominent needs all voices is to have new boreholes to survive. One rig is requested to be procured and preposition in our Bentiu office (Unity), which can then serve 3-4 nearby counties including Guit. We talked with WASH cluster and NGOs (Dorcas) running rig to confirm this is feasible. Training for staff, and drilling on operations will be conducted before deployment. 

Without such equipment, we are considered by cluster with similar capacity as national NGOs (e.g. UNIDO can do what we are doing - borehole rehabilitation), and we could not demonstrate our capacity to intervene in where there are outstanding needs in WASH.
