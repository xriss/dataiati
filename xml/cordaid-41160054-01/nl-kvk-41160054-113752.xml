   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project will fund the handling of cash and the payment of subsidies to health providers in the three health regions (2,3 and 6) in which, under projects funded by the World Bank, Cordaid is already fulfilling the functions of contracting health providers and verifying the results agreed.
