   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Marib is located 173 km northeast of Yemen&#x2019;s capital, Sana&#x2019;a. The governorate is severely affected by the conflict and divided into Houthi and Yemeni government-controlled areas. Renewed hostilities since early September have significantly impacted civilians living in parts of Marib, inducing casualties and displacement as well as restricting civilians&#x2019; movements and humanitarian organizations&#x2019; access to people in need. Critical infrastructure such as bridges and roads have also been damaged and destroyed. 

According to the Executive Unit for IDPs Camps in Marib Governorate, nearly 54,502 people (8088) HHs were displaced in Marib governorate since September&#x2013; the highest displacement rate recorded in the governorate in a single month this year.  

This humanitarian crisis has acutely worsened due to the conflicts taking place in the southern districts of Marib including Al Abdiyah as well as Harib, Al Juba and Rahabah. People of such districts have been badly affected as, according to the IOM&#x2019;s estimation, over 4,200 people fled these districts in September, mostly towards safer areas in Marib City, Al Jubah and Marib Al Wadi districts. These districts already hosted large populations of internally displaced people (IDPs) prior to this latest escalation, with 602,000 IDPs in Marib City, 9,300 IDPs in Al Jubah District and 101,000 IDPs in Marib Al Wadi District.  

Marib City is one of Marib districts that require emergency aid due to the large number of IDPs there. 70% of IDPs located in Marib city and Marib Al Wadi. Estimates of the number of IDPs in the districts vary greatly, but the local authority in Marib city puts numbers there as high as 1.5 million people. The districts are classified IPC3+, 65% of its population is acutely food insecure and 76,000 people require food assistance. 

 

INGOs and CSOs have started up interventions to respond to this humanitarian crisis. RRM interventions were implemented targeting 1,501 HHs. But a gap remains there to target 6,587HHs more. The already implemented shelter interventions targeted 486 HHs, while there is a need for more interventions to target 7,602 HHs. The NFIs interventions targeted 1,320HHs, while 6,768HHs are still in need for NFIs interventions. The food interventions targeted 2,380 HHs, while there is a need for more interventions to target 5,708HHs.There have been interventions Water (drink and use) targeted 312 HHs, while there is a need for more interventions to target 7,776HHs. The sanitation and latrine interventions targeted 123 HHs, while 7,965HHs are in need for such interventions. There is also a need for mobile clinics and medical supplies. The protection needs include livelihood, CFW, PSS, child friendly spaces, women friendly spaces, rent assistance, cash assistance, legal assistance and advice. 

IOM reported the need to urgent operation health facilities nearest to IDPs sites with primary health care(Medicines, Medical supplies and incentives health workers)&#x202F; for providing health services to match the need in several health facilities such as: 
*&#x202F;&#x202F;&#x202F;&#x202F;&#x202F;&#x202F; Al-Khusseif, Al-Maneen and Jaw Naseem health units in&#x202F;Marib&#x202F;city. 
*&#x202F;&#x202F;&#x202F;&#x202F;&#x202F;&#x202F; Operational Emergency field hospital at Al-Jufinah IDPs Camps 
*&#x202F;&#x202F;&#x202F;&#x202F;&#x202F;&#x202F; Al-Khasha&apos;a HU, Salwa HU, Al-Qasha&#x2019;a Al-Bard, Al-Huddn Aal Hamd, Al-Saqet, Al-Marda&apos;a, Al-Hani health units. (High  priority) 
*&#x202F;&#x202F;&#x202F;&#x202F;&#x202F;&#x202F; Al-Jathwah Hospital (Al-Shaheed Mohammed Al-Dorah). ( High priority)

*&#x202F;&#x202F;&#x202F;&#x202F;&#x202F;&#x202F; Operational emergency and ICU department in general Kara Hospital(Referral)-Marib&#x202F;city. 
*&#x202F;&#x202F;&#x202F;&#x202F;&#x202F;&#x202F; Al-Huzma&#x2019;a Hospital -Marib&#x202F;Al-Waddi district.( high priority) 
*&#x202F;&#x202F;&#x202F;&#x202F;&#x202F;&#x202F; medicines and medical supplies especially with IEHKs and medicines and material supplies. 
*&#x202F;&#x202F;&#x202F;&#x202F;&#x202F;&#x202F; Incentive&#x2019;s health workers especially in secondary health care. 
 

The number of new IDP arrivals is growing and exceeds the current capacity of existing partners. Increased influx of IDPs into overcrowded sites stretches response capacity. Under normal circumstances, Marib city and Marib Al Wadi can be accessed via four routes. Three of these are now affected by increased fighting and related safety concerns, leaving only one accessible route to the east &#x2013; from Marib city to Marib Al Wadi and on to Al Abr and Hadramawt governorate.  

Such a situation together with the possibility to have access to the vulnerable including the IDPs as well as the stability of this district motivates YWBOD and Cordaid to have interventions there. Cordaid&apos;s partner YWBOD has access and is able to respond to address urgent humanitarian needs.</narrative>
