  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">An assessment done in the development of this program found that many young girls, boys, and women in all target districts are not empowered enough to combat SGBV and improve SRHR in their lives and their communities. This is largely due to a lack of knowledge on healthy sexuality and relationships, their rights, and the inaccessible SRHR/SGBV services such as contraception and counselling. Besides knowledge, girls, adolescents and youths also lack the right attitudes and skills to address SRHR challenges they face. This is attributed to the fact that young adolescents (age 10-14) are hardly introduced to information on SRHR and gender equality because people around them i.e. peers, parents, teachers, and other relations are equally uninformed, unskilled, or unwilling to discuss sexuality and gender equality issues.
This has been exacerbated by the COVID19 Pandemic that has blocked most of the SRHR information and service delivery channels for adolescents and young people. COVID19 has also further weakened the health system by creating fear among service providers due to lack of PPE, crippling of the SRHR service supply chain due to diverted resources and limited access of health facilities due to inadequate infrastructure and space.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This leverage/ acceleration project will aim at achieving the specific goals below:
&#x2022;	To establish adolescent membership clubs with peer support  
&#x2022;	To build a smart registration, monitoring, information facility to support the operational side of the program 
&#x2022;	To build adolescent-focused features in health facilities that will be contracted 
&#x2022;	To apply RBF as a mechanism for linking payment to adolescent health service results 

These objectives are fully aligned with SRGR/SGBV programme (we will be implementing together with Amref health Uganda and REN known as &quot;Integrated Sexual Reproductive Health &amp; Rights Program in High Burden Districts of Uganda (ISPHD)</narrative>
