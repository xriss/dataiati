   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Since the military defeat of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) in November 2017, more than 4,477,000 people have returned to their area of origin. A transition towards stabilization started and a recovery began where people are slowly trying to rebuild their lives. Although overall security in Iraq is steadily improving (with the exception of the urban protests), the trust in political institutions is low. Of course, COVID is an important contextual factor. COVID caused loss of income for many people, especially dayworkers. It stopped education. The lockdown made it hard at times to access services. The lockdown also increased the number of cases of GBV. In sum, the need for MHPSS and for services to respond to GBV increased. On one hand, Telafar is strategically located on the main highway from Mosul leading to Sinjar and the Syrian border. Telafar district was almost emptied of people when the government of Iraq re-established control in August 2017 and since then it has been an increasing number of returnees, approximately 352,002 residents returned according to the Displacement Tracking Matrix of the International Organization for Migration1, positioning as the most significant urban center to the west of Mosul in Ninawa governorate. As a result, other residents migrate to this city from surrounding towns and villages. The city is predominantly home to ethnic Turkmen, the current majority is Shi&#x2019;a, while the remainder is Sunni. The area is also home to Kurdish, Christian, and Sunni Arab communities. One of the main reasons for returning to Telafar is the perceived improved security. Many others are not returning because of expected tensions, damaged, destroyed, or stolen property, and a lack of livelihoods opportunities. Even though the city has reportedly been largely cleared of explosives, some surrounding villages and agricultural lands are still not safe, and therefore, agricultural lands are not being re-cultivated. The ongoing closing of IDP camps in November 2020 &#x2013; enforced by the Iraqi government &#x2013; will substantially increase the number of returnees.</narrative>
