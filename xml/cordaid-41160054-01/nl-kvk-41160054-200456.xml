   <narrative xml:lang="EN">One year ago, in May 2017, the sub-prefecture of Alindao in Basse-Kotto has been the scene of violent clashes between the Armed militia called Anti-Balaka and the UPC elements of the former SELEKA coalition. Those clashes resulted in hundreds of casualties and forced thousands to flee their villages to seek safe heaven in an informal settlement at the Catholic Church and in two other sites (Elim Church and PK3). This situation has divided the community into two groups Muslims and Non-Muslims where clear demarcation lines are also drawn. As a consequent, more than 35 000 failed for one year to cultivate or to access their fields. This has created a food insecurity situation which flirts with the IPC4 where more than 80% households have less than one meal a day and rely on the assistance from the humanitarian actors to survive. However, ongoing and intensive efforts to create a better environment and a more peaceful livable community have brought some results to date. Some returns have been noticed along the Axis that connects Alindao to Bambari. Multisectoral assessments reported that those households are facing serious issues related to food security and oftentimes rely to negative coping strategies to survive. Cordaid, which is already providing some assistance in Health care and WASH services, would like to continue with its response thanks to the UNOCHA call that targets 25 000 individuals along this zone. Cordaid thanks to its previous experience in the Food Security sector particularly with its response through the CARJR 3&amp;4 where hundreds of families were assisted, proposes to support 12 000 Individuals with emergency food assistance using food voucher and provision of agricultural seeds and tools to restart building their assets through gardening. The intervention can be summarized as follows: - 558 households will receive 3 monthly rations of emergency food assistance through food vouchers modality. - 1000 Households will be assisted with vegetable seeds</narrative>
