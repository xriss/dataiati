   <narrative xml:lang="EN">According to the Humanitarian Response Plan, 2017, it is estimated that 10.3 million people need Health related assistance (these figures include IDPs, returnees and host community) as top priority need. 
As many as 3 million people in Ninewa Governorate, including Mosul city, are expected to require some form of humanitarian support in 2017. In the hard-hit Kurdistan Region of Iraq, 20 per cent of all host populations require assistance. In Erbil, over one million people require help, in Dahuk 800,000 need assistance. 

The Health system in Iraq and especially in Kurdistan is facing major challenges and gaps mainly due to the humanitarian and economic crises. 

All levels of health care services are overloaded and their capacity is exhausted, there is huge and immediate need to support in provision of essential and life-saving medications and laboratory equipment and tools. There has been a huge wave of migration of the health personnel especially medical doctors due to cut down and delay in provision of their salaries. Since the private sector is small and also affected by the economic crisis was not able to absorb or contribute to encouraging the health personnel to stay. 

Another challenge for the health system is lack of appropriate health awareness of the community and bypassing of the primary health care levels and seeking secondary and tertiary levels. 
Health system in Kurdistan does not have capacity to provide healthcare for all. 
Health system in Ninewa is destroyed by the war(infrastructure is destroyed, loss of equipment and resources, lack of sufficient health personnel because have not received their salaries for last 2 years).</narrative>
