   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The programme partners aim to achieve the following long-term impact:

Improved accessibility, responsiveness and accountability of security and justice institutions, and inclusive political decision-making and peace processes, achieved by mobilising civil society for collective action and advocacy that contributes to acceleration and localization of SDG16+ in 6 fragile countries.

This impact is delivered through achievement of 3 interdependent intermediate outcomes (IOs), specifically:

IO1: Security providers are more responsive, accountable, and people-centred, and take action enabling the most excluded constituencies to enjoy safety, protection and enforcement of the law;

IO2: Justice providers are more responsive, accountable, and people-centred, and take action enabling the most excluded constituencies, to defend and enforce their rights, redress grievances and resolve disputes through diverse pathways to justice through civil society;

IO3: The most excluded constituencies influence and negotiate collectively with duty-bearers and power-holders in a context of adequate civic space and respect for human rights leading to more inclusive political decision-making and peace processes.

Inclusion of women and youth intersects with each of the three IOs, with particular attention to: the needs and demands of young women and girls, and the commitment of men (including young men and boys) in achieving gender equality and preventing sexual- and gender-based violence (SGBV); and realising political power for young women and men who are the majority of the population in all 6 countries.

Programme results are delivered on the basis of the following Theory of Change (ToC):

If security and justice seekers in conflict-affected communities take collective action through and with primary stakeholders to articulate their needs and advocate for their demands to security, justice, and inclusion in political decision-making and peace processes,

and if primary stakeholders can constructively and effectively challenge and overcome exclusion to influence security, justice and governance policies and practices with and on behalf of the most excluded constituencies,

and if duty-bearers and other power-holders develop the political will, resources and capacities to respond to the needs and demands of the most excluded constituencies and are held accountable by primary stakeholders for the result of their actions,</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The target groups for this project will be drawn from community institutions (DRR committees, Dispute solution committees SHG, Vegetable growers, crop farmers, local authorities (Payam/Boma Administrators, area chiefs), County institutions (commissioner&#x2019;s office, administrators, legislative council), and line ministries (Ministry of Agriculture, Ministry of Local Government, RRC and the department of Rural water at the state level. 
Moreover, the Project will directly target 2150 (1350 women and 800m) persons i.e. 2100 water users and 50 line ministry officials) 
However, the indirect beneficiaries of this project are approximately 6450 (3650f &amp; 2800m) persons who are residents of the target bomas. They will benefit through the IRM program activities which are aimed at building resilient communities.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This is an Integrated Risk Management (IRM) program that aims at building resilient communities for multiple natural and man-made hazards in Jur River County (Kangi and Udici payams) through policy development, investment and practice.
Fragility, conflict and violence are the most significant obstacles to achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Just 20% of all fragile and conflict affected states are on track to achieve SDG targets by 20301, when 85% of the world&#x2019;s poorest people could be concentrated in fragile states2. At the same time, lack of inclusive development is itself generative of conflict and violence.

SDG16+ on peaceful, just, and inclusive societies is a vital accelerator of Agenda 2030, because it addresses the problem of fragility directly. While fragile contexts are characterised by immense heterogeneity, certain key dynamics are typical to all of them:

&#xA7; chronic and widespread insecurity and injustice due to unresponsive, unaccountable, uncoordinated, and highly politicised security and justice institutions adversely impacts the dignity, prosperity, and survival of all in society &#x2014; but especially those constituencies most excluded from access to justice, security or opportunities for political participation based on their gender, age or other group identity. Insecurity and injustice undermine people&#x2019;s perception of the efficacy and legitimacy of the state, inducing the weak social contract that is at the heart of fragility.

&#xA7; Patriarchal and gerontocratic political decision-making arrangements, including both local and national governance and formal and informal peace processes, exclude significant, even majority, demographic groups, like women and youth. These exclusionary arrangements further erode the willingness of people to trust and cooperate with the state, with detrimental effects on security and justice&#x2014;and the social contract itself.

These dynamics contribute to entrenched poverty, gross inequality (including gendered and generational inequalities), and persistent conflict and instability, including regional spill-over, as well as cycles of violent conflict and mass migration. Globally, these conditions amount to a form of structural violence of exclusion3. Recent research4 indicates that people living in fragile contexts, would prefer a state that actually takes responsibility for security provision and a functioning formal justice system. In addition, people demand more inclusive and accountable institutions.

Organised civil society and social movements legitimated by mass or grassroots participation, can aggregate and articulate the needs and demands of the most excluded constituencies, and engage on their behalf with duty-bearers and power-holders. In fragile contexts, civil society may be weak and / or fragmented, its legitimacy is often contested, relationships with states are mutually suspicious, and shrinking civic space undermines the ability of civil society organisations (CSOs), community-based organisations (CBOs) and social movements (further called: primary stakeholders) to demand effective state institutions or negotiate with the state. For this reason, the demands and expectations of the most excluded are seldom reflected in the policy and practices of security, justice and governance actors at the sub-national and national level. Nor are they included in global policy debates that shape and are shaped by national policy processes, where agendas are set and (often) resources allocated.</narrative>
