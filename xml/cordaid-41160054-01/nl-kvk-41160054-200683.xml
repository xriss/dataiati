   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Crisis situations such as natural disasters and conflicts cause significant disruption amongst the affected population. They can cause mental health problems due to the different types of losses suffered. Firstly, these situations cause significant material damage like road and sanitary infrastructure, buildings, food and energy sources. There are also often many economic losses across all sectors (primary, secondary, tertiary). People&apos;s livelihoods and jobs are nearly always impacted by the crisis. There are often heavy losses of human life. People go missing and die, others are injured and often suffer from disabling physical after-effects. Others are separated from their loved ones. These losses undermine the foundations of community life and the internal resources of the families and individuals affected. These mechanisms are weakened to a greater extent for people who are already vulnerable prior to the event in question (vulnerabilities related to age, gender, incapacities and impairments, social and economic status, etc.). The entire social fabric may be altered or destroyed, placing the individuals in an abnormal state of suffering. This may manifest itself in the form of psychological distress, or in a more disabling manner in the form of mental health disorders. Psychological distress is &quot;a state of disquiet which is not necessarily symptomatic of a pathology or mental health disorder. It reveals the presence of non-severe or temporary symptoms of anxiety and depression which do not meet the diagnostic criteria for mental health disorders, and which may be a reaction to stressful situations (migration, exile, natural disaster which can induce symptoms of psychological trauma) or to existential difficulties&quot;.
Although it may not immediately result in a disability, the onset of an impairment or trauma in a crisis is a factor for psychological distress and a determining factor for personal vulnerability. This distress may lead to a lasting deterioration in the person&apos;s mental health or a permanent disability. Given the increased risk of experiencing symptoms of psychological distress in emergency situations, mental health and psychosocial support (MHPSS) interventions in these settings have emerged as a key issue to address. Indeed, active listening and psychological first aid implemented in the emergency phase play a decisive role in limiting the effects of psychological distress and in people&apos;s individual and collective reconstruction. In the long term, they also facilitate the process of building community and individual resilience. The emergency setting and the sensitive nature of these types of interventions ask for very careful interventions to avoid any potential adverse effects that might worsen people&apos;s circumstances.</narrative>
