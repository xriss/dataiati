   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Political conflict compounded economic woes, and the recent flooding has caused massive displacement and dire food shortages in South Sudan. An estimated 1.5 million people are displaced within the boundaries of South Sudan with an estimated 190,000 seeking refuge at the Protection of Civilian (POC) sites across the country. 
South Sudan is faced with acute needs. IPC report released in August 2019 projects 5.5 million people in crises (IPC Phase 3) or worse from January to April 2020, about 934,000 pregnant or lactating women are acutely malnourished and 1.23 million children under the age 5 years old are likely to be acutely malnourished. The 2020 South Sudan Humanitarian Response Plan estimated that 7.5 million people are in need of humanitarian assistance.
Nevertheless, since the signing of the revitalized peace agreement between the government and warring factions in September 2018, relative peace and calmness across the country is maintained despite optimism on the formation of the transitional government which has further been pushed by 100 days to February 2020. These relative calm and peace since 2018 have triggered people to return to their villages with the hope and expectation of strengthened peace and stability by the formation of the transitional government in February 2020.

Guit and Koch are counties of former Unity State. The estimated population as of 2008 census of Guit and Koch are 74,863 and 33,004 respectively. Guit and Koch have been grossly affected by the conflict, displacement and recent flooding. The recent IPC report classified Guit county in Emergency (IPC Phase 4) and Koch County in Crises (IPC Phase 3) for January to April 2020 projection. In addition, both county&#x2019;s lie in Crises (IPC Phase 3) for acute malnutrition for same projection. In the WASH Cluster severity mapping, Guit is in severity level 4 (Alert state with 86% people access water from unprotective source; 88% practice open defecation and 47% have suffered from WASH related disease in the last one month) and Koch in severity level 3 (Warning state with 63% of people access water from unprotective source; 90% practice open defecation and 18% have suffered from WASH related disease in the last one month) . This WASH Cluster severity classification is in terms of access to an improved water source, outbreak or prevalence of WASH related diseases especially watery diarrhoea and cholera hotspot and malnutrition prevalence. 
The dire situation in Guit and Koch county&#x2019;s will be exacerbated with the reported arrival of tens of thousands of returnees in the last months of 2019. These returnees are arriving with nothing as their houses, infrastructure and livelihoods have been destroyed during the crises. Although Markets are functioning, people have no money to buy food. Many of the families have extremely low purchasing power. They are acutely food insecure and with no food stocks, putting more pressure on the available limited infrastructures and services like water, sanitation and health.</narrative>
