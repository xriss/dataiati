   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The changing dynamics of armed conflict and violence and pockets of violence in South Sudan between state and none state actors continue to challenge well-being of people and delivery of services to the community by government and humanitarian organizations. While there is hope for South Sudan&#x2019;s Nationals to the long-awaited implementation of the Revitalized Peace Process promised to offer new opportunities in 2019, its implementation still hangs in balance. Moreover, the cumulative effects of years of conflict, violence and destroyed livelihoods have left more than 8.3 million people in dire need of some form of humanitarian assistance and protection (UN 2021). Compared to the current levels of violent conflict in South Sudan, Greater Jonglei state is significantly affected by both political and tribal conflicts. Apart from the national level conflicts, there are several inter- and intra-state and community level conflicts that require the attention of all development actors in South Sudan. Traditional practices have had negative impacts on the desired peaceful co-existence in the communities. In addition to these, causes of conflicts such as military recruitment arms proliferation and social fragmentation, there are natural calamities like floods and long dry spells that affect the agricultural cycles. 
Jonglei and Greater Administrative Area of Pibor is one of the states hardest hit by the crises, with currently 47% of the population in need of severity phase extreme or catastrophic (HNO 2021 people in need by severity phase, gender, age and disability). Torrential rains in 2020 led to severe flooding in large areas of South Sudan, and OCHA estimates that more than 900,000 people have been affected (Update #3, 5 November 2020). In Pibor County, Jonglei, the situation is the worst, with an unprecedented 319,000 persons affected (ICWG, 5 November 2020). The population, who are primarily dependent on small-scale farming, has seen their livelihoods been flushed away: granary stores are damaged, fields are destroyed and livestock have drowned in large numbers. Alarmingly, 53% of the flood-affected counties were already in IPC 3 (critical) or IPC 4 (emergency) before the floods hit these areas (IPC Acute Food Insecurity &amp; Malnutrition Assessment distributed through WFP, August 2020). In Pibor, the flooding has affected people who were already very food insecure and using negative coping strategies to deal with the situation. In addition, intercommunal violence and cattle-raiding between the Lou Nuer and Murle communities has led to loss of lives and disrupted food assistance delivery to flood-affected populations in Gumuruk and Lekwangole payams and Pibor Town.</narrative>
