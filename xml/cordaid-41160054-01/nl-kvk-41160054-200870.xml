   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Cordaid is concerned about low levels of public knowledge and understanding about the linkages between migration and development, in particular between a) drivers of forced displacement in developing countries and b) the Dutch responsibility to tackle both root causes and consequences of forced migration. Since the 2008 financial crisis, public and political support for Dutch development cooperation has decreased. Its annual budget has decreased in the last 10 years, with fewer resources available for refugee reception and promoting sustainable development. In some political circles development is promoted in order for migrants &#x2018;to stay there&#x2019;.

Cordaid is also concerned with the growing negative public and political attitudes on migration. Since the 2015-2016 refugee crisis in Europe, right-wing politicians and opinion leaders have dominated public discourses and used the refugee narrative for political gain. Hate speech, including on social media, has contributed to a polarised debate in which the &#x2018;silent middle&#x2019; is not heard. This takes place within an atmosphere of growing fear and xenophobia towards newcomers, many coming from fragile developing countries such as Afghanistan or South Sudan where Cordaid is fighting poverty and exclusion. However, there are opportunities for change. Mainstream policy makers increasingly recognise that, in global history, migration has generally been a force for development. The 2015 Sustainable Development Goals clearly reference the contribution of migrants and migration to sustainable development, both in the countries of origin and destination. Moreover, policy makers increasingly understand that through social and financial remittances, migrants and diaspora are closely linked to their communities and livelihoods back home.

Importantly, while some groups (especially linked to right-wing politics) openly express xenophobia and racism, others showed solidarity, providing support for refugees who came to the Netherlands or organising support for refugees in Greece, the Balkans &amp; France, and demanding governments to ensure the safety and dignity of refugees and migrants. In addition, there&#x2019;s a strong public anti-discrimination and anti-racism movement in the Netherlands. It became more visible, in response to Black Lives Matter in the US and through the campaign to abolish &#x2018;Black Pete&#x201D;. Migrants and diaspora are taking a lead role in this debate.

Finally, within the development cooperation sector, a renewed awareness and dialogue is taking place about power relations between actors in the global north and south, between donors, aid organizations, and aid recipients. This starts with recognising that development cooperation is built on the legacies of colonialism. And embrace the need to address power inequalities and exclusionary cultures and behaviours within the sector, as well as institutional and individual racism, diversity and participation (also within our organisations and networks). Part of this endeavour also means finding new ways to speak about migration and development. This is related to the ongoing drive towards &#x2018;localisation&#x2019; and local leadership, which seeks to ensure local and national actors, particularly those most at risk, have the space, power, resources and capacities they need to participate in decision making on issues that touch them (&#x2018;shift the power&#x2019; from the global north to local actors in recipient countries)</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The long term social change goal is a more nuanced, less polarized and positive public and political discourse on migration and development, leading to policies promoting a more welcoming Dutch society, treating migrants and refugees with dignity, whilst respecting their agency.

This project is contributing to this change by improving of the capacity (skills, behaviour) of the primary target group in shifting public and political attitudes on migration, in particular by targeting the &#x2018;silent middle&#x2019;, leading to a more effective and collective engagement in public discourses and in political advocacy on migration and development.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The primary target group is the development and humanitarian actors, including faith-based organisations and all Dutch Porticus recipients, migrants and the diaspora, and refugee organisations. Cordaid along with these actors can become more effective actors in shaping inclusive communities and positive migration narratives, promoting a public opinion supportive of refugees and migrants, improving the public perception on migration and reducing polarisation &#x2013; addressing the &#x2018;silent middle&#x2019;. Since 15 years, Cordaid is part of this group of stakeholders, e.g. as members of Partos (branch of the Dutch development organisations) and partners of Partin (branch of Private Development Initiatives) - and in many theme-based and geographic networks and coalitions. Over the programme period of two years, Cordaid aim to reach out to representatives from 120 organisations, based on an updated stakeholder
mapping.

The primary target group will be engaged from the start of the PPAMD programme, though an online consultation bringing together some 15-20 representatives discussing the objectives, activities and expected results of the programme, and later on through various forms of stakeholder involvement: as participants and co-facilitators in trainings and workshops, as co-creators of positive migration narratives and as advocates for inclusive migration narratives, policies and practises. In line with Cordaid&#x2019;s vision, migrant, refugee and diaspora organizations will be invited to play a particularly active role to ensure that they can help shape the decisions and activities that affect them.

The secondary target group are the mainstream (not the extreme right) policy makers and political actors, who need to take up their responsibility, for example in reshaping the political discourses on migrants and refugees, and in designing specific policies that promote migrant and refugee rights, reduce discrimination, marginalisation and exploitation. This requires evidence-based advocacy, using the multisector advocacy approach.</narrative>
