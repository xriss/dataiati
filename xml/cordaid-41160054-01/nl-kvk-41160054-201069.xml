   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Myanmar obtained independence from the British colonial rule in 1948. However, from the start of independence peace and stability have never been obtained. The country&#x2019;s valuable resources have fueled tensions and even civil wars over the past 70 years. Most recently the democratically elected government led by Aung San Su Kyi was overthrown by the Myanmar military (the Tatmadaw) on the 1st of February. This military coup was followed by massive demonstrations and violent crackdown of these demonstrations by the Tatmadaw. The demonstrations were mostly initiated by young internet savvy people who were loosely organized in the Civil Disobedience Movement (CDM).

Martial law was installed in 6 townships in Yangon. As a result, most of the demonstrations stopped. The democratically elected parliament organized themselves in the CRPH (Committee Representing the Pyrthu Hluttaw; Pyidaungsu Hluttaw is the name of the parliament). The CRPH organized a National Unity Government (NUG). The CRPH and the NUG started organizing federal armies at state level in the ethic areas. People Defense Forces are organized at township level and also mandated by the NUG. The federal armies are teaming up with the Ethic Armed Organizations (EAO). The EAO and the CRPH have issued statements to demand the release of democratically elected leaders and to stop all violence against innocent and peaceful citizens. They also mentioned supporting the establishment of a federal state with much more self-governance by the ethnic minorities. Currently the most severe opposition to the Tatmadaw is in Chin state and Kayah state. 

Chin State is also one of the poorest states in Myanmar. Chin State does not have a history of protracted conflicts such as the eastern part of Myanmar. Ethic armed groups are not as active as in the Eastern part of Myanmar. In My the NUG initiated the establishment of the Chinland Defense Force (CDF). When the Tatmadaw started attacking parts of Chin state the CDF became the major armed group fighting the Tatmadaw. The hostilities between the CDF and the Tatmadaw are one of the most intense fighting&#x2019;s in the country and have uprooted thousands of families and individuals. Currently, the people that are uprooted are mostly in need of food.

In Chin state markets are functioning and cash grants has been selected by the partner as the best and most efficient modus of operandi. In Kayah state markets have been disrupted and food aid is the most realistic option and prioritized by KMSS Loikaw. Moreover in Kayah the IDPs mentioned that they are in need of mats, mosquito nets and blankets as the second priority. As the third priority access to (safe) drinking water was mentioned.

About 70% of the population in the Kayah State depend on agriculture for their livelihood. Most indigenous communities rely on shifting cultivation for livelihoods while some are doing permanent cultivation. 

Thousands of people have been displaced in Demoso Township after the armed conflict between military troops and People Defense Force troops which took place in DawNganKha on the 21st of May 2021. The conflict was sparked as a result of confrontation between the military troops and local people over the destruction of road blockages set up for protection of families from malicious attacks especially at night and the arrest of at least 8 people at a funeral house. In fact, the tensions had already increased with gradually harsher crackdowns on the protesters against the military coup and the previous arrest of at least 70 young people now detained in Loikaw prison.</narrative>

    </title>
    <description>
     <narrative xml:lang="EN">SPHERE: Communities and people affected by crisis, including the most vulnerable groups, consider that the timing of the assistance and protection they receive is adequate.
DRA: timely depends on the nature of the acute crisis (slow versus sudden onset). If it is an acute sudden onset crisis a response is considered timely if we decide to respond within 48 hours and if we initiate the response within 72 hours. If it is a slow onset crisis, it is timely if we initiate the response in 3 weeks after we decide that the crisis meets the criteria of an acute crisis.

The applicable definition depends on the type of crisis (protracted versus acute). The SPHERE definition should be used in more protracted crisis where there is (more)  time to conduct assessments and measure satisfaction of the response in the eyes of people affected.  The DRA definition should be used for acute crises, where it is more important to initiate the response as soon as possible and look at our own processes.</narrative>
