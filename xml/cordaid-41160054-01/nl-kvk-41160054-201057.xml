   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Meeting the basic needs of internally displaced people and other vulnerable groups through emergency response in Myanmar</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Kachin has a long history of civil conflict mostly between the Tatmadaw and the KIA. A one-sided ceasefire was announced by the Tatmadaw and from the end of 2019 open conflict became very sporadic paving the way for the 110,000 IDP to embark on a return and resettlement program. The government of Myanmar dictated an out of camp policy around that time. Return and Resettlement (R&amp;R) have been going on in 2020 but was made more complicated by the Covid pandemic causing disruption in supply chains. The border with China was providing thousands of jobs to daily labours. Many of them are vulnerable people without land as well as IDPs. However, the border has been closed and limited casual jobs are currently available. 

The economic impact of Coup further exacerbated the already eroded coping mechanisms by the covid pandemic. People are furthermore deeply mentally discouraged in this situation. Currently, the impact of the coup is that banks are not working and people cannot withdraw money from the banks. Because of the Civil Disobedience Movement (CDM) many people (33%) will not or cannot work and they have no income.

This time the military are purchasing large volumes of rice as supply for their own troops in anticipation on long term demonstrations and CDM. This causes rice prices to increase (12.5%, mid Feb 2021). The overall retail price increase of rice was modest, however, and higher increases were observed in Kachin, Mon and Shan states. The highest increases were observed in Putao (36%) and Banmaw (23%) townships in Kachin state (WFP, the Myanmar &#x201C;Market Price Update&#x201D; covering February 2021). The anticipation is that this will increase further causing people to have lack of money to purchase food and other essential items. 

Regarding the R&amp;R process; people are still returning without support. The new planting season will start somewhere in May. The majority are going back to the places of origin. About 65% has access to land and they have access to about 3.5 acre per household. Usually people have agricultural skills but are lacking resources for agricultural inputs. 

People are now returning and shelter is a crucial need. Families that are currently returning or resettling are living in makeshift shelters.

In villages where IDPs return there is a lack of safe drinking water as well no community hall for community meetings for the entire village. 

Markets in Bhamo are working but for example rice prices are increasing. Most items are usually available but prices are increasing; without access to daily labour jobs, or regular jobs (due to the CDM), more and more people may have difficulty to pay for agricultural inputs and/or daily food needs.</narrative>

    </title>
    <description>
     <narrative xml:lang="EN">SPHERE: Communities and people affected by crisis, including the most vulnerable groups, consider that the timing of the assistance and protection they receive is adequate.
DRA: timely depends on the nature of the acute crisis (slow versus sudden onset). If it is an acute sudden onset crisis a response is considered timely if we decide to respond within 48 hours and if we initiate the response within 72 hours. If it is a slow onset crisis, it is timely if we initiate the response in 3 weeks after we decide that the crisis meets the criteria of an acute crisis.

The applicable definition depends on the type of crisis (protracted versus acute). The SPHERE definition should be used in more protracted crisis where there is (more)  time to conduct assessments and measure satisfaction of the response in the eyes of people affected.  The DRA definition should be used for acute crises, where it is more important to initiate the response as soon as possible and look at our own processes.</narrative>
