   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Improving Access to Quality Mental Health and Psychosocial Support (MHPSS) Services in Sinjar City especially for women and children</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Currently, since the military activity is lower in and around Sinjar than this same time last year and major displacements are not expected to occur over the next period. As a result, large number of IDPs have returned to their areas of origin where they face harsh conditions of large-scale infrastructure damage, the memories and effects of systematic Gender Based Violence targeting minority groups, as well as weak economies. All of these have also contributed to impacting the psychological and mental well-being of the people living in the area. 

Through an assessment in Sinjar City which was conducted by a joint team of Cordaid and AAF, Cordaid was able to identify the need for MHPSS support in the city both at the community and PHCC levels. Accordingly, Cordaid through its partner AAF will provide comprehensive MHPSS services in Sinjar City in Sinjar hospital, as well as community-based support mechanisms. These will be structured in a three stage service delivery: 

Stage 1: Providing capacity building support to the community actors providing MHPSS services at the local level. Moreover, this stage of support will also focus on establishing and using referral mechanisms to higher levels of care.

Stage 2: Training the PHCC staff on case management to prepare the health system in the city to handle case with mental health needs. Specifically training DoH staff on MHGAP among other things.

Stage 3: Recruiting a psychiatrist to provide advanced mental health support activities. 

AAF has already established strong ties with the key community members in the area and has facilitated a joint assessment with Cordaid to the city.

Originally Cordaid wanted to invest in mobile teams for SRHR in Sinjar region. That expected projected was called &#x201C;Female Outreach&#x201D;. Because it took Cordaid a year to get access to Sinjar, needs have changed. Other NGOs started to work on the SRHR. Now - after an assessment visit by CO &#x2013; Cordaid identified mental health is the biggest need.</narrative>
