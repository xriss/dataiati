   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Cordaid participated in a joint multi-sector needs assessment in Nangarhar (Nazayan, Achin, Bati Kot, Kot, Shinwar, Shurkhrod, Mohamond Dara, Rodat, Dur Baba) and Uruzgan (Chora, Dehrawud,Tarinkot) from 22 to 28 December 2019 (annex 1). The main purpose of the assessment was to provide a quick and evidence-based overview of the current humanitarian situation in selected districts/provinces, to identify the immediate impact of the crisis, the needs of the affected population and define priorities for humanitarian action in the sampled areas. A mix of methods, capturing both quantitative and qualitative data sets were used in the assessment, including a literature review, a vulnerability capacity analysis, key informant interviews (KII) with community/opinion leaders (2 per district) and 1 with DoRR at provincial level, as well as male and female focus group discussions (FGD) with local communities and religious leaders. A household survey (HEAT) was used as well, collecting quantitative data from 696 households  (Nangarhar 348 and Uruzgan 348). Market surveys (20 in total) were also conducted across the target locations. The quantitative data was transcribed and analysed using content analysis and themes approach. While the quantitative data provided statistical impressions of the situation, the qualitative data gave explanations for the prevailing current conditions for Shelter &amp; NFI, Food Security, Protection, WASH, Health and Nutrition. 
The assessment found that 64% of the respondents was under 18 years old and 49% was female and 51% was male and that in the assessed areas in Nangarhar, 85% of the people had not received any assistance. Because of conflict and displacement, people&#x2019;s livelihoods had been destroyed and in previously ISIS controlled areas, people lived in isolation. People were found highly food insecure, with 84% having no food stocks at all. Reportedly, women were most affected by food insecurity, followed by children. The assessment indicated that 89% of the people had high coping strategies. Almost 50% of the respondents were daily unskilled workers, and 71% of the people had debts incurred of AFN 8,000 or more. Although most of the respondents were living in a house, only a quarter of them was the owner of the house. The majority of the people was living in overcrowded, shared and substandard accommodation including squatting and 8% was living in tents or makeshift shelter. The average rent of 2-room shelter in Nangarhar amounts to 2,333 AFN, which takes up a large proportion of people&#x2019;s unreliable income with 50% of the respondents being day labourers. The lack of adequate shelter exposes households to a variety of risks, including the lack of dignity, privacy, safety and security, risk of eviction, exploitation and abuse, overcrowding, poor access to services, and unhygienic living conditions. These concerns disproportionately affect persons with specific needs, including women, girls, children and the elderly. Furthermore  nearly 70% of the interviewees mentioned that their houses were partially or completely destroyed. With 50% of the respondents working as day labourer having unreliable income, many are unable to afford the necessary repairs. Consequently people are unprotected against the elements, posing health and protection risks to the most vulnerable people.
Market assessments were conducted as well and found that 85% of the markets were functioning well and were busy, with most of them selling food. Construction materials were not sold everywhere as a quarter of the markets was selling construction materials. The markets are supplied from Pakistan and most of the required supplies are available in the sampled markets with 90% of the traders facing no challenging. However, in the event sales would increase by 20%, 75% of the traders would face constraints in supplies. 50% mentioned that all goods were sufficiently available. Prices were monitored as well and prices do fluctuate with 6%.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The overall objective of the project is to provide extremely vulnerable people in Nangarhar with dignified shelter solutions through conditional cash transfers for shelter repair and transitional shelter construction, ensuring their well-being, privacy and dignity whilst mitigating protection and health risks of these people.</narrative>
