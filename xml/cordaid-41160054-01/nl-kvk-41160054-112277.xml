   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Republic of South Sudan has been embroiled in an armed struggle since mid-December 2013, when 
tensions between the South Sudan ruling party and rival fractions led by the former Vice President, escalated 
into a fully blown armed conflict. Since then, various media reports estimate that close to 10.000 civilians have 
been killed and over 70.000 fled to Uganda and neighboring countries. The latest number of Southern Sudanese 
refugees in Uganda as of 4th March 2014 was 75.103 arrivals in three locations of Adjumani, Arua and 
Kiryandongo. According to UNHCR reports, over 300 persons are arriving per day and these largely comprise 
children and women. Most of the emergency support agencies are providing mainly non-food and food items. A 
few organizations are providing protection services including basic psychosocial care. The psychosocial situation 
of children and women remains of concern in the humanitarian response as described by the Minister and as 
noted in periodic field reports. 
The overall objective of the mission was to provide technical support in regard to measurement of effectiveness 
of intervention implemented by TPO Uganda and titled: &#x201C;Protection and Psychosocial support to South 
Sudanese Refugee Women and Children Living in Camps in Northern Uganda.&#x201D;</narrative>
