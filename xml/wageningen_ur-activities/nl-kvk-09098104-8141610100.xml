   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Small and medium-scale farmers are the ultimate beneficiaries. The expectation is that some 300,000 households will increase productivity, income and resilience, based on the assumption that these farmers will increase productivity from the use of quality seed for crop production. A specific focus is given to gender and youth. Direct beneficiaries are the Local Seed Business (LSB) members and by the end of the project some 7500 LSB members are expected to have benefited from the production and marketing of Quality Declared Seed (QDS), in terms of increased productivity and income. In addition to this, some 100 vegetable sector professionals will be trained as trainers (TOT), and some 20,000 small holder farmers in will be trained in good vegetable production, using quality vegetable seed of advanced varieties. Four vegetable seed companies will also directly benefit from the project, since they will be given a grant for developing demonstration plots. A specific focus is given to gender and youth under project implementation.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The ISSD Plus project runs from 2016 to 2020 and builds on the previous ISSD project (2012-2016). It operates in the East, South Western Highlands (Kigezi area), Western Highlands (Rwenzori area), South Western, Northern Zone and also has a presence in the West Nile zone agro-ecological zone. The project implements its activities through teams in the Zonal Agricultural Research and Development institutes (ZARDIs) of the National Agricultural Research Organisation (NARO). The ZARDIs involved in the project include; Buginyanya ZARDI for the East; Rwebitaba ZARDI for the Rwenzori area; Mbarara ZARDI for the South West and South Western Highlands; Ngetta ZARDI for the North and West Nile zone.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The overall goal of the project is to contribute to increased incomes of smallholder farmer households and improved household food and nutrition security. Special attention is given to women and youth in increasing income. The project goal will be realized through increased productivity of field and vegetable crops (Intermediate Result). For field crops, increased productivity provides increased income and improved food security through existing and growing markets. The productivity increase results from the increased use of quality seed by small and medium-scale farmers (component 1). Quality seed use will be promoted through publicity and demonstration campaigns and proximity marketing efforts. Proximity marketing focuses on increasing farmers&#x2019; access to seed close to areas they easily reach. To satisfy the increasing quality seed demand, local seed businesses (LSBs) are supported to produce and market Quality Declared Seed (component 2). This means in practice that the project scales the LSB approach based on the experiences of the previous ISSD Uganda project (2012-2016). To assure that LSBs are able to perform well, their access to early generation seed is being improved (component 3). The ISSD Plus project has a specific objective on vegetable sector development (component 4). In the vegetable sector, the access to EGS is not an issue, as vegetable seed companies have privately bred varieties integrating EGS into their commercial seed production chain. The project is therefore intervening to improve the access of vegetable producers to high quality seed and seedlings, through the introduction of improved varieties and improving farmers&#x2019; skills in vegetable production. By training vegetable growers, they will become able to take advantage of high quality seed and seedlings, and increase their productivity (Intermediate Result).</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Uganda&#x2019;s population of 35 million is growing by 3% per annum and 75% is below the age of 30. 77% of the employed population works in agriculture, forestry and fishing. Uganda is making progress with regard to the Millennium Development Goals; absolute poverty dropped from 25% in 2010 to 20% in 2013, and prevalence of underweight children under five has declined from 26% in 1999 to 14% in 2013 (MDG report, 2013). The rural-urban divide is however expanding mostly as a result of unevenly distributed socio-economic infrastructure such as road networks, access to markets, health and educational services and private sector investments. Official unemployment in Uganda is steadily increasing, from 1.9% in 2010 to 9.4% in 2013 (UBOS, National Household Survey, 2012/13). Particularly the youth unemployment of 32.2 % is worrisome (UBOS Youth Employment Report, 2012). While the agricultural sector is central to the country&#x2019;s development agenda, its absorption of youth is low. Youth are increasingly shunning rural areas to access better services and livelihood options in urban areas (AfDB, OECD, UNPD, 2015, Uganda 2015, African Economic Outlook). Although the urban &#x2013; rural divide is growing, urbanization does at the same time present opportunities for rural development. There is a growing demand for food for those not involved in agricultural production. Furthermore, urban food patterns are diversifying, opening opportunities for value addition and food crop quality diversification and niche crops such as various vegetables as well as oil crops. Combined with growing trade in the region, most notably towards South Sudan and the Democratic Republic of Congo, there are strong incentives for farmers to become more market oriented and intensify their production. The challenge is to support women and youth to equally take advantage of these opportunities. A thread to the growth of the food and agriculture sector is posed by climate change and declining soil fertility. With diminishing reliability of rainfall pattern, farming and market systems have to be adapted to maintain national food self-sufficiency, improve national food and nutrition security, and at the same time increase export volumes to contribute to economic development. This requires efforts to support Ugandan producers in the environmental and economic sustainable intensification of their production. The use of high quality seed is a prerequisite for sustainable intensification of production, without it efficient use of resources such as land, labour, capital and soil nutrients is not possible.</narrative>

  <sector code="31150" percentage="100" vocabulary="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Food markets provide unprecedented opportunities for rural development. Subsistence farmers who produce primarily for their own consumption have become rare. Almost invariably Ugandan farmers are aiming to produce a marketable surplus to derive an income, while simultaneously satisfying their household food needs. At the same time however, the market orientation of agricultural production is not being accompanied by optimal seed use practices. A survey of the ISSD Uganda project (2016) clearly showed the mismatch between production objectives of Ugandan farmers and their seed use practices. It demonstrates that Ugandan farmers still follow seed use practices of subsistence oriented farmers. Currently farmers only regularly replace their hybrid maize and vegetable seed. They mainly rely on their own farm-saved seed. Over 30% of the farmers indicate to never replace their bean, oilseed, root and tuber and open pollinated cereal seed. If farmers replace their seed from an outside source, the most important sources are grain markets and their neighbours. Only a very small proportion of seed planted comes from a commercial seed provider.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In order to address challenges in the seed sector environment, the project contributes to addressing seed sector and vegetable sector bottlenecks as identified by stakeholders. In addition, work is done to lobby and advocate for cabinet approval of the national seed policy, and to support options for QDS, EGS and vegetables. Multi-Stakeholder Processes (MSPs) are organised at zonal and national (including national seed stakeholder meetings) since the bottlenecks in the seed can only be addressed by a variety of stakeholders. In addition to this, LSB out scaling through partners and the training of trainers for vegetable sector professionals are also intended to be embedded in relevant existing institutions.</narrative>
