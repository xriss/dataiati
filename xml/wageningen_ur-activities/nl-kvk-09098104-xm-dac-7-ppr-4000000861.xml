   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Impact: The project will contribute to improved food security and climate resilience of smallholder farmers in the Shan State and the Dry Zone of Myanmar Goal: The project&apos;s goal is to identify, test and develop farming strategies for farming systems in Myanmar that can meet the demands of the future, being robust, and resilient to climate change, sustainable with increased productivity as basis for profitability. Outcomes: 1. Stakeholders are aware of potential jeopardies of current trends in farming (fact based assessments) and practices and are increasingly willing to act on it. 2. Stakeholders share vision on desired systems (region specific) and farm technology 3. The farming community is informed on key issues of the future challenge and possible fitting technology Value chain partners and supporting organizations are involved in development of new approaches and innovation/introduction of new technologies. 4. Capacity is built for advanced agronomy for sustainable farming systems with education and extension. Stakeholder involvement in policy making process facilitated and supported. Improved alignment of efforts in projects involved in value chain and farming systems</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Farming Systems for Sustainability Myanmar project (FSS Myanmar), is a 4 year project, starting mid 2017 and running until mid 2021 that uses the farming systems approach to support sustainable intensification in Myanmar Agriculture. The project focuses on two key regions: Shan state and the dry zone, representing upland agriculture and lowland agriculture in Central Myanmar. In each region different areas/townships are selected to get sufficient spread in farming systems, agro-ecology and water availability/irrigation systems conditions. The project approach starts with the analysis of current practices and farming systems, moves then to the strategic design of improved farming systems for specific regions and sectors and then tests and improves these farming systems in practice. Scaling of the experiences to other farmers and other stakeholder groups and settings completes the approach. The testing activities are set to run for a three year period. The three year period allows for the necessary time to identify, test and develop new practices in the context of the farms, to create a living network with partners, to capitalize on the approach with demonstrations and other dissemination tools and to ensure that a robust and reliable outlook on the feasibility, effectivity and contribution of the methods to the overall objectives is accomplished. The project is implemented by a joint effort of Wageningen University &amp; Research in collaboration with the Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock and Irrigation (MOALI) of Myanmar. The project is funded by DGIS.</narrative>
