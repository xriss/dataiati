   <narrative xml:lang="EN">DHANAK FRANCHISE MARKET BRIEF The overall use of modern contraception in Pakistan is quite low, especially in rural areas. Several studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of social franchising approaches in increasing access to modern contraception and improving the quality of healthcare in resource-poor areas. DKT has established a network of 1100+ clinics under the Dhanak franchise to increase access to affordable and quality family planning (FP) services. The competition includes MSS and Greenstar franchises. Dhanak is different from others as it forms a partnership between MNCH/DoPW, the provider and DKT, where DKT helps in construction, provides products, trains for quality, monitors and assists in mobilization. DKT helps the Dhanak provider to run it like a business and move towards sustainability. Through its expansive network of over 1100+ branches, Dhanak caters to the needs of individuals and midwives by giving them necessary family planning counselling and access to preventive measures of their choice to address family planning issues in the underprivileged areas of Pakistan.</narrative>
