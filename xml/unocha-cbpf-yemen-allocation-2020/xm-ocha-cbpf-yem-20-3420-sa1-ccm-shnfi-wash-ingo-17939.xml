   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In Yemen, the combination of food insecurity, lack of dignified shelter and legal documentation, no proper water and sanitation facilities, compounded by the depletion of resources of both IDPs and host communities, has led to the reduction of households (HHs) purchasing power, poor access to basic service, collapse of HH and community support network, child labor and abuse, early marriage, and substandard living conditions. These problems are further complicated by the lack of updated information available on the actors, services, and gaps at IDP hosting sites.

The proposed intervention adopts a Projectized Site Management and Coordination (PSMC) approach at IDP hosting sites to simultaneously address the aforementioned issues through systematic strengthening of coordination structures, long-term capacity building of partners, and integrated multi-sectorial service delivery at 40 IDP hosting sites in Al Dhale&#x2019;e (6 sites, Qatabah) (ACTED), Hajjah (10 sites, Abs) (DRC), Hodeidah (6 sites, Tuhayta, 11 sites Az Zurah) (DRC) and Lahj (7 sites, Tuban) (DRC). The targeted sites have been selected as they are almost all current sites of operation for ACTED or DRC, and the proposed intervention will deliver a continuation of activities in these sites with high needs. The Site Reporting Assessment, initially completed in early 2020, and updated in November 2020, idfentified the continued needs in these locations, and site specific data has been collected by DRC and ACTED since, through the Site Comparisons Matrix (YDR, Sept 2020). Specific targeted sites may change in cases of eviction, new site development, and spikes in displacement, as identified by the field teams throughout the intervention period. Through CCCM and hardware interventions, the Danish Refugee Council (DRC) and the Agency for Technical Cooperation and Development (ACTED) will ensure that basic services are present in critical IDP hosting sites and are up to international and national standards. These services include longer term (transitional) shelter and sustainable WASH infrastructure community-based projects and multi-sectoral referrals, as well as active coordination of interventions at targeted sites. Key beneficiaries will include internally displaced persons as well as associated host communities. Particular emphasis will be placed on vulnerable sub-groups such as women, girls, boys, and people with disabilities. Overall, DRC and ACTED will support in maintenance and enhancement of national and local coordination structures and ensure the prioritized IDP hosting sites meet acceptable standards. 

The proposed locations/sectors for this intervention are as follows: 
Hajjah (Abs): CCCM (DRC)
Hodeidah (Al Zurrah): CCCM amp Shelter (DRC)
Hodeidah (Tuhayta): CCCM, WASH (DRC)
Lahj (Tuban): CCCM, WASH amp Shelter (DRC)
Al Dhale (Qatabah): CCCM (ACTED) 
These sectors and locations were identified based on bilateral engagement with the relevant clusters. DRC and ACTED will be seeking alternative funding sources to ensure the WASH and Shelter gaps not covered through this project are covered by ECHO or alternative relevant donors. 

This project will be implemented under the auspices of the Yemen Displacement Response (YDR) Consortium, a partnership of four agencies including DRC (lead), Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC), ACTED, and IOM established in 2019 to improve living conditions in IDP sites through effective site management, and evidence-based, community-driven service provision carried out through multi-stakeholder coordination. To support a sustainable exit strategy, the YDR Consortium Capacity Building unit will deliver trainings to cluster partners, service providers and site committees.</narrative>
