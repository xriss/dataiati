   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Covering gaps in emergency response by provision of primary health services in Ibb and Dhi As Sufal districts and WASH services for IDPs in Ibb Governorate (parameter2)</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project is aligned with the 1st standard allocation strategy, where the project comes with priority 2: Covering gaps in clusters&#x2019; ongoing emergency response for people in acute need. The project is also aligned with the second sub-component of priority 2 IDP Response.
The project targets Dhi As Sufal and Ibb districts with health intervention, and WASH intervention in six IDP sites in Ibb governorate. In the health component, four health centers will be supported to provide the health minimum service package for IDPs and host population. The needs of these HFs where determined according to a needs assessment which was conducted in the project set up phase. The health centers will be supported based on the national guidelines, cluster updated guidelines and MSP standards. The activities will be implemented through supporting the health workers, providing medicines and supplies, providing furniture and equipment and finally rehabilitating the infrastructure and supporting operational costs. For the WASH component, the project aims to address the critical WASH gaps in six IDP sites in Ibb, Al-Mashanah, and Al-Dhihar districts. This will include water trucking, cleaning campaigns, raising the awareness and training on hygiene, construction of latrines, etc.
The differentiated needs of women and girls, men and boys of different ages and disparities are addressed by providing reproductive health services for PLW, providing basic health services for all age and gender groups, providing child health care for U5 Children in the targeted health centers. As well, the WASH activities will be designed to meet the needs of the different ages and gender in the IDP sites, considering the different circumstances to ensure dignity and prevent harm.

Regarding risks, one of the expected risks is delay in signing the sub-agreements which may delay the implementation of the project. The mitigation will be through early coordination with related stakeholders and by giving this process a sufficient period before direct implementation. Another risk is the limited procurement percentage issued by YHF for high risk partners will cause inability to provide the targeted health centers with the required equipment, supplies and medications. Accordingly, the provided services wouldn&#x2019;t meet the standards and the objective of the intervention won&#x2019;t be achieved. To mitigate this, YDN addressed the health cluster seeking support. The cluster informed us that they tried but no exception for health projects was obtained from YHF. As well, the cluster assured us that they will provide emergency kits from WHO once the project starts. Eventually, YDN successfully coordinated with HC, to procure the required health commodities and the rehab by INTERSOS.
YDN&#x2019;s experience in the provision of humanitarian aid, the management of any field difficulties, and the use of the best practices has significantly improved through the implementation of many integrated emergency projects in different areas. More specifically, this is going to be the sixth health project, and the eleventh funded from the YHF. All along with the other humanitarian relief and developmental projects implemented by YDN in different governorates.
YDN health sector includes a team of experts with different specialties, who are supervising and implementing the health interventions and are developing special updated guidelines for the health interventions in Yemen. 
In Ibb governorate, YDN has implemented more than three projects, and is recently implementing one shelter and WASH project in three districts in Ibb governorate. 
In regard to coordination, YDN has coordinated with the MoPHP and GHO in Ibb to conduct an assessment to determine the actual needs in the nominated health facilities. This coordination ensures the accessibility of YDN and was done to facilitate the approval of the project in the sub-agreement phase.</narrative>
