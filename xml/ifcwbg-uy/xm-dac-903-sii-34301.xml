   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Productivity enhancement: Scanntech&apos;&apos;s platform allows SMEs such as independent grocery stores to process transactions, run inventory management, and sell financial services. This allows the SMEs to provide new services to end consumers, driving sales and store traffic, thereby strengthening the role of small and medium sized retailers in the economy.   Financial Inclusion: The Company&apos;&apos;s platform can be used by financial services companies to expand the reach of their products (i.e. micro-credits), thereby improving access to finance for the population.   The Scanntech network gives an additional incentive to SMEs to professionalize their operations and join the formal economy.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Scanntech (or the Company), a Uruguayan based company, provides a technology platform solution to small and medium independent grocery stores in South America. Through its platform, the Company is building a network of independent stores, consumer product companies, and service providers. Scanntech allows small and medium retailers access to area promotions with suppliers and to provide additional services (i.e. top-up or financial services) to their customers, which improves sales and store traffic. At the same time, the network enables consumer product companies and service providers to gain market share by adding a large number of independent stores to their network, and by obtaining pricing and market share information in this channel, which was previously very hard to reach. IFC is considering a potential equity investment of up to US$10 million in the holding company of Scanntech to help the Company expand in other South American markets.</narrative>
