   <narrative xml:lang="EN">(a ) Objective ( s)

Strategic Objective : Save lives and protect livelihoods of targeted individuals.

Specific objectives:
&#x2022; Improving food consumption targets households.
&#x2022; Provide targeted households to access food on the steps to diversify the supply according to the preferences and eating habits .
&#x2022; Revitalize the markets affected by the crisis in Mali zones.
&#x2022; Reduce the risk of adaptation strategies unstructured household food insecurity.

( b ) Activities

After the outbreak of the crisis that led to the violence and looting in the north, there were population movements in all areas , but it is mostly urban areas that have received the most displaced persons. This has been a burden for host families in urban areas that were already weakened by the crisis . This situation persists because since the liberation of the northern regions , especially because urban centers are more secure than rural areas within regions and populations there feel safer . In addition, a number of people left rural areas to urban cities due to the poor harvest , and went back to urban centers in search of better conditions of life (safety , work, etc. ) . Increased movement of return of displaced and refugee populations put increasing pressure on already scarce resources areas and increase the number of people unemployed. The food situation remains fragile and remains heavily dependent on humanitarian support , its evolution depends on the consolidation of peace and the resumption of economic activities in the region especially in urban centers.

In this context, through cash transfers , WFP will target beneficiaries located in urban and peri -urban areas where market research conducted by WFP indicated that there was availability and diversity of food products markets in sufficient quantities and that is the very low purchasing power of vulnerable families do not allow them to access these products. With CERF funding requested , WFP will:

&#x2022; Perform cash transfer to beneficiaries through financial institutions.
&#x2022; Monitor the distribution process.
&#x2022; Follow up after the cash distribution ( Post Distribution Monitoring) to assess the use of cash assistance by households.
&#x2022; Determine the level of food consumption score in assisted households.

With CERF funding requested , 33,000 beneficiaries will receive a cash transfer to cover their food needs for three months. Each household will receive 36 225 XOF ( 75 U.S. dollars ) , equivalent to 7 245 XOF ( 15 USD ) per person</narrative>
