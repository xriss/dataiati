   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The conflict has rendered access to health facilities very difficult, particularly for the most vulnerable such as elderly and patients suffering from chronic diseases that are unable to get their medications and are at high risk of having complications from of the chronic health conditions not properly managed. This is also compounded by the limited number of the few health facilities that are still working but are no longer are no longer able to provide even lifesaving interventions.  The situation is compounded by the fact Anbar had already some of the worst health indicators in the country even before the current crisis, as well as the low immunization coverage rates for measles and polio.

The overall objective of the joint WHO/UNICEF/UNFPA health project is to ensure that affected population from Anbar and host communities within Anbar and in other governorates hosting population from Anbar have access to quality live saving public health services focusing on most vulnerable population.  The three agencies estimate that 100,000 IDPs and 400,000 individuals in host communities will benefit from the services and supplies.

In particular, WHO (14-RR-WHO-003) will support the Ministry of Health, Iraqi Red Crescent Society and other health partners to provide essential medicines and medical supplies; establish a disease surveillance system to respond immediately to outbreaks; and support the cold chain for measles and polio vaccination campaigns.</narrative>
