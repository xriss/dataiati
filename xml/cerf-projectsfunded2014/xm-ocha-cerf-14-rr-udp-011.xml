Application summary:
On 9 July 2014, a humanitarian emergency was declared in the Gaza Strip, following a severe escalation in hostilities involving intense Israeli aerial and navy bombardment and Palestinian rocket firing. The humanitarian impact of these hostilities comes against a backdrop of heightened vulnerability and instability in Gaza.
Since the current escalation in hostilities began, the situation on the ground has evolved rapidly and needs have increased markedly. An Israeli ground operation began on 18 July which alongside continued intense shelling and airstrikes, has resulted in a high level of civilian casualties, the widespread destruction of buildings and infrastructure and a steep rise in internally displaced persons (IDPs). As of 14 August, current hostilities had resulted in almost 2,000 fatalities (at least 1,416 civilians, including 459 children and 238 women), almost  10,000 injuries and the destruction or severe damage to 16,800 homes. 350,000 people are displaced in UNRWA schools,government schools or with host families. Priority for humanitarian agencies are the provision of food, water and NFI to those displaced, as well as protection,  WASH, water, health and solid waste removal.

On 15 August James Rawley, DSRSG/HC/RC for the oPt submitted an application to the CERF, covering the health, protection, WASH, and food assistance sectors.  The CERF secretariat responded the following day with comments and request for further information on the projects.</narrative>
