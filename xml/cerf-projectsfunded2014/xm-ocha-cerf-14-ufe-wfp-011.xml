   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Overall submission description (humanitarian context &amp;amp;amp;amp; prioritization):

Ongoing and unresolved conflict and inter-communal violence has impacted nine of the fourteen territories in Myanmar, leaving an estimated 834,000 people in need of humanitarian assistance. Of this population in need, the 2014 Myanmar Humanitarian Strategy plans to assist 427,000 people, including 314,000 people in Rakhine State and 113,000 people in Kachin State. The remaining 407,000 people, including some 400,000 conflict-affected people in the southeast and 7,000 people in Meikhtila, Mandalay Region, are outside of the scope of the 2014 strategy.  

Of the 427,000 people targeted for humanitarian assistance under the 2014 plan, some 191,000 are IDPs living in camps (110,000 in Rakhine State and 81,000 in Kachin State). The IDPs in camps are almost entirely dependent on humanitarian assistance to meet their basic needs. Certain groups face additional vulnerabilities, such as women who are exposed to increased levels of violence, and children who have lost significant educational days. In most of the IDP locations in Rakhine, movement constraints have resulted in an almost complete inability of displaced people to restore their previous livelihoods activities. 

The Underfuned Working Group ranked Myanmar high on its list of recommended countries due to persistent needs in Kachin and Rakhine States with a main focus on protection.  Myanmar received $3 million from CERF UF in 2013. The ERC approved an underfunded emergency allocation of $5.5 million for the highest priority life-saving needs as identified in the new Strategic Response Plan  Upon notification that Myanmar had been selected to receive the underfunded grant, the Humanitarian Coordinator launched a consultative prioritization process which included an analysis of (1) the sector funding priorities, (2) the funding requirements of the 2014 Myanmar Humanitarian Strategy, (3) the sector allocation of 2013 donor funding contributions, and (4) likely changes to 2014 donor funding trends.

Myanmar underfunded submission and review process:
Total envelope: USD 5.5 million (round I allocation: USD 95.5 million for 11 countries)
Grant package received: 21 February 2014
Total # of projects submitted: 10

Overall project description 14-UF-WFP-011 (Food Security):
The project objective is to provide life-saving food assistance to the Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) in Rakhine, Kachin and northern Shan States and improve food security status of the affected population.

The total number of people targeted with CERF funding is 218,000 (Rakhine -128,000, Kachin - 82,000 and northern Shan - 8,000).

With CERF funds, the agency will purchase food (rice, pulses, oil and salt) and provide it to IDPs under monthly general food distributions (rice 13.5 kg, pulses 1.8 kg, oil 0.9 litre and 150 grams salt). 

Total project requirements:			USD 53,000,000
Current funding level:				USD 4,137,931 
Recommended to the ERC for approval:		USD 1,700,000

The CERF Secretariat recommends this project for approval.</narrative>
