   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Sao Paulo Emergency Response Phase 3: Putting food on the table in the Pandemic</narrative>
  </title>
  <description>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">14 months into the Pandemic Brazil has &gt;381k recorded deaths, 14 million cases (22/04/21) and is on the crest of a devastating 2nd wave. Sao Paulo has had &gt;2.7 million cases and over 88000. ICUs are close to capacity, whilst only 5% population had received both vaccines by late April. Economic impacts haves affected poor urban people most. 58% of the population is now food insecure and extreme poverty has increased from 9 to 27 million (13% population) in 6 months. State emergency support (now less than US$50 a month and suspended in the first 3 months of the year) is a quarter of a minimum wage, with no new applicants to the scheme accepted. Solidarity donations have also dried up. Food prices have risen 15% with staples such as rice and beans increasing 70% and 51%. As a result 58% people are now food insecure with many vulnerable people only able to eat once a day.

The project will provide 4 months of direct food and hygiene support to 5280 vulnerably housed and homeless people living in favelas, occupations and slums of S&#xE3;o Paulo through basic food baskets and cash transfers. 1000 households will receive food parcels for 4 months, and 300 will also receive cooking gas vouchers. 56 rubbish collectors who have been unable to work will receive cash transfers. Families headed by women, with children, older and disabled people  will be prioritised. Voices of vulnerable people will be heard during through project staff participation in coordination spaces with decision-makers.

The project will ensure that the most vulnerable have access to food and essential hygiene items and can survive the worst months of the health and economic crisis, avoid malnutrition and the weakening of the body&#x2019;s systems to fight disease which can result in lengthy hospital stays. Hygiene and cleaning items will enable vulnerable people to protect themselves against the virus and maintain dignity. Avoiding the need to choose between eating and paying rent will  reduce risk of homelessness.</narrative>
