   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Sao Paulo Emergency Response Phase 3 and 4: Putting food on the table in the Pandemic</narrative>
  </title>
  <description>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">20 months into the Pandemic Brazil has &gt;613k recorded deaths, 22 million cases (Nov 2021). Sao Paulo has had &gt;4.4 million cases and over 153,700 deaths. Economic impacts have affected poor urban people, especially women and mixed race and black people. 19 million face hunger and 117 million are food insecure. Extreme poverty has increased from 9 to 27 million (13% population). Social protection access and cover has shrank with the ending of emergency payments, and replacement to the Family Allowance, &apos;Brazil Assistance&apos; inaccessible to the poorest. Solidarity donations have dried up. Inflation is &gt;10% and prices of staples have risen - rice by 71% and beans by 56%. As a result many vulnerable people eat once a day.

The project provides 8 months of direct food and hygiene support to 5280 vulnerably housed and homeless people in favelas, occupations and slums of S&#xE3;o Paulo through basic food baskets and cash transfers. 1000 households will receive food parcels for 9 months, and 300 will also receive cooking gas vouchers. 56 rubbish collectors will receive cash transfers. Families headed by women, with children, older and disabled people will be prioritised. Voices of vulnerable people will be heard during through project staff participation in coordination spaces with decision-makers.

The project will ensure that the most vulnerable have access to food and essential hygiene items and can survive the worst months of the health and economic crisis, avoid malnutrition and the weakening of the body&#x2019;s systems to fight disease. Hygiene and cleaning items will enable vulnerable people to protect themselves against the virus and maintain dignity. Avoiding the need to choose between eating and paying rent will  reduce risk of homelessness.

In phase 4 (the final 5 months of the project), learning from phase 3 will ensure that cash transfers using pre-pay cards are further rolled out to approximately 10% of beneficiaries in tenements and occupations in a pilot initiative.</narrative>
