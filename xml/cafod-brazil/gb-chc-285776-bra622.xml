  </title>
  <description>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This emergency project aims to minimise the impact of hunger and food insecurity of vulnerable families living in the states of Maranhao and Piaui, in Northeast Brazil, as a direct result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The project will distribute food baskets of non-perishable food items to a total of 3,380 families in situations of extreme vulnerability - especially those headed by women, with school-age children and adolescents who no longer have access to school meals as their main meal, due to lockdown measures preventing school attendance. 2,370 families living in 15 municipalities in Maranh&#xE3;o, and 1,010 families in 3 municipalities in Piau&#xED; will receive one food basket per family, in one distribution. The baskets will supplement family access to other food sources, and Caritas Brasileira estimates that they will contain enough food to sustain a family of 5 for 15 days. The project will last 3 months, covering staff recruitment, training, baseline/needs assessment, project execution and reporting.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, food insecurity has worsened alarmingly in Brazil. A 2021 national survey showed that 19 million are living with hunger. The Northeast Region has the second highest rate of people living with hunger (14%), and families supported by this project are living in extreme poverty, with reduced access to social welfare programmes (Bolsa Familia and government COVID emergency support); loss of access to school meals for children/adolescents; and lack of childcare services and social assistance. 

Meanwhile, Brazil continues to battle a third wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, with over 534,000 deaths (second globally, behind the US), and 19 million cases. In Maranh&#xE3;o, there are currently 320,000 cases and 9,098 deaths (population of 6.8 million); Piau&#xED; has 18,700 cases and 552 deaths (population of 3.2 million). Vaccination rates are still slow, with only 36% vaccinated in Maranhao, and 35% in Piaui &#x2013; well behind the 70-85% herd immunity threshold estimated by scientists.</narrative>
