  </title>
  <description>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">An extratropical cyclone that formed in the Atlantic Ocean, caused by low pressure on the southern coast of Brazil has led to torrential rains and extreme floods in the south of Bahia and the Jequitinhonha valley of Minas Gerais. An estimated total of 247,000 people have been impacted so far in the states of Bahia and Minas Gerais, with nearly 25,000 forced to leave their homes to live with friends/family, and over 8,000 people losing their homes and sheltered in public facilities. The most urgent needs of affected communities are drinking water, food, clothes, mattresses, nappies for children and sanitary items for women. Medicines and hygiene items are also paramount as people are increasingly exposed to dirty and contaminated water, and the mass movement and gathering of people increases their risks to COVID-19. There is also a great need for construction materials to rebuild homes after the most critical period of flooding subsides. 

This project aims to support 102 most vulnerable families with cash transfer payments of BRL400 per family per month, over three months, to support their recovery and meet their short-term basic needs (food and non-food items) in the immediate aftermath of the floods. The project will focus on assisting female-headed households in the cities of Itamaraju and Jucuru&#xE7;u (state of Bahia), and the indigenous population of Maxacalis in the rural municipalities of Te&#xF3;filo Ontoni and Machacalis (state of Minas Gerais).

The rains began on 6/12/21 and are continuing, with rainfall exceeding 60 mm/h or 100 mm/day and winds above 100 km/h. In Bahia, 38 of the state&apos;s 417 municipalities have registered flood damage and declared a state of emergency. Landslides killed at least six people in the municipalities of Itamaraju and Teixeira de Freitas (Bahia), and more than 7,000 people were forced from their homes. In Minas Gerais, the state government declared a state of emergency in 31 cities on 11/12/21, as 9,500 people had to seek shelter with friends and relatives, while 2,000 families needed to seek refuge in community centres. 6 municipalities are severely affected: Machacalis, Joa&#xED;ma, Bert&#xF3;polis, Palmop&#xF3;lis, Fronteira do Vale and Monte Formoso. 1,000 people left their homes due to the risk of landslides, many had to wait to be rescued on rooftops, bridges have collapsed and roads have been damaged, affecting logistics.</narrative>
