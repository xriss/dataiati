  <description>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project aims to support 210 low-income farming families (c.1,050 people) located in 5 riverside communities in the municipality of Itacoatiara, Amazonas, Brazil, to rebuild their livelihoods after suffering devastating damage and loss to crops and livestock, due to the worst floods in Amazonas state since records began. These crops are both a source of food sovereignty and the main source of family income, via local markets. Many families have had to abandon their homes for months to wait for the flood levels to recede, and it is only now that they have been able to return to rebuild what they have lost. The project will focus on the following key activities: reconstruction of five community farinha (manioc flour) houses; replanting of four key crops that had been lost: corn, yam, banana and vegetables; agroecological and disaster risk reduction technical support to farming families. Key results are focused on rebuilding livelihoods sources so that food sovereignty, income generation and other house repairs can gradually improve over time. 

Agriculture and livestock is Itacoatiara&#x2019;s second main source of income, and it is the largest agricultural centre of Amazonas, making the losses in rural areas affect the entire local economy. It was one of the most badly affected areas by the floods, where the highest river levels were registered due to its location on the left bank of the Amazonas River, in the eastern region of the state. Located in a low plateau area, with a small slope towards the water courses, there are large rivers, lakes, islets and small streams that run through the city. The Institute of Agricultural and Forestry Development of Amazonas (IDAM) reports that the flood has affected more than 3,000 families in 15 neighbourhoods, mainly in rural areas.

At the peak of the flooding, records show that the Negro river reached 30 metres, the Amazonas river reached 16 metres, and the Solim&#xF5;es River reached 21 metres - classified by the Geological Service of Brazil (SG-CPRM) as a severe flood for 230 days (almost two-thirds of the year). The Civil Defence of Amazonas estimates that 455,576 people were affected by the flooding of the rivers Negro, Solim&#xF5;es and its tributaries, impacting 57 of the 62 Amazonian municipalities. According to the Institute of Agricultural and Forestry Development of Amazonas (IDAM) more than 16,000 families had losses in agricultural production, equivalent to almost R$ 190 million (&#xA3;27m @ 7) due to the floods.</narrative>
