   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project involves a joint IDA-IFC Risk Sharing Facility (RSF) in the local currency equivalent of $5 million ($10 million portfolio size).  The RSF will apply to the portfolios of Small and Medium Enterprise (SME) loans originated by Banque Internationale pour le Commerce et lIndustrie du Senegal (BICIS), one of the two banks selected by the Government of Senegal (GoS) to benefit from this RSF program.  The RSF to be issued by IFC will cover up to 50% of the credit risk of the commercial banks portfolio of new SME loans, with IDA funds of up to $1 million taking the first loss risk to IFC.   IDA funds will be held in euros in a World Bank Trust Fund and will take 50% of the first loss risk.  The commercial banks will share all losses on a 50-50 basis with the IFC-IDA RSF.   In addition to the guarantee, the project envisages two technical assistance (TA) components:    - TA to each commercial bank, with the objective of transferring the necessary skills and procedures to better service the SME sector and thus enhance the banks capacity to underwrite new SME loans on a profitable and sustainable basis; and  - TA to SMEs, which aims to help bridge the gap between the SMEs and the banks by providing some basic financial and management training to the SMEs.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project is part of a much larger IDA project, the Private Investment Promotion Project (PIPP), a. multi-sector project that seeks to stimulate private investments and to build capacity.   Development Impact:    Consistent with the objective of supporting sustainable private sector development, this RSF contributes to high development impact in two key, high-priority areas:   - Development of the financial sector in Sub-Saharan Africa:  Improving the capacity of banks can lead to increased efficiency and stability in the financial markets.  A sound financial sector contributes to the development of the local economy and attracts foreign investment.   - Development of the SME sector:  The SME sector makes up a large share of Senegals economic output and makes several vital contributions, including the creation of jobs and increasing economic activity. Increased access to finance and capacity building for this sector, facilitated by the PCG, can lead to higher levels of entrepreneurial activity, private sector development and improvement in economic output.  Furthermore, the project would support the GoSs objective of accelerating poverty reduction by furthering sustainable, equitable economic growth and will:   - increase SME access to medium term finance;  - promote the competitiveness of selected industries, including enhancing linkages and know-how transfer between large businesses and SMEs and working within high potential value chains to alleviate critical bottlenecks identified through careful supply chain analysis;  - promote a conducive business environment for domestic and foreign investment.</narrative>
