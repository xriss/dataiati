   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Summary Of Project Information (SPI)     Project Name			SENEGAL - Senegal Tanneries S.A. (SENTA S.A.)    Region				Sub Saharan Africa    Sector				Manufacturing    Project No				008427    Projected Board			November 22, 1997   Date    Company Name			SENTA S.A.    Technical Partner and/or Major Shareholders    Mr. Livio Banfi, 48, Italian, is Chairman and Managing Director, and has been involved in the leather business since 1979 with 20-years experience in hide  processing and trading. The main shareholders are Livio Banfi, Abdou Thiam, Paul Bach and Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; Coloniale, each with 20% of the shares.    Project Cost Including Proposed IFC Investment    Overall project is estimated at US$1,951,717. IFC has been asked to provide a  loan of US$400,000 representing 20% of the project cost.    Location of Project and Description of Site    The project, consisting in a tannery, is built on a 1,500 sq.m. plot in the industrial area of Dakar, known as the Free Export Zone.  The project site is about 20 kms from the center of the city and is well served by roads and transport. The site previously hosted an aluminum processing factory.    Description of Company and Purpose of Project    The project is designed to collect fresh salted skins and process them into wet blue leather. Production will be solely for export to European markets.    IFCs contribution to the project will be to provide affordable long-term financing to a Company that would otherwise have to   resort to expensive bank overdrafts, and support a Company that performs value added-work.    The project will have considerable development impact.  It will reduce the export of raw   skins and hides from Senegal.  These   exports will generate foreign exchange, and it will   contribute to the growth of the herd population in this Sahelian country.    Environmental Category and Issues    This is a category B project according to IFCs environmental review procedure.  The key environmental and health and safety issues include effluent treatment and discharge, solid waste and sludge management and disposal, hazardous materials storage and handling, and workplace health and safety.  SENTA will upgrade its existing primary effluent treatment plant with a new biological treatment process so that, within one year of the loan disbursement, the resulting effluent discharge will meet World Bank guidelines.  Solid wastes and treatment plant sludges are disposed in an approved off-site landfill.  Hazardous chemicals are segregated and stored in separate buildings with adequate spill containment.  Adequate fire protection features and procedures are provided, and the installation complies with World Bank health and safety requirements.    IFC will monitor the sponsors ongoing compliance with World Bank policies, and environmental, health and safety guidelines during the life of the project by evaluating monitoring reports submitted annually to IFC.  In addition, SENTA will provide IFC with the appropriate evidence of compliance with the one year schedule to upgrade its effluent treatment plant.    The Environmental Review Summary is available from the Public Information Center.    Date SPI sent to PIC		October 22, 1997    This Summary of Project Information is prepared and distributed to the public in advance of consideration of the proposed transaction by the Corporations Board of Directors.  It is provided for the purpose of enhancing the transparency of IFCs activities and should not be construed as presuming the outcome of IFC Board Consideration.
