   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project will have significant development impact as it will support the improvement of the living conditions of population in rural areas and the reduction of poverty. The project aims to support the progressive transformation and improvement of living conditions of the population in rural areas of Senegal which at present lacks electricity. This will be achieved by (i) providing lighting and access to modern communication to 11,826 new rural households, (ii) improving delivery of social services, health centers and schools and (iii) enhancing economic productivity through the provision of electricity for productive purposes. 

The population in rural areas depends on fuel-wood for cooking, on wicks, kerosene lamps and some small batteries for lighting, and on human force  frequently from women  for domestic and productive tasks. The project should promote growth and the personal development of women and children by making their domestic work load less heavy

The social benefits from electrification  the ability to power lights, radios, small appliances and televisions  will make a significant contribution to enhancing the quality of life and the reduction of poverty.

The Project will improve access to electricity as it will provide electricity to 11,826 rural users (9,945 via connections to the national grid and 1,852 with individual solar kits), in the next three years who at present do not have access to electricity.

The project will have a positive environmental impact since it will help to reduce CO2 emissions through the use of renewable energy. It will promote conservation by: using renewable sources of energy (solar energy) and reducing deforestation. Comasel Louga has opted for solar powered systems to complement the electricity provided by Senelec. Clean renewable energy sources will help reduces the use of individual fuel based generators and wood fuels thus reducing pollution in these communities.</narrative>
