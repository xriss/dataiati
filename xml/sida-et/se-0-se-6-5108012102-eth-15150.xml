    <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Embassy of Swedem has been financing and cooperating with JeccDO since 2014, in different phases. This final completion report covers the last cooperation that was agreed between JeccDO and the Embassy and covers the period of July 2014 - December 2017. JeccDo was initially an organisation that was running an institution for vulnerable and exposed children. JeccDo has gradully changed overtime and is now an experienced and professional capacity/community development organisation that works with local CBOs in order to strengthen women&apos;s and children&apos;s rights. For that purpose they received SEK 15 000 000 from The Embassy of Sweden for the above mentioned agreement period.&#xA0; The agreement was later extended to June 2018 with an activity period lasting to September 2017.
The anticipated goals of the programme have been:
- create access to alternative education for women that never received an education when they were young, due to child marriage or other reasons.
- enhance academic performance by young girls
-access to early childhood education for under school age children
- improve living condition for the target group.
- increased economic income for the guardians of the vulnernable children in the target areas
- reduce school drop out rate
- reduced gender based violence and increase family reunification
- increased awareness among duty bearers on the need for proctection of the target group
- increased capacity among CBO to contribute to above goals.
Prior the intervention started JeccDO made a base line study and concluded the 123 348 children were living under vulnerable conditions in the JeccDO target area. JeccDo managed to reach 4355&#xA0; children during the project imlementation (3,5%). The areas were JeccDo has chosen to work are particularly poor and exposed to hardship and in that context children and women tend to be the most affected.
JeccDo works with different approaches to improve the lives of these children and women. They mainly try to capacitate CBOs and communties to themselves take responsbility to address the needs and and the challenges for vulnerabel women and chilfen. For that purpose JeccDO sub-grant and cooperate with 40 CBOs at local level. The CBOs get a grant and capacity development support. The capacity development consists of management skills, RBM, monitoring, community engagement, advocacy skills etc. This way of working has proved to be very efficient and created good conditions for sustainablity. JeccDo also engage with local authorities, especially at kebele level, and different service providers, to strenthen dialogue and closer collaboration with the citizens.
Some concrete results that the programme has obtained are:
- 637 females got access to alternative basic education- 2143 school girls improved their academic results- school drop out reduced- the living conditions of 4355 women and men were improved- the income of guardians of vulnerable children was increased- savings increased- 101 reunifications between street children and their familiies- 706 women and men got employment</narrative>
