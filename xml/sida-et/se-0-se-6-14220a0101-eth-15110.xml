  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Ethiopia is in the process of designing  its Ten-Year Perspective Development Plan for 2020/1-2029/30.  This will be the first time that a national development plan has been developed since Ethiopia underwent its recent democratic transition.  Ethiopia is determined to take advantage of and harness this unique opportunity for change, by developing its plan in an inclusive, democratic and participatory way that is unprecedented in Ethiopia.  Thus, CIC assumed to support the Ethiopian government to conduct a countrywide polling exercise  to inform the decisions and processes around the plan. The polling exercise will be carried out by a commissioned professional agency with experience working in Ethiopia and internationally. The themes and issues to be covered during the exercise will include, 

&#x2022;	ensuring equitable benefits of development to all sections of the population
&#x2022;	concrete and perceptible improvement in the people&#x2019;s standard of living
&#x2022;	substantively reducing the level of poverty 
&#x2022;	creating more employment opportunities
&#x2022;	building able and responsive national public institutions, improving justice and governance
&#x2022;	ensuring access to education, health, water, roads
&#x2022;	improving technology and skills 
&#x2022;	peace and security
&#x2022;	addressing the challenges posed by climate change
&#x2022;	ensuring women&#x2019;s equitable participation

This engagement of public opinion in Ethiopia will follow a phased approach, the first polling exercise will be followed up by a broader quantitative and qualitative exercise, which will take place in Ethiopia at the same time as it takes place in the other countries involved in the Grand Challenge on Inequality and Exclusion.   

This will provide insights on the opportunities, public perceptions, rhetorical framing and strategies that can most effectively help to generate the momentum required to drive policies and programs that can tackle inequality and exclusion. 
 
In developing the opinion research, the Center on International Cooperation is making use of a renowned group of experts connected with academia, non-profits and the private sector, all of whom have extensive experience organizing large scale socially and politically oriented opinion research in a variety of countries and settings, including with governments, civil society and multilaterals.  

The support provided by CIC is not limited to the polling process, but includes broader accompanying support to Ethiopia on inclusive planning as well as on navigating challenges and harnessing opportunities in this period of democratic transition.</narrative>
