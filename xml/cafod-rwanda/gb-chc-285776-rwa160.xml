  <description>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">For over five years CAFOD was in partnership with CDJP Nyundo. In the first phase, partnership was thought the Action for Better Governance Program, and lately partnership was through the Peace building projects. Currently, CAFOD is in the process of closing the project partnership with CDJP Nyundo. Although the project had significant impact on the lives of the people, in strengthening peaceful coexistence between the people of the Nyundo diocese, on the one hand between the cross-border peoples of Goma and Gisenyi, and on the other hand with the peoples of the Diocese of Nyundo. Nyundo has god a record of having worked with women, youth and priests as a some of its direct target. It has come clear to our understanding that the role played by women and youth in our communities is paramount. This has shown us that the involvement of women and young people in the search for peace and the process of peaceful cohabitation, both categories remain unavoidable. In this crucial period, as we reflect on ending the partnership, CDJP / Nyundo wants to make sure that the landing process at every parish level is as smooth as possible. The aim is run some quick spot check with the leaders in the Diocese (board of directors of the CDJP) and the parish leaders and define together the effective sustainability strategy to upkeep the achievements of the peace building program even with limited means in the diocese.
CDJP / Nyundo will as well organize meeting to sensitize the animators for their role in ensuring sustainability of past years achievements. This project will cover the entire Diocese of Nyundo and will last a period of six months.</narrative>
