      <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Agenda for Sustainable Development for the period until 2030 (Agenda 2030) was adopted at the UN Summit in 2015. Agenda 2030 sets out the principle &quot;leave no one behind&quot; and is supported by an interlinked set of 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Each country is encouraged to implement the Agenda 2030 and the SDGs to track progress and to inform the UN on the progress of their implementation. The SDGs will be implemented and monitored against national indicators included in the national plans and development strategies. Thus, &#x201C;localization&#x201D; is one of the key elements in the implementation of the SDGs. The Parliament plays an important role in supporting all these efforts.
The SDGs replaced the Millennium Development Goals that were successfully achieved by the Republic of Belarus before the deadline. Belarus attaches great importance to the successful implementation of the Agenda 2030 and the SDGs. &quot;Nationalization&quot; of the SDGs has been initiated by the Republic of Belarus with the establishment of the post of National Coordinator on implementation of Sustainable Development Goals and the establishment under his/her leadership the Council for Sustainable Development. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs performs the function of the Secretariat of the National Coordinator on implementation of Sustainable Development Goals. Belarus has become one of 44 countries that will present national reviews on SDGs implementation at the political forum of the UN high-level forum on sustainable development in July 2017 at the headquarters of UN in New York.

The UNDP intends to support the efforts of the Government and the Parliament of the Republic of Belarus in implementation of the Agenda 2030 and the SDGs.

The undisputable importance of cooperation between the Parliament of the Republic of Belarus and the United Nations Development Programme stems from the overall shared commitment to support the Parliament&#x2019;s role in SDGs implementation.
