  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Turkey is establishing a regulatory and institutional framework to promote energy efficiency, including a National Energy Efficiency Strategy and Energy Efficiency Law. Based on this framework, efforts have been made to improve energy efficiency (EE) in energy-intensive sectors such as steel, cement and paper. However, these efforts were largely made by the companies of the designated energy- intensive sectors only and the dissemination of the efforts and outputs of EE needs concerted efforts covering all industry, especially including small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) that form the bulk of industrial enterprises in Turkey. Various finance, capacity, technology and policy barriers still stand in the way of the widespread adoption of energy-efficient processes and technologies. comprehensive and integrated approach that will focus on: (1) Contributing to the implementation of the EE Law by strengthening the institutional-regulatory framework and promoting a national Energy Management Standard; (2) Enhancing capacity and creating awareness in Turkish industrial companies as well as financial service and energy service providers; (3) Implementation of energy audits in large industry and SMEs; (4) Demonstration of state-of-the-art management practices, EE measures and technologies and appropriate business a</narrative>
