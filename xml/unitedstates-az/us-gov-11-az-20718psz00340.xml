    <narrative xml:lang="EN">U.S. assistance to Azerbaijan seeks to integrate the country into a whole, free, and peaceful Europe. U.S.~assistance takes an integrated approach focused on democratization and human rights, security, and economic liberalization and trade development, as the U.S.~government seeks to increase Azerbaijan&apos;s cooperation with the Euro-Atlantic community. It will promote initiatives that reduce Azerbaijan&apos;s vulnerability to Russian or other outside aggression, as well as to withstand the possibility of violent extremism. There have been increased restrictions on civil society and the media in Azerbaijan since 2013, highlighting the country&apos;s need for continued advocacy and support for democracy and human rights protection. Programs will aim to strengthen citizens&apos; ability to participate in public life, increase media freedom, improve media professionalism, and support the rights of journalists and civil society. They will promote good governance and foster democratization, including development of democratic institutions and processes. U.S.~assistance will continue to support Azerbaijan&apos;s efforts to combat trafficking in persons and will support efforts to empower women to participate more effectively in the political and economic spheres. Given Azerbaijan&apos;s borders with Russia, Georgia, Armenia, and Iran, U.S.~security assistance will aim to increase Azerbaijan&apos;s ability to contribute more effectively to counterterrorism, counternarcotics efforts, and to combat the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction (WMD). U.S.~assistance will bolster Azerbaijan&apos;s border security, capacity to combat domestic and transnational crime, ability to protect the maritime energy facilities on which its economy depends, and contribute to international efforts on peacekeeping. Azerbaijan&apos;s economy is largely dependent on its hydrocarbon resources, but its long-term prosperity and economic stability require diversification. Economic assistance will address critical policy and institutional constraints, promote trade liberalization, strengthen ties with Western and global markets, and foster diversification and sustainable growth in the non-oil sectors of the economy. U.S. assistance will build resilience and reduce vulnerability to Russian aggression, increase European integration, and provide continued support for enduring programs.</narrative>
