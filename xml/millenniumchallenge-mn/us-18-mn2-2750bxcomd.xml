   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Signed in July 2018, MCC&apos;s investment aims to provide a sustainable supply of water that will stem the impact of an impending water crisis and sustain private sector-led economic growth in the capital city, Ulaanbaatar. The MCC compact will increase the available supply of water through infrastructure for development of new wellfields and capacity building. The compact&apos;s Water Supply Project will support the construction of new groundwater wells and a state-of-the-art plant for purifying drinking water, the construction of a new plant for treating and reusing wastewater, and the development and implementation of policy, legal, regulatory and institutional reforms that enhance the long-term sustainability of Ulaanbaatar&apos;s water supply. These investments will increase the supply of water to Ulaanbaatar by more than 80 percent, putting the city on a better footing to sustain its future economic growth. The Government of Mongolia will also contribute $111.8 million to support the investment.</narrative>
