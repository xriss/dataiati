   <narrative xml:lang="EN">To address urbanization, industrialization and waste management challenges in the country, the proposed project will support Uganda&apos;s (1) green city development by preparing the urban development guidelines and the preparation of the masterplans for two secondary cities and infrastructure investment plans for these cities to include pipeline of priority project, develop local area plans and Neighborhood Plans and establishing a knowledge and stakeholder engagement platform to rally support, build capacity and raise awareness of relevant stakeholders; (2) green industrialization by developing the green free zone and industrial park guidelines and the green industrialization masterplan, designing model green free zone, green free zone policy and green industrial park and providing financing and investments options including one bankable project concept note for possible funding to facilitate industrial park development; (3) efficient waste management by developing the Greater Kampala Metropolitan Authority (GKMA) waste management strategy, designing two waste sorting and diversion centers in GKMA, assessing oil and petroleum waste and e-waste recycling potential and designing an SME fund for waste management value chain actors and an accelerator to facilitate SME access to the fund by providing business development support; and (4) integration of green growth into planning and budgeting system and effective communication of UGGDS. Throughout the project implementation, stakeholder engagement is an integral part of project to address gender equality and social inclusiveness and garner support from stakeholders. Capacity building activities will be conducted to ensure government staff, relevant private sector partners and subnational stakeholders understand and are empowered to adapt and implement the guidelines and master plans developed.</narrative>
