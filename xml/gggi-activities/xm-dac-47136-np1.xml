   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Growth of transport sector and motorization &#x2013; Demand for vehicles has grown by 14% per year during 1990-2015, with much of this concentrated in and around the Kathmandu Valley region. Sustained levels of population growth in Kathmandu, and the increasing prominence of the city&#x2019;s economy mean that demand for mobility in the capital will remain high for the foreseeable future. Since the 2000s, air pollution in Nepali cities, particularly Kathmandu, has worsened considerably. Levels of particulate matter in the air around Kathmandu are now similar to those of Delhi and Beijing. A 2007 study found that air pollution lead to approximately 17,000 premature deaths in Kathmandu.</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">A detailed assessment of each municipality was undertaken over September ? December 2017, for finalization in early 2018. This assessment was based on both primary research undertaken in each municipality, as well as secondary sources. The assessment reviewed the economic, social and environmental dimensions of each municipality&#x2019;s growth, and explored the institution, technical and financial management of the municipality. Based on this assessment, in close consultation with each municipality, a set of policy, planning and project initiatives and recommendations were made. Based on local and federal feedback, the Green Municipal Growth Assessments were completed in early February 2018, and approved by municipalities.
In June 2018, the final knowledge sharing event of this project was conducted. This was a two-day workshop in Kathmandu. This workshop including 1.5 days of training sessions delivered to the mayors and other municipal leaders on key components of green municipal growth, including urban planning, asset mapping, financing and tax collection, environmental management and climate change.
The final printed and translated Municipal Green Growth Assessments for the seven municipalities were presented as final products to the municipalities.</narrative>

All provide for key investments into the electric mobility ecosystem in Nepal. These project ideas required multiple rounds of stakeholder and bilateral consultations. Each project idea explores technical viability and undertakes preliminary financial analysis to determine IRR and cost recovery. The final project ideas were approved in early December 2018.</narrative>
