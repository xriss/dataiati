   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Over the next 15 years, the global economy will require USD 89 
trillion for infrastructure investments in cities, energy, and land-
use systems, and USD 4.1 trillion incremental investments in low-
carbon transitions to limit the global temperature rise within 2&#xB0;C. 
Despite the needs, channeling international finances into green 
growth sectors is challenging, especially within the complexity of 
development architecture. The key challenge is to attract required 
capital flows for green growth projects in developing countries 
due to lack of capacity of domestic institutions.</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">In 2018, two GCF readiness projects were successfully completed as
pre?investment risk pilots, one for MGFC and the other for Vanuatu NGEF.
* In Vanuatu, GGGI was nominated by the NDA to be the Delivery
Partner for three new GCF Readiness proposals, after our first GCF
Readiness project with Vanuatu was completed in May 2018. First
GCF readiness project received USD 270,000.00 from GCF Readiness funding to support the Government of Vanuatu (GoV) in establishing the
National Green Energy Fund (NGEF). The project carried out a market demand study, a renewable Energy (RE) Technologies feasibility study and a market and business model study. These three feasibility studies
jointly informed the strategy and implementation planning of NGEF by
bringing out the potential opportunities ? both short term and long term;
and directly contributed to the establishment of the NGEF.
*In Mongolia, GCF readiness project supported the MGCF by
identifying investment projects/program within the scope of three high
impact sub-sectors, undertaking market and technical assessments to
ensure the investment potential of projects/programs to scale up the
MGCF, and enabling the development of bankable funding proposals.</narrative>

planned, delivering three market assessments, a full feasibility study
and a funding proposal submitted. Non-Objection letter to submit the
funding proposal to GCF was issued and two letters of commitment to
invest in MGFC were obtained from the GoM (Ministry of Finance) and
the Mongolian Sustainable Finance Association. Each letter pledges a
USD 5 million equity investment from the GoM and the banks (total up
to USD 10 million).
Rwanda: In 2018, GGGI successfully mobilized USD 4 million for
FONERWA core funding from Swedish International Development
Cooperation Agency (SIDA). FONERWA&#x2019;s appreciation letter to GGGI for
the technical support to mobilize the mentioned USD 4 million was received.
Vanuatu: Member Financial Services Limited (MFSL) is the national
Pension Fund in the country with over 20,000 members. MFSL further
provided a LoI for a USD 100 million project conditional on a proposal
for Green Affordable Housing Scheme with the World Bank.</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">Mongolia: The MGFC final design was finalized with total funding USD 50 million (GCF accounting for USD 40 million). During the program period the MGFC will finance approximately USD 133.5 million of own funds, leverage financing of USD 57.2 million through PFI co-financing, and USD 58.5 million as down-payments from end-users. The GCF investment will result in at least 2 times due to revolving nature of the MGFC capitalization.
Rwanda: FONERWA is structured as a hybrid funding model National Financing Vehicle, using core funding for its demand led biannual calls for proposals and specific earmarked funding for strategic sectoral
work. It has received in 2018 USD 33 million of earmarked funding from the GCF for a new climate-resilience project and established a new financing facility that will provide Results-Based Finance (RBF) torenewable energy mini-grid projects.
Vanuatu: GCF financing proposal with the final design of the fund is currently under development by GGGI, targeting for GCF Board Meeting 22 (February 2019) to be submitted, with support of the NDA
and a suitable AE (GIZ). NGEF Bill was approved by the Parliament in June 2018 and the official gazette of the NGEF Legislation was on 23rd July 2018. The NGEF was launched by Minister of Climate Change and he also made the appointment of the NGEF Board Members. Member
Financial Services Limited (MFSL) signed USD 100 million co-finance
Commitment Letter in April 2018.</narrative>
