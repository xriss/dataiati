   <narrative xml:lang="EN">GGGI has been developing plans to work with the Least Developed
Countries Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Initiative
(LDC-REEEI) in advancing the interests and building the capacity
of the regional initiatives that utilizes local expertise rather than
international consultants and replicate what works.
GGGI interventions are rooted in supporting the Renewable Energy
and Energy Efficiency Initiative of a collaborative effort of partner
organizations and the LDC Group to achieve universal access to clean
energy for their people through integrated, sustainable and affordable
modern energy approaches that scale up the share of renewables in
the energy mix and maximize potential for energy savings.
As part of the TL work plan 2018, GGGI supported the REEEI and
ensured its sustainable energy activities aligned to the structure of
the LDC Group 2017-2018 Work Plan (WP).
Planned outputs directly addressed and supported LDC member
countries on technical support, tracking delivery, enabling learning,
fostering multi-stakeholder engagement, and strategic partnerships.
The support promotes rapid transformational action to improve
policies and to mobilize finance, and will explore effective action in:
&#x2022; Stimulating energy for productive sectors
&#x2022; Strengthening energy planning, to inform target setting and NDCs;
&#x2022; Tackling policy and regulatory barriers; and
&#x2022; Strengthen capacity of LDCs and Learning Exchanges for
Regulators, Policy Makers, and Energy Planners.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">To support GGGI LDC member countries to address the full range of their renewable energy and energy efficiency goals, and provide an opportunity
to cement the strong partnership with key government stakeholders as well as to effectively share green growth best practices among the LDC
member countries.</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">In 2018, GGGI supported member countries in formally launching
the LUCCC initiatives. The consortium of Universities and research
institutions to build the Network for long-term capacity-building,
education, and research on climate change development. The Network
serves as a repository of knowledge and capacity to tackle climate
change through sustainable and long-term capacity-building efforts to
promote education and research.
Launch of GGGI-LUCCC partnership on long-term capacity building
in Senegal and Ethiopia.
? Universities and research center representatives demonstrated
their commitments to contribute to the LUCCC implementation
and talked about similar initiatives, gaps, and threats before making
recommendations for the effective implementation of LUCCC.
? The capacity development workshop to catalyze cooperation among
universities convened representatives from various universities and
research institutes in Senegal and Ethiopia.
Participated to the bellagio, italy for the planning meeting of the luccc
partners (24th - 28th september 2018).
? Drafted and contributed for the LUCCC planning meeting in
strategic plan as the modality for the future endeavors of the
consortium as a wider south-south capacity-building network, as
well assign each member to commit to undertake climate actions for
their respective country specific thematic area.
? Discussed and developed a log-framework as a roadmap to achieve
the outcomes and goals of the LUCCC in immediate (2020),
medium-term (2025) and long-term (2030) time dimension relying
on five-year rolling workplan; and
? Initiated the preliminary tasks to draft an abstract for the perspective
column of nature and climate change focusing on the &#x2018;history of LDCs
