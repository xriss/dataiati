   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Office of Thought Leadership (TL) is responsible for 
developing and coordinating a compelling and rigorous evidence 
base that showcases impact to key audiences &#x2013; internal and 
external &#x2013; through policy research, analysis, and data-driven 
tools and methodologies &#x2013; resources that should have strategic 
planning and practical application value. It will promote knowledge 
sharing, leverage international partnerships to expand our 
impact. Activities under TL are intended to directly contribute 
to or complement operational projects and outputs, while 
simultaneously expanding and demonstrating GGGI&#x2019;s leadership in 
shaping the green growth discourse and dialogue internationally.
Policy research and analysis activities are aimed at helping 
GGGI develop strategic evidence base, frameworks, guidelines, 
and analytical models for shaping and influencing the green 
growth discourse internationally, and supporting evidence-
based green growth programs for impact on the ground. GGGI&#x2019;s 
policy research and analysis directly supports development and 
alignment of GGGI&#x2019;s operational strategy for NDC and SDG 
implementation in partner countries. The activities encompass 
(multi-country) cross-cutting as well as sectoral projects in the 
energy, transport and green cities sectors.
Knowledge sharing activities encompass strengthening and 
expanding GGGI&#x2019;s work in climate diplomacy, data-driven green 
growth tools and methodologies, and international green growth 
knowledge platforms and databases. In addition to these activities, 
TL continues to support in-country delivery through knowledge 
products and services that are based on the analysis and extraction 
of internal as well as external experiences, contextualization 
of best practices, and packaging of new knowledge, insights, 
innovations, data, tools, and methodologies.</narrative>
