   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Second phase of GGGI/Norway&#xB4;s joint green growth program with the Government of Colombia</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The expected program impact by the end of 2022 -after three years of implementation-, remains the same as in the first phase: an increase in green growth investments deployed in priority areas, and deforestation reduced thereby contributing to Colombia&apos;s SDG and NDC targets. This is materialized in the support of the fulfillment of the Government&apos;s goals of reducing deforestation and transforming productive landscapes towards environmental sustainability and social inclusion across prioritized departments.  Although a specific and individual contribution directly attributable to GGGI in the achievement of the Government&apos;s goals is difficult to measure, it will be possible to measure the program impact through the following specific measurable indicators:  i. Deforestation and restoration rates; ii. NDC progress (GHG emission reductions); iii. Areas under sustainable production (for example, livestock) and payment for ecosystem services; iv. Proportion of overall GDP comprised by the forest economy; v. Increased national and international funding allocated to green growth/Sustainable Land Use/REDD+.  &apos;</narrative>
  </description>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The proposed impact will be delivered through the following two outcomes:  1) First, Institutional effectiveness to reduce deforestation and to promote sustainable, productive and social inclusive landscapes strengthened.  2) Second, Scale-up of sustainable productive systems and implementation of restoration efforts from degraded land to sustainable productive systems under a landscapes approach promoted. These two pillars are intended to boost Colombia transition towards a green model of economic growth providing proper institutional, planning and business frameworks. These frameworks will enable sustainable productive/restorative systems and entrepreneurship alternatives to flourish at the benefit of the population, while incentivizing forest conservation efforts.  These opportunities shall reconfigure and reposition the economic value of forests providing increased income and incentives for rural communities to engage in sustainable activities.   This means reducing and avoiding deforestation while also proactively promoting the sustainable use of forests through the deployment of sustainable productive systems via the promotion of sustainable bioeconomy, nature-based tourism, forest economy and cattle ranching opportunities. The intent is to increase both income opportunities and conservation incentives, as well as promoting the recovery of key deforested areas and their ecosystem services.  As such, long-term active collaboration both at the policy and project level are the appropriate course of action.</narrative>
