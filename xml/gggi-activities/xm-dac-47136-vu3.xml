   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project aims to (i) address the lack of adaptive capacity and vulnerability of the rural water sector to adverse climate effects (climate change adaptation and GHG emission reductions) and (ii) remove barriers for the wide-scale utilization of solar power to meet the water needs of households, communities and micro-businesses initially in few target sites and eventually in the whole country.
The project will do this by providing technical, management and operational solutions to improving access to sustainable alternative sources of safe potable water in communities where there is not enough access to clean and safe water resources. The project will also create conditions that enable sustainable local management of the systems and replication and up-scale of investments in sustainable water infrastructure to rural and remote island areas.
The implementation of the project will be carried out in partnership with Government of Vanuatu Ministries and Departments responsible for energy and water. The approach will draw on lessons from ongoing initiatives and keep open communication channels to maximize learning and knowledge sharing throughout the project. The GGGI Project Manager is embedded with the DoWR to maximize project integration and learning both-ways on rural water management in Vanuatu and provide supplementary support as and when needed.
Therefore 24 cyclone-resistant solar powered water pumping systems (including storage) must be designed, successfully installed and commissioned at the identified locations where communities do not have sufficient, reliable and affordable access to water. In addition targeted communities will be trained in the Operation and Management of such systems as far asgovernment officials. National Solar Powered Water Systems guidelines will be also produced.
Finally, a Financial Sustainability Study will be carried out in order to provide mechanisms to ensure financial sustainability and development of a replication mechanism.</narrative>
