    <narrative xml:lang="EN">In the last few years, Kenya has embarked on a comprehensive and ambitious democratic reform process, including the devolution of government structures and authorities. The goal of devolution is to facilitate a more accountable and participatory system of governance that will allow for broader-based economic growth and improved service delivery at the local level. U.S. assistance in Kenya works across sectors to support this process with an overarching goal of sustainably strengthening regional peace, prosperity and security. These sectors include democracy, human rights and governance; elections in 2017; health including quality and accessibility, infectious diseases, child and maternal health, and water and sanitation; agriculture; private sector competitiveness; education and youth; and environment including biodiversity, adaptation for climate change and combating wildlife trafficking. In addition to participating in several Presidential Initiatives, Kenya is a Relief-to-Development Transition (R2DT) Focus Country and receives assistance to promote resilience and climate adaptation in drought-prone areas.</narrative>
