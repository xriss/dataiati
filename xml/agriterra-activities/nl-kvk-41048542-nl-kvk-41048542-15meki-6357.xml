  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">&lt;p&gt;Meki Batu Vegetables and Fruits Growers Cooperatives Union is a union with 7 994 members (18% - 1414 female) and 150 member primary cooperatives. The member cooperatives are found at 130 to 180 km South from Addis Ababa  where production of different vegetables and fruits is possible all year round. However  due to lack of access to and maintenance on water pumps for irrigation and due to limited access to improved seeds and other inputs  the smallholder producers of the area are producing their vegetables and fruits at minimal efficiency and in relatively low quality. Furthermore  finding access to markets that provide fair prices is also a large problem. Efforts made by Agriterra since 2013 has helped the union to get more focused by developing a five years strategic business plan (2015 to 2019) so as to ensure gradual attainments of its marketing and processing ambitions. Additionally  the union has managed to improve its financial management capabilities and have fully professionalized its accounting system. This year Agriterra action plan is the continuation of last year performances  however in this year intervention will be provided in a more coordinated manner by collaborating with IFDC 2SCALE and EHPEA. In 2015 IFDC 2SCALE will mainly focus on 1) Production improvement by introducing new higher yielding varieties and providing capacity building on good agronomic practices  and 2) Improving output marketing both domestically and internationally. In 2015 EHPEA will mainly focus on 1) Global GAP Certification and 2) Green bean export improvement. In 2015 Agriterra will mainly focus on 1) Improving the linkage between the union and its Primary Cooperatives in terms of output marketing through supporting PC cluster formation  2) strengthening the organizational performance by implementing a membership commitment coaching track and a governance and leadership coaching track  3) Ensuring technical capacity deliverance at pack house quality management and at farmer level good quality production management practices  4) Developing an irrigation mechanization management strategy.&lt;/p&gt;</narrative>
