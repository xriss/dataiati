   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Chati Dairy Cooperative union is a member-based farmer organization located in the western part of Kalulushi district of Copperbelt province. The cooperative union was established in 2014 and is composed of 256 individual members and 10 clubs.
The main business of the cooperative union is to bulk milk from its members who are located in the surrounding area in readiness for supply to Parmalat the off taker.
The cooperative currently bulks 500 litres every fortnight to supply to Parmalat. The milk volumes supplied to Parmalat is very low and is as a result of low milk producing population among the members. The cow population at the time of the assessment was 133 cows with only 16 cows milked to produce enough volumes to supply to the off taker.
Among some of the challenges the members are currently facing is low number of members who own cattle while on one hand there has been high mortality rates among the few members who managed to acquire cows through heifer international.Chati Dairy Cooperative was established in 2013 by four clubs and with support from heifer and Oxfam the members started producing milk. It was at this point that the clubs thought of forming a union through the clubs and became registered in 2014. In 2014 heifer gave the union a matching grant which was used to build the current office building. The cooperative currently has 10 clubs which form the cooperative union  about 6 cooperatives received haifers to start dairy business while the others are waiting for pass on or other external support. Currently the cooperative has a total membership of 255 individual members composed of both males and females of which 40 males 215 females and 41 youths. Members pay K250 to join the cooperative and K150 for renewal annually. There is a lot of benefit in becoming a member of the cooperative ranging from increasing self sustainance  access to market  increased knowledge in improved feeding for the cows to increase milk production. Members also have a business opportunity to grow pasture to sell to other members who have cows. The cooperative members also benefit from savings groups and study circles. The cooperative has two members of staff who are both milk technicians. The cooperative has no other management structure but have ambitions to employ the manager and book keeper. This is done through campaign for increased milk supply and production to enable the cooperative to employ the required staff. The board currently supervises the two-management staff  although both management staff have no written contracts. The cooperative came into contact with Agriterra through a head hunt which was conducted by Agriterra Business Advisor after Chati Cooperative featured in an agriculture program on the national television. The cooperative feels they can be supported in capacity building and exchange to increase milk production.</narrative>
