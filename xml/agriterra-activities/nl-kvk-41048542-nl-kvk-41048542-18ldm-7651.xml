   <narrative xml:lang="EN">2020In 2019  the union completed installation of machineries and equipment of dairy processing plant. The union received loan of Rs. 33 million from National Cooperative Bank. The union needs to generate working capital for the operation of the plant. The union designed and registered brand name &#x201C;Posilo&#x201D; for its product. The milk product processing guidelines were prepared in 2019. Until now  the union has collected fresh milk from its member organizations  provided chilling services and delivered to the dairy processing unit. With the operation of the plant in Q1 of 2020  the union will produce yoghurt  butter  ghee  condensed milk and paneer  and do marketing in Kathmandu valley. The union has set goal for sales turnover of Rs.150 million in 2020. The proposed activities on 2020 has been developed as extension of action plan 2020 by discussing with BoD and management team to cope the challenges on generating internal capital  develop capacity on product diversification and support the marketing of the dairy products.2019In 2018  LDMPCUL completed the processing factory building with NPR.30 million grants from government and NPR 16 million from own equity.  There is still capital requirement of NPR 31 million for completion of the processing facility. LDMPCUL also needs to generate financial resources for working capital. There was little progress to generate internal capital from members. Only 5 primary cooperative members out of 54 have shown committed to put share of each NPR.0 1 million. The proposed activities on 2019 has been developed as extension of action plan 2018 by discussing with BoD and management team to cope the challenges on generating capital from internal and external sources and prepare for marketing of dairy products. LDMPCUL has set target to access external loan of NPR.30 million and increase equity for working capital. In 2019  LDMPCUL has planned to complete installation of equipment and machinery  and start operation of dairy processing factory.2018The cooperation of Agriterra with LDMPCUL started on May 2016 with cooperative assessment. Agriterra supported LDMPCUL in developing a strategic plan  and strengthening institutional capacity within the cooperative and financial management. LDMPCUL has developed a 10 years business plan which gives clear overview of consumer demands  sales channels  product diversification  marketing strategies  and capital requirement. The total estimated capital requirement for completion of dairy processing plant is NPR 70 million. Out of which  LDMPCUL received NPR 20 million from government and it is yet to receive NPR 9 million from the government. So far  LDMPCUL generated NPR 16 million from own equity. There is still a remaining capital requirement of NPR 31 million for completion of the processing facility. On top of that  LDMPCUL also needs to generate financial resources for working capital. LDMPUCL should ensure the commitment from primary cooperatives for delivering of enough milk so that the processing facility run in optimum capacity. The proposed action plan for 2018 has been developed based on results achieved in 2017  and discussion with BoD and management team to cope the challenges on generating capital from internal and external sources. The proposed activities are expected to generate NPR 40 million from internal capital and external financing in 2018. The proposed activities also provide guidelines for operation of the dairy processing plant.</narrative>
