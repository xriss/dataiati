   <narrative xml:lang="EN">ANATRANS is the leading cashew nut processor in Burkina Faso. The company sources raw cashew nuts (RCN) within the local community in order to shell, peel and grade them for export to international markets. The finished product is exported in 50 lbs (~22.7 Kg) boxes to major clients in Europe and the United States. Through its different certifications, ANATRANS is able to source and supply fair trade, organic and conventional nuts. They are Fairtrade, Organic and HACCP certified, and are also working towards obtaining British Retail Consortium food safety standards by April 2020, and SMETA (Sedex Members Ethical Trade Audit) certification by June 2020.   Access to capital is crucial for ANATRANS. There are only a few months in the year when RCN are available, and sufficient stock need to be secured to ensure the functioning of the processing plant for the full year. The relatively high prices of RCN, requires a large amount of working capital. For the upcoming season (starting in March 2020), the company is looking to collect and process 10,000T of raw cashew nuts (an increase of 1,300T from 2019E). That translates into a global working capital need of &#x20AC; 12 million (in order to cover all the operating expenses from purchase of raw cashew nut until FOB delivery). For this year, ANATRANS is seeking for a working credit facility of &#x20AC;800,000 with the ABC Fund.  The ESG and TA needs assessment brought out the following main issues to be addressed: 1. Lack of financial capacity to restructure the balance sheet and financial statements The balance sheet and financial statements of ANATRANS are highly affected by debts and financial liabilities from the 2010-2015 period. This &#x201C;inherited&#x201D; financial situation makes it complicated for ANATRANS to find local banks willing to lend money. Since the new management is in place since 2015, international banks (Triodos, Rootcapital) are only willing to provide loans via their client NUTS2 which limits their financial autonomy.    2. Absence of a monitoring tool to assess the social and environmental impact of the company ANATRANS has detailed procedures in place to prevent child labour of factory and farmers&#x2019; level, based on social certification standards by ECOCERT, Fairtrade, BRC and SMETA. But the company needs tools to monitor the follow-up especially on farmers level. Besides developing a monitoring system for the follow-up on child labour, ANATRANS wants to develop an environmental impact monitoring tool to assess impact and mitigate risks on the use of natural resources (deforestation, use of protected landscapes, etc.) among its expanding number of smallholder suppliers.</narrative>
