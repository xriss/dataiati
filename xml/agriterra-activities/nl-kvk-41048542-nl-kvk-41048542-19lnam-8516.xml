   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Lu Nge Ah Man cooperative is a primary cooperative and was established in 1976. The cooperative owns around 550 acres of land which they rent to members and partly (150 acres) used by themselves. The land has been given to the cooperative in 1976. The cooperative consist of 56 members. Membership is stable since the start. Besides the land the cooperative owns a rice mill (including drying machines)  machinery  trucks  combines. Besides the board members there are 16 staff members.   The added value for members is the use of the mill and the machinery  sharing knowledge about modern farming  credit service and trade (beans).Cooperative Scoping was done on 4th July 2019 and cooperative assessment was recommended.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">There are a lot of ideas for the coming years but they need to have proper strategy.  But the cooperative has ideas how to improve the business by modernising the machinery and the use of new farming technology. Because the cooperative has around 650 acres of land they are able to get long term loans from the government (only possible when you own at least 100 acres of land). The cooperative expects that in 2 till 3 years they are allowed to sell land. At this moment one acre of land is worth around $ 3.000. By selling some acres of land (small part) it must be possible to get more loans to invest in the cooperative. The cooperative is sustainable because of the fact that they own around 650 acres of land. The plans of the cooperative are realistic because they own a lot of land  so their own equity is very high (only land is worth around 2 million dollar). The biggest challenge for the cooperative to use the equipment and machinery efficiently to get the maximum profit. The cooperative wants more youth involvement in the board. They also wants to invest in new machinery and equipment. These plans are feasible  however a more efficient use of the machinery is needed in order to get the maximum profit. For rice milling  the over capacity in Pyu is a risk. To mitigate these risks more members are needed (or more clients). What they need is an overall (strategic) plan for the future. This plan must be made with the collaboration of the youth and Agriterra as it is their future.</narrative>
