   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Technical Assistance Fund (TAF) was created by IFAD as a separate mechanism linked to the ABC Fund  which provides advisory services to agricultural organizations  SMEs and financial institutions. Rabo Partnerships is part of the Technical Assistance Fund (TAF)  led by Stichting Agriterra  and provides advisory services to the financial institutions investees.In Ecuador  Insotec was seen as an opportunity and BCP organised a remote Due Diligence (DD) to see whether Insotec could become a lender of the ABC Fund. Rabo Partnerships joined the DD team to assess the TA needs as well as carry out the ESG assessment using IFAD&#x2019;s ESG tool for FIs.Insotec is a Micro Finance Institute (&#x2018;MFI&#x2019;) and focuses on providing microcredits for Ecuador&#x2019;s rural sector  particularly to small-scale farmers  with the objective of improving the financial inclusion of low-income or vulnerable populations in the country. As of April 30  2020  73% of the loans were located in rural areas and 55% of the loans were for agricultural activities. The entity serves around 18.000 clients.After the Due Diligence was carried out by a joint team of Bamboo Finance and Rabo Partnerships the investment committee approved a loan to Insotec for USD 3 000 000. Insotec will also receive Technical Assistance from Rabo Partnerships during the lending period.</narrative>
