   <narrative xml:lang="EN">ACOPAGRO is a cooperative producer of coca beans located in the San Mart&#xED;n region in the north-eastern jungle of Peru; It has more than 1800 members to date and has a history of more than 20 years in the market  being the leading cooperative in Peru producing cocoa beans. ACOPAGRO members are small farmers with a land ownership of between 2 to 3 H&#xE1;s. ACOPAGRO has been playing an important role  both regionally and nationally  since it is the cooperative that brings together the majority of members in this crop and has led the main advances in the processing of cocoa beans  although it has not yet made the move to industrialization  its production and export is limited to dry grain to be processed abroad. It has a staff of professionals and technicians  mainly from the area  who have collaborated in the growth of the organization during this period; however  it is necessary to continue strengthening and expanding the capacities of the staff and their leaders / managers who run this organization on different issues in the process of professionalization for better decision-making at all levels  both business and institutionally. Additionally  the organization is experiencing technical problems in the field that are reducing its business  commercial and financial performance  this refers to pests in the area (such as the corn worm and witch&apos;s broom)  as well as the low yields of cocoa by H&#xE1;  (1000 kg / ha  when the optimum is 3000 Kg / ha) related to not having an effective extended technological package that includes limiting the presence of cadmium in production. This situation has meant for the cooperative a loss of production of around 30% during the years 2018 and 2019 with the consequent loss of contracts with foreign clients and reduction of the income of the producers. ACOPAGRO currently offers its members the following services: -    Technological advice in the field. -    Advance of pre-harvest credits. -    Installation of fermentation areas in various sectors. -    Installation of drying area. -    Purchase of production. -    Centralized drying services -    Storage -    CommercializationThree cooperatives of farmers who also produce cocoa beans from the same region and that face similar challenges  are also invited to this training with 6 participants each (3 staff and 3 leaders/ directors)  it means that the total number of participants is 24 (50% staff and 50% directors/ leaders). The invited cooperatives are: ALLIMA CACAO (from Chazuta-San Mart&#xED;n  373 members) CECAT (from Tocache- San Mart&#xED;n  615 members)  MONTE AZUL (from Tarapoto- San Mart&#xED;n  278 members).To execute this programme Agriterra has set up an alliance with the renowned Peruvian Business University ESAN will be part of the consortium and their local teachers will deliver the majority of the trainings. The partnership with ESAN has a big advantage because each participant will receive an official and legally recognized diploma which will be an amazing accomplishment for the participants of this TMT  especially for the elected directors and future leaders who are farmers.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The proposed training aims to provide comprehensive training that guarantees the understanding of the basic aspects of the business management of a cooperative  aimed not only at its staff but also at the directors and leaders (who will ultimately remain in the organization indefinitely) and who can give sustainability to the application of the technological package; all this promoting the participation/ inclusion of youth and women in decision-making.The program includes the elaboration of a technological research and implementation plan to solve the problems of each organization which will be evaluated by experts at the end of the program. Throughout the Program the development of a technological innovation project in the field is included and the best performing participants will be awarded by Agriterra with a study tour to the Netherlands to visit advanced cooperatives and companies that provide technological innovation.</narrative>
