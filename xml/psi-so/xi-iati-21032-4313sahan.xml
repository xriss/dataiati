   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Demand Creation for Health Services - Somali Advocates for Health and Nutrition (SAHAN) Programme</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">PSI is supporting Ministries of Health to implement the Demand Creation for Health Services - Somali Advocates for Health and Nutrition (SAHAN) programme - from July 2016 to March 2021. SAHAN is a component of DFID&#x2019;s Somali Health and Nutrition (SHINE) programme. The aim under this programme is
to identify and build a body of evidence for prototypes (interventions) demonstrated to increase access to and utilisation of reproductive, nutrition, child, and maternal health services and to promote healthy behaviour change. The program is using an adaptive, evidence-based, participatory approach to better understand the persistent barriers to uptake of health services and healthy behaviours and develop and test innovations in demand creation that target factors which influence individual behaviour to improve the health of Somali women of reproductive age (WRA) and children under-5. Using the socio-ecological model as a framework, these factors are understood to exist at and interplay between the individual, interpersonal, community, organizational and policy levels. Fundamentally this programme is re-envisioning how &#x201C;demand creation&#x201D; is done, using cutting-edge methods.

At the end, this programme is intended to have developed evidence-based, user-informed and tested interventions to drive demand for health services (in both the public and private sectors) and/or change healthy behaviours of women and caregivers of children under-5, packaged and ready to be implemented at scale with clear recommendations for contextual adaptations. In parallel, the programme will have built local capacity to develop and implement innovative behaviour change interventions using human-centered approaches, strengthened the learning environment across the health sector through promoting information sharing and collaboration.</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">PSI will emphasize innovations that can be adapted by other health sector actors. Therefore, an important part of PSI&#x2019;s approach is to replicate and share work in an easily accessible and usable way. This will include how-to toolkits, manuals, partner trainings and field exchange visits to facilitate transfer of learning within the health sector. Evidence from the Discover phase will be shared in more useful formats than study reports, including pictorial slides and will also explore use of videos. PSI will engage a behavior change communications advisor who will steer and facilitate the learning agenda for this programme with selected partners, DFID, health authorities and the wider health sector.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">A. UNFPA &#x2013; VCAT: UNFPA has adopted the VCAT concept as a compulsory 2 day precursor to the Family Planning Trainings being conducted across Somaliland and Somalia. They have also adopted the VCAT Champions as the family planning training facilitators to benefit from the synergistic effect of having the same trainers facilitate the VCAT sessions and continue with the FP sessions. B. FCDO (Program Income) &#x2013; FP Method mix: SAHAN influenced FCDO to fund FP method mix using Program Income from HCS and CHANGE programs to support the provision of Family Planning services through pharmacies and private clinics across Somaliland. C. PSI (as an implementing partner) iterated an existing prototype intervention: (Mother 2 Mother) to improve its effectiveness and was deployed tested in the USAID funded community demand creation program in 2017. Despite, it&#x2019;s marked improvement in impact, the prototype was further interrogated through an incubation process (track 2) following a discovery day. This led to further iteration. The prototype was developed and packaged for pilot and rolled out through SAHAN implementing partners. D. Perspective Media: SAHAN worked with Perspective Media to include health messaging in their Radio drama series, SAHAKA NOLOSHA in the current season programming. The radio drama is funded by the European Union with a primary message on anti-piracy and illegal immigration. E. Influencing new program designs SAHAN&#x2019;s HKH intervention implementation results were disseminated and shared with numerous partners including the MOH, World bank (WB), Implementing partners, GAVI and others. The success of the pilot intervention was well acknowledged especially by the FGS MOH and WB. It influenced changes to the design of the FGS MOH FHW program and led to the possible funding of PSI by the WB to support the capacity building of the MOH to implement the FHW programs with improvements and learnings from HKH. F. Private Sector sustainability The IVR Intervention, which was cosponsored by SAHAN and Telesom was a great success especially with the evidenced based health messages expanded by SAHAN and MoH during the pilot. Telesom have committed to continue with the expanded platform their own resources. They have also received interest from WHO on utilization of the platform especially for COVID messaging. 
G. Implementing Partners incorporating interventions to other programmes The SAHAN implementing partners were impressed with the performance of the community-based interventions. Some of them e.g. Trocaire and Action Against Hunger (AAH) have incorporated or fully adopted the intervention into their other existing demand generation activities with other sources of funds. H. MoHD, Somaliland&#x2019;s commitment to influence implementation of these demand creation activities SAHAN community-based pilot interventions in Somaliland, produced very good results. During the final joint supervision with the MOHD the end of the project, the MOHD committed to influence the sustaining of these proven activities through front line workers by supporting them directly and mandating partners to adopt the interventions and support the frontline workers.</narrative>
