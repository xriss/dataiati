We are satisfied with the progress made but we do believe we can do more within this trajectory, focusing our work with women more on Capacity Strengthening for IRM lobby &amp; advocacy activities.

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">Key stakeholders are aware of benefits of IRM in their projects and practices. Activities have focused on drawing attention to the importance of women&#x2019;s empowerment in IRM, at the national and municipal level. PfR/CARE has been involved in the organization of the forum &#x2018;Women as Pillar of Sustainable Development&#x2019;, attended by municipal authorities and several women&#xB4;s organisations. PfR/CARE has also supported the organization of the &#x2018;First Knowledge Exchange on the Application of the Gender Equality and Women&apos;s Human Rights Perspective in Humanitarian Action&#x2019;, with UN Women. In addition, PfR has provided technical, organizational, logistical and financial support for the participation of representatives of women&apos;s organizations in relevant national fora. The Council of Indigenous Women has approached PfR/CARE to share their experience related to the increase of resilience through the protection and diversification of livelihoods, and UN Women and the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) have expressed their interest in the exchange of experience and knowledge about the application of gender equality perspective and women&#xB4;s human rights in humanitarian action.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">Key stakeholders have started to implement IRM principles in their projects and practices. In 2017, PfR focused its work on empowerment of women in IRM approach through both civil society as governmental actors. Two new government allies PfR started to collaborate with, are SEPREM and SE-CONRED, this joint work was at policy level in which PfR supported with its knowledge on IRM and CARE&#xB4;s specific expertise on gender equality. CEPREDENAC also got interested in the gender equality approach within IRM, which was not only shared at national level but also regional. Women&#xB4;s civil society organization Asociaci&#xF3;n Madre Tierra was supported by PfR to incorporate the IRM approach in their internal organizational processes.  
For 2018, we see the possibility to replicate and scale up the products to national and even regional level, developed with SE-CONRED and Asociaci&#xF3;n Madre Tierra. We will focus on this and keep with capacity strengthening of women&#xB4;s CSOs.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">Key stakeholders are planning to implement IRM principles in their projects and practices. Also, being present in different parts of the country enabled to bring the work carried out at national level to territorial level. For example, in November 2018 Caritas replicated Resilience Days in Zacapa which had good attendance and people where happy with this dialogue space where different actors shared their work and good practices. CARE supported CONRED in the creation of the Territorial Platform on IRM in the western part of the country.</narrative>

Two signatory agencies of the Agenda have taken concrete measures to include IRM in their organisation during 2018 as a result of PfR advocacy efforts. The Ministry of the Environment (MARN) included a chapter on Disaster Risk Management in the draft National Action Plan on Climate Change (PANCC). And the Ministry of Civil Defence (CONRED) created a Territorial Platform on IRM to promote interagency activities in 5 provinces of western Guatemala, to which UNDP has already pledged support.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">Key stakeholders are aware of the importance of IRM mainstreaming in policies and legal frameworks. The focus in 2016 was on reaffirming support for the AEI  (Interinstitutional Strategic Agenda), following the change of government. PfR facilitated meetings of senior officials for this, as well as the participatory 2016 to 2018 operational work plan, in accordance with the institutional priorities of each AEI partner. In addition to this, CONRED asked PfR to participate in the CONRED law reform process in Guatemala, and to be part of the technical discussion team in order to integrate IRM into the new law. Apart from the signed agenda and work plan, important outputs of this trajectory are: On 13 October 2016, United Nations Radio published an interview with Ada Zambrano, Director of CARE Guatemala, presenting the Interinstitutional Strategic Agenda in Guatemala as a model for DRR; In October 2016, the AEI experience was disseminated in Latin American discussion forums in close coordination with CONAP</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">Key stakeholders demonstrate limited engagement in IRM mainstreaming in policies and legal frameworks. During 2017, PfR kept leading the Interinstitutional Strategic Agenda (ISA) and updated the working plan with the three institutional allies; MARN, CONRED and CONAP. PfR was actively engaged in the elaboration of the ToR, hiring process and development of the Methodological Guide for Vulnerability Reduction in collaboration with MARN, CONRED and INSIVUMEH. The active participation of PfR in these processes led to its recognition as a relevant actor within Disaster Risk Reduction and its work is being considered as an important contribution for compliance of the Sendai Framework.
We are on track and will focus the rest of 2018 on concluding the Methodological Guide for Vulnerability Reduction and handing over the leadership of the ISA to SEGEPLAN in order for this mechanism to become sustainable.</narrative>
