       <narrative xml:lang="EN">Key stakeholders are aware of benefits of IRM in their projects and practices. Activities have focused on drawing attention to the importance of women&#x2019;s empowerment in IRM, at the national and municipal level. PfR/CARE has been involved in the organization of the forum &#x2018;Women as Pillar of Sustainable Development&#x2019;, attended by municipal authorities and several women&#xB4;s organisations. PfR/CARE has also supported the organization of the &#x2018;First Knowledge Exchange on the Application of the Gender Equality and Women&apos;s Human Rights Perspective in Humanitarian Action&#x2019;, with UN Women. In addition, PfR has provided technical, organizational, logistical and financial support for the participation of representatives of women&apos;s organizations in relevant national fora. The Council of Indigenous Women has approached PfR/CARE to share their experience related to the increase of resilience through the protection and diversification of livelihoods, and UN Women and the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) have expressed their interest in the exchange of experience and knowledge about the application of gender equality perspective and women&#xB4;s human rights in humanitarian action.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">Key stakeholders are actively engaged in IRM mainstreaming in policies and legal frameworks. An important trickle-down effect could be recorded of the work that PfR1 started well over 5 years ago with the present installation of an IRM Round Table at departmental level led by CONRED in the Third region. Interinstitutional coordination for IRM is no longer only a government policy at national level but is now being implemented at local level where it should be. This is important evidence for CONRED when taking this philosophy to the regional level. Institutional coordination in Central America is a fragile issue, but PfR might reach far with this replication at local level.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">Key stakeholders are actively engaged in IRM mainstreaming in policies and legal frameworks. in close collaboration with two very important government institutions SEGEPLAN (Presidential Secretariat for Planning and Programming) and INSIVUMEH (National Institute for Seismology, Volcanology, Meteorology and Hydrology), two paramount publications saw the light in this phase II of PfR; the Methodological guide for the elaboration of the Municipal Development and Land Use Plans (2019) and the  Methodological Guides for Risk Management, Vulnerability Reduction and Improvement of Climate Change Capacity in Guatemala (2020) respectively. These guides have been duly approved by the Government of Guatemala and are currently being used on a nation-wide scale. Also, the team has succeeded in the insertion of these tools in CEPREDENAC&#x2019;s toolkit for the region.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">Key stakeholders are aware of the importance of IRM mainstreaming in policies and legal frameworks. The focus in 2016 was on reaffirming support for the AEI  (Interinstitutional Strategic Agenda), following the change of government. PfR facilitated meetings of senior officials for this, as well as the participatory 2016 to 2018 operational work plan, in accordance with the institutional priorities of each AEI partner. In addition to this, CONRED asked PfR to participate in the CONRED law reform process in Guatemala, and to be part of the technical discussion team in order to integrate IRM into the new law. Apart from the signed agenda and work plan, important outputs of this trajectory are: On 13 October 2016, United Nations Radio published an interview with Ada Zambrano, Director of CARE Guatemala, presenting the Interinstitutional Strategic Agenda in Guatemala as a model for DRR; In October 2016, the AEI experience was disseminated in Latin American discussion forums in close coordination with CONAP</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">Key stakeholders have started to implement IRM principles in their projects and practices. PFR is now positioned as one of three major resilience initiatives in the Caribbean (with CADRIM/Canadian RC Community Resilience Building project and IFRC/TNC Resilient Islands project) and IRM has been proposed and discussed as a harmonizing concept with these stakeholders: Red Cross National Societies of the Dominican Republic, Grenada, Jamaica, Suriname, Belize, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, IFRC (CADRIM, Americas regional office &amp; Caribbean Country Cluster Support Team), Canadian Red Cross and The Nature Conservancy. Evidence includes integrating PFR tools and materials into the Caribbean Regional Roadmap for Resilience resources menu, making IRM tools and methods visible and available to all Red Cross national societies and their partners in the region beyond the end of the PfR project. Contributing to the IFRC/CADRIM regional tools and methods and eVCA training workshops, provided a platform for Caribbean Red Cross disaster managers and their TNC partners to discuss the commonalities and understand differences in terminology and approaches; i.e. EBA (ecosystem-based approaches), NBS (nature-based solutions, landscape approach and ecosystem management and restoration. In addition, demand for the Y-adapt youth adaptation engagement curriculum is growing, knowledge-sharing between Guatemala and Haiti&#x2019;s Y-adapt programmes has been instructional the development of the global curriculum and strategy, while dialogue on potential for coordinating regional roll-out is advancing among the British territories and 1 government partner (Dominica).</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">Key stakeholders have started to implement IRM principles in their projects and practices. the PfR team has encountered interest from various new CSOs in Guatemala that have potential to reach out in their regional networks: TECHO, Guatemala Scout Association, and CENTRARSE among others. The expression of their interest, the concrete actions undertaken and changes undergone by these CSOs were recorded as outcomes here. PfR has assisted these CSOs with training and transfer of methodological tools to scale up at regional level. The outcomes are incipient at the level of Guatemala and thus regional outcomes are hard to encounter at this stage. It is expected that 2020 will show the first impact outside Guatemala</narrative>

At local level, the pilot work with community-based structures like COCODES and COMUDES as the team had initially envisaged, took off at a modest scale and did not meet the team&#x2019;s expectations as formulated in the ToC in 2016. This large field of work can be the single topic for a project proposal under PfR&#x2019;s third phase or similar initiative with the objective of community-based organisations and community people becoming more meaningfully involved in local planning.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">Key stakeholders have concrete (signed) plans for risk-informed investments. The Ministry of Planning (SEGEPLAN) is clearly adopting our Municipal Development and Land Use Planning (PDM-OT) tools and securing their own funds to use these tools in all municipalities in Guatemala. This makes them a perfect ambassador for PfR in the region through the SICA (Central American and Dominican Republic Integration System) structures, although no outcomes at regional level could be harvested this semester in this respect. PfR is well positioned with different SICA actors to accompany these ambassadors and enhance their impact: CSUCA, CECC, CEPREDENAC. Now that the local government structures in Guatemala are subject to self-financed SEGEPLAN training in IRM in municipal planning, it will become very important in a next phase of PfR, to focus on the community structures like the COMUDEs for them to become more meaningfully involved in local planning.</narrative>

The tool &#x2018;Equidad Casa Adentro&#x2019; (Gender equity starts at home) has proven to be a useful tool in this respect. Gender will receive more impetus, as a regional event on this theme has been scheduled for the first semester of 2020 with the help of the Guatemalan champions. PfR co-facilitation of the pilot eVCA training with IFRC and CADRIM added value in promoting and strengthening understanding of an integrated approach, with an emphasis on ensuring gender and inclusivity tools and methods are used and on linking ecosystem management and restoration to climate resilience, based on the expertise of each of the partners in the alliance. For example: Each of the partners has established certain strategic relationships, which has contributed to attracting and reaching a greater number of allies, beneficiaries, and knowledge management has reached different types of education, formal and non-formal, consolidating concrete actions at a higher level and with civil society volunteering</narrative>
