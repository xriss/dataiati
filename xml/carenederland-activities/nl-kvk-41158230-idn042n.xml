       <narrative xml:lang="EN">In agricultural sector, the project achieved 100% of HH target (160 HH) and 91% of individual target (585 out of the 640 targeted).

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">In fishery sector, the project achieved 100% of HH target (160 HH) and 107% of individual target (684 out of the 640 targeted). Based on the table above, the number of beneficiaries achieved through the distribution of fishing gear assistance to fishermen reached 684 individuals consisting of 350 or 51% men and 334 or 49% women, while the number of vulnerable groups was 175 or 26%.
The location of project intervention for fisheries sector was focused in the Donggala District because most of disaster-affected people are fishermen, who live along the coast of Donggala which was hit by the tsunami disaster in 2018. Base on assessment result, Dompet Dhuafa decided to implement the project in 6 selected villages namely Kavaya (15 HH), Lembasada (34HH), Tolongano (29 HH), Tosale (12 HH), Towale (52 HH), and Tana Mea (18 HH). 

The first distribution was carried out with the number of beneficiaries of 65 households for the types of assistance Packages 2 and 3 in the villages of Kavaya, Tolongano, and Lembasada 26-29 June 2020. One of the obstacles over time was that the vendor informed that it is not possible to procure a boat within the remaining project duration. Beneficiary households who had previously applied for boat assistance accepted the situation and agreed to divert to other assistance.
The second distribution was held on 23-26 July 2020 in 6 villages namely Kavaya, Lembasada Tolongano, Tanah Mea, Tosale, and Towale. Similar to the first distribution, the goods were delivered by the vendor to the house chosen by Dompet Dhuafa as a warehouse. Then, the team distributed the goods from the warehouse to the recipient&apos;s house

The series of activities have been carried out to increase the knowledge, skill and production capacity of 160 HH beneficiaries in fishery sector are as follows:
