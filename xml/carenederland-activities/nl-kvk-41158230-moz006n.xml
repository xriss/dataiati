       <narrative xml:lang="EN">During the 18th and 19th of October, CARE conducted PDM at the resettlement center in Massasse, Montepuez district, where 90 beneficiaries of the DRA project who received hygiene kits were interviewed. This activity involved 5 trained enumerators. Key findings include:
&#x2022;	100% of the respondents were satisfied with the quality of the distributed items from those (39% were satisfied and 61% very satisfied)
&#x2022;	99% of the respondents were satisfied with the quantity of the items while 1% said otherwise.
&#x2022;	100% of the respondents were satisfied with the registration process.
&#x2022;	88% of the responds did not how to do a complaint or suggestion.

Regarding the last finding (88% of the responds did not how to do a complaint or suggestion), CARE will strengthen messaging on how to access complaint and feedback mechanisms (such as the Linha Verde hotline and complaint boxes) prior to future distributions.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">In this reporting period, CARE, in coordination with the district governments of Chiure and Montepuez and WASH/Shelter partners, have identified the locations of where the kits will be distributed. This ensures no overlap or duplication of effort. CAR MEAL team is currently registration the beneficiaries, in line with the vulnerability criteria. The delivery of the survivial kits was scheduled for the end of September; however this has been delayed. Suppliers indicated this related to the delay in the arrival of raw materials for the manufacture of soap, as well as COVID-19-related transport delays in the ports. The kits are due to arrival to CARE&#x2019;s warehouse on November 8th; the NCE granted will allow sufficient time to complete the distribution and subsequent PDM.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">Under the reporting period, CARE conducted the following gender and protection activities:
&#x2022;	Awareness-raising on GBV and protection-risks has been ongoing. Specfiically, CARE has disseminated GBV messaging through face-to-face sessions, covering topics such as prevention of sexual harassment, exploitation and abuse, local reporting mechanisms, and how to take a survivor-centered approach to GBV.
&#x2022;	In order to support GBV case management, CARE has been working with caseworkers and community outreach activists that have been trained, particularly in the district of Chiure. Together with the Protection Cluster, CARE provided a 3-day training on GBV case management in the local context
&#x2022;	In order to facilitate psychosocial support to IDPs, CARE conducted 3-day training sessions for caseworkers and community outreach activists, in both Chiure and Montepuez. This training strengthened the capacity of the caseworkers on how to conduct psychological first aid and how to develop and promote positive coping mechanisms towards distress and traumatic consequences of the conflict; with special focus on how this specifically and disproportionately impacts women and girls.</narrative>
