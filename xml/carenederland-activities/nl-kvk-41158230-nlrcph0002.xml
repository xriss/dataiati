       <narrative xml:lang="EN">Key stakeholders are open to supporting IRM mainstreaming in policies and legal frameworks. PfR partners have engaged with a multitude of stakeholders to raise awareness for IRM, in order for them to address disaster risks (on basis of IRM principles) in their respective plans and activities. It has set up a Technical Working Group to this effect that has been instrumental, and in several communities concrete IRM actions have been taken. Simultaneously PfR works at the national level to develop planning guidelines. Main outcomes for 2016: Increased awareness re disaster risks and the benefits of IRM within DILG, Climate Change Commission, Office of Civil Defense, and Housing and Land-use Regulatory Board); Awareness of critical issues to be addressed in relation to Manila Bay reclamation efforts (Manatuti stakeholders); Practising of IRM in conflict-selected areas, notably implementation of resilient livelihoods (income generation) to support enrolment; Inclusion of IRM in de development of the Local Climate Change Action Plan (plans which are obliged for local governments in order to be eligible to apply for funding from the Peoples Survival Fund for adaptation activities)</narrative>

multi-stakeholder alliances, including use of IRM tools in updating their risk assessments as basis of their plans mostly kicked off IRM mainstreaming efforts at the local level, which eventually produced climate-sensitive, landscape-based Contingency Plans, Evacuation Plans, and DRRM Plans of select barangays. At the same time, consistent advocacy work at the national level facilitated NDRRMC and OCD&#x2019;s recognition of IRM approach&#x2019;s effectiveness. In addition to that, PfR played a key role in organizing and directing the discussions of the first National Disaster Resilience Summit, and mainstreaming IRM was explicitly identified as one of the ways forward in doing DRR in the Philippines as declared by USec. Ricardo Jalad, Executive Director of the NDRRMC. Finalization of the NDRRMP is on its way, which PfR has influenced to clearly state IRM as one of its frameworks. Key stakeholders of the MBSDMP and DET have made clear steps towards recognizing the importance of certain IRM principles and stakeholder engagement. The final year this needs to be taken a step further in ensuring that these principles are enshrined throughout the entire MBSDMP and its PAPs. All in all, it can be said that the majority, if not all, of the outcomes of Trajectory 2 are already or on its way to be accomplished.</narrative>

Moreover, the team has also focused on the engagement as independent expert of the Dutch Expert Team of the Manila Bay Sustainable Development Master Plan. There was a need to sharpen the pathways of change within this trajectory, as two different processes are applied - the mainstreaming of IRM in mandated plans at LGU and NGA level, while also working simultaneously on creating multi-stakeholder alliances and mainstreaming IRM within the strategic plans of these alliances (which ideally later on ink towards the mandated plans).</narrative>

In addition to that, PfR played a key role in organizing and directing the discussions of the first National Disaster Resilience Summit, and mainstreaming IRM was explicitly identified as one of the ways forward in doing DRR in the Philippines as declared by USec. Ricardo Jalad, Executive Director of the NDRRMC. Finalization of the NDRRMP is on its way, which PfR has influenced to clearly state IRM as one of its frameworks. Key stakeholders of the MBSDMP and DET have made clear steps towards recognizing the importance of certain IRM principles and stakeholder engagement. The final year this needs to be taken a step further in ensuring that these principles are enshrined throughout the entire MBSDMP and its PAPs. All in all, it can be said that the majority, if not all, of the outcomes of Trajectory 2 are already or on its way to be accomplished.</narrative>
