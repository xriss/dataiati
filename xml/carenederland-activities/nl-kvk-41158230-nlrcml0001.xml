       <narrative xml:lang="EN">Key stakeholders are actively engaged in IRM mainstreaming in policies and legal frameworks. Immediately following this, the regional IRM coalition of Mopti and Mopti Members of Parliament exchanged on their respective roles and responsibilities and identified the potential for collaboration with a view to formalization. Focal points have been selected and a roadmap has been established. This partnership is a breakthrough in the process of advocacy for the IRM as its formalization will allow the IRM coalition and its member users to have a reliable relay at the national level to guaranty their concerns are considered in public policies and decisions. Under the leadership of CARE, the technical team of the PFR initiated a preparatory workshop with the members of the newly established regional IRM coalition and initiated a regional forum with the Mopti Members of Parliament, chaired by the Governor of Mopti.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">Key stakeholders are actively engaged in IRM mainstreaming in policies and legal frameworks. The establishment of IRM coalitions has helped boost advocacy from local to national level. Positive results in the lives of these users materialized through a change of institutionalised changes such as an agreed Convention for Fisheries Management, resulting in respected breeding grounds and safeguarding of fishing as a means of subsistence and secured access to land for women and young people with a land transfer protocol, countersigned by mayors and sub-prefects. Crucial in the context of insecurity is the reduction of conflicts over the use of land and water through the establishment and signing of Land Commissions (COFO) and fishing councils at the district, commune and village level. Collection and dissemination of meteorological and hydrological data has started to improve resilience practices for communities in the Mopti region with a partnership protocol signed between the local IRM coalition of Bankass and the local manager of the agro-climatology station of Bankass. Contingency plans have been developed  from local to regional level and simulations take place. This all took place under the control and with support of local authorities, which strongly enhances sustainability. Mopti deputies appointed five IRM champions (2 women) who are fully supported to play their leadership role to strengthen resilience. We recognize as a positive factor the progressive awareness of state services, who, faced with a better organized and more pressing social demand from the coalitions, tend to take better account of these demands despite the resource constraints they face. For example, community vulnerabilities are taken into account in the case of floods. Continued attention and support is necessary though. &#x201C;True integration&#x201D;, especially of water management and Climate Smart Agriculture is not yet guaranteed. The integration of IRM elements in municipal development plans is yet to be translated into practice. A more in-depth review could be planned for the next cycle of these municipal plans.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">Key stakeholders have started to implement IRM principles in their projects and practices. In 2016, 1,000 women, organised in various savings groups in 20 villages of Konna, Borondougou, Dialloub&#xE9;, Youwarou, Deboye rural district in the Mopti region, have become more active and present in decision making committees around integrated risk management. Traditionally, only men would sit in such committees. Womens participation enabled discussion around inequalities at stake in land issues such as women&#x2019;s lack of secured access to good and fertile land and ensuring that the quotum of 10% of land management activities benefits women. Partners for Resilience facilitated these committee meetings and CARE in particular has supported women to organise themselves in savings groups.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">Key stakeholders have started to implement IRM principles in their projects and practices. In December, following the organisation of citizens into user groups and IRM cercle coalitions at municipality and district level in 2016 and 2017, the 45 delegates of the three IRM coalitions of the Bankass, Djenn&#xE9; and Mopti districtscercles have set up one regional coalition to strengthen their power and influence. It has been a strategic move to have coalitions of all relevant administrative levels that are operational in the planning process as part of decentralisation in Mali.This is strategic to make the organizational process for IRM consistent with the government pattern of decentralization. Now, only one entity must defend the interests of all cercles districts instead of each cercle defending its problems by targeting the same decision makers. In the meantime, the lower level IRM coalitions and unions, began to materialize changes of practices such as the access of women and young people to land (around 100 ha); examples of reduction of conflicts over the use of land and water, especially in Bankass where over 60 &#x201C;IRM champions&#x201D; were selected from different villages (although the much wanted evidence for these concrete results remains a challenge); authorities being more sensitive to issues of punctual natural resources management and disaster risk reduction as demonstrated in increasing uptake of IRM issues in local development plans and the collection and dissemination of meteorological and hydrological data for communities by the local Djenn&#xE9; coalition.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">Key stakeholders have started to implement IRM principles in their projects and practices. With the constitution in December 2018 of the umbrella Integrated Risk Management coalition in Mopti Region, a solid foundation has been laid of organized citizens, well connected to the grassroots level through their member coalitions at the lower levels: district, municipality . The coalitions of Kayes, Djenn&#xE9;, Bankas and Mopti districts (cercles) are legally recognized and operate independently. The coalitions are organized at all administrative levels that are relevant in the decentralization process, which enables mutual reinforcement of the lobby work of the coalitions at different levels.</narrative>
