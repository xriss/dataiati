       <narrative xml:lang="EN">There were two time that project has changed the design and plan based on the recommendation of beneficiary. First one, project intended to distribute the cash for livelihood recovery in two batches, 50% of the total amount for each batch. However, after the meeting with local people, they suggested that it should be one time distribution for beneficiaries have enough money to buy animal. Second one, project did not have plan for vaccination for animal, but people required that is necessary, therefore we have to adjusted budget plan to include vaccination for animal that beneficiaries bought after they received cash</narrative>
