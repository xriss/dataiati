CARE SS also provided the GBV Survivors with dignity kits that were received from UNFPA.

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">4656 children of 6-59 months were screened for malnutrition during using MUAC tape as per the SSJR standards for conducting quarterly mass screening. Children who were severely or moderately malnourished were referred for admission to OTP and TSFP program. 8568 PLWs were also screened for malnutrition. In addition to MUAc screening, there was also checking for bilateral pitting oedema. After every measurement, the MUAC tape was sanitized as per the new COVID-19 guidelines. The activity is  on track and the target will be reached on time. CARE SS is implementing the nutrition programme in line with the MOH National CMAM guideline with emphasis on community outreach, Outpatient Therapeutic Programme (OTP) and Targeted Supplementary Feeding Programme (TSFP), and referring the children who are severely malnourished (SAM) with medical complications to the stabilization centre (SC) under World Relief integrated in Koch County Hospital.</narrative>

The challenge faced during the reporting period was the inadequate PSS materials from the centres and the delay to timely procurement of the PSS materials as ordered. However, the WGFS benefitted from the Reconciliation, Stabilisation and Resilient Trust Fund (RSRTF) project though there was delay to timely delivery of project supplies, which are expected to be delivered by the end of April as the truck is on the way from Juba to Koch.</narrative>

The topics of discussion during these sessions included dispelling myths about violence against women, services available for GBV survivors, early and forced marriages&apos; consequences, domestic violence  and its consequences, the benefits of seeking timely help, the causes and contributing factors of violence against women and girls, understanding the consequence of violence on different people in the community, Identifying how norms are created and can change. Due to COVID-19 measures, the awareness raising was conducted in adherence to SOPs including provision of hand washing facilities and sanitizers.

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">The nutrition  activities such as the treatment and preventive  community outreach at the three  OTP/TSFP Nutrition centers are  normally  implemented to provide life saving service to the malnourished children and PLWs. CARE SS closely  implements the nutrition programme in collaboration with the CHD, WFP and Unicef and these partners provide the nutrition supplies and essential drugs such as amoxicillin.  The nutrition programme is being implemented in line with the MOH National COVID-19 CMAM guideline with focus to the three CMAM components namely; Community outreach, Outpatient Therapeutic Programme (OTP) and Targeted Supplementary Feeding Programme (TSFP), and referring the children who are severely malnourished (SAM) with medical complications to the stabilization center (SC) under World Relief integrated in Koch County Hospital. As part of coordination, CARE SS submits weekly and monthly reports to Unicef, WFP and the County Health Department and also participates in the coordination meetings and joint support supervision.  CARE SS also integrates Risk Communication and Community Engagement on COVID-19 prevention messages. The CHD, WFP and UNICEf has led to effective implementation of the nutrition programme. The only challenge was in Jahjah when the nutrition center was looted by the SSPDF during the conflict with the armed youth in the community.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">Through the PMCs, HDC registered 10800 individuals for the FSL inputs pending distribution of the seeds and tools which are expected to be delivered in Koch before the end of April 2021. The beneficiaries include the PWD, elderly, female-headed households, IDPs, returnees and the host community across the 3 Payams of Jaak ( Jahjah, Gaap, Petpe Bomas), Kuachlual (Koat Boma) and Gany (Bang Boma) Payam. The process began with feasibility studies for seed preference availability. 67 individuals participated during the feasibility studies. The feasibility studies highlighted the need for HDC to procure seeds outside Koch, due to flooding effects. The VSLA members are scaling up the IGA activities as most of them are now engage in petty businesses such as fish retailing, tea making, restaurant, making local brew, selling charcoal to improve the household basic needs such food, clothing and health. HDC will continue to monitor the VSLA activities to improve its quality.</narrative>
