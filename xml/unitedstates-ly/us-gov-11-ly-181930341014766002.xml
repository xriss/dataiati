    <narrative xml:lang="EN">In coordination with the UN and other partners, U.S. engagement in Libya remains focused on helping Libya&apos;s political transition produce a legitimate, accountable, and effective national government. A responsible and viable Libyan government is critical to regional security and stability, and to advancing U.S. objectives in the Maghreb, Sahel, and Mediterranean regions. The U.S. government will continue efforts to bolster a new Government of National Accord (GNA) and support implementation of the UN-brokered Libyan Political Agreement signed on December 17, 2015. Security challenges persist, as seen by the ongoing conflict in Benghazi and Sirte. Libya continues to need support from the United States and other international partners as it struggles to harness in-country expertise and build the capacity to strengthen its own institutional development and reconstruction, and as a nascent civil society works to secure funding for its activities and raise public awareness about democratic values and human rights. U.S. government support remains essential to strengthening Libya&apos;s democratic and governance institutions, and supporting regional security. This support will be critical as the Libyan Presidential Council and interim transition government work with the international community to implement the UN-brokered political agreement and seat the GNA. U.S. programs are designed, in coordination with the international community, to support Libyan government and civil society efforts to establish a democratic, representative political system; strengthen the capacity of critical Libyan institutions to deliver services; secure Libya&apos;s territory; and build an effective and civilian-led national security system. Programs will also help manage Libya&apos;s borders, promote private sector economic development and prosperity, counter terrorism and violent extremism, and advance democracy and human rights. State and USAID are positioning U.S. assistance to respond as quickly as the political conditions on the ground and operating environment will allow, and in a manner that maximizes flexibility. U.S. government personnel are currently located primarily in the Libya External Office in Tunis, Tunisia, with additional United States Agency for International Development (USAID) staff in Frankfurt, Germany. Programming continues either in third countries or on the ground through local implementer grantees and with the help of over 78 local staff located in eight partner offices around the country.</narrative>
