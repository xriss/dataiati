       <narrative xml:lang="EN">Grantees have indicated a significant improvement in the efforts and willingness of duty bearers to adopt and include a women&#x2019;s rights perspective in policy and budgetary decisions, proposals and reviews. Generally, as a result of the consistent advocacy of Women&#x2019;s Rights Organisations, new laws that will enhance women&#x2019;s participation in public and political spaces have been adopted, there has been an increase in key influencers advocacy to end gender-based violence and other forms of women&#x2019;s rights violations. According to grantee reports, an average of 228 key influencers have been engaged to advocate against VAW, sexual abuse and harassment, secure land rights for women, gender justice and women empowerment, amplifying women&#x2019;s voice and participation. There have been changes at the community level as well. Currently, the public is becoming increasingly aware and anonymously reports cases of abuse perpetrated against women. Some communities have established information centres with VAW desks to provide a safe space for reporting such cases and for the protection of victims. There have also been major engagements with over 300 national, local, public and private sector officials on issues related to women&#x2019;s rights and access to resources, property and inheritance rights, and rural financing. An average of 5000 women and girls, who previously could not speak out on issues relating to their rights have been empowered to campaign against gender-based violence and social injustice. Media houses were engaged as well to extend the reach of advocacy. Grantees report indicated that about 50 media houses, including radio, print media and television, were engaged to discuss topics relating to women&#x2019;s health and rights, including trafficking, violence against women, women&#x2019;s rights, and gender-based violence associated with widowhood rites. Social media also played a key role as some grantees employed it as a tool to circulate various messages aimed at raising awareness and promoting women&#x2019;s rights. Advocacy efforts by the Women&#x2019;s Coalition in Zimbabwe have led to the appointment of women to strategic key ministries such as the Ministry of Defense and War Veterans, the Ministry of Youth, Sports, Arts and Recreation, Ministry of Information, Publicity and Broadcasting Services, Ministry of Environment, Tourism and Hospitality Industry, Ministry of Public Service, Labour and Social Welfare. Two (2) Female ministers appointed for deputy ministerial in Ministry of Local Government, Public Works and National Housing and Ministry of Youth, Sport, Arts and Recreation. Recognition of Section 17 &amp; 56 of the constitution in cabinet appointments, and ensure that more women are represented in the Cabinet unlike in the past years. The cabinet has 7 females out of 20 Ministers compared to the composition of the November 2017 Cabinet where out of 22 Ministers, only 4 of them were women.</narrative>
