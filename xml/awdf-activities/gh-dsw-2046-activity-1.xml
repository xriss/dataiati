       <narrative xml:lang="EN">&quot;Generally, grantees have noted efforts by policy and decision makers to review policies, laws, and budget allocations to treat women as equal citizens and ensure their access to resources. Existing laws and policies are being analysed to identify gaps related to gender inclusion. There has been a 58% increase in key influencers of public opinion &#x2013; traditional leaders, parliamentarians, gender focal persons and champions within councils as well as activists within communities &#x2013; being engaged in advocacy activities to end violence against women and girls. Specifically, they are involved in lobbying, advocating for human rights generally, ensuring the implementation of gendered rights for all people, especially the marginalised in councils and communities. Additionally, communities are increasingly taking front-line positions in dialogues around pertinent issues aimed at addressing women&apos;s rights violations in their localities. They are working with church religious and traditional leaders, as well as celebrities to lobby for transformation and changes in attitudes and behaviour and to raise awareness on reducing gender based violence. The Rape Crisis Cape Town Trust in South Africa signed an MOU with the Deputy Minister of Justice setting out demands for a sexual offences court system to be established in Khayelitsha. He confirmed that the Khayelitsha Magistrates&#x2019; Court will be upgraded through a collaborative process early in 2018 starting off with an audit including a site inspection. The Minister expressed an awareness of the poor infrastructure of the court and the long time it takes for rape cases to be finalised.&quot;</narrative>
