   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Some of the development impacts are highlighted below:    Data Center Provision:     High quality hosting is a key element of IT infrastructure enabling the increased use of high technology among private corporations, individuals and government.  Through economies of scale, specialty knowledge and extensive staff training, BAC will allow their clients to enjoy cost savings and high quality service provisioning that they would not otherwise obtain if these services were operated in-house.        Increase in Capacity:     The Russian IT sector is currently under-served by data center capacity.    Further development is required to build capacity and encourage more sophisticated use of technology for both domestic corporations as well as small businesses.     SME development:    BACs regional expansion plans will provide the company with opportunities to work with SMEs in frontier Russian and CIS regions.  For the SME sector, data centers allows for young businesses to have access to professional grade technology platforms and reliable, consistent Internet connectivity without the burden of significant upfront capital expenditure on equipment and the ongoing high costs of recruiting specialist IT staff.      Regional Expansion:      BAC plans to open new offices and acquire mid-size IT companies in frontier regions that have inadequate IT services capacity.   The companys move to these regions would support existing clients that are expanding business to those regions, in turn, increasing economic activity.    Employment and skills training:    Over the next four years, BAC plans would create several hundred new engineering jobs.  Given the shortage of qualified engineers in Russia, most of the new hires are expected to be lower-skilled employees that would be trained.  BACs training programs and coupled with tailored mentoring are expected to turn those low-skill entrants into high-skill employees with the appropriate level of expertise for the companys offerings.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project involves a $22 million investment in B.A.C (BAC or the company) for expansion of its operations to regional cities in Russia and potentially elsewhere in the Commonwealth of Independent States region, the establishment of a number of new data centers, and incremental working capital.  Through the investment, the company will provide an increased array of IT&#xA0;services required by medium-sized and large clients, both in the private and public sectors.</narrative>
