   <narrative xml:lang="EN">NBD (NBD or the Bank) was established in 1992 under the initiative of the local government of Nijhny Novgorod, Russia.  Despite its small size, NBD became one of the leading banks active in the SME segment in the region.  NBD continues its focus on SMEs, entrepreneurs, individuals and aims to remain a leading regional, independent institution, providing services to smaller enterprises and limited non-lending specialized services to larger companies.  According to the Bank, in Nizhny Novgorod region NBD has about 20% market share in the SME sector and a 60%-70% share in the sub-segment of sole proprietorship companies, catering to the needs of about 5,000 SME clients through its 17 branches in the region.    The proposed investment in NBD comprises of:     - a credit line (up to $7 million) to support the continued demand for credit from SMEs; and   - a credit line (up to $8 million) to work with NBD to introduce energy efficiency (EE) loans to corporates in the Volga region.</narrative>
