   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Summary Of Project Information (SPI)       Project Name    Russian Federation: Bitech Silur              Region    Europe        Sector       Project No008902   Projected Board DateOctober 14, 1998   Company NameBitech-Silur JSC or &quot;Bitech&quot;   Technical Partner and/or Major Shareholders    	Bitech is wholly owned by Bitech Petroleum Corporation (BPC), a company listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange.     Project Cost Including proposed IFC investment    	Total Project cost is estimated at US$79 million. IFC&apos;&apos;s investment would consist of an A-Loan of US$25 million and an equity investment of up to US$5 million equivalent in BPC&apos;&apos;s capital.    Location of project and Description of site    	Bitechs operational base is in Pechora, in the Komi Republic of Russia. Pechora has a relatively well-developed oil infrastructure and a variety of small, as yet undeveloped, oil fields.             Description of Company and Purpose of Project    	Bitech is a Russian joint stock company, which was established in 1994. It has licenses pertaining to three main oil fields, namely South Kyrtayel, Lekker and Subor, with combined proven reserves of about 45 million barrels. Bitech started producing from South Kyrtayel in 1995 and posted its first net income in the third quarter of 1997.           The Project involves the full development of the South Kyrtayel and Lekker fields and includes drilling and gas re-injection facilities. It also includes an extended well test and seismic studies on Subor, which is adjacent to the Lekker field and is a non-producing heavy oil field. The Project is expected to result in a peak production of about 18,500 barrels per day and recovery of up to 45 million barrels of crude oil. Implementation is well underway and is expected to take three years.          IFC&apos;&apos;s main role is to complete the financing plan by providing long term funding, which is not readily available for relatively small and independent Russian companies. IFCs presence and financing will also help to mitigate the perceived political risk of investing in Russia for BPC, and encourage it to expand and strengthen its Russian operations as well as support its plans to establish joint ventures with other Russian and foreign oil companies.  In this way, IFC will be supporting private sector led hydrocarbons development in Russia. Finally, IFC will ensure that the project meets the World Bank environmental guidelines.    The project is expected to have a strong developmental impact by supporting Russias oil sector, which is a key sector for the country and which continues to suffer from severe under-investment. The lack of investment in Komi has created significant economic hardship in its oil producing communities. The project will generate additional tax revenues for the central and local governments, and benefit Russias balance of payments.  Bitechs control of field operations combined with its policy of employing only Russian staff, will help transfer western oil production technology to Russia. Finally, the project would have a positive demonstration impact for foreign oil companies, willing to invest in Russia, but wary of its very uncertain investment climate.     Environmental Category and Issues    	This is a category B project according to IFC&apos;&apos;s environmental review procedure. The full development of the South Kyrtayel and  first phase of  Lekker field will be accomplished using existing well pads, field roads and pipelines.  At the Subor field the project includes seismic and a test well.  The project includes the remediation of existing contamination at the two well pads at South Kyrtayel.  Produced gas currently being flared will be reinjected to support an enhanced oil recovery program.  The project includes an emergency response plan including an oil spill contingency plan.  The project responds to requests for humanitarian causes and is committed to helping its neighbouring communities.  While gulag labor has been used in the past at the request of the camp commander for useful work for prisoners, the sponsor has decided not to do so in the future.      At IFC&apos;&apos;s request, the sponsor will give a written undertaking to that effect and commit to referring to IFC for approval if it wishes to respond positively to any similar future request.     The project has all the required environmental permits granted on the basis of separate Environmental Impact Assessment Reports prepared in accordance with Komi Republic requirements.     The project fully complies with applicable World Bank safeguard policies and environmental, health and safety guidelines    The  is  from the Infoshop.       Date SPI sent to PIC     September 14, 1998      This Summary of Project Information is prepared and distributed to the public in advance of consideration of the proposed transaction by the Corporations Board of Directors.  It is provided for the purpose of enhancing the transparency of IFCs activities and should not be construed as presuming the outcome of IFC Board consideration.
