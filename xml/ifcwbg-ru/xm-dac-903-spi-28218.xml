   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Project is the first competitively and transparently procured airport concession in Russia and is expected to have a positive demonstrative effect for other planned PPP projects in Russia, which is of particular importance given the large infrastructure needs of the country.  

The Project will support the continued growth of the regional economy around St. Petersburg and improve a key infrastructure bottleneck. It is expected that Fraports role as lead operator will significantly improve the efficiency of airport operations as well as standards of service. The Project will also enhance the energy efficiency of the buildings at the airport.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Project is to expand, develop, operate and maintain Pulkovo airport in St. Petersburg (the City), Russian Federation. Pulkovo is the only civil airport in the City and the fourth largest airport in the Russian Federation, serving 6.8 million passengers in 2009. 

In order to modernize the airport and address capacity constraints, the City decided to tender a 30-year concession to operate the existing airport facilities, construct a new terminal, which significantly expands the current terminal facilities, and invest in new airside and landside infrastructure to achieve an airport capacity of 17 million passengers per annum (the Project). The Project is Phase I of a master plan for the development of Pulkovo airport with future phases to be developed and funded at a later stage in accordance with the concession agreement. 

The concession has been awarded to Northern Capital Gateway (the Project Company), based on a competitive and transparent procurement process, under the terms of a Public Private Partnership Agreement (PPPA) that was signed on October 30, 2009. The proposed IFC financing will be used for the construction of the new terminal and associated facilities as well as the refurbishment of existing infrastructure and buildings at the airport. It is expected that major construction works will commence in 2010 and be completed by the end of 2013.</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">Pulkovo airport is located approximately 16km south of the center of St Petersburg. The airport has been in existence since 1932 and borders to the north the outer limits of the city, with an industrial and commercial area to the north east and residential properties mixed with light industrial facilities to the northwest. The eastern side of the airport borders the Pulkovskoe Highway, which also provides the main entrance to the airport. To the south and west of the airport are residential areas and farmland. Much of the neighboring areas have been developed since the airport started operations. The site is located on a low lying plain bounded to the west by the Gulf of Finland.</narrative>
