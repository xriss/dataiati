   <narrative xml:lang="EN">- Supporting Growth of Renewable Energy:    Solar power is developing into a key renewable energy source and globally, the sector is witnessing growth rates in excess of 30% per annum.  Nitols Project will be producing polysilicon, the main material from which solar cells are manufactured.  Upon completion of the Project, Nitols polysilicon output would be equivalent to about 300MW of solar power per annum.  - Employment Preservation:    Nitol has about 5,100 employees and is a key source of employment for the immediate region.  The Project would support Nitols future growth by allowing the company to diversify away from commodity chemicals into polysilicon, a high growth sector.  As a result, the company expects to preserve the employment of its existing workforce and also create additional jobs (directly and indirectly) as it grows.  This would be a key development impact, promoting stability in a less developed region (Irkutsk GDP is 16% below national average).  - Environmental Correction:    Land adjacent to Nitols chlor-alkali facilities has legacy contamination issues from mercury sludge generated by the facilities prior to their privatization.  Although, this land is owned by the local authorities, Nitol has volunteered to conduct a base-line study to assess the degree of contamination and, subsequently, develop a remediation program to address the issue.    - Resource Diversification:    The project would be adding value to domestic non-hydrocarbon resources, thereby, helping diversify the countrys dependence on oil and gas revenues as well as generate export revenues.    - Enhancing Domestic Corporate Governance Standards:    Nitols intended listing on London Stock Exchange would be the first full listing for a Russian company (i.e. not a GDR or AIM listing) and includes Nitols commitment to conform to the UK Combined Code of Governance.  This would have a demonstration effect to other Russian companies, given their reputation for limited transparency.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The proposed transaction is a $75 million loan and equity investment in Nitol Solar Limited (Nitol or the company), to facilitate the construction of a 3,700 metric tonnes per annum polycrystalline silicon (PCS or polysilicon) manufacturing facility in Russia at a total cost of about $450 million.    Nitol is a vertically integrated chemical and silicon gas producer based in Russias Irkutsk region (south-eastern Siberia), with access to abundant rock salt and low cost energy.  The company is currently one of the largest Russian producers of chlorine based compounds, such as trichloroethylene, calcium hypochlorite, epichlorohydrin and polyvinylchloride (PVC) emulsion, as well as silicon gases.</narrative>
