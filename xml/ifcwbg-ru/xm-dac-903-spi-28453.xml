   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Borets International Limited and its subsidiaries (BIL, Borets or the Group) are the leading Russian producers of electrical submersible pumps (ESPs).  ESPs are an important part of the oil production process and are installed in oil wells that do not have sufficient reservoir pressure and need supplemental energy in raising oil out of the&#xA0;reservoir to the surface.   The Group has 11 manufacturing locations, 7 in Russia, and one each in Slovakia, China, the U.S. and Canada.  It has over 8,600 employees worldwide, including 8,000 in Russia. 

BIL approached IFC, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), Deutsche Investitions- und Entwicklungsgesellshaft (DEG) and various commercial lenders to finance its investment needs which include: (i) refinancing its outstanding long-term debt; (ii) funding working capital and capital expenditure requirements of the Groups south-south expansion (e.g. to Mexico, China, Indonesia, Nigeria, Angola and various other emerging countries); and (iii) modernization and working capital requirements of its operations in Russia (the Project).</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The expected development impacts from the transaction include:

Climate Change Mitigation:  The Project will help improve the Groups product offering through the planned roll out of more efficient submersible pumps, thereby contributing to significant energy savings and CO2 emission reductions.

Employment generation:  Borets is a major employer in the Russian regions.  In the last 18 months, Borets has transferred more than 2,000 jobs from Moscow to various regional manufacturing sites, with the objective of making these global centers of excellence in their respective product lines.  In many cases, the Groups factories and service centers are the largest employers in their respective cities or regions. The Group companies are operating in four of Russias frontier regions, where they employ about 1,600 people.

South-south investment:  The project will help Borets expand its manufacturing and services operations in other developing countries such as Mexico, China, Indonesia, Congo, Nigeria, Angola, Egypt, Ecuador, and Columbia

Support of small and medium businesses: Borets supports local businesses through the purchase of various contract services which total $33 million annually, of which close to 80% corresponds to transportation services that involve a large number of small businesses. 

Contribution to tax revenues: Borets annually pays about US$90 million in taxes to the government, of which about 75% is in the form of value-added taxes (VAT).</narrative>
