   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Summary Of Project Information (SPI)       Project Name    Russian Federation - AO Mosenergo      RegionEurope   Sector   Project No007673   Projected Board DateFebruary 3, 1998   Company NameAO Mosenergo   Technical Partner and/or Major Shareholders    	RAO UES (49%)is the majority shareholder of AO Mosenergo.  UES is a publicly traded joint stock company which owns and operates the Central Dispatch Unit for the Russian Federation power grid and all inter-regional powerlines.  Other shareholders include:  foreigners (29.6%), company employees (9.9%) and Russian investors (11.5%).    Project Cost Including Proposed IFC Investment    	Total Project Cost up to US$185.5 million.  IFCs proposed investment is a US$32 million A Loan for IFCs Account.    Location of Project and Description of Site    	The IFC financing will be in part for corporate expenditures to improve Mosenergos generation, transmission and distribution of electricity and heat to Moscow and the Moscow region.  Part of the financing will go toward completion of the Zagorsk pumped storage hydro power station which is located about 150 km east of Moscow, in the Sergiev Posad District of the Moscow Region, on the left bank of the Kunya River, a tributary of the Dubna River.    Description of Company and Purpose of Project   (include IFCs Role and Development Impact)    	AO Mosenergo is the largest company among the 72 vertically integrated utilities that generate, transmit and distribute heat and electricity in the Russian Federation.  Mosenergo services nearly 4 million customers, supporting a population, and its associated industry, of nearly 16 million in the City of Moscow and the surrounding Moscow region, an area of approximately 47,000 sq. km.    The proposed project is to provide general corporate financing which in part will support the completion of a strategic asset (the Zagorsk pumped storage hydro power station) of Mosenergo.  IFCs role in providing this financing is twofold.  This is the first international long-term debt financing to a Russian utility and can be expected to have a demonstration effect, not only for Mosenergo but also for other Russian utilities and large companies.  In addition, IFC has introduced a number of corporate governance measures to assist the company in improving areas such as billing and collection systems and other management and accounting information, environmental planning and monitoring, financial reporting, and insurance.      Environmental Category and Issues    	This is an environmental review category B project.  Environmental issues associated with the project include environmental impact of completing the partially operating Zagorsk pumped storage hydro power plant, and environmental audit of the overall corporate operation and programs to move existing facilities towards compliance with appropriate World Bank environmental policies and guideline, and Russian requirements.  An independent environmental consulting firm prepared an environmental audit and analysis. For its Zagorsk pumped storage hydro power station, Mosenergo has proposed a range of mitigation activities in collaboration with regulatory authorities.  These include slope stabilization measures, construction of a municipal wastewater treatment plant, prohibition of new industrial, agricultural and construction activities inside the water protection zone around the upper and lower reservoirs, and environmental monitoring schemes for terrestrial and aquatic monitoring and geotechnical monitoring.  All these mitigation and management activities will be included in a formal Environmental Action Plan (EAP).  Mosenergo has developed a Strategic Environmental Program to the year 2010 that identified pollution control measures to improve the companys environmental performance.  This program was approved by the Moscow City government.  By implementing the Program, the company plans to achieve full regulatory compliance by 2010 by reducing air pollutant emissions, waste water discharges, and noise levels at older power stations.        The  is  from the Public Information Center.
