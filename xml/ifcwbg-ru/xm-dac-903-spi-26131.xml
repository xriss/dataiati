   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Brunswick Rail Leasing (BRL or the company) is a Russian registered company formed in 2003 to provide railcars to customers in Russia and neighboring broad-gauge countries. BRL acquires railcars and leases them to large industrial and transport companies under long-term operating and financial lease contracts. BRLs total fleet is around 7,000 cars and its plan is to add approximately 5,000 railcars to its fleet over the next 12 months. The company intends to borrow up to $385 million from IFC and other lenders to finance its fleet expansion and refinance existing debt.     Once the new loan is drawn down, the company plans, subject to the outcome of a feasibility study to be undertaken in July-August, to transfer the assets (i.e. lease receivables and railcars) to a Special Purchase Vehicle (SPV), which would sell rated bonds into the market place. The proceeds from this securitization would be used to repay the companys debts.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The new financing facility would be the first securitization undertaken for a private Russian rail company. As one of Russias more experienced rail sector lenders and as an existing lender to the company, IFC is well positioned to add value to the transaction. Further, IFC will be playing a crucial role in broadening the pool of potential investors in securities issued by the SPV by providing a credit enhancement in the securitization. By supporting an innovative transaction, IFC will be improving the competitiveness of the sector, promoting transparency, and promoting best practices.    The development impact of the new loan facility and securitization will include:       - support of private sector investment in Russias rail sector,    - increase in the size and competitiveness of Russias fleet of rolling stock,    - creation of instruments for long-term saving and investment for investors such as pension funds and life insurance companies,    - increased transparency and disclosure by financial institutions required in capital markets transactions that will ultimately strengthen corporate governance in these entities, and   - promote the use of capital markets by Russian entities</narrative>
