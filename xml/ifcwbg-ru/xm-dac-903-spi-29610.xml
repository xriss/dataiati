  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Project will consist of a Senior Loan and equity investment to First United Bank, or Pervobank (the Bank),a the leading bank in Samara and the Samara oblast (the Volga region) in the total amount of up to $50 million. 

Pervobank was formed in 2006 as a result of a merger of two local banks  Nova Bank owned by NOVATEK and Samara Credit owned by Volgaburmash, the leading producer of drilling bits in Russia.  Following the merger of two effectively captive banks, a new strategy was developed, aimed at transforming Pervobank into an independent regional bank.  Currently, the Bank is ranked 72nd by capital and 81st by total assets in Russia.  In the Samara region, it is the largest bank by total assets and capital with the exception of Rusfinance, which is a consumer lending subsidiary of Societe Generale and is not exactly a regional bank.

The Bank targets SMEs, mid-size corporates, and retail clients.  Pervobanks current strategy concentrates primarily on increasing its SME lending (over 50% of the Banks loan portfolio as of end-2009 was represented by SME loans).  

The IFC loan would broaden the Banks long-term funding base and would be used for expansion of its financing of micro and small entrepreneurs in the regions. In addition, the proposed project will have an energy efficiency component, which will help the Bank introduce and develop this new strategically important loan product. As part of the project, IFC may also consider providing up to $20 million in equity to support the Banks strategy and assist in its expansion.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">i) Access to finance.  The IFC senior loan for on-lending to SMEs will improve access to long-term funding for small and mid-size companies in the regions.
ii) Fighting climate change.  The Energy Efficiency component of the IFC senior loan will contribute to mitigating climate change in one of Russia&apos;s most industrially developed regions.  Reduction in energy cost will increase the competitiveness of the Bank&apos;s clients.  It is expected that the Project will have significant impact through lowering annual energy costs, primary energy savings and reductions in GHG&apos;s emissions.</narrative>
