   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Project Impact Assessment: - Stakeholders impact - IFC anticipates the project will provide up to US$150 million in long-term financing for climate-smart and environmentally friendly projects such as renewable energy, green buildings, energy efficiency, and water conservation and waste water treatment projects. Expected impact includes: i) increase in accessibility of financing for green projects to China Bank&apos;s customers; ii) improvement of China Bank&apos;s employees&apos; skills related to climate change financing; and iii) provision of longer tenor funding and new instrument for China Bank to access capital markets. - Environmental and/or social impact - IFC anticipates the project will reduce CO2 emissions in the Philippines. The expected reduction on sub-borrowers&apos; emissions and technical data on reductions in CO2 emissions will be collected and quantified through IFC&apos;s CAFI tool. Market Impact Assessment: IFC anticipates that the project will have the following market impacts: 1) it opens the market for climate finance and ultimately attracts more financial institutions into this space (competitiveness); and 2) it supports China Bank&apos;s contribution to the country&apos;s objective of tackling climate change challenges (sustainability) by adopting environmental sustainability principles and developing a new asset class that promotes greater market sustainability.</narrative>
