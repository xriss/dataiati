   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Ambuklao and Binga hydroelectric power plants are being privatized as a package through an international tender process, as part of the privatization program under a comprehensive sector reform law, the Electric Power Industry Reform Act (EPIRA).  At privatization, expected to occur in June 2008, the plants will be owned by SN Aboitiz Power Benguet, Inc. (SNAPB), a joint-venture between SN Power Invest (SN Power) of Norway and Aboitiz Equity Venture (AEV) of the Philippines.  IFCs proposed investment, a loan, will be in parallel with additional financing from Nordic Investment Bank (NIB) and local banks and will support the privatization.  The proposed IFC investment will partly finance the privatization and rehabilitation of the 75 MW Ambuklao hydroelectric power plant and the 100 MW Binga hydroelectric power plant, currently owned by National Power Corporation (NPC).  The rehabilitation will re-commission the Ambuklao plant, which has been shut down due to silt problems, upgrade the Binga plant, and increase the combined capacity by 50 MW in total (30 MW for Ambuklao and 20 MW for Binga) from 175 MW to 225 MW.  They will operate as peaking plants, supplying power to the Luzon grid for about five hours daily.  There are no electric transmission system constraints with regard to the expected higher generation levels.  The project company, SNAPB, is expected to take over the hydropower facilities in June 2008, and will put in place new management procedures, address technical issues such as sedimentation and dam safety and implement the rehabilitation of both plants.  SNAPB will also enter into a separate agreement with the Government, for those facilities that will remain under public ownership, to cover the operation and maintenance of the dams and appurtenant structures, formulation of operations manuals, formation of an oversight committee, and maintaining the integrity of the water levels in the reservoirs.  Responsibility for the watershed management will remain with the Government.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project will be the fourth power generation privatization project with foreign participation.  It has a high development impact, as it is expected to:  - reinvigorate foreign investors interest in the countrys power privatization program after several years of inertia,  - continue to support power sector reform by restoring market confidence in the WESM mechanism and the institutional capacity of the Philippines power sector governance in general;  - provide proof of concept and demonstration effect of a successful privatization of a large scale merchant hydro power project to other East Asian countries who hesitate to embark in similar sector reforms;  - support the improvement in the operations and the potential capacity expansion of an environmentally friendly source of energy in the country; and - contribute to government efforts to address fiscal problems through prepayment of deferred payment facility.</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">Ambuklao and Binga are located on the Agno River in Benguet Province, in a relatively narrow, steep sided valley.  Ambuklao dam was built in 1956, and was decommissioned in 1999 as a result of accelerated silt accumulation around the water intake point.  As part of the rehabilitation, SNAPB will construct another intake point at a higher elevation.  The rehabilitation plan will also include installation of new electrical and mechanical equipment and a new tailrace discharge structure at a higher elevation to address silting.  The Ambuklao dam will also need some repair works in relation to erosion and damage to the embankment, repairs to gates, and general maintenance.  Rehabilitation is to take two years and is targeted for completion in July 2010.  Binga was built downstream of Ambuklao in 1960.  Binga will be upgraded with the construction of a new intake and the replacement of each generation unit per year during dry season when all units are not needed.  Plant rehabilitation will include construction of a new intake similar to Ambuklao as well as installation of new electrical and mechanical equipment.  The Binga dam will need some repair works in relation to damage to the embankment, a deficiency in spillway capacity, and other maintenance and repairs.  Completion of the refurbishment plan targeted for the first half of 2013.  As Ambuklao is upstream to Binga the Ambuklao reservoir supplements the reservoir for Binga as well allowing for the operation of the two power plants in cascade.  This will be important in the future, as sedimentation progress is expected to lead to a run of river situation at Binga by 2027.  SNAPB does not plan on desilting the reservoir and will instead operate the plant in a manner that will regularly remove silt from the areas immediately in front of the intake.</narrative>
