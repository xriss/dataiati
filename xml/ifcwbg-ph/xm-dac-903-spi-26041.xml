   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Magat Hydroelectric plant (Magat HEPP) is a 360MW power plant built at the foot of the Magat dam in the north of Luzon, the Philippines, which has been operational since 1983. The Magat HEPP has been undergoing a privatization process since December 2006 through an international tender process, as part of the privatization program of the Electric Power Industry Reform Act (EPIRA), a comprehensive sector reform law, under which the Power Sector Assets and Liabilities Management Corporation (PSALM) has been created to privatize substantially all of the assets of the National Power Corporation (NPC), the state-owned transmission and generation company. The Magat HEPP is among the countrys few peaking plants in the Luzon grid and is expected to be dispatched largely during peak hours, running primarily as a 100% merchant power plant and selling electricity through the bid-based wholesale electricity spot market (WESM).

The proposed IFC investment of a $105 million A Loan will partly finance the privatization of the Magat HEPP. The winning bid of $530 million was tendered by SN Aboitiz Power Incorporated. (SNAP), a 50:50 joint-venture between subsidiaries of Statkraft Norfund Power Invest AS (SN Power) of Norway and Aboitiz Equity Venture (AEV) of the Philippines. This would be the first and only privatization deal successfully concluded with significant foreign participation under EPIRA.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project is the first power privatization project with significant foreign participation and the first merchant power plant to be financed internationally in East Asia. It has a high development impact, as it is expected to: 

- reinvigorate foreign investors interest in the countrys power privatization program after several years of inertia, 
- continue to support power sector reform by restoring market confidence in the WESM mechanism and the institutional capacity of the Philippines in general; 
- provide proof of concept and demonstration effect of a successful privatization of a large scale merchant hydro power project to other East Asian countries who hesitate to embark in similar sector reforms; and 
- support the improvement in the operations and the potential capacity expansion of an environmental friendly source of energy in the country.</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Magat HEPP is a reservoir hydro power plant located on the island of Luzon at the border between Ramon (province of Isabela) and Alfonso Lista (province of Ifugao) approximately 350 km northeast of Manila in the Philippines.  Its reservoir covers 117 km2 and has the usable storage capacity of about 21 days of electricity generation.  It was built in 1983 and runs on four 90MW Francis hydro turbines.  Historical annual production ranged from 550 to 1,445 Gwh with an average of approximately 928 Gwh per annum. The project will be the first IFC investment in a reservoir hydro power plant.</narrative>
