Location of project and Description of site    	The hospital will be built on a 17,250 square meter vacant lot within Filinvest Corporate City, Alabang, Muntinlupa in southern Manila.  The hospital site is located strategically within a commercial area, adjacent to and easily accessible from the Southern Luzon expressway which is the main expressway linking the southern provinces of Luzon to Metro Manila.    Description of Company and Purpose of Project    	The purpose of the project is to construct and operate an international standard, greenfield 247-bed private tertiary hospital, including a doctors office building. The project is designed to become a world-class acute care hospital complex having state-of-the art facilities for inpatient and outpatient care, as well as a doctors office building housing specialist clinics and diagnostic facilities.    	In one of the first greenfied projects in the Philippines since the onset of the economic crisis in Southeast Asia, IFC proposes to provide long-term, limited recourse financing for construction of a world-class, tertiary care hospital.  The proposed hospital would employ about 400 doctors and is designed to provide quality health care services to meet the rapidly growing demand in the Philippines and the neighboring ASEAN countries.     Environmental Category and Issues    	This is a category B project according to IFC&apos;&apos;s environmental and social review procedure. The following potential environmental and occupational health and safety issues were analyzed: handling and disposal of medical and bio-hazardous waste, liquid waste and sewage disposal, power and water supply, hygiene and implementation of good hospital management practices, employee health and safety training, and fire protection.    Waste management practices at Asian Hospital will be of international standard and will follow those specified by the Philippines Department of Health.  Infectious, hazardous and other hospital waste will be segregated and incinerated or disposed of under license to controlled landfills.  Air emissions from the incinerator will meet World Bank Group guidelines. Wastewater will be pre-treated on site and then discharged to a centralized wastewater treatment plant.  Electrical power will be supplied from the local utility and standby diesel-fueled generators will operate in compliance with WBG requirements.    Asian Hospital has prepared an Initial Environmental Examination report as required by Philippine authorities and has been granted an Environmental Compliance Certificate for this project.
