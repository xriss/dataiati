   <narrative xml:lang="EN">- Economic Development: The successful implementation of the project will improve the secondary market for distressed assets in the countries of investment.   - Business Environment: As banks in the region increase the sale of their distressed assets to independent private investors, the transparency of those institutions&apos;&apos; balance sheets should improve as these assets would be priced according to market conditions.   - Financial Infrastructure: IFC&apos;&apos;s involvement in this project would allow Altus to positively impact the market place by building NPL servicing capacity in the financial markets. The project is expected to increase the ability of financial intermediaries in the country to offload their assets, particularly non-performing ones, improve liquidity and devote  resources to originating new transactions.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project entails a twofold investment:  IFC will provide a loan to a to-be formed Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV), which along with the equity investment of the two sponsors of Altus Capital Partners (Altus), will establish a platform for the acquisition and resolution of Distressed Assets (DAs) in the Philippines. The SPV will acquire DAs consisting of sub/non-performing portfolios of assets and sub/non-performing single assets, including real estate-related performing, sub/non-performing loans, securities, assets and similar instruments, and distressed assets derived from special situations.   IFC will invest equity in a to-be formed Altus Holding Company (HoldCo) that will be the vehicle that holds interests in local servicing companies, such as 100% in Altus Capital Partners (PH) and potentially other servicing companies in Asia.  The proposed project is part of IFCs Debt and Asset Recovery Program (DARP), a crisis response initiative approved by the Board in August 2009, which focuses on DAs, roll-over risk and restructurings.  DARPs strategy is to revitalize financial systems through investments in DAs and servicing companies / platforms.</narrative>
