   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Since November 2016, generous support from EKN has enabled Yamaan to extend its voucher scheme to Dhamar, to ensure that poor and marginalized women and girls in this governorate can access affordable, high quality contraceptive and safe motherhood services of their choice. The first phase (under Marie Stopes) was implemented between 1 January 2017 and 30 June 2018; 32,963 vouchers were distributed, including 16,787 family planning (FP) vouchers and 16,176 SMH vouchers. Of all vouchers distributed, 73% (n= 24,191) were utilized by the end of June 2018, including 50% (n=8,353) of all FP vouchers and 98% (n=15,838) of all SMH vouchers. The vouchers distributed has contributed in 7,828 assisted deliveries and 23,967 antenatal appointments. The 2nd phase, directly implemented by Yamaan (activity # 4000000913) was from 1 November 2017 to 30 June 2019. The programme distributed 33,600 vouchers to women: 18,000 safe motherhood (SMH) vouchers, and 15,600 family planning (FP) vouchers. Of the distributed vouchers, 14,826 unique beneficiaries used SMH vouchers (82% of distributed) and 6,152 unique beneficiaries use FP vouchers (39% of distributed). The vouchers distributed has contributed to 11,267 assisted deliveries and 12,583 unique antenatal appointments in addition to 7,005 long-acting and permanent family planning services. Yamaan proposed to continue this successful programme for an additional one year in 2019, to enable us to catalyze on these successes. The new phase will see the programme to expand to an additional district (Doran) bringing the total number of target districts to five.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In Yemen, the collapsing health system is struggling to cope under the pressure of the continuing emergency. More than half of all health facilities are closed due to damage, destruction, or lack of funds. The largest cholera epidemic in the world is currently spreading across Yemen, exacerbated by deteriorating hygiene and sanitation conditions and disruptions to the water supply. 84 percent of Yemen&#x2019;s estimated 2.9 million internally displaced persons have been displaced for over a year, resulting in additional needs due to depleted savings, lack of access to financial resources and the saturation of available housing capacity. Despite a decline since 1990, maternal mortality ratio (MMR) in Yemen remains among the highest in the region, at 385 deaths per 100,000 live births. The risk is significantly higher for marginalized and vulnerable groups: the MMR in rural areas is 69 percent higher than urban areas, and 80 percent of maternal deaths are among women and girls with less than primary education. The intervening two and a half years of conflict have worsened the situation considerably since these statistics were captured. Women and girls have fewer of the protective factors commonly available to men and boys to mitigate the impact of crisis and emergency: income, assets, access to health and education, social networks, political voice, legal protection and the realization of basic human rights. The incidence of gender-based violence also increases during conflict, with early/forced marriage becoming more common. These factors increase the likelihood of unintended pregnancy and the associated risk. Contraception and safe motherhood services are particularly important under these conditions to enable women to delay and space pregnancies and access vital medical assistance before, during and after childbirth. In 2013, only 45 percent of births were attended by skilled health staff and only 30 percent were in a health facility. 62 percent of women had a need for contraception but only 27 percent were using it. Given the deteriorating health facilities, lack of service providers and essential supplies, it is an even greater challenge for women to access services today. Many women and girls, particularly in rural areas, lack the funds to pay for transport and service costs associated with accessing the formal health system.</narrative>
