   <narrative xml:lang="EN">As Results: - 29 productions were made by these young people. These productions included marriages in schools, access to education for girls, and various forms of bullying in schools. - Some of the productions produced by CSOs, and even of local radios relayed on Facebook, have been widely used by young teenagers on their own platform. Thus, interconnections have been created between high schools and other project stakeholders, including CSOs and community radios. - These publications generated more than 4,200 interactions, with more than 1,000 users&apos; reactions.</narrative>
