   <narrative xml:lang="EN">A study on gender sensitivity in mainstream media content was conducted in Cote d&#x2019;Ivoire, with the collaboration of the Observatory of Press freedom, ethics and deontology (In French OLPED) of Cote d&#x2019;Ivoire. This monitoring was carried out by OLPED, under the supervision of the WOM Observatory. Thus, 10 media (3 mainstream Radio, 2 TV, and 5 print media) were selected for the analysis. The choice of these media was justified by their audience from the report on the audiometry, and by their ranking for the print media. It is in the basis of UNESCO&apos;s gender indicators that the analysis was conducted. The analysis period was from the 29th &#x2013; 4th July. The analysis covered both the volume of productions with headings including women and their editorial orientation, trying to answer the following questions: 1) in which categories do women appear? 2) What women are the media talking about? 3) Who has direct access to speech? 4) What is the volume of articles or reports about women? 5) From which angle are women presented, as victims or active?</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The analysis of the public television news showed that during these 5-days of observation, only 4.25% of the news and information topics covered were on women. For radios (public and private), 37.5% of the topics covered during the period were on women. With regards to the written press, the analysis showed that none of the publications has developed a specific subject on women, but they had nevertheless mentioned women in the various sections. The iconography of the print media also showed that women are visible in the various published illustrations, but at a very low proportion. These images of women are most often found in advertising sections. These results will be used by the observatory, to sensitize the actors and the media institutions on their social responsibilities in the production of ethical and gender-sensitive contents, and thus contribute to the creation and consolidation of a professional and responsible media environment, contributing to the promotion of women&apos;s rights.</narrative>
