   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Provision of life-saving health, psychosocial, GBV, nutrition services through static and mobile health teams for the people in hard to reach and underserved areas of Kunduz and Uruzgan provinces with focus on IDPs</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">HNTPO will provide life-saving Primary Health Care, Psychosocial, GBV, Nutrition and Protection services to conflict affected population mainly  IDPs and host population in high priority districts of Uruzgan and Kunduz provinces. The focus will be on most vulnerable population, mainly women and children, in 5 very hard to reach districts in Kunduz (Chahar Dara, Dashte Archi, Imam Sahib, Khanabad and Qalay-I-Zal) and five districts in Uruzgan including three high priority hard to reach (Terinkot, Shahid Hassass and Has Uruzgan) and two other priority districts (Dehrawod and Chora) identified by the ICCT. 

HNTPO is currently present in both Uruzgan and Kunduz provinces and in most of the high risk districts prioritized in this call. The organization is currently providing health, psychosocial and nutrition services to conflict affected population, IDPs and vulnerable specialized group such as nomads. Beside that our partner in Uruzgan will be AHDS, BPHS implementer, whom has presence in the province, and also in Kunduz, there is formal understanding on division of responsibilities with OHPM, the BPHS implementer. In both provinces, HealthNet TPO is presence for more than a decade and has developed a very strong community TRUST and thus the access will not be a challenge for implementation. 

The preparation phase will include a rapid assessment of target areas, mapping of the population, orientation and coordination with community and provincial authorities and identifying the service delivery points (SDPs). This will be achieved during the first month of the project, by provincial team and project manager and other staff from central office of HNTPO.

The project will be implemented through 9 mobile health teams in the targeted districts, except khanabad, where OHPM will have the mobile team. Each mobile team will comprise a team of professionals, including a medical doctor, a mid wife, two psychosocial counselors, a nutrition nurse and a team ( one male and one female) for community based intervention such as child friendly space, women health friendly space, nutrition screening and referral. The mobile teams will be located in the districts ideally and will function from there. But in some cases such as Chrdarah district which is only 8 kilometer from Kunduz center, the mobile team will travel from the provincial center. The team will be provide orientation and training on the functions they will perform. We will use our existing staff, whom has good performance and local experience, for our mobile team. 

The lessons learned during our current CHF and other projects in both provinces are used to design this proposal. 	The first lesson learned is Community Participation: It was learned that community participation for the smooth running of the project is very important. For this purpose the establishment of coordination committee within IDP community and host community will be one of the first steps. the second lesson learned was Coordination with other stakeholders: It is the ToR of psychosocial team to identify the basic needs of IDP and how to link with other actors. During the previous project, it was found that linkage the basic needs of IPDs with other stakeholders are important and it help the IDP for addressing their basic needs and having access to relevant actors. OCT (operational Coordinating Team) is a good example in Kundoz province which has regular monthly basis meeting and discuss the needs of IDP.                                                                                                                                This OCT model will be implemented in Uruzgan province for further coordination and access of IDPs for basic needs. 

The provincial team already exists but will be further strengthened as per need of the project. A very robust and practical data management, compilation and reporting system with an effective monitoring mechanism to be implemented at different levels.</narrative>
