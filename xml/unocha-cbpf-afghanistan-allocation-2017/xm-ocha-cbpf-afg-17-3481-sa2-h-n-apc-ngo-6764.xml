   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Provision of emergency trauma care to affected population (men and women, boys and girls) and  addressing their nutrition and protection needs in Zabul and Ghazni Provinces</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The proposed project will be solely implemented by ORCD as it is the BPHS implementing partner in both target provinces. The project has been designed based on a needs assessment conducted by a team comprised of male and female experts.

While addressing nutrition and protection needs, the project will also ensure access to equitable emergency trauma care to war victims in both provinces to 21,764 (including 3,085 men, 3,347 women) in the target provinces which has been based on the existing data source. This will be done through: 1) the provision of trauma care services by upgrading ShahJoy DH (hiring 1 Orthopedic Surgeon, 1 male and 1 female nurse and 4 support staff, construction of 8 rooms) and establishing 3 integrated FATPs in both provinces: (1 integrated FATP attached to a BHC in Daychopan of Zabul and two integrated FATPs attached to Waghaz and Wali Mohammad Shaheed CHCs in Ghazni Province). Apart from construction of 3 rooms for Waghaz CHC, the support to these health facilities will also involve supply of medical/non-medical equipment, staffing and medical and non-medical equipment and supplies to cover extra needs linked to conflicts 3) Capacity building of staff involved.

Why the proposed interventions are important and how they will be implemented? 
The insecurity of these the target districts have left their population in desperate need for emergency trauma care, nutrition and protection (addressing immediate needs of GBV survivors). 

Health:  
Shahjoy DH upgrading: Although WHO has recently provided enough equipment to this hospital, yet there is continuing need because it is located on the main war zone where skirmishes usually take place by AOGs. The burden due to war has constrained the ability of the target HFs in having sufficient medical and non-medical equipment and supplies. In addition, the existing infrastructure gaps in Waghaz and Shahjoy has seriously restricted quality service delivery. 

A total 25 staff (at least 10 of them female) will be trained on various topics. The training will involve triage, trauma care, and basic lifesaving interventions. In addition, infection prevention and waste management trainings will also constitute topics of the trainings. 

Nutrition: 
To promote awareness on nutrition , ORCD will deploy 8 community mobilizer, 4 male and 4 female each couple will be working in the coverage area of related health facility. In addition, aimed at easing access to services a mobile team will be functionalized. The community mobilizers will tackle demand side factors, they will focus on strengthening the community-based nutrition interventions i.e. referrals, and improving Infant Young Child Feeding (IYCF) practices. To improve supply side factors. ORCD will hire 4 additional nutrition nurses preferably females at HF level who will be involved in the treatment of acute malnutrition and screening and growth monitoring of all under five children. 

Protection/GBV 
To respond the protection needs, ORCD will mobilize 8 community mobilizers (4 male and 4 female)  to work with the community elders, policy department, etc. to enhance awareness about GBV in order to respond to, prevent and refer GBV survivors/victims. ORCD will upgrade the capacity of the target HFs in terms of hiring psychosocial counselors and nurses (1 per each HF) to enable them to provide psychosocial counseling support to GBV survivors, undertake clinical management and provide advanced and specialized services. 

Considering our experience in Ghazni, the construction work will start early in March in Zabul and will be completed before end of the project.</narrative>
