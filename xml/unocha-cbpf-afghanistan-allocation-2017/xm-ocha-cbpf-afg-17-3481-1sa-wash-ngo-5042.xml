  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">An assessment survey was conducted in Ghani Khel(Shinwari), Rodat and Khewa districts of Nangarhar province.  During the needs assessment 13 villages were reached by the assessment teams.  Out of a total of 3995 undocumented returnees and IDPs, 10% families were taken as sample size. The types of respondents selected were men, women and children of undocumented returnee and IDP families and consultation with community elders and host families. It is thus, the project will reach 27,965 individuals (11,480 undocumented returnees and 16,485 IDPs) in 13 villages (i.e. Markazi Khewa, Qala Tak, Shaga Kali,  Kashkoot, Salam Por Kali,  Saidabad, Sher gar, Anar Bagh, Katilai, Ghani Khill, Ghazi Amanullah, Shayeedano Meena and Kabul Camp)  living in spontaneous settlements and host communities in Nangrahar and ensure that beneficiaries have 1) Ensure timely access to a sufficient quantity of safe drinking water, use of adequate and gender sensitive sanitation, and appropriate means of hygiene practices by the affected population, 2) Ensure timely and adequate access to WASH services in situations. According to the survey using assessment survey form, 82% of respondents own latrines in their houses but did not use latrines due to lack of awareness on the importance of latrine. Understanding of hygiene practices is very poor, with only a quarter of respondent stating that hand-washing was important before eating, 19.3% said it was important after defecating, and a mere 1.3% said it was important after handling an infant&#x2019;s faeces.  Only 18% of the households use both soap and water to wash their hands, with 77.8% of them stating that soap was too expensive as a reason for not having any in the household. In regards to household water supply and practices, 100% of the respondents stated that they had to go out and collect household water.  Surface water for drinking was collected by 58.5% of the household and only 20.3% said they were able to collect drinking water from a protected water source, such as a hand pump.  A further 21.2% said they collected drinking water from an unprotected water source.  Forty-one percent of the surveyed households state that they consume less than 11 liters per person per day below the Sphere indicator of 15 liters per person per day.  There is a lack of understanding among st the communities regarding the importance of correct water treatment procedures.  wells with hand pump and motorized piped scheme which are not functional will be rehabilitated. Activities to promote good hygiene practices will be done to reduce health risks and to foster resilient bodies and minds. With community participation at the core, hygiene promotion activities will emphasize on prevention of diarrhea, hand washing, menstrual hygiene, infant and young child feeding (IYCF)), water treatment, food storage and waste disposal. Promotion activities will be accompanied by the distribution of hygiene Kits to undocumented returnees and IDPs. Prominently the project encompasses two major components i.e. hard and soft. Hard component mainly consists of rehabilitation of 30 water wells and one piped schemes, boring of 5 new wells with hand pumps, installation of water containers for drinking and washing in health centers and schools, for one-month water trucking and as per result of assessment report 18% beneficiaries have not access to latrines and bathing facilities, thus, new emergency latrines and bathing facilities will be constructed. while soft component consists of promotion of hygiene i.e. Participatory hygiene and sanitation transformation (PHAST) and Children hygiene and sanitation training (CHAST) approaches to make sure behavioral changes. to have an impact assessment of PHAST and CHAST we required time frame of at least 6 months as per set procedure&#x2019;s already been identified in other districts.</narrative>
