   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Increasing Resilience of affected East Aleppo communities through Labor Intensive Debris Management, Recycling and Reuse</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Following intense bombardments in November and December 2016, once besieged East Aleppo has seen a beginning of return of former residents, the renewal of some community infrastructure as well as the limited revival of economic activities and business. While the UN and stakeholders continue to provide life-saving emergency support, the opening of Aleppo provides an opportunity for a pilot sustainable intervention that can trigger the safe returns of former residents. 

UNDP will support three East Aleppo neighborhoods identified as pilots in the inter-sectoral planning workshop for Aleppo organized by MOLAE in March 2017. (Sayf Ad-Dauleh, Az-Ziebdiyah and Al Ansari Mashad) to increase access to their neighborhoods through labor-intensive and low environmental impact-debris recycling in the eastern part of Aleppo City and provide support towards further strengthening the targeted community. 

The project thus aims to:
1. Address immediate emergency needs (access to services, by contributing to the disposal of debris)
2. Contribute to the resumption of economic and social activities
3. Support target communities to regain their path towards resilience. 

The project will support the three neighborhoods to establish community committees or strengthen existing ones. In order to ensure women voice in the decision-making process, Up to 50% of committee members will be women. 

At community level, the project also focuses on supporting community initiatives, maximizing the benefits that may be derived from debris recycling, and thus making debris a source for job creation and raw material for the rebuilding process. The proposed program will also enable the selected participants to earn some income (from block production) and thus cover the basic needs of their families.

Furthermore, and in order to ensure complementarity between the debris removal project (which will be carried out by a parallel UNDP project in Aleppo, in the same neighborhoods) with the block production under this project (noting the severe need for blocks in the local economy, and the possibility of recycling the crushed debris), the project will support local communities to create a sustainable community-based institutional framework for the implementation of this project (and other community initiatives outside of this project) and to establish sustainable business productive units (production of blocks). 

This will be ensured by supporting the establishment of inclusive Community Committees that consist of, female, youth, IDPs, marginalized and vulnerable community members. Also, community groups will be strengthened by creating a sustainable revenue stream of which part can be reinvested in other community initiatives and this will contribute in creating peace dividend through livelihoods stabilization and development.

The project is implemented by UNDP, in partnership with RESCATE.

The project is built on 
1- 10 communities 10*30=300
2- From these we take 150 for block production
3- From these we maintain 150 as community mobilizers who will do the marketing and find new projects in the neighborhoods.
The direct beneficiaries are those who will benefit from the community members and the workers.</narrative>
