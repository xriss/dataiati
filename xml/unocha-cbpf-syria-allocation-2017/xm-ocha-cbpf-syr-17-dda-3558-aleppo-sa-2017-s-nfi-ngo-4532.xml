   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Syria is one of the largest protection crises of our times. Hundreds of thousands of civilians have been killed, and parties to the conflict continue to carry out violations of human rights, with women and children particularly vulnerable to exploitation - including breaches of international humanitarian law.
Since the beginning of the crisis in 2011, Syria has witnessed significant challenges in the humanitarian and security situation across the country, an intensification in the targeting of civilian infrastructure.
One of major cities affected by the crisis that demands urgent help in almost all sectors is Aleppo. By 14 January 2017, an estimated 1.8 million people in Aleppo city and eastern rural Aleppo have been cut off from their main source of water supply following a technical failure in Al Khafse water station. 
More than 121,350 people originally from east Aleppo city have been officially registered in different locations. Of those, 65,345 remained or re-registered in east Aleppo, 50,929 are registered as sheltering in west Aleppo, and 5,077 remain in the Jibreen collective shelter.
Many IDPs returning to their houses in east Aleppo discover their properties were looted. These families urgently need additional NFIs.
In east Aleppo, the neighborhoods of Hanano, Tariq Al-Bab and Al-Qaser for example, continue to host the largest numbers of returnees, with respectively 16,500, 14,194 and 10,260 people, just to name a few.
During the past year, the negative impact of the war has left Aleppo almost deprived of its basic resources. Attacks against schools, hospitals, water networks, electricity plants, places of worship, economic assets and other civilian infrastructure has left Aleppo in ruins and have contributed to the exacerbation of the humanitarian situation in the city, leaving its returnees in need of all kinds of support, in all sectors. 
These returnees are now living in poverty, unable to afford basic food needed for survival, in addition to the fact that food prices are driven upward by lack of access to supplies and transport costs. 
GOPA-DERD is one of the very few national NGOs, with longstanding contextual expertise currently engaged in relief and development efforts. GOPA-DERD is working closely with different UN agencies, through different cluster working groups, to coordinate its response and efforts and to maximize the effectiveness of its work.
GOPA-DERD has worked in HTR areas of Aleppo before, such as Nubol amp Zahraa, not to mention various other HTR areas providing shelter assistance by rehabilitating apartments, schools, hospitals and polyclinics. This aims to assist IDPs, affected as well as vulnerable returnees in hard-to-reach areas as mentioned above, to help alleviate the burden of the crisis on them and improve their humanitarian situation. Through shelter, the selection criteria of beneficiaries will give priority to returnees&#x2019; families who have lost everything, and most importantly, their homes.</narrative>
