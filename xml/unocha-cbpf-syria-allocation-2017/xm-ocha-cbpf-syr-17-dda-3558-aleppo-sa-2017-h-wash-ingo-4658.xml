   <narrative xml:lang="EN">With the end of the armed conflict in East Aleppo, the city was left under massive destruction. Reports show that most of health facilities have been completely destroyed or severely damaged in East Aleppo. This is leading to an interruption in basic health care services, disrupting routine treatment for people with pre-existing conditions. A main concern is the spread and control of communicable diseases. In overcrowded displacement areas, the risk of certain communicable diseases is much higher (e.g measles, meningitis, acute respiratory infections) as well as an increased risk of vector borne diseases (eg malaria, dengue). Lack of adequate water and sanitation can lead to an increase in water-borne diseases. The situation is likely to deteriorate further when summer season starts in April. There is also an increased risk of malnutrition due to limited access to appropriate food, health services and increased diarrhea cases. Surgical needs have been increased ranging from minor injuries and simple fractures to more serious injuries (multiple fractures, internal injuries) requiring surgery and other intensive treatment. Hospitals and surgical units have been stretched to full capacity. Logistics is another major challenge with ongoing problems in ensuring sufficient fuel and medical supplies are provided to the few remaining functioning health facilities. SIF team based on the Health Sector Recovery Plan for Health Services in East Aleppo has carried out initial assessments to two public health centers and one Poly Clinic in three of the most affected neighborhoods in East Aleppo namely Bustan Al Qaser, Az-Zebdiyeh and Fardousin in collaboration with local partners and health authorities. The assessments found a good number of residents and an increased number of returnees and IDP populations. The medical and primary health service are provided through mobile clinics which can provide a reasonable primary health care till the rehabilitation of the original centers is made. 

One of the main needs identified is reconstruction and rehabilitation of three assessed public health facilities in order to provide necessary medical care to the most affected people in East Aleppo.  

The project aims at provide functioning health centers in east Aleppo for residents, IDPs and returnees. To achieve this goal, SIF is planning to: rehabilitate three public health centers in Az-zebdiyeh, Bustan Al Qaser and Fardous neighborhoods in east Aleppo. The planned rehabilitation activities will consist of providing the damaged centers with doors, windows, repairing or reconstructing internal and external walls, internal electrical networks, electrical wiring and maintenance, repairing holes in walls and slabs, repairing damages of stairs and courtyards, all needed works for  water supply and sewage networks, sanitation facilities (sink, taps, toilets....etc.) in addition to constructing of new toilet blocks at the courtyard for patients due to the lack of WASH facilities taking into consideration patients with special needs. Provision and installation of Water Tanks if found necessary depending on the outcome of the detailed technical assessment to the clinics in order to increase the water storage capacity of the clinics. This will be with coordination with the key partners in neighborhoods who are dedicating all efforts to find solution for the shortage of water. In each health center at the end of the project, we will provide an awareness campaign to promote hygiene in public healthcare settings in order to help minimize the spread of influenza, diarrhea prevention and avoiding respiratory infections. The project will also address the shortage of electrical power in east Aleppo due to destruction in the infrastructures through the installation of thermal solar panels which will enforce their access to electricity and hot water.</narrative>
