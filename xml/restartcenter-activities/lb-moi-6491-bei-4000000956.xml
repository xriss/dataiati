National Strategies: In line with its five years&#x2019; strategic plan in lobbying for the full implementation of the UN-CAT and OPCAT in Lebanon, Restart Centreendeavours to initiate complementary actions that build on the national efforts made in the direction of preventing torture and ill-treatment in Lebanon. Specifically, this Action goes hand in hand with the current attempts headed for the designation of the Lebanese NPM and the criminalization of the act of torture. Furthermore, the proposed action seeks to complete the progressive legal reform done with regard to improving access of persons deprived of their liberty to legal justice and fair trial in Lebanon. Furthermore, the proposed action responds to the international call of the Subcommittee for the Prevention of Torture(SPT)and the Committee against Torture (CAT) in what relates to establishing an information system on the status of pending cases in all prisons in the country as well as ensuring the sustainability and effective implementation of the &#x201C;Forensic examination Unit&#x201D; inside the judicial palace in Tripoli respectively.

The methodology will take the form of a handbook and will comprise chapters on legal framework, roles and responsibilities, key ethical and legal principles of the Unit, referral pathway, physical safety; privacy and confidentiality, preparation for examination and interview, medical examination and Psychological interview, documentation, communication, referral, evaluation tools, indicators, etc. This handbook will be developed by national and international experts (20 working days).
