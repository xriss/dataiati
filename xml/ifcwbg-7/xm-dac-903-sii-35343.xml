   <narrative xml:lang="EN">-	Access to finance for SMEs: The Fund is expected to provide much needed equity and quasi-equity financing to at least 25 SMEs in Central Africa to support their growth and expansion.  -	Job Creation: The Fund is expected to generate employment in low-income communities (as confirmed by pipeline investments in the health, education and agriculture sectors) and help support over 8,000 direct jobs from its investee companies and investments ranging from $250,000 to $5 million. Job creation impact is being demonstrated by CASF, which has generated 450 new jobs over a 4-year period from its 26 investments ranging from $100,000 to $500,000. -	Private Sector Development: The Fund is expected to promote sustainable growth in companies that have very little or no access to other sources of capital. Further, there will be significant value add to the portfolio companies through capacity building, improved ESG, as well as operational and financial expertise through a technical assistance facility that ARF is raising for investee and prospective SME companies. -	Poverty Alleviation: All target countries with the exception of Uganda, are fragile and low-income countries. IFC&apos;s investment will have impact in supporting business growth and generating job income. -	Expansion of Financial Markets in Central Africa: the Fund&apos;s successful investments and exits are expected to help develop a new asset class and provide much needed long term capital financing for high-growth SMEs in these markets.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project entails an IFC equity investment of up to US$10.0 million, not to exceed 20% of total commitments, in the African Rivers Fund (ARF or the Fund), a 10 year closed-end fund seeking to raise US$50.0 million.   The key objective of ARF is to construct a portfolio of small business investments diversified across low-income countries in Central and Eastern Africa, which collectively capture the underserved SME and FCS investment segment in those two regions. The Fund will seek to provide (i) risk capital and (ii) management guidance to small businesses in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Republic of Congo, Central African Republic, Burundi and Uganda.   ARF will continue the business model established by the Central African SME Fund, which has had a business model that has achieved proof of concept, demonstrated by (i) establishment of a functional effective team; (ii) sourcing of a healthy pipeline of investments; (iii) execution and value addition; and (iv) the Fund Manager making four cash distributions to investors to date. CASF has managed to achieve this even with the significant setback brought on by the political disorder in CAR, and the Fund Manager has proven the ability to ring-fence investments and safeguard capital in such environment, a critical ability for a FCS investor.</narrative>
