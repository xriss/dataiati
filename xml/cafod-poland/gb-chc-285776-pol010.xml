  <description>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In July 2021 the number of migrants attempting to cross the Eastern EU border via the Eastern Borders Route (via Latvia, Lithuania and Poland) increased from about 100 to 3000 a month. The increase prompted the Lithuanian authorities to introduce a state of emergency and strengthen the country&#x2019;s border with Belarus. In August 2021 the increased number of illegal crossings from the Belarusian side was recorded also on the Poland-Belarus border, which resulted in sealing the border, concentration of large numbers of border guards, police, military and para-military forces and introduction of the state of emergency in 183 (115+68) border towns in Podlaskie and Lubelskie voivodships. As the consequence of sealing the border, the number of migrants gathered on the Belarussian side dramatically increased reaching at the beginning of November 2021 about 4000 people.  According to the Border Guard, since the beginning of the year approx. 33 000 attempts to cross the Poland-Belarus border in an irregular manner have been recorded. The statistics of the Border Guard for the period January - September 2021 in the category detained/disclosed third-country nationals indicate 1671 migrants.

Caritas Poland has reacted directly to the humanitarian crisis on the border by implementing the &quot;Tents of Hope&quot;. The aid project aimed to create a dense network of stocked points/warehouses in the border areas that were accessible to anyone providing direct help to people in need. The equipment of such points responds to the material needs of direct rescue intervention. The tents are stocked with thermal comfort items, food, clothing. Caritas Poland&apos;s task was also to activate border parishes so that the locals involved in helping migrants were properly prepared and equipped. Another direct activity was supplying Border Guard officers and border parishes with &#x201C;help packs&#x201D; (a set of items most needed in case of meeting people in the state of discomfort (dry food, NRC foil, water).</narrative>
