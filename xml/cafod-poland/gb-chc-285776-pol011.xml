   <narrative xml:lang="EN">he war in Ukraine, which began on February 24, 2022, has had dire consequences, with hundreds of civilians confirmed killed and thousands injured. Millions of people have left Ukraine to neighbouring countries as refugees and 6.5 million people have been displaced internally. The United Nations estimates that in Ukraine, 12 million people are in need of humanitarian assistance. Millions are estimated to be stranded in affected areas, unable to leave due to security risks, destroyed bridges and roads, and/or a lack of information on where to find safety and accommodation. As millions of others remain on the move, most are forced to shelter in crowded spaces with limited access to sanitation facilities and healthcare.

Pharmacists across the continent of Europe have responded to the increasing calls for specialist help from Ukrainian hospitals by launching a campaign. Led by their national pharmacists&#x2019; organisations, pharmacists are using their expertise around medicines to organize the sourcing, logistics and the safe delivery of specialist medicines to where it is most needed by Ukrainian casualties.
Project objective
The campaign has the following objectives:
1. To collect funds for humanitarian organizations relevant to the humanitarian crisis in Ukraine.
2. Mobilising various pharmacist union organsiations in countries that are members of a European umbrella pharmacy union called EPhEU. 
3. Centralize the final place of transferring the funds so that financial transactions are carried out optimally &#x2013; preferably by one charity organization.
4. The systemised collection of orders from managers and clinical directors of hospitals in Ukraine.
5. From the collected funds, to the greatest extent possible, fulfil the demand by purchasing medicinal products and medical devices using a professional and quality chain approach channel.
6. The acquisition for Ukraine will be coordinated by the Officer - Project Manager (PM), who has the knowledge, experience and capacity to carry out this objective.
7. Making wholesale (central) purchases &#x2013; then it is possible to achieve the best results in terms of availability and commercial conditions.
8. Transfering the medicines using a quality logistical chain to the intended destination with the support of the Polish and Ukranian authorities where necessary; ensuring that the medicines are suitable for human consumption.</narrative>
