   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Sheltering an immense and dangerous desert area conducive to all kinds of trafficking (drugs, arms, illegal migrants, goods of all kinds), Niger faces permanent threats from several terrorist organisations established around its borders (Boko Haram, Aqmi, MUJWA, Mokhtar Belmokhtar&apos;s group, etc.).
These non-state armed groups operating in the sub-region are currently attacking not only the military, but also the civilian population.
The humanitarian crisis that has been affecting the country for several years is worsening due to the security crisis which is exacerbated by the political instability of neighbouring countries.

The context in Niger is becoming increasingly worrying with growing insecurity in almost all regions. The insecurity situation inside the country and in neighbouring countries is leading to an influx of thousands of refugees, returnees, migrants and internally displaced persons (IDPs) who need access to basic social services to survive.

 This situation poses a great challenge for humanitarians who are targeted by terrorists in some areas and makes access to some areas of operation difficult or impossible. In this context of generalised insecurity in the sub-region in general and in Niger in particular, CADEV Niger&apos;s agents implement projects and programmes to alleviate the suffering of populations affected by natural and/or man-made hazards. It is therefore urgent to equip these actors, who are the field agents, with skills that will enable them to manage these security situations. 

This project, co-funded by Caritas sister agencies, will provide a training opportunity on security management for 80 people (including 40 diocesan staff, 10 national staff and 30 volunteers) from CADEV Niger.</narrative>
