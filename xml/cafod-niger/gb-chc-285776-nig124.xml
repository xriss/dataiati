  <description>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Niger, through its 2020 Finance Law, which is reinforced by the 2021 Finance Law, has undergone important tax reforms to enable the government to improve the mobilization of tax resources, notably through the control of VAT (Value Added Tax) invoicing by using new information technology. 
The Finance Law introduced, for example, the obligation for any taxable company/organization that delivers goods or provides services for the needs of a third party who is also a taxable person or an ordinary consumer, to issue a certified invoice to the latter.

In order to support partners in understanding and complying with these new tax reforms instituted by the government, CAFOD supports this learning process through training on the new finance law.
 This training will enable the finance and administration officers of partner organizations to acquire the necessary knowledge and tools to update themselves on the new tax reforms and to prevent any prejudice arising from the non-application of new government measures.
The objectives of this training are:
- The mastery of tax dispositions (taxes and duties) in force in Niger in relation with the sector of activity
- The mastery of the fields of application, the bases, the mode of liquidation and recovery
- The knowledge and mastery of the application of the tools that the DGI (General Directorate of Taxes) puts at the disposal of taxpayers
- The presentation of a synoptic table of taxes and duties of the nomenclature of documents and evidentiary documents in tax matters
- Capacity building of the participant on the process and documentation of tax exemption
- Provision of an updated document on tax regulations in Niger</narrative>
