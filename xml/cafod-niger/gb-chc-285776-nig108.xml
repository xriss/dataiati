   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Women economic empowerment in peri-urban regions of Niger</narrative>
  </title>
  <description>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In Niger, a developing country, women represent more than 52% of the population, the population growth rate is 3.1%, which makes an average of 7 children per woman; while economic growth is 2.5%. 
The difficult economic situation of the country means that most women find themselves without income. Socially enforced biases limit the ability of millions of Nigerien women to get the acceptable level of educational or vocational training that will improve their employability or income generation. 
Despite the efforts made in recent years, girls from poor families are the hardest hit, leading to a &#x2018;feminization of poverty&#x2019; in Nigerien society. 
This phenomenon is on the rise in urban and peri-urban contexts where social safety nets are broken or altered. The community of Zermagandey near Niamey, is made of a population of about 65,000 inhabitants of which 32,662 are women, from Zerma, Haoussa, Peul, Gourmantch&#xE9; and a large community of foreign refugees and immigrants. 
More than 60% of these women are under 25 years of age; more than 80% of them have dropped out of schools. Due to economic and lack of livelihoods, these women and girls are at increased risk of exploitation and abuse, including sexual exploitation and Sexually Transmitted diseases. (http://www.thenewhumanitarian.org/fr/report/42741/niger-la-crise-alimentaire-pousse-les-jeunes-filles-&#xE0;-se-prostituer ). The condition of women in peri-urban communities is aggravated by limited availability of land for agricultural activities (due to rapid urbanization).
This project aims to support 80 women looking for a way out of this poverty/abuse cycle, by providing vocational training in dressmaking / tailoring and equipping them with sewing machines and sewing supplies to commence an income generating activity.
The project will also provide psycho-social support to the women to help them regain their dignity and self-confidence.</narrative>
