  <description>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Diocese of Maradi covers 5 regions: Maradi, Tahoua, Agadez, Zinder and Diffa with a total population of 8 023 299 people.
It is divided into 4 sectors:
- East sector  covering Maradi, Zinder and Diffa parishes 
- West Sector covering Tahoua, Birnin Konni parishes
- North sector covering Agadez, Tchirozerine and Arlit parishes.
Niger has been seen for many years as an example of peaceful coexistence among religious groups.   In 2015, as a result of caricature of Prophet Mohamed (PUH) by Charlie Hebdo magazine in France, Muslims from many countries organised demonstrations against Charlie Hebdo magazine.  In Niger this happened in many regions. 
Zinder region was one of the region that has been affected and the demonstration took place on 12 January 2015 and was characterised by the destruction of many churches, catholic missionary school, French cultural center and leisure places. This caused 45 cases of sustained injuries,   4 deaths and many lost in term of valued materials.  Up till now, the effects of the riot is felt while visiting the Catholic Church were many devices are still in destructed conditions.
This project was developed to support rehabilitation of building within  the Catholic Church in Zinder. In addition to that materials such musical instruments and loud speakers, chairs and a generator will be purchased to replace those that have been destroyed</narrative>
