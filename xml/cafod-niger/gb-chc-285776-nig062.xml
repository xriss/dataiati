   <narrative xml:lang="EN">For many years, Misereor has been funding CADEV Niger running costs. In 2011, they decided to reduce their funding and to have other CI/CIDSE members working with CADEV also contribute. This debate was also held in 2011 and 2013 in Paris where a formal agreement was not reached except to agree that each organisation could allow as much as 7% of Admin costs for CADEV Niger. CAFOD&#x2019;s preference is to support running costs through projects. The three year budget submitted by CADEV is of &#x20AC;432493. The breakdown per year is Y1 (&#x20AC;143,472); Y2 (&#x20AC;139,510), Y3 (&#x20AC;149,511). Misereor is happy to make a contribution of 64% while CADEV need to find the 36% from other sister agencies. 
In 2012 CAFOD received a special request from the Archbishop to support a funding gap for their running costs and for solidarity reasons we supported this from an appeal fund (see NIG037). It was made clear that the support was exceptional and it would not be provided except through projects.  In October 2015 CAFOD received a request from the Archbishop of Niger to provide support to CADEV running cost to help cover the funding gap. Despite the fact that this does not really fall within CAFOD&#x2019;s strategy , the need for funding CADEV Niger running costs was recognised. As a national Caritas, they play a very crucial coordination role. The current running costs will be funded by Misereor, CRS, CAFOD, Secours Catholique and Caritas Belgium. Due to budget constraint CAFOD will make a solidarity contribution of &#xA3;10,000.</narrative>
