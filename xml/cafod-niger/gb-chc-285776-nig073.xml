   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Global acute malnutrition remains rampant in Niger especially during the lean period when the number of the affected children, pregnant and lactating mother rise. In 2015 the rate of global acute malnutrition was o 15% which is equivalent to WHO&#x2019;s emergency threshold. The Tillab&#xE9;ry region (where Tera Health District is situated) is not an exception with 13.1% of GAM and 2.5% of SAM in 2015.  The 2016 nutritional  has shown signifiquant improvement in regard to the previous year as follow: In rural area, the rate of global acute malnutrition is 9.4%, the rate of acute severe malnutrition 1.6%  and the rate of acute moderate malnutrition is of 7.8%. The nutrition status of children in Niger is closely linked to the level of food access and availability in the country. For those living in rural areas such as those targeted by this project this is usually is challenge especially when the harvest is not sufficient enough to cover the needs of the families. Also coupled to the lack of food is poor hygiene and poor feeding practices.  Despite the positive changes the District of Tera is facing insecurity problems witch make some part of the area to be under state of emergency. The will make the situation more worse with significant impact on the health and nutrition status of the community menbers especialy under five children and pregnant and lactating women.  This is the reason why CADEV has submitted this project to CAFOD to help reduce the rate of malnutrition in the health areas of Kokoru  and Bankilare.  It is important to notify that the previous project was implemented in Diagorou, Taka, Bouppo, Bangare, Gabitane, Tillim, Tegueye, Wanzerbe, Yatakala, Bellekoira, Wezabangou. these are more affected by the state emergency this make the accessibility more difficult and risky. CADEV Niger requested the fund to implement the project in Bankilare et Kokorou. Activities will be centres towards:  awareness raising sessions, promoting essentials  family practices , culinary demonstrations, and early detection of malnutrition through screening, supporting health centres with drugs and hygiene kits and food stuff for accompanier of malnourish children hospitalised in Tera Hospital. In all CADEV will reach out to 16351 children, 8502 pregnant and lactating mothers, 10 health workers and 192 community volunteers people. 
CAFOD has been providing support to fight malnutrition and save the lives of many children and women.</narrative>
