   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Caritas Niger is a Catholic Church organisation and member of the Caritas Internationalis network that contributes to human development efforts to improve the living conditions of the poorest people. CADEV is a privileged partner of CAFOD in Niger and has benefited from CAFOD&apos;s extensive support in terms of organisational and human capacity building in accordance with CAFOD Niger&apos;s country strategic plan and our organisation&apos;s global policy.
During the year 2021, CADEV undertook an organisational diagnosis as well as the evaluation of its strategic plan process which received the support of CAFOD. The management of the organisation also underwent a profound change with the replacement of the National Executive Secretary and the management of the Niamey Diocesan office.  
The new management of the Niamey office, following its assumption of office and an analysis of the mode of operation, plans to increase the involvement of church volunteers in the implementation of services to the most needy as recommended by the CADEV texts.
The involvement of volunteers according to the new vision will allow for a better understanding of the needs of the communities. The volunteers are organised in solidarity committees and are drawn from the communities.
In order to bring volunteers back to the centre of CADEV&apos;s action, it is necessary to
- Assess the current level of organisation of the DSCs by parish.
- Evaluate the capacity of the DSCs to communicate on community issues.
- Evaluate the capacity to write project proposals.
- To assess the knowledge of security of the DSCs.
- Evaluate DSCs&apos; knowledge of protection, inclusion and accessibility.
Once these assessments have been completed, capacity building will be provided in order to put DSCs at the heart of the interventions.</narrative>
