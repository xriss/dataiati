   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project aims to help support a medical centre in Ngoula, Niger.

Ngoula is situated at 80 kms off road with limited infrastructures. The only infrastructures, such as a primary and secondary schools and boreholes for drinking water were built by the Catholic Church. Due to the request from the community, the church built a health centre with at least 10 beds. 

The centre has been providing good services to the community for the last year; supporting malnourished children, providing curative services, vaccinations, maternity services, etc. The church signed a MOU with the Niger government that it would hand over the management of the centre within 2 years. The Archbishop contacted CAFOD in Niger last year to see if any support could be given to the centre. A budget was submitted and the major donor section agreed to help seek funding, but this was not successful. The budget then was much higher, due to the purchase of an ambulance.

In December 2014, the Archbishop requested the PM in Niger to request if CAFOD could help pay the nurse and the midwife. Because this does not fall within the country strategy (despite some link with nutrition work), the PM requested support from other budget sources to help the church continue providing health services to Ngoula inhabitants.</narrative>
