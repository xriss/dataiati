   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Being a deeply rural Sahelian country, Niger records rainfall over a period of three months. This is the period when the majority of the population is active in agriculture. During the other nine months of the year, it is traditional for people to migrate to neighbouring countries to work at small jobs in order to survive during the lean season. This phenomenon is amplified by the porosity of the borders. These uncontrolled movements of people (especially after the reopening of land borders borders in June 2021 for purely economic reasons after their closure at the beginning of the pandemic) are at the origin of several problems that the state has to face, such as insecurity, extremism, human trafficking and the high risk of circulating diseases from one area to another, especially Covid-19.

Concerning the application of barrier measures, internally, it should be noted that the population has greatly lowered its guard and no longer scrupulously applies the barrier measures recommended by the Ministry of Health. This situation is relatively due to the lack of an adequate communication and the circulation of messages of disinformation.

As for vaccination, it was launched on 29 March 2021 with AstraZeneca and Sinopharma vaccines. 
However, in view of the results obtained, only about 3.3% of the targeted population of 10,318,339 people have been vaccinated. Additional efforts are still required to reach the vaccination targets recommended to country, namely 10% of the population vaccinated by September 2021 and 30% by December 2021.To reach this goal, raising awareness among the population remains the key to success in a country where bad rumours are circulating to discourage the population from being vaccinated.
This project will therefore contribute to prevention through awareness raising activities on barrier measures and the usefulness of vaccination and distribution of Covid-19 prevention products and equipment in border regions which currently represent high risk areas after the reopening of land borders and may serve as entry points for several cases of different Covid-19 variants from different neighbouring countries.</narrative>
