   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Malnutrition prevention support among children and women in 11 Health Centres in Tera District</narrative>
  </title>
  <description>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Global acute malnutrition remains rampant in Niger especially during the lean period when the number of the affected children, pregnant and lactating mother rise. In 2015 the rate of global acute malnutrition was o 15% which is equivalent to WHO&#x2019;s emergency threshold. The Tillab&#xE9;ry region (where Tera Health District is situated) is not an exception with 13.1% of GAM and 2.5% of SAM in 2015. According to UNOCHA the number of children threatened by malnutrition is 1.2 million children and this number is likely to rise as the food security situation is likely to worsen. The government of Niger talks of the malnutrition situation in its 2016 National Response plan. During his recent visit in Niger a couple of weeks ago, Mr O&#x2019; Brien (the USG for humanitarian Affairs) raised concern for the high number of children affected by malnutrition in Niger. The nutrition status of children in Niger is closely linked to the level of food access and availability in the country. For those living in rural areas such as those targeted by this project this is usually is challenge especially when the harvest is not sufficient enough to cover the needs of the families. Also coupled to the lack of food is poor hygiene and poor feeding practices. This is the reason why CADEV has submitted this project to CAFOD to help reduce the rate of malnutrition in the health areas of Diagorou, Taka, Bouppo, Bangare, Gabitane, Tillim, Tegueye, Wanzerbe, Yatakala, Bellekoira, Wezabangou, all in T&#xE9;ra Health District. This will be done through the awareness raising sessions, promoting best practices in infant and child feeding, culinary demonstrations, and early detection of malnutrition through screening. CADEV will also train community relay people in communication&#x2019;s technics, will provide cereals, beans and vegetable cooking oil. In all CADEV will reach out to 6,800 children, 927 pregnant and lactating mothers, 13 health workers and 180 community relay people. 
CAFOD has been providing support to fight malnutrition and save the lives of many children and women. CADEV has a long standing experience and has been regularly asked by the health and nutrition services to provide support. In view of the prevailing malnutrition situation we recommend this project for approval because it aims to reduce the rates of GAM and preserve lives in the selected areas.</narrative>
