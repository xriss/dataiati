  <description>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In Niger, the prevalence of acute malnutrition is consistently above the 10% warning level, and at least one area is always above the emergency level during lean periods. The 2015 agriculture season has been globally very poor in terms of harvest and the availability of food within households. Rains came very late in season and where very heavy at times and destroyed crops. This has created a situation of food insecurity where which has exacerbated the nutritional situation by increasing the number of children below 5 years of age affected by malnutrition and also of pregnant and lactating mothers. According to official government and OCHA figures there are up to 3.6 million people threatened by severe food insecurity. Tillab&#xE9;ry region where CAFOD has been supporting malnutrition prevention through BRACED and other funding sources is not spared. According to the latest national survey on nutrition and child survival carried out by Niger Ministry of Public Health, the nutritional is particularly critical in 4 out of 8 regions of Niger with rates beyond emergency threshold of 15% set by WHO. Currently Tillab&#xE9;ry Region has the malnutrition rate of 13.1% still above alert threshold (10%) set by the WHO. This means that everything has to be done to prevent the Tillab&#xE9;ry nutrition situation from worsening and reaching the emergency level. If the levels in Tillab&#xE9;ry have remained quite low compared to the other regions it is also because of the work CADEV/CAFOD and others have been doing in malnutrition prevention and treatment over last years.
This project is being proposed to help CADEV Niger provide malnutrition treatment to 10 Integrated Health Centres (Lemdou, Bankilare, Chatoumane, Pettelkole, Amarsingu&#xE9;, Zaneye, Fambita, Komabangou, Goundaye and Kokorou) where CADEV has been providing malnutrition prevention services through BRACED. The total number of beneficiaries expected is 9,677 children below 5 years of age and 6,674 pregnant and lactating mothers. It is important to note that CAFOD alongside other agencies (Caritas Luxembourg, Secours Catholique France, Caritas Germany, and Kindermissions-Werk) funded a 2 years nutrition project implemented by CADEV Niger which was complementary to BRACED and allowed CADEV to transfer any child or women suffering or suspected of suffering from malnutrition for treatment. This project officially ended end of last year 2015. CADEV has found it difficult to make any transfers of the sick because they were no longer able to provide any treatment. That is why this project is important to help complement the prevention work being done through BRACED.</narrative>
