  </title>
  <description>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Niger ranks 187th out of 187 countries in the Human Development Index, making it the poorest country in the world. This extreme level of poverty is caused by a number of interlinked factors such as geography, climate and food insecurity. More than 60 per cent of the population of Niger live below the poverty line and are unable to meet their most basic needs including food, water, clothing, access to education and healthcare.
The remote area of Ngoula, where this project is based, is situated 130kms from the city of Niamey, in the south west of Niger. Roads are very poor and disappear during the rainy season. The only long established items of infrastructure are a primary school, a secondary school and boreholes for drinking water built by the Catholic Church. At the request of the community, a health centre was also constructed in 2013, with 10 beds for inpatients. The centre has been providing good services to the community for the last two years, including support to malnourished children, vaccinations and maternity care. It was agreed that the government of Niger would take over management of the Health Centre in 2015. However, this agreement has not been fulfilled and the Health Centre requires urgent support. Over 16,000 people live in Ngoula and the nearest hospital is 80kms away. Ngoula Health Centre is a vital lifeline for rural communities. In 2015, a total of 225 babies were born in the Health Centre. Without these facilities, the babies would have been born at home and if complications had arisen, their mothers would have had no access to medical support. The Health Centre also provides a range of care for those with malaria, respiratory infections and skin diseases, for example. The goal of this project is to improve health services for 12,600 patients at Ngoula Health Centre. Our partner CADEV Niamey will focus on reaching malnourished children between 0 and 5 years of age, as well as pregnant and breast-feeding mothers.</narrative>
