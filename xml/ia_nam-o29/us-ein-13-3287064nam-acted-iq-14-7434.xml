   <narrative xml:lang="EN">ACTED&#x2019;s programming under the proposed action will focus mainly on supporting the populations of Kawergosk and Darashakran refugee camps, while also providing information services to non-camp populations and other humanitarian actors working in the region. The action aims to contribute to its overall goal through the following activities: overall management of Kawergosk and Darashakran refugee camps; provision of domestic items to the populations of these camps that are sufficient to meet their basic needs; providing both these two camps&#x2019; populations as well as non-camp refugees in all three KRI governorates with timely and accurate information regarding available services; and providing humanitarian actors with frequent updates regarding the situation and needs of refugees in the KRI through ACTED&#x2019;s REACH initiative.</narrative>
