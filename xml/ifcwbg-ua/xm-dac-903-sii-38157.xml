   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Project will support LLC Astarta-Kyiv (the Company or Astarta), a leading primary agriculture producer in Ukraine with approximately 250,000 ha of land under cultivation.    Astartas principal activities include (i) production of sugar beet and high quality white sugar, (ii) production of other crops including wheat, barley, corn, sunflower, and soya, (iii) soybean processing, and (iv) cattle farming. The Company owns and operates 9 sugar plants, soybean processing plant, bioenergy complex, and chain of grain silos and supporting infrastructure facilities in 4 operational regions in Ukraine.  The Project will help Astarta finance its general working capital needs and purchase crops from local farmers during the harvest season, when the availability of crops is at peak and the prices are normally the lowest, thus allowing the Company to achieve sustainable supply raw material for processing and limit its margin volatility.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project is to support the growth and diversification of one of the leading farm enterprises in Ukraine, engaged in the production of crops, sugar, soy products and milk. IFC Loan will help Astarta secure adequate financing of general working capital needs while financing from local banks is difficult to obtain.  Also, the IFC financing will inject additional liquidity into the Ukrainian agri sector and indirectly to multiple farmers who sell their crops and provide farming services to Astarta. This program will contribute to the growth of the Ukrainian economy, to global food security by increasing production of key crops exported from Ukraine, while supporting direct and indirect employment in rural areas where alternative job opportunities remain scarce.</narrative>
