   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Project will help facilitate its continued growth in a high potential sector to Ukraine&apos;&apos;s economy and strengthen the debt servicing capacity of a leading agribusiness group. Key development impacts of the Project include the following:  (i) Support food security: MHP&apos;&apos;s overall volumes are expected to increase as a result of the Project and contribute to improved food security in Ukraine and beyond by efficiently converting grain to meat through supporting a leading and efficient poultry producer;  (ii) Provide demonstration effect: By supporting MHP, a socially responsible and efficient producer with solid track record, IFC&apos;&apos;s investment, which includes a B Loan, will encourage foreign and local investors to invest in Ukraine&apos;&apos;s economy in crisis times;   (iii) Support job preservation and creation: The Group currently employs 30,000 staff, including 11,400 women. Direct employment is expected to increase as a result of the Project; and  (iv) Support inclusiveness: The Company supports a network of 2,600 SMEs, a franchise network of small shops selling MHP branded poultry.
