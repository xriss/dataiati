   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Stakeholders (Funds portfolio companies): The Fund will provide capital and value creation to mid-cap companies primarily active in Ukraine and Moldova, to address a lack of access to equity capital, particularly given the challenging environment, by making investments of $1030 million in around 10-15 companies. Horizon Capital has demonstrated a strong track record of supporting value creation in its portfolio companies, reflected in both market expansion and job creation. The Fund Manager has delivered solid results by backing competitive platforms generating hard currency revenues globally, which are resilient to domestic macro and currency shocks. The Fund Manager remains fully committed to Ukraine and Moldova, including a dedicated operations advisory team to support portfolio companies in managing the current situation and continuing to pursue their growth objectives. In line with its commitment to promoting gender equality, Horizon Capital has set a target of at least 25% of its portfolio companies being women led/owned companies.
Resilience: Ukraine has a long history of PE investments; however, current circumstances limit commercial interest and investment in this market. As a leading investment firm in Ukraine, Horizon Capital plays an anchoring role within the PE market in Ukraine, demonstrating fundraising strength and delivering results during prior periods of conflict and economic uncertainty. IFC expects Horizon Capitals continued commitment and presence to support preservation of near-term market activity, while backing companies which will support Ukraines economic revival and future growth. The Fund will be one of the first investments by IFC in Ukraine since the war began in February 2022, and as such, will send a significant signal in demonstrating market resilience and encouraging investors to capitalize on the opportunities that Ukraine and Moldova have to offer.</narrative>

The Fund will invest primarily in fast-growing technology and export-oriented mid-cap companies, primarily active in Ukraine and Moldova, benefiting from cost competitive local platforms with global reach. The Fund will make investments of $10-30 million to acquire minority stakes in 10-15 mid-cap companies with enterprise values of $50-150 million. HCGF IV is the successor fund to Emerging Emerging Europe Growth Fund III (2017 vintage) and will follow a similar investment strategy focusing on IT services and products, as well as e-commerce, innovative consumer goods, and fintech.</narrative>
