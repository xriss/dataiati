   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Construction of Septic Tanks in Support of 16/6 Program through UNOPS</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In  Haiti,  UNOPS  is  one  of  the  4  UN  partners  of  the  Governments  16/6  program  and  is  responsible  for  the  design  and  implementation  of  the  Housing and  Community Infrastructure  aspect of  the  project.  The first phase funded by the Haitian Reconstruction Fund  (HRF),  is  located  in  the  6 neighborhoods  of  P&#xE9;tion&#x2010;Ville and Turgeau.  The  second  phase,  located  in  Fort  National,  funded  by  the  Department of Foreign  Affairs,  Trade,  Development  Canada  (DFATD,  formerly  CIDA).  These  two programs  are  scheduled  over  a  24&#x2010;month  period.

The  main  objective  of  UNOPS  and  the  16/6  program  is  to  provide  the  Government  of Haiti  with  different  housing  models  and  community  infrastructure  solutions,  which  are sustainable  and  replicable.  To  be  able  to  achieve  these  goals,  a  holistic  approach  was used  to  tackle  the  main  difficulties  blocking  both  the  housing  sector,  including  the complexity  of  the  land  tenure  situation,  the  lack  of housing  credit,  weaknesses  in  the construction  industry  and  local  authorities,  high  density  settlements,  no  urban  planning, limited  historical  government  interventions,  and  very  difficult  terrain  prone  to  landslides and  other  natural  risks. UNOPS  engaged  in  three  different  housing  solutions  in  order  to  address  the  issue  of  lack of  housing  in  informal  urban  settlements: Repair  and  reinforcements,  Single  core expandable  houses  and  collective  site.

The  main  objective  of  this  request  is  to  seek funding  for  the sanitation  component attached  to  the  housing  program.  In  light  of  the  request  of  the Direction  Nationale  de l&apos;Eau  Potable  et  de  l&apos;Assainissement (DINEPA),  the  National  Water  and  Sanitation Agency,  of  having  a  toilet  for  each  new  house  constructed,  the  project  is  in  need  of  350 sanitation  packages  that  include  the  septic  tank  and  related  plumbing  to  finish  the program.  This  would  cater  to  350  families  who  are  in  need  of  housing  in  the  neighborhoods  of  P&#xE9;tionville  and  Turgeau. Since  this  falls  inside  of  the ongoing  16/6  project,  the  requested  funds  are  only  for  labor and  material,  as  all  UNOPS  personnel  are  covered.</narrative>
