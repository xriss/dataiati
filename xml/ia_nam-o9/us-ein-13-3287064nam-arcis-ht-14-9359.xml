  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project proposes to support Haitian Red Cross (HRC) physical asset development in coordination with ongoing organizational development (OD) programs supporting HRC capacity building. After the 2010 earthquake, HRC suffered reduced capacity to achieve core functions related to disaster risk reduction and health promotion. This was caused in part by significant losses to physical assets that hosted activities of many of these core functions, including: HRC national headquarters located in Carrefour Feuilles, the Port au Prince central ambulance dispatch, and the downtown Port au Prince blood bank.

&#x200B;The HRC 2010-2015 Strategy outlines core functions of the Haitian Red Cross, including: (1) preparation for and respond to disasters; (2) pre-hospital ambulance services; and (3) blood transfusion services The American Red Cross therefore seeks to support HRC to rebuild two of their physical assets hosting these core functions: (1) the West Branch headquarters in Carrefour Feuilles; (2) the Bicentenaire ambulance dispatch OR the Rue des Miracles Blood Bank. The building construction will be led by ARC with full engagement of HRC at all stages of the process. Further, the needs for these assets will further be analyzed by the ongoing HRC organizational assessment and business plan development process being undertaken with support from American Red Cross (ARC) OD program. The third (3) building will be constructed by USAID as part of its Canaan urban development program and this proposal covers only the development of the schematic design of this building which would be an ambulance post and HRC local office/community engagement space for Canaan.Furthermore, as part of HRCs strategic objective to prepare and respond to disasters, the HRC plans to extract lessons learned from the 2010 earthquake, and expand these activities throughout the country through community resilience programming. Therefore, ARC proposes to proactively support this strategic objective promoting resilience outside of Port au Prince through the new construction of a forth (4) building, a training center and office premises, in the North Department. This is in line with the objectives of the &#x2018;Greater North Resilience Program&#x2019; or Gran No Pi Djanm (GNPD) program implemented jointly by ARC and HRC based on HRCs strategic interest and needs in the Greater North region.</narrative>
