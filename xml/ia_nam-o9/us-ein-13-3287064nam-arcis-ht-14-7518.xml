   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Camp Formalization through UN Habitat</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The existence of camps remain a major issue for Port-au-Prince Metropolitan Area. Without alternatives to relocate or rehouse the poorest households, many residents are strengthening their shelters with concrete blocks and basic structures for water storage. Camp committees and private initiatives are investing in provision of basic services such as community schools, free clinics and shops as most of the camps are socially organized as communities. The process of camp transformation into neighborhood is ongoing without proper planning guidelines and provision of adequate infrastructure. The main risk is the expansion of existing informal and under-serviced areas with poor quality and unsafe constructions, in the absence of development controls. 

Rental subsidies for camp closure are currently the main governmental intervention addressing camp issues while the Housing Policy, developed by the Unit&#xE9; de Construction de Logements et de B&#xE2;timents Publics (UCLBP) with support of UN-Habitat, identifies other options like camp formalization, retrofitting rental units, sites and services. Even though a high proportion of the rental subsidy funds are used by landlords to upgrade their buildings, external evaluation on rental allocations show that after one year 75% of the returning families do not remain in the rental accommodation identified and approved under the subsidy scheme. The Camp Coordination and Camp Management cluster (CCCM) is doing an evaluation of rental subsidies impacts, and exploring other options and alternatives such as camp formalization. 

The project aims to assist the government bodies (UCLBP, relevant ministries) and municipal authorities in the building of consensus regarding all camp exit strategies including the less developed alternative of in situ camps upgrading and urban integration. The objective is to strengthen analysis and decision making with a view to ending displacement based on case-by-case survey of specific camps in consultation with the CCCM Cluster.

The project proposes to formalize 2 or 3 selected camps through urban integration with the surrounding neighborhood and through provision of support which could include housing support, rental subsidies, access to basic services such as road, water and sanitation networks, or a combination of these options. The project evaluation, which will be based on lessons learned from the implementation and processes applied, will contribute to systematize the full approach in order to replicate the process. In this vein, the project will provide a platform of methodological support and improved tools to &#x201C;end displacement&#x201D;, focusing on &#x201C;camp formalization&#x201D;.

Given the Nations&#x2019; commitment to use the recovery phase to bridge and support the development of Haiti, this opportunity of guiding the process for camp formalization could pave the way for urban revitalization by looking at a multitude of cross-sectoral issues related to urban development such as local governance, community empowerment, training and capacity building, land issues, housing, in addition to access to basic services, water and sanitation.</narrative>
