   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Access to and extension of the anti-retroviral treatments during the last decade have significantly reduced the mortality rates among children infected with HIV/AIDS, while at the same time enabling them to enjoy better living conditions during childhood, to be integrated to family, social and educational activities without fearing to be exposed to the same fatal outcome as their biological parents.

This optimistic prospect, however, is often confronted with pervasive stigmatization felt everywhere in the Haitian society, resulting in constraint to freedom and denial of their serological status for fear of being judged and rejected by their peers or even by their own families.

As part of a society comprised of 43% of youth under 18 &#x2013; one of the youngest society in the world- this generation of young adults is facing major challenges calling for actions aimed at:

1) Limiting HIV transmission to other young people

2) Advocating gender equity in order to promote safe sexual practices based on freely discussed and mutually agreed choices

3) Working towards economic self-sufficiency and self-esteem among youths and young adults, in order for them to become a generation equipped with a sense of responsibility and actively involved in the development of their country.

Unfortunately, in spite of this significant progress in accessing the antiretroviral treatments, there are still too many orphan children who will not be able to reach the age of adolescence due to stigmatization which generates rejection by the extended family.  Rejection of these children results in a lack of access for them to medical care and ARV treatment, with the consequence that their survival is at stake.

The Emmus V preliminary report of 2012 makes it clear that AIDS continues to be a major challenge with regard to the situation of the Haitian children:

190,000 children have lost at least one parent or both due to AIDS, a number that is increasing systematically

6,800 children 0-14 years are living with HIV

Only 14% of children positive to HIV have access to ARV treatments</narrative>
