   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Safe and Resilient Communities in Pamplona Alta, Peru</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Zone of Pamplona Alta (Zone 1), located in one of the most populous districts of Lima, Peru (the District of San Juan de Miraflores) is home to a sizable urban population that is in constant risk of hazardous seismic activity. Additionally, the community faces regular natural hazards such as flooding and landslides due to climate change, El Ni&#xF1;o, and other meteorological events. The risks that these hazards pose are only compounded by the poor rural planning and the community&#x2019;s lack of adequate access to basic needs &#x2013; such as water and sanitation. Through a partnership with the Peruvian Red Cross, the American Red Cross is supporting a project to address these risks and vulnerabilities, ultimately making Pamplona Alta a safer, healthier, and more resilient community. The project seeks to increase the target community&#x2019;s resilience in preparing for and responding to disasters through an integrated disaster risk management approach which attempts to address disaster risk reduction as well as heath and water and sanitation. Within these sectors, the project will focus on capacity building and training, as well as hygiene promotion. The capacity building and training components will be heavily focused on disaster preparedness and disaster risk reduction at the community level. Trainings will include supporting the community to be better able to self-organize, develop community level and household level disaster plans, pre-define evacuation routes, establish awareness around early warning systems, as well as create and train community disaster response teams, as the community is always the first to respond in any disaster. From the hygiene perspective, given the high risks and vulnerabilities which have already been identified in the community, the hygiene promotion, largely through clean water campaigns, will be a critical component both of disaster risk reduction as well as disaster preparedness and enhanced response. Given the impact disease and infection can have on a community, in disaster times as well as in the quiescence periods, ensuring a stronger, healthier community is an integral part of community resilience. Additionally, the project will seek to support the Peruvian Red Cross&#x2019; management capacity to promote future sustainability.</narrative>
