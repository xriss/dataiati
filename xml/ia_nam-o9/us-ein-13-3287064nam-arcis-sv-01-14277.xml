  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In December 2013, El Salvador&#x2019;s third highest volcano, Chaparrastique, erupted causing thousands to flee their homes. The Salvadoran Red Cross responded immediately providing assistance to the communities and coordinating with local authorities. Despite these efforts, this event demonstrated that communities were neither well prepared nor organized to respond to the event. With the volcano remaining active, with small explosions being reported as recently as January 2015, and subsequent eruption or other natural disasters inevitable, proper preparation and planning is critical. This project build off the current phase of the Building resilience in Chaparrastique Volcano Affect Communities project to ensure that a wider reach of communities, schools and local agencies within the direct vicinity of the volcano are better prepared for and able to respond to future disasters. The project targets 11 communities which have been selected based on their vulnerability and exposure to the volcano, leaving them at greatest risk to subsequent volcanic eruptions and landslides. The project will include activities such as first aid training, creation and training of community committees, creation of community disaster plans, installation of early warning systems, and simulation exercises which will increase community knowledge and preparedness to address future disaster hazards and risk. In order to increase knowledge and preparedness in the school systems, trainings in First Aid and psychosocial support will be conducted, evacuation and school protection plans developed, and school simulations carried out. Lastly, training in Damage Assessments (EDAN) and Management of Emergency Operations Centers (MACOE), Shelter management and School Safety (SSC) will be provided to local authorities to strengthen their ability to carry out rapid damage and needs assessments and enhance their administrative capacity.</narrative>
