  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">On 27 February 2010, at 03:34 local time, an earthquake measuring magnitude 8.8 on the Richter scale struck 105km NNE of Concepcion and 115km WSW of Talca, the respective capitals of the B&#xED;o-B&#xED;o and Maule regions of Chile, at a depth of only 35km. This earthquake was then followed by an equally devastating tsunami. This double disaster left 528 people dead, more than 1.8 million people affected, 81,000 homes destroyed and some 30 billion US dollars in damages. Heavy aftershocks, including a recent tremor of magnitude 6.8 on 11 February 2011, continue to be recorded well after the event. The earthquake affected region in Chile, as well as the country overall, is vulnerable to natural disasters due to its geographic and topographic features, including tsunamis, volcanic eruptions, landslides, flooding, fires and drought. Furthermore, in recent years it has become evident that, due to poverty and demographic pressures, more people are living in areas prone to natural disasters. Poor planning and environmental management as well as a lack of regulatory mechanisms increase risk, while at the same time exacerbate the negative effects of disasters. Prior to the February 2010 earthquake, there were no community based disaster preparedness or disaster risk reduction programs taking place in Chile implemented by the government, the National Society or other organizations. As evidenced by an assessment trip following the earthquake, the Chilean Red Cross is a national society working to transform itself into a more dynamic and modern organization. The national society has increased is capacity as the result of the disaster, but further support for capacity building will be needed to consolidate gains and continue development.

The LARRA Chile program will increase preparedness capacity to respond to future disasters by empowering vulnerable communities, as well as the Chilean Red Cross society operating in disaster prone areas, through disaster preparedness (DP) and first aid activities. Implementation Strategy: The program seeks to reduce the number of deaths, injuries and socio-economic impacts caused by disasters by strengthening the Chilean Red Cross and building safer, more resilient communities in the regions affected by the February 2010 earthquake. ARC will implement the LARRA-Chile Program in close coordination with the Chilean Red Cross Society and target institutional capacity building at the national, regional and local levels, in sync with ARC&#x2019;s DM strategic plan. While this program will be managed at the National and Regional Levels, interventions will be carried out at the branches of the Chilean Red Cross and are based on years of evidence within and outside the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement (Movement). Critical assumptions include: stability of Red Cross leadership and local branch authorities; no future disasters affecting program areas; recruitment of high caliber staff, active participation of volunteers, and community and inter-agency network members; and security conditions are maintained in the region.</narrative>
