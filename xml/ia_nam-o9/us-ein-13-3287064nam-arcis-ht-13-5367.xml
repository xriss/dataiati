  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In a region northeast of Port-au-Prince sits a burgeoning community known as Canaan, where more than 160,000 people have relocated and are building homes and businesses. The population of the four neighborhoods that make up Canaan saw a huge influx after the earthquake as people sought land to build homes, leading to unplanned settlements with limited access to basic services. Plots have been claimed without oversight from the government, leading to informal buying and selling between residents and self-appointed committees. At the end of 2012, it was estimated that people had invested more than $100 million in the area. 

The region faces a number of challenges resulting from the quick and disorganized growth. Homes are being built from poor materials, making them susceptible to future disasters such as earthquakes and hurricanes. The lack of urban planning has led to a shortage of utilities such as clean water and waste management, and has led to concerns over the scarcity of environmental considerations. As a new settlement, there is a tenuous connection between residents and the national and local government, resulting in a lack of community cohesion.

The Canaan Urban Development Program, jointly funded and implemented by the American Red Cross, USAID, and Habitat for Humanity, seeks to make a sustainable impact on the region by giving residents the resources they need to expand livelihoods opportunities, improve living conditions, and become a safer, more integrated community. As an international coalition working in tandem with the Haitian government, these organizations have developed the program so that it takes a comprehensive approach to addressing the area&#x2019;s challenges while considering the broader recovery strategy of the national housing authority (UCLBP). The program&#x2019;s will undertake the following goals:

Improve social engagement and help residents be better prepared for future disasters, and;

Expand economic development and make improvements to infrastructure in order to foster livelihoods.

Achievement of these goals will be realized through implementation of several projects that work in coordination with each other.</narrative>
