   <narrative xml:lang="EN">PASS was established in 2000 to stimulate investment and growth in commercial agriculture and related sectors by providing business development and financial services to small and medium agribusinesses, to stimulate investments and promote growth of commercial agri-businesses in Tanzania, for enhanced inclusive economic growth and poverty reduction.

As such, the target group is mainly small agribusinesses who are unable to get a commercial bank as they lack collateral, information and knowledge on how to develop business plans or how to apply for a bank loan. PASS also collaborates with medium seized businesses who&apos;s activities have positive effects on the main target group such as smallholder farmers or sub-contractors.

PASS charges the banks a fee of 3-4 % depending on the guarantee provided, a cost which is not affecting the client. The reasons being sustainability and avoidance of market distortions. Instead, PASS can assist the clients in comparing banks and the collaboration also at times reduces the interests rates as banks see a lowered risk.

Sweden views PASS as a highly relevant partner in its role as an intermediary who understands both the banks and the agribusinesses, assists in making unbankable clients bankable, lowers the risk for both banks and clients, and contributes to unleashing the potential of Tanzanian agribusinesses and economic development. Also, PASS contributes to banks&apos; increased knowledge about the agriculture sector and thereby, addresses market failures and information asymmetries.

Sweden will, extend a guarantee of 20 MUSD to complement PASS&#x2019;s current guarantee scheme to support bank&#x2019;s lending to clients in the agriculture sector. Sweden&#x2019;s guarantee is not cash funded, but a paper guarantee backed by the government of Sweden (rated AAA by Fitch, S&amp;P and Moody&#x2019;s) therefore normally considered a zero-risk in the balance sheet of banks. The guarantee is a portfolio guarantee, Sweden will therefore not be involved in each single transaction but cover 60% of the guarantees provided by PASS who in turn covers up to 60% (80% for women owned businesses) of the lending bank&#x2019;s risk. Risk sharing with PASS and the banks is important to assure a good quality portfolio.

The main guiding principles that are required to be addressed during partnership are: Environment and climate change, gender equality, and poverty reduction. As such, PASS is required to undertake a simplified environmental assessment and Sweden will support PASS in formulating improved definitions on target groups and 3-4 results with indicators that allow monitoring of progress related to poverty reduction i.e. jobs and incomes, as part of the new strategy development. A gender analysis is also needed, but could be undertaken as part of the new strategy development.</narrative>
   <narrative xml:lang="SV">Private Agricultural Sector Support Trust - PASS arbetar med aff&#xE4;rsutveckling och tillhandah&#xE5;ller finansiella tj&#xE4;nster &#xE5;t sm&#xE5; lantbrukare samt sm&#xE5;- och medelstora entrepren&#xF6;rer inom jordbrukssektorn i Tanzania. PASS grundades av Danmarks tillsammans med Tanzanias regering f&#xF6;r att stimulera investeringar och &#xF6;ka tillv&#xE4;xten i jordbrukssektorn som f&#xF6;rs&#xF6;rjer en majoritet av Tanzanias befolkning, framf&#xF6;rallt de som lever i fattigdom, och f&#xF6;r att p&#xE5; s&#xE5; s&#xE4;tt st&#xF6;dja fattigdomsminskning och ekonomisk utveckling. Idag karakt&#xE4;riseras sektorn av l&#xE5;g tillv&#xE4;xt, l&#xE5;ga inkomster, l&#xE5;g produktivitet och bristf&#xE4;llig infrastruktur. En av de fr&#xE4;msta orsakerna till detta &#xE4;r begr&#xE4;nsad tillg&#xE5;ng till finansiella tj&#xE4;nster generellt och f&#xF6;r jordbrukssektion specifikt.

PASSs fokus &#xE4;r s&#xE5;ledes att st&#xF6;dja &#xE4;ff&#xE4;rsutveckling och bidra med finansiella tj&#xE4;nster till framf&#xF6;rallt sm&#xE5; lantbrukare, f&#xF6;retagare och kooperativ. De agerar som en l&#xE4;nk mellan l&#xE5;ntagare och l&#xE5;ngivare (banker) och f&#xF6;rb&#xE4;ttrar l&#xE5;ntagares l&#xE5;nevillkor och st&#xF6;djer aff&#xE4;rsplansutveckling. De erbjuder bland annat att st&#xE5; som garant i de fall l&#xE5;ntagaren saknar n&#xF6;dv&#xE4;ndig s&#xE4;kerhet f&#xF6;r kommersiella bankl&#xE5;n, vilket de flesta av PASS klienter g&#xF6;r givet m&#xE5;lgruppen. Till liten del st&#xF6;djer de &#xE4;ven medelstora f&#xF6;retag om deras verksamhet har positiv p&#xE5;verkan p&#xE5; mikro och sm&#xE5; f&#xF6;retag s&#xE5;som underleverant&#xF6;rer.

Enligt banker i Tanzania har samarbetet med PASS bidragit till en &#xF6;kat aptit f&#xF6;r utl&#xE5;ning till sm&#xE5; entrepren&#xF6;rer inom jordbrukssektorn, en grupp som tidigare ansetts ha f&#xF6;r h&#xF6;g riskprofil. Samarbetet har &#xE4;ven resulterat i en minskad risk f&#xF6;r banker, en &#xF6;kad medvetenhet om finansiella tj&#xE4;nster hos lantbrukare och entrepren&#xF6;rer, samt f&#xF6;rb&#xE4;ttrat bankernas kunskap om utl&#xE5;ning till jordbrukssektorn.

Sida kommer att utf&#xE4;rda en svensk statsgaranti om 20 miljoner USD f&#xF6;r att komplettera PASS nuvarande cash-garanti som st&#xF6;djer bankernas utl&#xE5;ning till jordbrukssektorn. En svensk statsgaranti &#xE4;r en pappersgaranti med den svenska staten (AAA av Fitch, S&amp;P och Moody&#x2019;s) som garant och garantin bed&#xF6;ms vanligtvis som riskfri i bankernas balansr&#xE4;kning.

I samarbetet med bankerna kommer PASS alltid att vara den frontande organisationen, och Sverige st&#xE5;r bakom. Intentionen &#xE4;r att alla klienter kommer att garanteras av en kombination av PASS cash-garanti och en svensk pappersgaranti. D&#xE4;r alla betalningskrav fr&#xE5;n bankerna kommer till PASS, som i sin tur kr&#xE4;ver Sverige p&#xE5; 60 % den garanterade summan.

D&#xE5; PASS verksamhet &#xE4;mnar bidra till inkluderande ekonomisk utveckling anses den f&#xF6;reslagna insatsen vara relevant f&#xF6;r det &#xF6;vergripande m&#xE5;let i Resultatstrategin f&#xF6;r Sveriges internationella bist&#xE5;nd i Tanzania 2013 &#x2013; 2019 och mer specifikt resultat 2.3 &#x201D;&#xD6;kade m&#xF6;jligheter f&#xF6;r kvinnor och unga att starta och driva produktiva f&#xF6;retag&#x201D;.

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Private Agricultural Sector Support Trust (PASS) is a facility that aims to stimulate investments and growth in commercial agriculture, agro-processing and related sectors through access to finance in markets, which are currently characterized by low growth, high levels of informality, low productivity, and weak infrastructure. It was founded in the year 2000 by Governments of the Kingdom of Denmark and the of United Republic of Tanzania as a pilot project under the ministry of agriculture. In 2007 it was transformed independent trust, registered as a Non-Profit making and Non-Governmental Organization (NGO) under the Trustees Incorporation Act 2002, and is taxed as charitable organization. The PASS key objectives include:
&#x2022;	Increasing the involvement of small and medium scale private sector entities in agribusiness,
&#x2022;	Providing technical services and financial linkages to small and medium scale agribusiness entities,
&#x2022;	Encouraging formation of producers organizations for market and financial linkages through agribusiness development services.

The role of PASS is to be an intermediary, which understands both the banks and the agribusinesses, and provides business development support (BDS) and financial services through a guarantee fund. PASS supports agribusinesses in the development of appropriate business plans and financial statements for loan applications, provides support during the loan and follows up when of risk of default. As such, it also assists the bank in making unbankable clients bankable and lowers the risk for the bank as well as the client. As a positive external effect, PASS also contributes to banks&apos; increased knowledge about the agriculture sector and hence, by default, contributes to addressing market failures and information asymmetries. The main services provided by PASS to its clients are:
1.	Business Development Services (BDS): feasibility studies, development of business plans, capacity building in specific technical areas, organization of farmers into groups (used as focal points for contract farming, input supply credit, produce-price negotiations and provision of advisory services), and marketing and market linkages. The majority (53%) of the business plans refer to farming, followed at a distance by processing (15%) and trading (14%). For sustainability reasons, PASS charges fees to clients for the BDS services provided and loan applications.
2.	Financial Services (FS): appraisal of loan write ups in line with banks&apos; terms and conditions and linkage thereof, and partial credit guarantees given to banks to top up inadequate collateral. The average loan amount is TZS 10,000,000 (USD 4 464.29) and the average tenor of these loans is 3 years.

PASS internal knowledge is used to provide business development services to help farmers and agribusinesses to obtain finance while the guarantee scheme is used to mitigate the lack of collateral required by the banks, which enables agribusinesses to obtain formal commercial loans. In addition, PASS&apos; network is large as it is working with 14 banks and covers the whole country which means that they also reach clients in remote areas where the banks are not represented. The main banks in agricultural finance are CRDB and NMB, both in terms of assets as well as the number of branches. The aim is to increase the number of partner banks, in order to have a larger outreach.
Three main reasons for banks to participate in Credit Guarantee Schemes (such as PASS
is offering) are:
1.	In case of default the guarantee scheme will offer compensation,
2.	The bank can use its capital more efficiently, because the guarantee reduces risk and do not require the same capital reserves, and,
3.	A guarantee can help resolve a single obligor limit (the maximum a bank can lend to a business).
PASS uses three types of guarantees:
1.	Traditional guarantee: The traditional guarantee covers loans to individuals, borrowers, associations/ groups and companies. Under the traditional guarantee, the PASS client will fill in the application form and a business plan will be drafted. PASS will hold a fixed deposit with partner banks during the first two years of the collaboration, and after this period the deposit will be replaced by an indemnity fund. The partner bank will pay PASS a risk sharing fee of 1% of the outstanding guaranteed loan principal per quarter. Under normal circumstances the value of the loan that can be guaranteed amounts from TZS 7 million (USD 3000) to TZS 600 million (USD 265 000). Currently, the maximum guarantee percentage under the traditional guarantee amounts to 60% (80% in case of loans to women).

2.	Portfolio guarantee: Under this guarantee, the bank decides to guarantee loans to their borrowers based on predetermined guarantee criteria and a guarantee product policy contractually agreed with PASS. Under the portfolio guarantee, the bank decides to guarantee loans to their borrowers based on predetermined guarantee criteria and a guarantee product policy contractually agreed with PASS. Every loan booked by the bank under the portfolio guarantee will however be reviewed by PASS and a guarantee certificate will be offered by PASS to the bank. Effectively, the portfolio guarantee does not differ that much from the traditional guarantee. The main difference is that in the case of the portfolio guarantee, the bank will take the initiative, make their own assessment, and PASS only has a review role, whereas in the case of the traditional guarantee PASS will be in the lead and assists with the business plan and the due diligence process. In terms of modalities and characteristics, the loans under the portfolio guarantees adhere to the same criteria as the traditional guarantee loans.

3.	Linkage banking guarantee: The linkage banking guarantee guarantees loans from highly liquid institutions to rural financial institutions / small banks to be used only for loanable funds supporting those institutions agribusiness portfolios. The linkage banking guarantee guarantees loans from highly liquid (tier 1) institutions to prequalified rural financial institutions (tier 2) to be used for loanable funds supporting the agribusiness portfolios of these FIs. The funding from the tier-1 FIs can be guaranteed (50%) and the individual loans from the tier-2 FIs to agribusinesses can also be guaranteed (50%). PASS is actively brokering the relationship between tier 2 financial institutions (such as community banks) with CRDB, as the clients of these financial institutions are clearly in need of lower demands for collateral for guaranteed credit. Of course, financial institutions would prefer higher guarantee percentages (50%), which to date could not be considered by PASS. PASS generally offers 30%.

According to banks in Tanzania, the cooperation with PASS has increased the banks ability to provide loans to agro-businesses which were previously seen as too risky, reduced risk due to improved business plans, increased the knowledge among the agro-entrepreneurs in their financial possibilities, and increased knowledge in banks about agricultural financing.

The idea is that if PASS can assist agri-businesses in getting a loan or a larger loan than they would otherwise get, this has a positive impact on assets and earnings which can be used to obtain new loans in the future whereby, after a number of years, a guarantee will not be required. Also, by assisting agribusinesses in registration and applying for formal bank loans, PASS also contributes to formalization of small enterprises in the agricultural sector. PASS does not seek to make non-commercial projects more bankable, nor do they make bad financial institutions better. Loans guaranteed are for projects that are otherwise viable, except that they are not considered bankable.</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">The guarantee quarterly reports and the developmental results narrative report indicates a general increase of Banks appetite to lend in Agricultural projects. The Swedish re-guarantee has supported PASS to have a tremendous growth of its portfolio with increase in number of beneficiaries and high impact on poverty. The following are examples of results based on core PASS&apos;s business indicators:&#xA0;
&#xA0;
Credit Guaranteeing is agribusiness is the core business of PASS. The report shows that as of December 2020, the PASSs total credit accommodation in the sector reached TZS 279 billion equivalent to 1.1 billion SEK or USD 121 million (based on Oanda average exchange rates) with committed funds worth TZS 124.8 billion (equivalent to 492 MSEK or USD 121m). This translated to 2.3% growth from previous reporting period and the ratio of about 1:1 down from 1.3 when Swedish guarantee was still used to book new loans. PASSs guaranteed loan portfolio held in 14 Banks which is still dominated by two Banks holding 78% (CRDB 39% and NMB 39%) while remaining 22% is guaranteed to other partner Banks. 

The  quality of PASS guarantee portfolio  is a requirement by the Bank of Tanzania for Banks to analyze the repayment trend (credit performance). Generally, the performance is slightly lower than the previous reporting period: 
1.	Unclassified loans: Loans with no instalments outstanding constitutes 56.6% of the total portfolio down from 62.37% of 2019 
2.	Especially mentioned: Loans with instalments 30  60 days past due has increased to 8.4% from 2.67% in 2019 
3.	Substandard Loans: Loans with instalments in arrears between 60  90 days increased to 9.8% compared to 8.43% in 2019 
4.	Doubtful Loans: Loans with outstanding instalment 90 - 180 days decreased to 1.2% from 4.70% in 2019 
5.	Default Loans: Loans with instalments in arrears over 180 days constitutes 24.0% compared to 21.83% in previous year.

Business development services: It is reported that a total of 15,347 business proposals were processed and submitted to banks with value of TZS 257.3Billion in 2020. This was, higher in number (9,047 business plans) and value (TZS 182.4Billion) compared to previous year. This an indication of promising growth of PASS portfolio and hence more agribusiness entrepreneurs are being linked to financial services for increasing investments in the agricultural sector. PASS surpassed its target for both Value (38.4%) and number (67.7%) of business proposals approved by partner financial institutions. 

The business plans are disaggregated by PASS product classification and gender: Under Traditional guarantee, a total of 128,350 individuals were reached 54.9% of whom being male and 45.1% female. Under this product, the target for the year was reached by 137% in terms of numbers and 101% in terms of value of businesses submitted to banks. Under Portfolio Guarantee, 65,656 agribusiness entrepreneurs applications were supported in which gender distribution was 80.2% male and 19.8% female. The value of the loan under this guarantee in year 2020 grew by 66% compared to values in year 2019. 

With regards to proportions based on the line of business (agribusiness sectors), crop Production was the leader with loan value of TZS 79.5 billion (about 30.88%), followed by agro-processing (27.49%) and crops trading (off-taking) (23.36%). There is a potential on horticulture, aquaculture and mechanization (where PASS is establishing the leasing window). PASS supported many small holder farmers under crop production who were linked to mainly two banks: VisionFund Microfinance in maize, paddy, and avocado production and NMB on cashew nut farming Number of Beneficiaries: 532,798 people (262,899 male and 269,899) benefited from the loans approved in 2020 for different guaranteed products compared to 2019 where the total number of beneficiaries were 226,689. The beneficiaries include large enterprises, farmer groups, SACCOS, farmers&apos; associations, companies as well as individuals involved in agribusiness. 

In the year 2020 a total of 9 business proposals were rejected from TPB, Azania Bank, NMB, NBC and CRDB Banks with a total value of TZS 0.33Billion compared to a total of 33 business proposals rejected in 2019 with values summing to TZS 0.77 billion. The rejection rate was higher (52.5%) in terms of value in 2020 with NMB Bank.

The assessments of the reports shows that PASS is the major contributor in unlocking financing in agribusiness sectors and hence promotion of private sector investments in agriculture in the country. This was manifested in the 2020 farmers day (an annual event called nanenane) whereby PASS was named the winner of the organizations supporting agribusinesses in the country. However, this has come with challenges-many farmers using the services have overwhelmed PASS in managing the too much data which has resulted to both delays in reporting and the quality of the reports. 
PASS is also implementing the capacity development project -the digitalization for which the Embassy contributed 1 000 000 kr, as well as Inclusive green growth and Agribusiness innovation centers in Morogoro and Kongwa for which Sweden is not part of the funding partnership (fully funded by DANIDA). 

COVID 19 and the unstable business environment are the most probable risks which the partner needs to monitor as they pose risk in the quality of guarantee portfolio.</narrative>
