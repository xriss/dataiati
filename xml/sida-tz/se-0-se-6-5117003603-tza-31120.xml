   <narrative xml:lang="SV">Till&#xE4;ggsbeslutet g&#xE4;ller ett tillskott till AECF f&#xF6;r att finansiera en tredje runda av Tanzania Agri-business Window (TZAW) d&#xE4;r f&#xF6;retag kan s&#xF6;ka st&#xF6;d f&#xF6;r aff&#xE4;rsmodeller inom jordbrukssektorn som gynnar m&#xE4;nniskor som lever i fattigdom. Ett antal vinnande f&#xF6;retag v&#xE4;ljs ut bland annat baserat p&#xE5; hur v&#xE4;l och hur m&#xE5;nga fattiga m&#xE4;nniskor kan dra nytta av f&#xF6;retagets aff&#xE4;rsmodell, som producenter, konsumenter, leverant&#xF6;rer mm.

Tidigare st&#xF6;d har g&#xE5;tt till runda tv&#xE5; av TZAW och Renewable Energy and Climate Change Adaptation Technologies (REACT-TZ). Det &#xE4;r &#xE4;nnu f&#xF6;r tidigt att rapportera resultat fr&#xE5;n dessa tv&#xE5; utlysningar, men rapportering fr&#xE5;n f&#xF6;rsta rundan (ej finansierad av Sida-st&#xF6;d) visar resultat i linje med uppsatta m&#xE5;ls&#xE4;ttningar och visar att modellen fungerar v&#xE4;l. 

Det bed&#xF6;ms finnas ett ansenligt antal lovande f&#xF6;retag inom jordbrukssektorn i Tanzania som skulle kunna kvalificera f&#xF6;r AECF-st&#xF6;d. Utifr&#xE5;n goda f&#xF6;ruts&#xE4;ttningar och baserat p&#xE5; erfarenheter av redan p&#xE5;g&#xE5;ende verksamhet genom AECF i Tanzania bed&#xF6;ms ett st&#xF6;d till en tredje runda av TZAW vara relevant. Den tredje rundan kommer att inneb&#xE4;ra en v&#xE4;sentlig &#xF6;kning av det f&#xF6;rv&#xE4;ntade antalet m&#xE4;nniskor som ska &#xF6;ka sina inkomster som en f&#xF6;ljd av projekten.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Africa Enterprise Challenge Fund (AECF) is a multi-donor funded financing facility aimed at stimulating private sector driven innovations to improve market systems for enterprises in agribusinesses, renewable energy, and finance. It makes the markets work profitably better for the poor in the rural areas in Africa and stimulate further investments by private sector entrepreneurs. The Fund awards grants and non-recourse loans to projects focused on agriculture, renewable energy and adaptation to climate change, and access to financial services and information, with the aim of improving households incomes and reducing rural poverty. Based on the poverty dimensions, to achieve the goal, AECF provides catalytic financial RESOURCES as matching grants for companies, selected through a competitive process. This promotes private sector innovations and investments in projects that create OPPORTUNITIES to the poor as employees, contract farmers, out-growers and/ or suppliers. 

Sida through the Embassy in Dar es Salaam bilateral strategy and the UK Department for International Development (DFID), now FCDO, has been co-funding the Agribusiness windows for rounds Two and Three (TZAW R2 &amp; R3). The total funding about amount for Round Two (R2) has been USD 4.55 million with proportion of 76% from DFID and 24% from Sida and USD 9.15 million for Round Three (R3), with 50% from each funder. The programme had 25 projects (8 for R2 and 17 R3) representing a mix of agribusiness enterprises in Tanzania.</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">In general, the reported results indicate that the progress towards the overall plan based on AECF core mandate is on track with minor deviation. The deviation was mainly caused by lack of flow of funds (investees interrupted drawdown) and policy and business environment related to agriculture in general. The interrupted investees drawdown was because the 2019 annual plan and budgets for both windows were not approved following the whistleblower alert with allegations of AECF&apos;s management weaknesses, which prompted Sida to commission an investigative special audit. As a result of Audit, immediate actions were taken and the medium to long-term action plan was agreed and are being implemented. The spending suspension was then lifted following the budget approvals in the last quarter of 2019 followed by a formal approval communication in January 2020.

Development Results 
It is reported that 2020, the TZAW challenge fund projects funder both rounds (R2 &amp; R3) had commercially reached 4,564,627 households translating to livelihood impact to about 22.8 million (assumption of approx. 5 people per household) with mean additional net benefit of US$ 400.48 and US$ 189.29 for TZAW R2 and R3 respectively. Regarding the jobs created as a result agribusiness challenge fund, the report shows that 773 and 1,361 total full-time equivalent jobs were developed for R2 and R3 projects respectively. The report flags Darsh Industries (tomato processing factory in Iringa) and Kagera Tea Co. Ltd as the high employer projects for the two rounds. On the other hand, Seed Co Tanzania Ltd and Sibesonke Ltd. contributed 99.26% and 99.02% of the total households reached for R2 and R3 projects. The Seed Co Tanzania Limited reached a large number of households given its nature of business, which includes the growth of distribution points and training of agro-dealers and agronomists and developing demo plots. Sibesonke was successful because the company could add more features to its mFarming solutions for crop buyers, especially for export-oriented traders. The total number of smallholder farmers using mFarming features has grown to over 4 million by 2020, resulting in improved farm productivity and profitability.
Business models Replication
 It is reported by TZAW grantees that other businesses (and entrepreneurs) has begun to show interest to copy their models, which provides a more considerable potential to change a market system. The TZAW team expects that replicating successful and innovative models will allow for broad change across the market. Some examples are cited: (i) The Real IPM model that introduced bio-pesticides to counter chemical pesticides and improve plant diseases resistance has seen some entrants on the same model, emphasizing expanding to more value chain. (ii) more companies are entering the export vegetable and fruit market after companies like Rungwe Avocado and recently Olivado model proved to be critical to the growth and sustainability of the value chain in the Southern highlands of Tanzania and (iii) other buyers start to buy cocoa copying Kokoa Kamili model.
Copying good practices is also reported at farmers level as they begin to see the neighbors successes using the practices from TZAW projects. Examples are cited from Kilimanjaro where farmers are beginning to grow more avocados due to the presence of reliable off-taking enterprises like Africado.
Crowding in
Other goods and services businesses are tapping into opportunities created by the challenge fund projects. For instance, food vending, which is dominated by women, provide catering services in areas of TZAW facilitated projects which has employed high number of workers. In financial market, some lending institutions are also showing interest in funding groups of farmers who are contracted by TZAW investees. TADB and CRDB banks are reported to have moved closer to farmers and are providing credits to farmers group that have contracts to supply avocado to Olivado. Logistics markets also have been seen to emerge. For example, in avocado value chain, logistics companies have been attracted as the volume of products that needs transporting.

Challenges &amp; Lessons Learnt:
&#x2022; The challenges and Future of repayable grant funds: The report shows that as of December 2020 (the end of implementing period), the TZAW programme had disbursed US$ 9.069 million in repayable grants. However, and the total cumulative repayment was only US$ 1.025m from 9 investees. Collections are below the target as most of the companies have been struggling to cope with the new changes in regulatory issues including taxation, and also more recently, the effects of Covid-19. Furthermore, few of the businesses have not been performing well and there is a low chance of recovering these loans. Because the TZAW implementation period and grant agreement have coming to an end, dialogue between the Embassy and AECF regarding the collection and management to repaid grant will be required. In addition to the AECF initiatives to improve the collection of loans, among the reported remedial actions is to recommend to AECF Programme Management Committee (PMC) for write off where there are no prospects of recovering the loans.
&#x2022; Commercializing agriculture requires patience to allow time for uptake by farmers and reach a commercial scale. A number of the challenges hinder the projects that depend on out-growers.  For instance, farmers are susceptible to markets and prices uncertainties. If the markets are not transparent, they immediately switch to other crops or projects with promising markets and prices.
&#x2022; Unpredictable and unreliable rains and lack of knowledge on Good Agricultural Practices (GAPs) which prompted the need to strong Technical Assistance (TA)
&#x2022; Regulatory challenges caused uncertainties and delays in investing in agribusinesses.
&#x2022; The COVID-19 pandemic delayed some investees operations. For example, the procuring of necessary equipment for some projects for Ruaha Farm Limited. The pandemic slowed down purchasing equipment for honey processing plants and laboratories, limiting the completion of the targeted milestone.
&#x2022; Financing model (matching grants): Some contracted projects struggled to raise matching funds for disbursement. Delaying in the implementation of planned activities risks losing farmers as many of them are not patient.</narrative>
