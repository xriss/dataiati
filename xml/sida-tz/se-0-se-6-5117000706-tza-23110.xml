   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Zanzibar Energy Sector Support (ZESS) project, which was formed based on an intergovernmental support on the energy sector between the Government of Sweden and the Revolutionary Government of Zanzibar is currently in its consolidation implementation phase.
The overall objectives of this project are to improve competence and processes for Zanzibar Electrcity Supply Corporation (ZECO) Staff in all Departments, improve the capacity of Zanzibar Utilities Regulatory Authority (ZURA) to carry out economic regulation of the electricity sector. In order to make this objective concrete and measureable, the target outcome is to ensure that, by the end of the program, ZURA has developed the capacity, knowledge, tools, systems and procedures to effectively set end-user tariffs of ZECO.
ZESS Project consists of three types of support; (1) Technical assistance, (2) Training/Capacity development for the Department of Energy and Minerals (DoEM), Department of Planning, Policy and Research (DPPR), Zanzibar Utilities Regulatory Authority (ZURA) and ZECO staff; and (3) Procurement of pre-paid meters and critical equipment. The Project is underpinned by an inter-governmental agreement between Sweden and Revolutionary Government of Zanzibar (RGoZ), which provides for up to about Swedish Kronor (SEK) 53.6 million including Sida monitoring costs to sustain program results.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="SV">Insatsen syftar till att skapa f&#xF6;ruts&#xE4;ttningar f&#xF6;r ekonomisk och socialt h&#xE5;llbar utveckling p&#xE5; Zanzibar genom att f&#xF6;rb&#xE4;ttra s&#xE4;kerhet och tillg&#xE5;ng till elektricitet genom att st&#xE4;rka den organisatoriska kapaciteten och ekonomin hos tre statliga akt&#xF6;rer inom energi sektorn p&#xE5; Zanzibar.

Zanzibars elsektor har under en l&#xE4;ngre tid haft problem med elavbrott, tekniska och icke tekniska f&#xF6;rluster, elpriser som inte reflekterar kostnader f&#xF6;r ink&#xF6;p och distribution. Det statliga elbolaget och de statliga myndigheter som &#xE4;r satta att reglera sektorn har en begr&#xE4;nsad kapacitet att f&#xE5; bukt med problemen. 

2003 bad Zanzibars regering Sverige om hj&#xE4;lp att adressera de problem som energi sektorn upplevde. Ett trestegsprogram som angrep policy, organisatorisk kapacitet och tekniska f&#xF6;rb&#xE4;ttringar utformades och en f&#xF6;rsta fas genomf&#xF6;rdes mellan 2007 och 2010. Resultaten av denna f&#xF6;rsta fas var positiva. Bland annat minskade de tekniska f&#xF6;rlusterna fr&#xE5;n 33% 2008 till 24% 2014, och de icke tekniska f&#xF6;rlusterna minskade med 40% och elbolaget ZECOs inkomster &#xF6;kade fr&#xE5;n 2.8 miljarder TSH per m&#xE5;nad till &#xF6;ver 5 miljarder TSH per m&#xE5;nad under samma period . Dessutom har en rad reformer inom sektorn genomf&#xF6;rts och den organisatoriska kapaciteten har st&#xE4;rkts med resultat att b&#xE4;ttre styrning och kontroll av sektorn bidragit till energisektorns f&#xF6;rm&#xE5;ga att leverera tj&#xE4;nster till slutanv&#xE4;ndare p&#xE5; ett effektivt s&#xE4;tt. 

En ans&#xF6;kan om st&#xF6;d f&#xF6;r en andra fas med titeln &quot;Zanzibar Energy Sector Programme Consolidation&quot; inkom till Sida i oktober 2013 och har som m&#xE5;l att 1) st&#xE4;rka kapaciteten och verksamheten hos Department of Energy and Minerals (DoEM) och dess roll att koordinera energisektorn 2) F&#xF6;rb&#xE4;ttra elbolaget ZECOs finansiella kapacitet och 3) bidra till mer h&#xE5;llbar energianv&#xE4;ndning p&#xE5; Zanzibar 

Konsolideringsfasen har en budget p&#xE5; 47 miljoner svenska kronor och &#xE4;r t&#xE4;nkt att genomf&#xF6;ras under fyra &#xE5;r med start h&#xF6;sten 2014.</narrative>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The development objective of the intervention is to create conditions for economic and social development in Zanzibar by improving reliability and access to electricity through strengthening organizational and financial capacity of three public entities in the energy sector in Zanzibar.
Zanzibar&apos;s power sector has for a long time had problems with power cuts, technical and non-technical losses, tariffs that do not reflect the costs of power purchasing and the operation and maintenance of the electricity distribution system. The state-owned power utility and the government agencies who are supposed to regulate the sector have a limited capacity to overcome the problems.
In 2003, the Revolutionary Government of Zanzibar asked Sweden for assistance in addressing the problems experienced in the energy sector. A three-step program that covered policy, organizational capacity and technical improvements was designed and a first phase was implemented between 2007 and 2010. The outcomes of this first phase were positive . Among other things, technical losses were reduced from 33 % in 2008 to 24% in 2014 , and the non- technical losses decreased by 40% and the power utility ZECO&#x2019;s revenue grew from 2.8 billion TSH per month to over 5 billion TSH per month during the same period. In addition, a number of reforms in the sector were implemented and the organizational capacity has been strengthened with the result that better management and control of the sector contributed to the energy sector&apos;s ability to deliver services to end users in an efficient manner.

A request for support for a Consolidation phase titled &quot; Zanzibar Energy Sector Programme Consolidation&quot; was submitted to the Swedish Embassy in October 2013 and aims to: 1 ) strengthen the capacity and operations of the Department of Energy and Minerals and its role to coordinate energy sector 2 ) improve the power utility ZECO&#x2019;s financial performance, and 3) contribute to more sustainable energy use in Zanzibar.

The Consolidation phase has a budget of 47 million Swedish kronor and is intended to be implemented over four years starting in Autumn 2014.</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">The ZESS project saw a high level of activity in July 2018 - June 2019, with good progress being made on most work-packages. In 2019, ZESS Project has gradually moved into a new phase, focused operations and on-the-job training to ensure the sustainability of the project outputs, as well as targeted external training. The Project is on track to deliver all targeted outputs and make good progress towards key outcomes by December 2019. Below is the summary of the results that have been achieved, both expected and unexpected based on the sub-projects; ZECO Leadership and Corporate Culture; The overall objective of the activities undertaken this sub-project is directly tied to the target Project outcome of &#x201C;improving the financial performance of ZECO&#x201D;. A prerequisite for improving the financial performance of ZECO is to have leadership and a corporate culture in support of the utility&#x2019;s key business priorities. With focus on leadership and corporate culture, this Sub-project support strengthening of the financial performance. The Leadership and Corporate Culture Subproject continues to make significant progress particularly in Management Training and ZECO Culture. The Corporate Culture Workstream continues to progress with teams supporting specific initiatives being addressed within ZESS project. Improving ZECO Operations; An effective Operating Model defines the relationships and interactions that need to exist i) internally between ZECO departments and ii) externally between ZECO and its trading partners (suppliers and customers). In a holistic way, an Operating Model defines how a business works through people (organization and skills), processes and IT systems to cost effectively deliver customer value via an agreed strategy. For ZECO, the Operating model needs to deliver customer value that maximizes revenues at lowest total operating cost. The Program of work identified within the Operations sub-project is intended to holistically address high impact shortfalls within the current ZECO Operating Model. Improvements in these key areas will show significant improvements in revenue generation, loss reduction, stock-outs and power outage duration as well as lower costs and working capital requirements. &#x2013; Procurement Unit Development The Project Consultant and ZECO Staff continue to make significant progress in both Capacity Development as well as adoption of Lean Processes using SAP. Significant strides have been made in three areas in particular:1). Issued Framework Agreement Tenders for three largest purchase groups; Poles, Meters and Transformers accounting for more than 50% of ZECO annual purchases. The Framework agreements will free up significant time of procurement and management team by reducing the level of emergency tenders and allowing a small set of suppliers to better and more responsively supply ZECO2). Coached by TANESCO on adoption of 3 Year Framework Agreements. &#x2013; Although Framework agreements are new to ZECO, they have been used in private sector for decades. One of the key challenges of Framework Agreements in the public sector is compliance to Procurement Regulations. Consequently, ZECO reached out to TANESCO for coaching on how to tender Framework Agreements for Poles, Transformers and Meters while complying with Procurement Acts3). Project Consultant provided ongoing support in the procurement of AMR Meters. - Consultant has been working with ZECO Legal, Commercial, IT, and PMU to finalize the contract and commercial terms. - Commercial Department Development Customer Registration to Meter Installation (Customer Connection) change plan has been agreed with ZECO management and includes changes to process, technology and policies. During the reporting period progress was made in areas to further improve performance whilst providing controls on performance. Specific achievements include: &#x2022; Designed, developed and deployed a of standard SAP Dashboard that graphically shows Connection Performance as below, ZECO will be able to monitor performance within SAP at any time&#x2022; Agreed to pilot an SAP mobile App that allows installation jobs to be closed on the engineer mobile phone upon completion thereby saving another 2 to 4 days in the installation process-The Customer and Complaints Management (CCM) process is undergoing a complete overhaul following the Contact Center pilot period. The lessons learned from the pilot period are extensive and have identified that the ZECO participants in the CCM are wide ranging. During the reporting period ZESS project continued to see advancements in CCM including: &#x2022; Implementation of New Avaya Phone System that allow for up to 15 customer calls to be taken in parallel as opposed to single phone line&#x2022; Extending mobile phones across all emergency teams on Unguja including North and South teams&#x2022; Training was carried out by an AIL on the team with deep experience in the mobile applications &#x2022; Creation of CCM KPI Dashboard (below) which will allow job resolution performance and ticket creation and closing analysis by Island, by dept and by engineer.&#x2022; Eliminated use of engineer personal emails (gmail, yahoo, hotmail, etc) and set up ZECO department emails to simplify job assignment and closing to a zonal team and not an individual - Geographical Information System (GIS) During the reporting period there was continued advances in developing and deploying GIS Capacity. The activities carried out included:&#x2022; Designed the integration of GIS location capture into New Customer Survey visit using mobile phone&#x2022; Mapped substations into GIS&#x2022; Augmented attribute data for many assets including transformer&#x2022; Worked with SAP and ESRI to develop and integration between SAP and ESRI allowing a paperless survey that collects Bill Of Material and GIS (Lat/Long) coordinates -Financial Management System ( Systems Applications and Products (SAP) Adoption. The FMS initiative is focused on greater adoption of SAP across ZECO for key financial areas. Practically, the Project Consultant and ZECO staff have created a focus on revenues and costs. Therefore, the focus of SAP enablement is on: Revenues from Customers, Payments to Suppliers, Payments to Employees, Recording of Fixed Assets, and Management of Inventory Although adoption was progressed in some areas, specific areas remained slow to progress, specifically: Bank Reconciliations, Fixed Assets, and Financial Statements. Consequently, during the reporting period saw ZECO revisit training in the above three areas. Based on the training, ZECO is undertaking reconciliations on a daily basis as well as completing the Fixed Asset registrar to upload into SAP. With the updating of the Fixed Assets and Bank Reconciliations, ZECO have targeted to recreate FY 18 financials in SAP. DoEM Energy Sector ManagementThe overall objective of this sub project is directly tied to the project target outcome of &#x201C;increase the capacity of DoEM to coordinate the energy sector within an adequate legal sector framework.&#x201D; This is being addressed through the following approaches: Training, both formal and on-the-job trainings, Improvements to the energy management process, and Strengthening of the legal and policy framework. This includes the ongoing revision of the Zanzibar Energy Policy (2009) and preparation of the new Energy Act. Overall, good progress is being made under this sub-project, with all out-puts delivered or near finalization; - &#x201C;Strengthening DoEM and DPPR through training&#x201D;, DoEM and DPPR personnel have participated in a number of important trainings under ZESS project in the course of the reporting period, including ZESS week and the one week Managing Power Sector Reform and Regulation in Africa course at the University of Cape Town.- Coding and design of the webpage and database based on DoEM comments and suggestions was completed in Q3 2018 but operationalizing the data collection and in-put procedures has unfortunately proved challenging. In the course of reporting period more training has been given to ensure high-quality data collection. However, in order to ensure that the data collection routines actually work as envisioned, the database will not be launched before Q4 2019.- &#x201C;Energy Policy Update&#x201D; was closed in Q4 2018, with the submission of a final draft report to be considered by Cabinet.Under WP13, the final zero draft of a new Energy Bill was submitted by the Consultant in July 2019.- The Solar Rapid Assessment was finalized based on stakeholder comments, and submitted to the Client in Q2 2019. Technical Investments and Environmental ManagementThe overall objective of this sub-project is directly tied to the project outcome of improving the financial performance of ZECO. This has been addressed through activities related to: (i) Procurement assistance for equipment that will contribute to reduced commercial and technical losses, improved metering accuracy, as well as strengthen ZECO&#x2019;s capacity to remedy system faults in a timely manner. And (ii) Identification of environmental risks and impacts of ZECO&#x2019;s operations as basis for improved business processes and performance. Significant progress has been achieved during the reporting period on Procurement of Technical Investments of six (6) procurement lots. Many have been received and already commissioned. &#x2022; 17,500 pre-paid meters (Lot 1 &amp;amp; 2) have been delivered to ZECO. More than 3,000 meters have been installed and commissioned to date within the Post-Paid to Pre-Paid Initiative. There were technical fault issues with first 400 but the supplier came from China to resolve. ZECO expected to complete the installation in May 2020 leaving only 500 Post Paid Customers versus over 18,000 at project launch&#x2022; 3,000 Prepaid Three Phase Meters (Lot 3) have been delivered to ZECO and installation is being planned.&#x2022; The Test Bench (Lot 5) has been delivered to ZECO. The supplier will carry out training in November 2019&#x2022; The cable fault detection equipment has been commissioned and ZECO trained. It is now in use. ZURA Economic RegulationThe overall objective of this sub-project is to improve the economic regulation capacity at ZURA, and more specifically put ZURA in a position to receive tariff applications, carry out tariff reviews and approve end-user tariffs of ZECO.The Sub-project is progressing well, and according to plan. Given that the work under Addendum 2 only started in September 2018, it is natural that a few tasks remain for execution in Q4 of 2019. Since September 2018, the Resident Advisor (RA) to ZURA is in place in a 70 percent position. During the reporting period the Resident Advisor focused on preparation of regulatory tools (rules and regulations) under the ZURA Act, supported the drafting of the new Energy Bill, and facilitated the ZURA Strategic Plan Review. He also planned and facilitated the three-day ZURA Study Tour of the Mainland Power System to learn more about how Zanzibar is supplied with electricity, and a training in Strategic Planning for regulators. He works closely with ZURA management and provides on-the-job-training as well as dedicated training sessions to a number of ZURA staff. Several trainings in regulatory economics has been given in over the course of reporting period. The final ZECO Cost of Service study reports were submitted early in June 2019, and ZURA is working to follow it up with ZECO. During the reporting period the work and training on regulations, standards and procedures was progressing well, largely lead by the Resident Advisor. Licensing procedures/regulations had already been approved, and draft tariff setting regulations are being finalized. Board Mentoring session conducted by professor Anton Eberhard from the University of Cape Town in early July 2019, and at the end of Q3 of 2018, two ZURA Board Members participated in the one week Managing Power Sector Reform and Regulation in Africa course at the University of Cape Town. Work on the Customer Complaint Management component, as well as review of the ZURA Strategic Plan was started in July 2019 as planned and is foreseen to be completed in Q4 of 2019.</narrative>
