    <narrative xml:lang="EN">General question: Results related to the intended outcome 2015Question: Summarise results related to the intended outcome (this information will be sent to Open Aid)Answer: TMEP was an SRHR project ( 2010- 2015) that targetted mainly men from the age on ten years onwards. The project strategically focused on male involvement so as to promote sexual and reproductive Health rights for both men and women. TMEP used methods developed by RFSU and lessons learnt to stimulate critical dialogue on sexuality, SRHR, gender and male involvement and participation. The key achievements related to the intended outcome include:
1) Project sites continued to record significant SRH service utilisation and this indicated sustainability of the project interventions.
2) Continued support to the Reproductive and Child Health section ( RCHS) of the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare to integrate gender, sexuality and male involvement in Policy Guidelines for SRH Services Provision and Training and in the new national training curriculum for Health workers covering Male Involvement in Reproductive maternal newborn Child and adolescent Health services.
3) Partnering with media, training journalists and mentoring to the emerging SRHR media network ( TAMENET-SRHR). Press club members and editors from print and Electronic media were trained on gender, SRHR and its reporting and rationales for male involvement.
4) Various legacy documents were finalised to promote sustainability of TMEP concepts and practices after the end of the project. This includes: a training resource guide, a guide for youth clubs focusing on SRHR, a guide for journalists reporting on SRHR, a write-up of practical guidance on how TMEP was implemented and a video documentary. 
5) Ward development committee members were guided in the development of ward specific sustainability plans that identified zero cost activities that could be undertaken and associated monitoring and reporting mechanisms.
6) Towards the end of the project, the TMEP Secretariet formed an NGO to continue carrying out the project&amp;apos;s work, and hence the NGO TMEP in Development was created.

Over the course of the project life, several challenges were encountered but these did not hinder the achievement of project results. One challenge was that the project succeeded in creating demand for SRHR services but could only affect supply of services locally through quaterly Reviews and planning meetings with the Council Health Management teams ( CHMTs), and nationally through advocacy. In some instances, local authorities failed to meet increased demand and this created additional pressure on Health staff, Health facilities and commodity supplies.

Another challenge is that the government structures took a lot of time to incorporate TMEP interventions into their development plans, or there were resource constraints that hindered local councils from taking over project activities. Allied to this the projects main NGO implementing partners failed to develop strong sustainability capacity to take the work forward. Therefore, towards the end of the project when sustainability was top priority, the Secretariet shifted its attention to building the capacity of community structures within the local communities. Ward Development Committees took over the coordination of on-going activities at limited cost.

Towards the end of the TMEP project, the key lessons include:
1) Men have unmet need for SRHR information and services but often do not seek or manage to access what they need, henec the importance of undertsnding men as clients.
2) Increased access to SRHR information and services for men seems to lead to unloking increased access for women, i.e. importance of understandiing and targetting men as partners.
3) Men are better convinced to access SRHR information from their fellow men i.e. need to utilise the potential for men as agents of change.
4) It is vital for young men and women to undertsnd their SRHR rights andbe able to access the SRH services they require- male involvement and SRHR work should target young men as well as adults.
5) For sustainability, community structures and beneficiaries need to be engaged, as well as government and Health system stakeholders and structures.
6) As duty bearers it was important for government officials to understand SRHR and gender concepts together with implementing partners and community members ( rights holders) in order to ensure prioritisation of SRHR in development plans.

Overall conclusion is that the project has contributed towards an increased understanding of  how to successfully handle and change; practices and attitudes that have been hindering access to Sexual and Reproductive Health Rights to all.</narrative>
