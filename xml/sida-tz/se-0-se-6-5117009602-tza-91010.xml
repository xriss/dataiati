   <narrative xml:lang="EN">AMDT&#x2019;s primary impact goal is to increase and sustain incomes and employment opportunities for poor women, men and young people in agricultural markets in Tanzania. The outcome goal is to enable the target group to take advantage of more inclusive, resilient and competitive market systems. During the five year period (2016-2021), AMDT&#x2019;s interventions will target 500,000 poor women, men and youth involved in smallholder agricultural production and in other agricultural on-farm and off-farm economic activities (trading, services, supply) as employees earning a wage or self-employed in agricultural MSMEs. 

To deliver its strategy, AMDT adopts a market systems approach (M4P), working through private and public stakeholders to address identified system constraints and introduce changes to agricultural market systems that have a high potential to benefit those living in poverty.

AMDT&#x2019;s interventions will focus on three value chains &#x2013; sunflower, maize and pulses.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The primary impact goal is to increase and sustain employment OPPORTUNITIES which will enhance the income (RESOURCES) generation for poor women, men and young people agricultural value chains in Tanzania. The outcome goal is to enable the target groups to take advantage of more inclusive, resilient, and competitive market systems.
AMDT&#x2019;s intervention logic starts from the premise that commercially incentivized market systems are one of the vital pathways to more sustainable and resilient approach in fighting against income (RESOURCES) and other dimensions of poverty. This is even more important for the poor rural based population, dependent on agriculture for their livelihood. Therefore, systemic change is required to allow the poor to&#xA0;sustainably gain &#xA0;from participating in the markets. This is based on approaches of making the markets (in agrarian dominated economy such as Tanzanian) to work for the poor (M4P).
AMDT is considered as a facilitator for M4P -a systemic development approach. It works through other institutions who are considered as Market Facilitators. The Co-facilitators works with stakeholders to identify systemic constraints in particular value chains, priorities/rank them and devise commercially/market driven solutions. In turn, the Market Facilitator identifies the ideal Market Actors (normally private sector enterprises,&#xA0; government agency, producer organizations such as cooperatives etc.) to intervene in changing the systems in Micro Small and Medium Enterprises owned by women, men and youth.&#xA0; The approach promises greater efficiency as market actors have a lasting commercial interest and can provide sustainable and quicker outputs through sustained market systems.&#xA0;This can include the &apos;spoke and hub&apos; model for the benefit of the productive poor smallholder farmers.
For example, the market for edible oil in Tanzania, AMDT has selected interventions in sunflower value chain: the demand is very high locally and in export markets. Several market constraints are identified and prioritized for which AMDT&#x2019;s M4P model is working on the market/commercially motivated solutions from various market actors (business enterprises and farmers). From the on-farm sunflower production, the constraints have been in improved seeds, mechanization and extension services while on post-harvest markets section of the value chain, aggregation and linkage logistics with the processors has been facing the challenges including disorganization. &#xA0;
Through its interventions,&#xA0;AMDT aims to deliver five key outputs:
1. Inclusive business models which address systemic constraints while exploiting pro-poor growth opportunities.2. Innovative pro-poor productive assets and services targeting constraints of a large majority of the poor.3. Improve coordination, knowledge, and practice of inclusive markets development or M4P approaches in agricultural markets in Tanzania.&#xA0;4. Enhance capacity for evidence-based dialogue and advocacy targeting inclusive business reforms. Increase availability and adoption of new or improved climate smart technologies and practices specifically targeting constraints faced by agricultural enterprise of the productive poor.
Whenever there is need, AMDT attempts co-invest with the stakeholders by provision of subsidy to de-risk and stimulate the functioning of essential market systems. For example to finance the establishment of demonstration plots for farmers to learn new technologies which consequently creates&#xA0;demand.</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">This is the assessment statement of AMDT&#x2019;s performance based on annual reporting, annual review meetings, and various communications up to June 2020, which highlights the status of implementation of annual plan and budget and the overall/cumulative 2017-2021 intervention milestones. The implementation was reported to be fairly achieved given the organizational and operational stress caused by staffing and COVID 19 consequences. The programme, fulfilled the mandate to strengthen systems and the exposure of beneficiries to more market OPPORTUNITIES and CHOICES inspite of the mentined challenges. It is reported that by the end of the FY 2019-2020, the overall M4P outreach to smallholder farmers totaled to over 120,000, out of which 87,000 havefully engaged into some form of commercial relationships with the market actors (agribusiness enterprises), thus providing an impression of sustainability. For simplicity, performance of the M4P programme during FY 2019-2020 is summarized in various selected key nodes of the value chains as follows:
1. Inclusive Business Models&#xA0;
Improved Seeds Market:&#xA0;&#xA0;Unreliable supply of improved sunflower seeds was identified as one of&#xA0; major constraint in sunflower value chain. AMDT continued the momentum around availability and accessibility of improved sunflower seeds across the country. As a result of the intervention, hybrid seeds are now multiplied locally. Eleven new seed varieties have come on the market, and the respective seed companies plan to expand seed production. As a result, the competitiveness has improved and farmers were exposed to more CHOICES of seed varieties, depending on the agro-ecological zones, and at relatively lower prices up to an average of 60% of the of imported varieties. Following the coordination and engagement with private seeds companies, the government institutions: Agricultural Seed Agency (ASA) and Tanzania Agricultural Research Institute (TARI) are projecting seed production and availability to increase from 1,265 metric tons in FY 2018&#x2013;2019 to potentially up to five times this amount in FY 2020&#x2013;2021.
Post-harvest, markets: Off-takers continued to engage a limited number of farmers organizations in both maize and sunflower, but this is largely on their own (motivated by commercial benefits as supposed to be). This imply that the business case on some of the models and solutions being tested in the maize and sunflower value chains are beginning to take root. For instance as a result of adopted high yielding sunflower seed with high oleic value, and the well-known nationwide shortages on cooking oil, farmers in some areas have manifested the un-expected positive response to the market OPPORTUNITIES: They altered the ordinarily practiced supply chain that follows farm-gate (producer) selling the yield to middlemen (aggregators) who either process themselves or sell to processors to farmers by adding value themselves through semi processing and selling the oil and cake to retail/wholesale refineries and/or cake aggregators respectively. This enable farmers to benefit more from the high oil content sunflower seeds by retaining higher percentage of gross margin. Moreover, efforts to develop and reach the niche markets for sunflower organic cake is taking shape after the private sector partner in the Dodoma project was issued with organic certificate covering 19,000 smallholder farmers. It is hoped that during the 2020/2021 crop buying season, processing and export will take place and certified farmers will earn premiums from their work, thus increasing income.
2. Innovative pro-poor productive assets and servicesProductive RESOURCES: Some financial institutions, working with the agro-inputs market actors that AMDT has been engaging, have provided loans to some farmers cooperatives which was previously supported by AMDT in FY 2018 &#x2013; 2019. Notably, NMB Bank has extended loans to market actors in sunflower through a TADB Bank loan Guarantee in Southern Highlands (Mbeya). Input suppliers also show interest entering into contracts with organized producer organizations to supply inputs on credit or cash. This shows mutual commercial benefits: the inputs suppliers get an easy bulk customer in the organized producer organization and farmers on the other hand benefit the from low prices through bulky procurement and the extension services (explained below).
3. Improve coordination, knowledge, and practiceExtension Services capacitates the poor farming households with key RESOURCE-Knowledge and skills on sustainable production methods to increase efficiency and productivity.&#xA0; Seed companies, lead farmers and government agronomists and extension staff are providing extension to sunflower and maize smallholder farmers. There are signs of crowding-in and hence sustainability of this model even outside the AMDT&apos;s selected value chains (sunflower and maize). As a promotion strategy to create demand for their products (seeds, fertilizers etc.), there are agro-dealers who have been partnering amoto establish demonstration plots close to farmers organized by the AMDT M4P intervention and to provide extension trainings related to specific seed varieties and use of fertilizers and other inputs. Moreover, the service providers that AMDT has engaged with in testing ICT-based solutions for extension and market information services to farmers, are having their business models tested towards digitized platforms with a growing range of integrated business services like brokerage.
4. Enhance capacity for evidence-based dialogue and advocacy&#xA0;Withing the SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC and POLITICAL AND INSTITUTIONAL contexts, POWER AND VOICE is a key power relations&#xA0;ingredient in influencing markets and trading policies and other socio-economic rights. This is because commercial decision making and ownership as well as bargaining power depends on business and investments environment. While AMDT is working on the advocacy at national level, it has initiated the work of exploring the private-public dialogue mechanisms that will lead to increased participation of farmers and agribusiness emterprises especially at District levels. In FY 2019/2020 AMDT was able to initiate this in 30 of the 52 Districts where limited initiatives at District Business Councils. In addition, other advocacy groups such as Agriculture Council of Tanzania are now looking at AMDT as a credible institution to champion advocacy issues together.
The trust also has reported progress on gender and environnmental thematic areas, where the gender specialist was hired and integrated in technical operational team and the environmental policy was completed.</narrative>
