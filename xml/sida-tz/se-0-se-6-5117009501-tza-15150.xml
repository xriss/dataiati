    <narrative xml:lang="EN">General question: Results related to the intended outcome 2016Question: Summarise results related to the intended outcome (this information will be sent to Open Aid)Answer: Results are similar to those reported in 2015   During the cooperation period ALAT has considerably grown as an institution. As an organization ALAT remains unique and strategic in Tanzania as it represents all local governments in the country and can play a crucial role in promoting accountability and reform processes among LGAs. The Association has achieved a number of milestones related to advocating for LGAs needs. It still has great potential to better support LGAs, as a coordinator and disseminator of best practices. The Association is strategically positioned and could be an important player in reform processes in Local Economic Development, which is well aligned with its vision, mission and is one of its core responsibilities.   Implementation has not progressed as planned specifically in this phase-out support.  Among other objectives, the institutional support from the Embassy targeted the strengthening of ALAT&#x2019;s capacity for financial, organizational and project management. ALAT remains weak in this respect, in the absence of specifically designated staff. During the cooperation, this gap was bridged by having International Technical Assistance (TA) procured through the Embassy. This has however been unsustainable. ALAT was overly dependent on external consultants and TA to undertake its activities. In absence of consultants and TA, there is no required in-house capacity to contribute to strategic and operational leadership of the organization and its activities. This has affected both ownership and sustainability of capacity building efforts in the long run.   The limited capacity within the organisation has also limited the use of many recommendations on financial and programme management that ALAT has received from consultants and from various commissioned assessments. The strategic vision by ALAT&#x2019;s leadership on what the Association could do and deliver is still weak.   The Association faces difficulties in mobilising sufficient financial resources to meet its operational costs and implement some of its activities. Lack of own financial resources affects overall implementation of ALAT&#x2019;s Strategic Plan.  Management of CBNRM Projects In absence of technical assistance that was directly supporting and leading CBNRM projects, ALAT lacks the required capacity to efficiently plan, manage and report on the CBNRM projects. Management of these projects is out of ALAT&#x2019;s core focus areas under its Strategy. Management of CBNRM projects by ALAT was externally introduced by the Embassy and may have not necessarily been the best fit.   In managing CBNRM projects, ALAT became overstretched trying to perform different tasks and activities that are outside its core capabilities. With ALAT&#x2019;s limited human resources there was little room to effectively implement activities under CBNRM. However, an independent assessment by NIRAS commissioned by the Embassy showed that the four CBNRM organizations appeared to have independently used their resources effectively with good quality of work and results. Thus partnering or supporting them with a more capable partner would have provided a better chance of achieving their intervention objectives.</narrative>
