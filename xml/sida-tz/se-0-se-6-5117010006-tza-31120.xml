   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Tanzania Horticultural Association (TAHA) is an apex private sector member-based organization that advocates for the growth and competitiveness of the horticultural industry in Tanzania. TAHA signed a five-year (1st January 2017 - 31st December 2021) Grant Agreement with the Swedish International Development Agency (Sida) to implement a project named Support to TAHA Strategy (STS). In this cooperation, Sida provide a support of 43M SEK to TAHAs five years (2017-2021) Strategy which seeks to transform the sector into a more vibrant to become more inclusive and long-term economic benefits for poverty reduction and employment creation for the people of Tanzania. 
The contribution supports the implementation of ground activities in increasing knowledge in efficient and sustainable horticultural farming methods. The contribution also supports value chain coordination and other activities including market systems development for inputs, output and support services (collection centers, transport and handling logistics, insurance, packaging, and quality control etc.). TAHA also supported for their work in the nationwide business environment (Policy analysis with lobbying and advocacy) and important thematic issues (nutrition, and gender). The approach includes strategic partnerships and engagement, technology transfer and capacity building and promoting commercialization of the sectors value chains. The STS results therefore contribute to the overall Swedish bilateral strategy objectives (of inclusive economic development) by enhancing knowledge of in productivity, access to functioning markets, financial inclusion based on the four Key result areas: 
&#x2022;	Key result 1: Advocate for better business environment for the horticulture Industry. 
&#x2022;	Key result 2: Increase access to markets for Tanzanian horticultural products. 
&#x2022;	Key result 3: Improve productivity and competitiveness of the horticulture industry. 
&#x2022;	Key result 4: Enhance TAHAs effectiveness, efficiency, and sustainability. 
In operationalizing the support to TAHA Strategy, the organization closely integrates the Gender especially Youth &amp; Women Engagement, and Environmental Sustainability (Climate Smart horticulture). This is expected to further increase sustainability and inclusiveness and contribute addressing the various dimensions of poverty at institutional and individual levels: enhanced capacity to seize opportunities in horticultural sub-sector to generate income (resources) and enhance their power and voice to advocate for policies and conditions that will enhance the performance of horticultural value chain.</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">The specific performance on specific key performance areas is summarized below:

Improved policy and regulatory environment in the horticulture industry: TAHA has been on forefront holding policy engagements with agricultural non-state actors, chairing the Agricultural Council of Tanzania to identify, lobby and advocate for the removal of restrictive laws, regulations and taxes (disaggregated by national and Local Government Authority levels). In 2019, four issues were identified and presented to the government, which was very responsive by addressing them in the FY 2019/2010 national budget. The issues were:
1. Lack of efficient logistics systems and infrastructure as well as the impeding bureaucratic red tape by customs and other authorities for horticultural produce and other perishables has been major setback for Tanzania in accessing regional and International markets
2. Agriculture crop insurance was subjected to Value Added Tax charges hence make it more expensive and less affordable to farmers.
3. Excise and Custom duties on horticultural packaging materials and Customs duty on imported agricultural implements and technologies used in horticulture.
4. High fees charged by Occupational Safety and Public Health Authority (OSHA)

Increased access to markets for horticultural products: TAHA Market Information System (MIS) and direct linkages by marketing officers contributes in linking enterprises/individuals to local, regional and international markets or buyers. In 2019, 5,388 farming enterprises were linked to these markets. (the target was 1,600). TAHA also works with large-scale regional and international companies sourcing horticultural products from Tanzania. During the reporting period (2019), linkages with three companies were successful (the target was four). The income  secured as a results of  sales of  horticultural products from regional and international markets is reported to be USD 3.7 million from the target of USD 3.35 million.

Increased capacity for provision of logistics and market support infrastructure services: The most notable achievement is the public-private partnerships established between TAHA, the Government of Tanzania &amp; stakeholders to address trade facilitation and cold storage infrastructure needs at Songwe Airport, Dar es Salaam Airport and Dar es Salaam Port. As a result, the number of farming enterprises [including individual farmers] accessing the logistics, storage and other market infrastructure services increased by more than 100 above the set target of 3,000 in 2019. However, there is still a lot of work to be done in capacity building and awareness creation to staff in public sector responsible for transportation (road, airports and seaports) on the perishability of horticultural products, and the their contribution to the either potential success or failures on horticultural exports in the country.

Increased horticultural productivity and competitiveness: Productivity is anchored on maximizing yields in small area of land, using minimal costs,  minimizing post-harvest losses  as well as quality and marketing competitiveness to fetch the highest possible prices. TAHA is reporting the increase in annual productivity per acre for commonly produced value chains reaching 25% for onion and  44% for tomato from the 2019 target of 20%. The annual yields lost during the reporting period are reported to be decreases by 50 Percentage from the target of 45%. But this is also attributable to other Sida funded initiatives: challenge funds and guarantees which helped the enterprising in agro-processing e.g. Darsh Industries in Iringa, a tomato processor under AECF-TZAW who off-takes the smallholders tomatoes yield from TAHA established collection centers. TAHA also has a mandate to promote the international quality and quality standards and certification. As such, during 2019, the percentage annual horticultural exports that meet regional and international standards reached 44% from the target of 25%. 

Environmental sustainability, gender and youth inclusion, and nutrition: The organization has also established and is promoting the horticulture environmental code of conduct: The documents for promotion of Environmental Monitoring and Management Programme (EMMP) &amp; Pesticide Evaluation Report and Safer Use Action Plan (PERSUAP). At grassroot (producer) level Protocols to guide farmers compliance to environmental standards are being developed: A production manual with detailed information on compliance to environmental standards produced and distributed to Agronomists and focal farmers. Agrochemicals (pesticides) and the environment: Partnerships are established with authorities and input suppliers to facilitate access and registration of quality and health and environmentally safe inputs. Tanzania Pesticides Research Institute, Tanzania Agricultural Research Institute, Tanzania Bureau of Standards, Tanzania Revenue Authority, National Environment Management Commission , Pangani water basin, Rijk Zwaan, Seminis (Monsanto), Balton, Kibo seeds, Syngenta, Crop bioscience, East west seeds, Yara and Daymo. Youth and Women Empowerment: TAHAs own survey (statistics covering 2016 to 2019) indicates that the percentage of youth and women employed in the horticulture industry has increased. For example, despite the challenges in terms of access to, decision-making and control over resources by women and youth, during the reporting period 47% of the beneficiaries who received technical extension/ trainings were youth. Through MoUs with providers of technologies and support services such as Private Agricultural Sector Support (PASS), for credit guarantee and suppliers on greenhouses and irrigation technologies, TAHA is able to provide her members with sufficient bundle of services which attracts youth and women.</narrative>
