    <narrative xml:lang="EN">Union of Tanzania Press Club is a member based organization composed of press clubs across the country. Each press club in each region is registered separately but administratively report to UTPC. UTPC has a formal memorandum of understanding with press clubs to be able to manage relationship and operationalization.

UTPC and Press clubs.
UTPC presents a different pattern of achievements in its 2019 report submitted in 2020. UTPC seems to be progressing well on strategic side of things. It has recorded an income of 227,074,400 TZSH from different development partners for different projects that are within UTPC strategic plan. The mobilized fund is hosted at UTPC HQ but main use and operations will happen at press club level. It is worthy noting that whenever press clubs secure fund for activities from any donor, such fund will be hosted at HQ for reasons of accountability and compliance. The centralization of funds is for control purposes only in order to be able to distribute the funds based on needs and with reasonable size as UTPC continues to monitor assurance on good financial management practices at press club level.&#xA0; Embassy of Sweden assesses that, income flows to press clubs is an advanced step towards stabilizing and piloting the idea of press clubs being able to apply for fund and run programs on their own.

UTPC in their 2019 report also shows that press clubs are continuing to innovate their own means of survival. Several press clubs have bought land for potential office development in future. The fund for buying plots of land come from the income generated from stationary shops, hiring of equipment and press club revolving fund schemes. Almost all press clubs are reported to have internal generated fund that will assist with potential long term investment.
It is also reported that all press clubs receive their support cost on time to be able to run office operations smoothly. UTPC measures its performance by its ability to support and monitor press clubs timely. From 2019 report, press clubs are reported to have effectively and successfully delivered on their activities adequately. Such activities are like being able to meet as press club leaders, use internet services for reportage and repairing of journalists equipment.&#xA0;
On the same note 2019 reports that UTPC has witnessed more strengthening of old partnership and arrival of new ones. An organization called We World, Danish NGO which recently won a grant from EU for the project called New Voice has entered into partnership with Mtwara, Mbeya and Kigoma Press clubs to implement media interventions in the respective regions. There is also another international partner called international Media Service that has dialogue going on for possible press club funding. Embassy of Sweden assesses this progress as an indication of press club growth and UTPC&apos;s potential of becoming a multi donor organization in future.

UTPC and Journalists
It is also reported that membership fees contribution is turning not to be a huge challenge now as it was in the past. Embassy of Sweden assesses this change might be a result of UTPC demonstrating return on investment and UTPC increased ability to respond to press club needs on time. It is also reported that UTPC&#xA0; has tied membership fees to training participation; Unless membership is paid, a journalist will not attend to a selected training. 15m TZSH is reported to be collected in 2019 compared to 13m TZSH in 2018 . It is worthy noting that press club members who are journalist pay fees to UTPC through press clubs. As for member based organization, fees payment is a compulsory arrangement that will sustain membership in the organization.
It is also reported that more journalists have joined press clubs. There are now 1656 as opposed to 767 members registered in 2016 at the time new strategy implementation started. Of the 1656 journalists, 969 are women and 687 are men.

2019 report indicate that, there are more than 250 journalists who participated in various trainings including Human Right, Environment reporting. It is also reported that, women leadership training for women journalists has also taken place in Arusha region to empower women to take decision positions in media houses. The 2016 - 2020 strategy of UTPC has placed emphasis on development of women in media sector. UTPC and MCT started with research on women status on media and tailored training to promote women in to leadership position. According to UTPC and MCT it is only ITV and Radio one at national level media that has a woman at the top leading the organization. As one of the responses, UTPC had organized several leadership trainings to inspire women including the training that is reported in Arusha in 2019 report.</narrative>
