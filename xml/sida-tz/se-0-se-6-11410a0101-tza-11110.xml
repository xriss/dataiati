   <narrative xml:lang="EN">TENMET is an umbrella organization for more than 180 member CSOs. By virtue of being an Umbrella it naturally plays dual roles; first as secretariat (coordinating management) and second as a Network. Practially, TENMET has to strengthen itself as an institution and utilize its power base to potentially increase influence for its call for policy changes in education sector in Tanzania.
Below objectives defined TENMET purpose.
1. Buildng members capacity to be able to manage their organization and advocate for access and quality in education
2. Strengthen the secretariat as institution to be able to grow, expand and support its members to build a strong network
3. Conduct research and advocacy to inform and work with the government to develop new policies or guideline to improve education systems in the country.
In 2015, Embassy of Sweden signed an agreement with TENMET for two years (2015 -2017) to implement the above stated objectives. And later in 2017 as TENMET was transitioning to a new strategy period, Embassy of Sweden funded TENMET for six months (July 2017 - December 2017) to allow TENMET to explore for development of new strategy and conduct organizational capacity assessment that would feed in to the strategy development process.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">TENMET is an umbrella organization in education and is one of our key partners whose role is to strengthen member CSOs to be able to contribute in improving education quality in Tanzania. TENMET as the organization is also doing advocacy work and part of its sucess in advocacy was on influencing the government to take back its decision to include teacher education under NACTE which by the act of parliament No. 9 of 1977, is an autonomous body with a different set of functions, incompatible with teacher education. TENMET has 181 member organization spread all over Tanzania implementing education programes.

TENMET has approached Embassy of Sweden requesting transitional funds to support them operationally in the transit to the next strategic period 2017 - 2021. TENMET&apos;s agreement with Sweden ended in June 2017 and it is likely that Embassy of Sweden will support TENMET in future. The support during the transition period is likely to make TENMET better equipped to reach their targets for the next strategic period, which makes it is reasonable and relevant for Sweden to grant them transitional funds.</narrative>
   <narrative xml:lang="SV">TENMET &#xE4;r en paraplyorganisation inom utbildning vars roll &#xE4;r att st&#xE4;rka sina medlemsorganisationers kapacitet f&#xF6;r att f&#xF6;rb&#xE4;ttra utbildningskvalitet i Tanzania. TENMET &#xE4;r &#xE4;ven en viktig &quot;advocacy-akt&#xF6;r&quot; d&#xE4;r exempelvis organisationen lyckades influera regeringen att ta tillbaka sitt beslut att inkludera l&#xE4;rarutbildning under NACTEs &#xF6;versyn, vilket stod is strid med NACTES syfte. TENMET har 181 medlemsorganisationer som implementerar utbildningsprogram utspridda &#xF6;ver Tanzania.

TENMET har beg&#xE4;rt ytterligare medel fr&#xE5;n den svenska ambassaden som operationellt st&#xF6;d i TENMETS &#xF6;verg&#xE5;ng till sin n&#xE4;sta strategiska period 2017-2021. TENMET&apos;s avtal med Sverige gick ut i Juni 2017 och Sverige kommer sannolikt att st&#xF6;dja TENMET fram&#xF6;ver. Ytterligare finansiellt st&#xF6;d kommer sannolikt att g&#xF6;ra TENMET b&#xE4;ttra rustade att n&#xE5; sina m&#xE5;l f&#xF6;r sin kommande strategiska period, vilket g&#xF6;r det rimligt och relevant f&#xF6;r Sverige att st&#xF6;dja dem under denna &#xF6;verg&#xE5;ngsperiod. 

Denna f&#xF6;renklade insats &#xE4;r i praktiken ett till&#xE4;ggsbeslut som omfattar ovan n&#xE4;mnda ytterligare medel.</narrative>

This strategic plan provide an important area of focus from an operational perspective to a strategic platform for advancing network and TENMET influence in education sector in Tanzania.&#xA0;  Organizational Capacity Assessment-OCA TEN/MET commissioned an external Consultant to facilitate and carry out an Organizational Capacity Assessment (OCA) between the month of September and October, 2017. The aim of the OCA was: &#x201C;To assess whether TEN/MET is well positioned to manage and deliver effectively and efficiently it&#x2019;s new strategic plan 2017-2022, and find eventual areas of improvement for TEN/MET to build on in order to achieve its long-term strategic goals&#x201D;. The assessment provided wide recommendations ranging from governance, Human Resource Management (Staff size, skills and capacity, job descriptions and performance management system), Organizational Management:-Strategic planning, operational planning and financial management and sustainability. OCA also recommended to TENMET to review its salary scale.  Quality Education Conference (QEC) TENMET managed to organize Quality Education Conference (QEC) for 2017. The focus was on Extreme Social Inequalities and Quality Education for All. This conference was held from the 14th to16th Nov. 2017 in Dodoma. The conference brought together various education stakeholders from state, private sector and non-state actors (Civil Society Organizations-CSOs) working at different levels in Mainland Tanzania to discuss extreme social inequalities that affects achievement of quality education in the country and collectively chart a way forward on how to address it. The conference was officiated by Ministry of Education Science and Technology.&#xA0;The main objective of the conference was to develop strategies that would enable the government to end extreme social inequalities by providing quality education for all which will significantly contribute to the process of national development. Strengthening Coordination, Networking and Zonal Thematic mapping of TEN/MET Members During the refinement of five-year strategic plan for 2017-2022 to accommodate the paradigm shift for the coalition, TENMET conducted mapping of themes according to zones and priorities issues to be advocated for in each zone in the next five years. The aim was to ensure during the implementation of new strategic plan each zone will be concentrating on particular issues that is unique to their own constituency and address it accordingly with focus. To achieve this, a workshop was conducted zonal level (Northern Zone, Eastern Zone, Southern Zone, Lake Zone, Western Zone, Central Zone, Sothern Highlands and Dar es Salaam Zone) for thematic mapping for advocacy issues. Each zone identified a thematic areas and prioritize as per needs to be advocated for during implementation of five year strategic plan.</narrative>
