   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Sweden has been part of building up the Media Council of Tanzania from the outset, which fills an important democratic function in the country. The council is owned by the media itself and is a voluntary body the public can turn to in order to file complaints against media. MCT mediates, works with media ethics and advocacy work. This initiative supports a project aimed primarily at strengthening freedom of the press, freedom of expression and media ethics. Part of the project focuses on efforts to improve current and future media legislation in the mainland and Zanzibar. This work is being done in close cooperation with a number of national, regional and international partner organizations and networks, as well as in dialogue with the government on the mainland and Zanzibar. The second part of the project focuses on increased media professionalism and ethics of media and journalists. MCT wants to achieve this by continuing and increasing the promotion of self-regulation of media and the organization&apos;s mediation work, which will be made more widely known to the public throughout Tanzania.</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">According to 2018 annual report, MCT seem to have managed to align to its plan of work and implemented more than 80% of their targeted interventions. With a revised framework in our mind (moving from core - to program support), MCT performance for 2018 is assessed based on its abilities in advocating for media freedom and promoting demand for self-regulation within media sector. For outcome 1; Advocacy for repeal and review of anti-media laws. In 2018, according to the report, MCT together with other actors appealed for anti-media law at East African Court of Justice in Arusha. The judgement was in favour of MCT and if government will implement the court decision, Media sector will be free of all restrictive conditions that were imposed by Media service act of 2016. Embassy of Sweden assesses that as an important landmark in media landscape and view the judgement as a call for more advocacy from CSOs side to push and ensure government implements the court decision. In the same report, MCT has developed a compendium of media laws in one simple document to be used as tool kit for media actors&apos; to raise awareness on existing laws and challenges. The document was shared to all MCT stakeholders.&#xA0; MCT has also launched a Non- State actors support program in Zanzibar to build capacity for Zanzibar media to report on Gender based violence. Already 66 journalists are trained, 34 are women. Embassy of Sweden views the intervention as relevant as it seems to galvanize women issues in to development agenda. Outcome 3 Arbitration.&#xA0;MCT goal was to see that arbitration of complaints is improved and widely accepted by public and the media. According to the 2018 report, MCT performed 5 mediations for 5 complaints with various audiences. According to its annual report 2018, mediation and arbitration services are not only designed to mediate but also to train media actors to be self-regulating. The five mediated cases are; Bank M Vs Tanzanite Newspaper where the Tanzanite allegedly accused Bank M for money laundering. TOL Gas Vs Mwananchi where TOL Gas was accused of not paying its taxes to Rungwe and Buseko district council. Others are Rtd Brigadier Francis Mbena and Raia Mwema newspaper, Atlas Schools Vs Jamvi la Habari newspaper and Subhash Patel Vs Tanzanite Newspaper. As the main regulator in the media sector, MCT in 2018 reviewed and reprinted some of the tools related to promoting ethical coherence. The guideline on Teaching Media Ethics was reviewed and 1500 copies were to be submitted in 2019. Guideline on court reporting is another ethical tool MCT reviewed and 1500 copied were disseminated. Just to add more on MCT advocacy initiatives, MCT has also managed to continue one of its flagship project that is producing a book every year to show case media performance and quality in Tanzania (Media Report 2018). According to MCT annual report, this piece of work is expected to stimulate debate and policy actions at different levels of media sector in Tanzania. The preparation media report for 2018 was completed in December 2018 and its launch to happen in 2019. MCT is also claiming positive outcome by winning four court cases and these are; Mawio against government where the newspaper was banned and the court declared the ban as illegal because it did not provide an opportunity for the accused to be heard. Another one was Mwanahalisi against the government ban in which the newspaper won. Others are Raia Mwema newspaper and Mseto journalists. MCT is still continueing to track press of freedom violation by updating its violation register consistently. Press clubs are acting as focal contact for this tool to perform. For 2018 only, there were 46 press of freedom violations reported. The reported cases ranged from cyber crime, disappearance, threats and arrests. MCT does not only register but also follows up cases to ensure either mediation or prosecution takes place as required.</narrative>
