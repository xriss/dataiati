    <narrative xml:lang="EN">General question: Results related to the intended outcome 2015Question: Summarise results related to the intended outcome (this information will be sent to Open Aid)Answer: The main purposes with the budget support contribution was to contribute to the objectives of Tanzania&#x2019;s poverty reduction strategy, the MKUKUTA II, and to strengthening public financial management (PFM) systems. This concluding assessment will consequently focus progress and results with regard to MKUKUTA II implementation and with regard to PFM. Significant progress have been registered for both these areas.

The MKUKUTA II covers the period 2010-2015, while the Swedish contribution only covers the financial years 2013/2014 &#x2013; 2014/2015 (though the previous budget support operation covered the first half of the MKUKUTA II period). The support has been coordinate with other budget support donors. A final joint annual review to follow up on result until June 2015 was never held. There was a much-delayed review (11 months late) for the preceding year. The reason why the annual review meeting was never held for the last year was that the budget support process stopped working in the aftermath of the IPTL affair (a large corruption scandal in the energy sector). Hence, there was never any report on the budget support Performance Assessment Framework for the year 2014/2015 and no final annual review report. This concluding statement will therefore be based on the Ministry of Finance and Planning&apos;s (April 2016) final assessment of the implementation and results of the MKUKUTA II and on the external Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) Assessment report from 2017 (by Andrew Lawson, Finn Hedvall, Cecilie Thue Hansen and Gonzalo Contreras) taking stock of PFM progress since the previous PEFA Assessment in 2013. 

The MKUKUTA II review covers the three MKUKUTA clusters: Cluster I &#x2013; growth for the reduction of income poverty; Cluster II &#x2013; improvement of quality of life and social well-being; and Cluster III &#x2013; governance and accountability.
 
Cluster I - Growth for Reduction of Income Poverty  

During the period under review, GDP in real terms grew by seven percent or above with the exception of 2012 when it grew by 5.1 percent. The GDP growth however has not reached MKUKUTA II target of achieving and maintaining an 8-10 percent growth. Income poverty started to respond to economic growth. The proportion of Mainland population in basic needs poverty was 28.2 percent in 2011/12, down from 34.4 percent in 2007. Furthermore, 9.7 percent of the Mainland population was food poor in 2011/12 compared to 11.8 percent in 2007 though in aggregate, food production resulted in a Food Security Sufficient Ratio that generally remained above the target ratio of 100 percent throughout the period.

Under MKUKUTA II, prudent macroeconomic management has largely been achieved. This is also confirmed by IMF&#x2019;s periodic reviews. The main exceptions to the otherwise well managed monetary and fiscal policies being poor budgeting and the accumulation of government arrears. The rate of inflation has been fairly low, stable and close to target during the second half the MKUKUTA II. During the MKUKUTA II period, domestic revenue to GDP ratio exhibited a rising trend. It rose from 11.4 percent in 2009/10 to 13.6 in 2013/14 and it reached 14.0 percent in 2014/15.  The fiscal deficit before grants as a percentage of GDP has declined from 8.2 percent in 2009/10 to 4.5 percent in 2014/15. However, fiscal deficit after grants showed a fluctuating trend.  
 
Total export increased from USD 7,050.7 million in 2010/11 to USD 8,885.8 million in 2013/14 and reached USD 9,398.5 million in 2014/15. The improvement emanated largely from traditional and manufactured export goods, as well as travel and transportation receipts. Nevertheless, the current account balance recorded a widening deficit during the MKUKKUTA II period. 
 
There has been some progress in job-creation. Manufacturing Sector has been doing better in increasing job opportunity from 2010 to 2014. Cumulatively the number of people employed in manufacturing sector by 2014 reached 133,231 people, an increase of 21.6 percent from 2010. 
 
Cluster II &#x2013; Improvement of Quality of Life and Social Well-being  

Under this cluster, MKUKUTA II aimed at the following two cluster-wide broad outcomes:  
i. Enhanced capabilities, with particular focus on the poorest, people with disabilities, and other vulnerable groups; and  
ii. Reduced inequalities in accessing social and economic opportunities, across geographical areas, income groups, age, gender, and other groups.  
 
In ensuring equitable access to quality education, Tanzania records significant progress in some indicators; but major challenges are noted. The net primary school enrolment rate indicated a substantial progress in the last decade from 2003 (88.5 percent) to 2007 (97.3percent), following the introduction of the Primary Education Development Plan (PEDP) in 2001. However, Net Enrolment Ratio declined afterward (2008-2014) from 97.2 percent to 84.4 percent, indicating that about 15.6 percent of primary school age children were not attending school. MKUKUTA II target was 100 percent Net Enrolment Ratio by 2015.  The Percentage of Cohort Completing Standard Seven continues to increase. However, quality of education is a concern. Pupil teacher ratio in primary education has been improving since the past decade, from 1:58 in 2004 to 1:51 in 2010 and to 1:43 in 2014, which is close the government standard of 1:40. The Transition Rate from Standard Seven to Form One improved from 52.2 in 2011 to 55.5 percent in 2014. Tanzania has achieved gender balance in transition to secondary education. Net Enrolment Ratio in Lower Secondary Schools (Form One-Four) steadily increased from 6.3 percent in 2003 up to 36.6 percent in 2012. It then started declining afterward, down to 32.0 percent in 2014. This is shortfall to the MKUKUTA target of 50 percent.  
 
There has been substantial increase in qualified teachers in secondary schools, from 33,954 teachers in 2009 to 80,529 teachers in 2014. The standard norm of pupil teacher ratio of 1:40 in secondary education has been achieved.  Vocational Education Enrolment has been increasing. Between 2011 and 2014, the number of students enrolled increased from 104,840 to 164,077. The number of students enrolled in technical education increased by 136 percent from 49,185 students in 2009 to 116,160 students in 2014.  

Proportion of births taking place at health facility was 62 percent in year 2013/14 which is far from the target MKUKUTA II and HSSP III target of 80 percent by 2015.  Under-Five Mortality Rates continued to drop from 112 deaths per 1,000 live births in 2005 to 81 in 2010 and to 54 in 2013, achieving MKUKUTA target of 54 deaths per 1000 live births by 2015.  The maternal mortality rate has declined but is still unacceptably high at 454 per 100,000 live births.  
 
There has been progress in access to affordable clean and safe water; sanitation and hygiene. Water supply coverage in rural areas increased substantially, from 40 percent in 2013 to 55.5 percent in to 67 percent in June 2015. This surpasses the MKUKUTA II target of 65 percent by June 2015. MKUKUTA II also addressed issues of settlements and sustaining environmental quality. The percentage of households with decent housing rose from 55 percent in 2007, to 73 percent in 2012. The proportion of houses with land certificates increased from 5.86 percent in 2012/13 to 6.4 percent in 2013/14. The villages with land use plans increased from 1.4 percent in 2010 to 12.45 percent in 2014. The target for MKUKUTA II was to attain 40 percent by 2015.  
 
MKUKUTA II further contained strategies for providing adequate social protection and rights to vulnerable and needy groups. The results include the increase in the proportion of households with orphans who attend school 10.33 percent (2009/10) to 13.5 percent but regressed again to 9.0 percent in 2013/14. Male enrolment has been higher than female enrolment.  The proportion of children with disability attending primary school increased from 0.32 percent in 2009/2010 to 3.4 in 2011/12 is maintained this level in 2013/14. Throughout the review period, attendance is higher for males than for females.  The Productive Social Safety Net (PSSN) is intended to support one million extreme poor households comprising around five million people (approximately 10 percent of the total population). After a rapid scaled up, the programme had enrolled more than a million households in 2015.
 
Cluster III- Good Governance and Accountability  

MKUKUTA II interventions under this cluster aimed at achieving the broad outcomes in terms of good governance and the rule of law; accountability of leaders and public servants; democracy, and political and social tolerance; and peace, political stability, national unity and social cohesion.  
 
Achievements include increases in the number of institutions utilizing public resources according to the financial rules and regulations. Despite the achievement, challenges include the inadequate capacity with regards to International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS) and inadequate knowledge among practitioners in respect to the Integrated Financial Management System (IFMS).  During the period under review, all 163 LGAs were found to post their public budgets, revenue and actual expenditures on easily accessible public notice boards.
 
Corruption remains a challenge. Tanzania&#x2019;s Transparency International index score is relatively high compared to other countries in Sub-Saharan Africa. On improving gender balance, the proportion of women in senior positions in different levels of decision-making has increased from 33 percent during 2010/11 to 41 percent in 2014/15.  Progress has been made on dispensing justice. In order to reduce the number of prisoners in remand, time taken for arrangement of case hearing, especially the first hearing has declined from 120 days in 2010/11 to 65 days in 2014/15.

The PEFA Assessment of progress in PFM

Turning to the finding on PFM progress according to the independent PEFA assessment, the review team finds that receipts of government revenue in the period under the PEFA review have been consistently below the targets forecast in the approved annual budget. As a result, borrowing has been higher than planned, payment arrears have accumulated and substantial budget reallocations have had to be made to keep aggregate expenditure broadly consistent with resource limits. Performance has also been poor with regard to the consistency of domestic revenue collections with respect to budget forecasts but there was a clear improvement in performance in 2015/16, with collections of domestic revenue exceeding budget forecasts, and rising by 28.5 percent compared to 2014/15. The improvement came just after the activity period for the budget support and was a result of push by the new president, Magufuli, to close loopholes and increase collection. 

The area of budget execution is without doubt the PFM area of most weakness, as evidenced by the poor PEFA scores relating to cash management, control of payment arrears and commitment controls. At the same time, there have been important improvements in revenue administration, payroll controls and procurement management. The gains in these areas are effectively the &#x2018;pay off&#x2019; from long years of investment and capacity building in these systems. However, the continuing weaknesses in core aspects of PFM &#x2013; budget credibility, cash management, and commitment control &#x2013; threaten to undermine the value of these improvements. High levels of expenditure arrears and weaknesses in the monitoring of arrears have been persistent problems in Tanzania. However, the assessment points to a further deterioration since 2013, with the stock of arrears now hovering at around 10% of total expenditure.

With regard to transparency, significant improvements have been made in the quality of reporting on Central Government extra-budgetary operations. All extra budgetary units of Central Government now submit annual financial reports to the Accountant General and the CAG. However, there are signs of declining performance in two key aspects of transparency: in the comprehensiveness and quality of the budget documentation submitted to the Legislature and in public access to fiscal and budgetary information. There have been significant improvements in the monitoring of fiscal risks and contingent liabilities. 

The Auditor General continues to be an important and trusted part of the accountability chain of the public sector in Tanzania. Steady improvements have continued to be made in the coverage, quality and timeliness of external audit though the poor follow-up by the Executive of external audit recommendations remains an issue.</narrative>
