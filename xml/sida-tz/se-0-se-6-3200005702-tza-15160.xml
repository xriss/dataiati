    <narrative xml:lang="EN">General question: Results related to the intended outcome 2016Question: Summarise results related to the intended outcome (this information will be sent to Open Aid)Answer: The challenging context in which Pingos Forum has been implementing its activities has defined its approach and its involvement. Pingos Forum has been engaging itself in adressing a wide range of challenges. The mere fact  that there are limited organisations with similar capacity to adress the challenges facing pastoralists, hunters and gatherers has meant that Pingos forum has been receiving demands from the P&amp;HG communities to take up all sorts of issues. The organisation has extended itself both in terms of geographic scope and the issues it intends to address.

In terms of outcome results, Pingos Forum persistent engagement with  human rights issues, land rights and land conflicts, HIV/AIDS, Climate Change as well as other cross cutting issues has positioned  the organisation as a model institution articulating issues of its target audience who are mainly pastoralits, hunters and gatherers.
The following outcome results have been highlighted:

1) The many engagements of Pingos Forum initiated through media advocacy, research, fact finding missions, policy advocacy and awareness Creation have improved service delivery and empowered P&amp;HGs to proactively raise their concerns to relevant government authorities at the different levels of governance. Similar engagements at the international level where the organisation has observer status and as a working Group member on indigenous communities have raised the profile of P&amp;HGs thus creating recognition and identification of these Groups.

2) Pingos Forum has equally partnered with many institutions in implementing and carrying out the programme on human rights and good governance such as in the case of land rights in Loliondo where it partnered with NGONET, PALISEP and CRT. All of them being like minded CSOs 

3) The structured way in which Pingos forum is adressing the issues of P&amp;HGs at the local, regional and national level is being recognised by many stakeholders. Its involvement in the international level advocacy to present issues concerning pastoralists and hunter-gatheres has been pointed out as good progress and an achievement in bring vibility on human rights violations facing these communities.

4) The programme implementation approach in implementation and engagement of various stakeholders has made Pingos Forum create a constituency of like minded institutions including the government to work with. This is sited in its HIV/AIDS programme where it worked closely with government programmes responsible for such programmes in Longido, Kiteto, Mbulu and Morogoro.

5. In terms of Fact Finding Missions, a total of 22 fact finding missions were conducted in 8 regions to adress emerging threats of evictions, conflicts and related human righst abuses. These fact finding missions aimed at establishing facts, eividences and documenting the root cause of human rights violation that led to P&amp;HGs evictions, secure facts from affected communities, draw outcomes and way forward to adress the threats. The Missions have had considerable impacts and have helped to change government perception towards P&amp;HGs and reduce government negative  actions on the affected communities while also strengthening communities demands for the gocvernment to be accountable to its Citizens and exercise the the principle of fairness and equality in dealing with emerging conflicts and related confrontations between pastoralists and farmers or farmers and hunter gatherers.

6) The use of media as a tool for advocacy has been used extensively by the organisation. A particular example is where Pingos Forum has used the media proactively in adressing the land rights of pastoralists in the Loliondo Game Controlled Area. Through media advocacy, the public was made aware of the government intention to reduce the size of village land and its impacts. This led to the Government changing its position.</narrative>
