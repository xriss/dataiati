   <narrative xml:lang="EN">(i) Job creation: SMEs are the major sources of employment in Pakistan. Through the Fund&apos;s investment in SMEs, much needed growth capital will be injected into the system to foster employment creation. (ii) Access to finance: small and midcap companies are constrained by a lack of access to long-term, risk-oriented capital and institutional support. The Fund will provide long term risk capital, which is very difficult for the local SMEs to obtain. (iii) Introducing new sources of finance: Establishment of funds in the region introduces additional and complementary sources of financing to the financial markets which are largely dominated by banks. (iv)  Promoting sustainable growth: The Fund will play an active role in strengthening the SME&apos;s governance and transparency. Through hands-on involvement, operating efficiencies of the portfolio companies will be improved, thus promoting growth and sustainability.</narrative>
