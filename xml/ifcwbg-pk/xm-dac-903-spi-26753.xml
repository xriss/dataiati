   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The downstream steel project comprises the installation and operation of an integrated 280,000 tons per annum (tpa) cold rolled mill and a 150,000 tpa galvanizing plant in Karachi, Pakistan. The project also includes a captive 18 MW gas fired power plant which is operational and providing power to the national grid. The project would source steel, mainly hot rolled coil, in the competitive world steel market and process it further to make cold rolled coils and galvanized sheets primarily for roofing material. The project cost is estimated at $162 million, including $34 million working capital.   - Purpose of Project:   The project would establish the first privately owned galvanizing sheet plant in Pakistan that would domestically manufacture and substitute 75% of the galvanized sheet that is currently imported.  Pakistan imports 200,000 tpa annually or 80% of its requirements.  The imports of galvanized sheet into Pakistan are primarily made by individual traders in small quantities which is inefficient and leads to high costs to domestic consumers.  The projects large and modern manufacturing equipment will lead to lower costs to consumers, allow better matching of the market needs through customized products and achieve significant proximity advantage against imports through shorter lead times.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project will have a strong development impact by locally supplying galvanized sheets that are currently imported, savings over $35 million annually of foreign exchange.  Many houses in the coastal regions of Pakistan still use asbestos sheets for roofing, which represents health issues for the society, and which the project plans to replace with galvanized sheets. The project will benefit from the management expertise of a strong sponsor, who has significant technological know-how both in investment and production.  It will also create direct job opportunities, for about 500 employees, who will benefit training schemes. Given the limited number of listed companies in Pakistan, the successful IPO of the project will help strengthen the domestic capital market.</narrative>
