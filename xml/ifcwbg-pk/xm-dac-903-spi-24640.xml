   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Institute of Business Management (IoBM, the Institute) is a not-for-profit private sector institution in Karachi, Pakistan. IoBM first began as College of Business Management in 1995, after which IoBM was established in 1998 under an act approved by the Sindh Provincial Assembly. It currently operates in its purpose-built campus spread over 9 acres, and has about 2,800 full time students ranging from pre-college A-level, undergraduate, and post-graduate levels in various academic programs at three different Colleges: College of Business Management (CBM), College of Economics and Social Development (CESD), and College of Computer Science and Information Systems (CCSIS).   The Institute is undertaking an investment program to increase its present enrollment capacity from 3,000 to 5,400 students including about 800 school students, and provide support services to students as well as faculty members. More specifically, the project consists of:     -  the acquisition of up to 10 acres of land;    -  construction of a new college building for holding of classes;    -  construction of 50 apartments for faculty/staff members;    -  construction of a 1,200 seat auditorium; and    -  completion of on-going expansion activities.     The project, including contingencies, maintenance, and interest during construction, is estimated to cost $18.4 million and be implemented over a period of three years.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project will have strong development impact in the following areas:    Increasing access to high-quality tertiary education in Pakistan: Gross enrollment in tertiary education is about 3% in Pakistan (based on 2002 World Bank figures), ranking the country among the lowest in the world and putting it at a competitive disadvantage relative to other countries that are investing more heavily in the development of skilled human capital.  Enable the Institute to expand its financial assistance program to cover additional low-income students: IoBM rewards academic excellence among students through merit-based scholarships, in all, allocating up to 15% of its revenues to finance these activities.</narrative>
