   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project involves the drilling of up to an additional eight producing wells (four current exploration/appraisal wells will be converted to producers) and the construction of a 24 km gathering pipeline system and a gas processing plant.  All of the produced Bhit gas from the project will be sold at the plant boundary to Sui Southern Gas Company (SSGC), a government-owned gas transmission and distribution company.  A 42 km spur pipeline to be constructed by SSGC will transport the Bhit gas from the processing plant to SSGCs main trunk line.  SSGC will sell the gas to end-users in the Karachi region.    IFC has several major roles to play in this project: (i) IFC would provide long-term financing, which is not readily available in the country for a domestic gas project; (ii) By supporting this anchor project, IFC would provide assistance to the further development of Pakistans gas infrastructure, supporting a form of energy that is more environmentally friendly, more efficient and cost-effective than the alternatives; (iii) IFCs financing would enable LOPL to leverage its investment in the project thus facilitating the companys efforts to pursue other opportunities in the country; and (iv) IFCs financing would support the Governments initiative to maximise gas use in order to meet increasing demand and generate savings in foreign exchange.    The project has a number of important development impacts: (i) It will assist with the optimisation of Pakistans energy potential because it will develop Pakistan&apos;&apos;s gas reserves in order to help satisfy the countrys net demand for energy; (ii) The project will help reduce the countrys dependency on imported fuel oil; (iii) The government will benefit from about US$394 million in royalties, taxes and other revenues which represent about 23% of the total project revenues; and (iv) The implementation of the project will provide employment of about 1,500 people during construction and about 200 people during operation.</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Bhit field, which covers an area of about 248 sq km, is located in the foothills of the Bhit Mountain about 40 km west of Sehwan, the closest town, and 150 km north of Karachi in the Sindh province.  The area, which is one of the poorest regions in Pakistan, is typically hot, arid and classified as a desert.  Only small amounts of the project area are cultivatable outside of monsoon conditions and there is very little vegetation and it has been used as grazing land for hundreds of years.</narrative>
