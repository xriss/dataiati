   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Star Hydro Power Limited (SHPL or the Company) is in the process of developing a 147 MW run-of-the-river greenfield hydroelectric power plant,  on a Build Own Operate and Transfer (BOOT) basis, situated in part on the Kunhar river,  which  marks the border between Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) and the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province of Pakistan (KP) and in part on the Jhelum river in AJK (the Project). AJK is the Pakistan-administered portion of an area over which India and Pakistan have been in dispute since 1947. By supporting the project, IFC does not intend to make any judgment on the legal or other status of any disputed territories or to prejudice the final determination of the parties&apos; claims.
The Project, expected to generate about 632 GWh of energy per annum, will sell all of its output to National Transmission and Dispatch Company (NTDC), Pakistans state-owned single buyer, under a 30-year Power Purchase Agreement (PPA). The Project programme indicates a construction period starting in 2011 with completion scheduled four years later.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Project is expected to have high economic and developmental impact, as it will: 
 
- Provide a valuable positive signal to international lenders and investors as Pakistan plans to build ~10,000 MW of capacity between 2010 and 2015, most of which developed on an IPP basis; 
 
- Provide a much needed capacity as the installed capacity in Pakistan fails to keep up with the rapid growth of peak demand (~7% p.a.), as a result, economic actors are expressing concerns over supply deficit and load shedding measures, which are likely to continue for some time; 
 
- Contribute to reduce greenhouse gas emissions; 
 
- Create a sustained economic activity by providing job opportunities and an adequate road infrastructure thus improving life conditions of neighboring rural populations; 
 
- Reduce the fuel oil import burden by using a domestic source of energy which is a relief for the country&apos;s balance of trade.</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">The design involves the construction of a weir across the Kunhar River, near the village of Patrind, about 12 km downstream of the Garhi Habibullah Bridge. The Project will divert a portion of the water of the Kunhar River through a tunnel to a powerhouse on the right bank of the Jhelum River near Muzaffarabad. Power will be delivered to a switchyard on the left bank of the Jhelum River which will be connected with the NTDC grid. Since the Project is run-of-the-river power project diverting water from the Kunhar River into the Jhelum River, approximately 13 km upstream of their confluence, the Project does not reduce water flows of the Jhelum River.  
 

The Jhelum River is classified as an International Waterway and together with its tributaries, including the Kunhar River, subject to the Indus Waters Treaty of 1960. In accordance with IFCs Policy on Social and Environmental Sustainability (April 30, 2006), IFC sent riparian notices to the IFC Executive Directors for both, India and Pakistan notifying them of IFCs proposed investment in the Project and its location.</narrative>
