   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Atlantic Fellows for Social and Economic Equity (AFSEE) programme of the International Inequalities Institute (III) at the London School of Economics (LSE) is funding and collaborating with Oxfam on a new project (RLFD50), bringing the expertise of practitioners and academics together, in response to the global impact of the coronavirus pandemic.  The objective is to advance our knowledge about the impacts of and responses to COVID -19 and contribute to shaping policy and informing wider, public conversations about people and community initiatives. This will be facilitated through multiple streams of work:  (1) Primary research and evidence gathering in Somalia, the Philippines, Nigeria and the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) (2) Secondary data collection through a wide network of interested participants (3) Joint sense -making and knowledge exchange through various thematic clusters or small communities of practice (4) More wholistic and targeted knowledge dissemination and communications to ensure uptake of ideas This agreement relates to component (1) above, Primary research and evidence gathering, as well as component (3) &#x2013; Joint sense -making and Knowledge exchange. The purpose of this work is to collect primary examples and cases of emerging agency within Somalia. This work has been discussed and it has been agreed that work will be implemented through existing staff.  It has been jointly agreed that at least 9 examples or cases of emergent agency will be documented in reports, case studies, or video in the English language, with one summary developed and completed by the end date of this agreement. Please see attachments for detailed description of what we mean by Emergent Agency and what the cases should be examining.  As part of this agreement, it is hoped that Oxfam Somalia will be actively involved in the growing Emergent Agency network, including the cluster conversations bring these examples and others into these discussions and being part of sense -</narrative>
