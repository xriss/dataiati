   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The purpose of the project is to establish a well-functioning vocational training programme for the target group. The project provides a need-based provision of vocational training on selected skills and micro-enterprises as a means to help transform lives
 of participants and their families. There are two kinds of target groups. The original emphasis is on assisting victims of domestic violence and the other one is women in village communities. Especially in village communities the skills training acts as a
 preventive measure. Fida&apos;s partner organization is RENEW (Respect, Educate, Nurture, and Empower Women), which is a non-governmental Bhutanese organization (NGO) dedicated to the empowerment of vulnerable girls and women of Bhutan so that they can emerge 
as socially and economically independent members of their communities. Her Majesty Ashi Sangay Choden Wangchuck is both a founder and a President of the organization. Fida participation in the vocational training project is integrated into the partner&apos;s ot
her programs of services for women and girls in shelter homes, the Thimphu centre and rural village communities. Since the beginning of the project implementation in 2011 six instructors for handicraft design and quality have been trained, two sewing instr
uctors trained by the project qualified for the advanced tailoring in SEWA organization in Ahmadabad in 2012. The main focus of training instructors has been on quality of the products and of the training which has been individually implemented that is due
 to the nature of the participants. The training method has been &quot;hands on, one to one&quot; -training, which has been an appropriate method in shelter homes, village communities with illiterate women and in a Thimphu centre. Around 60 women and girls have part
icipated handicraft training in 2014. That includes girls who learned knitting on their winter holiday. The ultimate goal of the project is to improve livelihood opportunities for victims of domestic violence (DV), gender based victims (GBV) and vulnerable
 women by learning livelihood skills. It is assumed that these women will return to their communities as: Being empowered by having sufficient knowledge of making handicrafts or other vocational skills.; Having new skills to generate income and to improve 
their livelihood.; Having improved security as individuals.; Having improved self-esteem.; Standing firm in their rights as active members of society. Until now the project has assisted learners to acquire new knowledge and skills on their own speed. At th
e same time they have learned effectively different methods and issues of quality and product design. Additionally, the project has assisted RENEW to improve its capacity in training and services.</narrative>
