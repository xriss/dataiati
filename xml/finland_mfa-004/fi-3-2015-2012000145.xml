 based approach enabling participation of different groups of refugees in the planning and implementation of the project. Special emphasis is put on participation of women and minorities. Training and group discussions will include topics on gender equilit
y human rights and democracy. The improved level of knowledge and skills of the participants will result in increased self-esteem and better capacity to take actively part in the decision making and development activities in their communities. This support
