poor and knowledge of good sanitary practices is lacking and therefore the general state of health of the population especially children is poor.There is no general information about the practices of personal hygiene clean facilities garbage disposal envir
onmental protection and water disinfection practices which is why the communities consume contaminated water. Due to all these reasons the prevalence of acute diarrheal diseases (ADD) parasites and other illnesses is high in both children and adults especi
ally elderly.The main beneficiaries of the project are the 65 families (approximately 250 people) of the communities of la Joya and Esmeralda that are indigenous Aymara speaking communities. The objective of this Project is secure access to clean water (on

nd by spreading knowledge of adequate hygienic practices through workshops and by training school children the community in general and the communal health promoters that are elected in the communities.In order to secure the sustainability of the results o
f the previous project the hygienic practices and the functioning of the village water committees are monitored in the communities of Candial and Sixilla Baja. Additional training is offered when necessary.The project aims at strengthening also the adminis
trative capacities of the communities by participating them in all phases of the project from planning and implementation through the evaluation and by providing them training in how to organize the community the water system maintenance and the Water Comm
