   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Village Community Empowerment (VCE) III project is operating in Bhilwara district in  Bijoliya block in Rajasthan India. The project is run by Bal Rashmi Society (BRS) in cooperation with the Student Union of the University of Jyvaskyla. BRS is the onl
y NGO working in the area and there has been two phases of VCE project until now. The new phase is a two year exit phase of the project in which the organization will be prepared to continue on their own. In Bijoliya block there lives many backward communi
ties such as the Bheel community which are very poor largely illiterate and live in pitiable conditions without the basic needs. The project aims at helping them to stand on their own feet and making the development process sustainable. Therefore the focus
 of the project is on awareness building and empowerment. The key beneficiaries of the project are women adolescent girls children and through empowering them the project aims at the total upliftment of the entire village communities.The main activities ar
e the income generation programme (IGP) to give loans for women and leadership trainings for self help group (SHG) members. In the area there will also be new SHG and adolescent girls? groups formed during the new phase of the project. These activities aim
 at awareness building among the women and adolescent girls. At the same time the project makes extra focus on educating parents/communities about need for continued education of their children and also about social evils like child marriage and their mind
set about superstitions. This phase is the exit phase of the project and therefore it will not create any new structures during the last period but will focus on interventions that would have long term impact on the families and community.</narrative>
