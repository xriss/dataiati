   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The OHS study that was conducted during the pilot phase will be made use of as training material and tool of the workplace / company level OHS committees, whilst the new training manual will be used in basic unionism training. Collective bargaining, negoti
ation and grievance handling skills will be improved. New members will be recruited with the emphasis in the first project year in formal MNCs and local companies that are easiest to organize, moving on in the second and third year towards the more difficu
lt family enterprises and other small local companies. This project also includes an element of south-south-north exchange where alongside ICU participate the Mozambican tourism sector union SINTIHOTS, Mozambican food industry union SINTIAB and the Finnish
 SEL and PAM.The basic structures of the union are in order and it is a recognized negotiation partner in the food and hospitality sectors, but its institutional capacity is not yet adequate for efficient interest representation and member services. In add
ition also organizing is rather challenging, especially in small and medium local enterprises, so a large number of workers are out of the scope of interest representation. Growth of membership, development of negotiation and grievance handling skills and 
improved OHS action are the expected impacts through which the project strengthens ensuring workers? rights.Through improved OHS it is expected that numbers of workplace accidents reduces and health of workers in general improves. Rights awareness and acti
ve participation in the union grows through basic training. The union negotiates new and better CBAs and handles grievances of members more efficiently than earlier. Membership grows by a few thousands during the project phase and this growth brings the un
ion more power and coverage.  Through the exchange program of three countries the union gains new types information from experiences of others and ideas for further development of its activities.Beneficiaries of the project will be Ghanaian food industry a
nd hotel + restaurant workers through their strengthened union.Industrial and Commercial Workers? Union ICU is a multi-sectorial union covering also the food industry and hotel and restaurant sectors. It has approximately 60 000 members, of whom about a fo
urth work in these sectors. At international level ICU is affiliated to IUF, UNI and IndustriALL.</narrative>
