   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Inequality and inequity in education remain matters of great concern in Afghanistan. The education of all children regardless of their gender abilities disabilities backgrounds and circumstances are a major challenge. Approximately 50% of children remain o
ut of school and many who are enrolled in school drop out or do not attend. With support from Serve Afghanistan the Ministry of Education (MoE) has just completed their first Inclusive + Child Friendly Education Policy. However government schools have limi
ted resources and expertise to include Children with Disabilities (CwD). Over the three years of the project staff will implement Serve&apos;s comprehensive model of Inclusive Education (IE) to improve access to and quality of education for CwDs in 15 governmen
t schools in Kalakan and Dasht e Barchi in Kabul province. The model includes the following:1. Establishment of and support to school-based Inclusive Education Advisory Committees (IEAC) playing a pivotal role in ensuring the quality of IE and in raising c
ommunity awareness and behavioral change in disability.2. Training of master trainers in braille sign language and IE. Master trainers will in turn train the teachers of the targeted schools according to Training of Trainers principles.3. Development of te
aching and learning materials for various categories and training teachers to use them.4. School preparation for hearing and visually impaired children in order for them to attend the regular government schools with an IE curriculum and approach.Additional
ly staff will establish two Accelerated Learning Programmes (ALPs) a model initiated by the Ministry of Education (MoE) in order to bring overage CwDs into the government school system. The MoE?s ALP allows over-age Afghan children to complete two cycles o
f education in one calendar year using the regular MoE curriculum. The ALP represents the only entry point for over-age CwDs into the formal education system.  In addition Serve recognizes that inclusive education requires a proactive approach to policy an
d practice as well as a multi-stakeholder approach between civil society and government ministries especially the Ministry of Education.  Therefore we choose a participatory comprehensive effort that operates on multiple levels: individual groups and insti
tutions with the aim to bring about changes of behaviour in a range of stakeholders that would result in positive outcomes for students and their communities.</narrative>
