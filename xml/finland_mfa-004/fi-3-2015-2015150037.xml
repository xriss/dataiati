  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">National Coalition of Human Rights Defenders (NCHRD-K) is a national organization incorporated in Kenya as a Trust whose mission is to strengthen the capacity of Human Rights Defenders (HRDs) to work effectively in the country and to reduce their vulnerabi
lity to the risk of prosecution through protection capacity building and advocacy for a favourable legal and policy environment. NCHRD-K support has been extended not only to Kenyan human rights defenders but also those in the region who sought refuge in K
enya for safety and to pursue their human rights work in exile.: NCHRD-K has positioned itself as an important player in responding to the challenges and risks faced by HRDs in Kenya. The pivotal role of NCHRD is to work towards creating a safe working env
ironment for HRDs which is especially critical at this time in history when global and national trends point to shrinking democratic space and threats to human rights work. In the past two years NCHRD-K has demonstrated unwavering commitment to HRDs by ens
uring that lives of human rights advocates were safeguarded their voices are not stifled and that human rights work is promoted in spite of increased surveillance vilification arbitrary arrests malicious prosecutions and threats.Through the previous fundin
g by the Embassy the NCHRD-K was able to achieve a number of outcomes; the capacity of the NCHRD-K to respond to HRDs needs was enhanced through staff support procuring office equipment and furniture. The project funding contributed to the realization of a
ccountable government at the county level by building the capacity of county based HRDs with the skills to conduct accountability assessment of projects and budgets and supporting policy development that incorporated human rights principles of citizen part
icipation non-discrimination and focus on the marginalized groups in the society. NCHRD-K through our support and other development partners provided support to HRDs at risk. In particular HRDs arrested on account of their work injured or threatened were p
rovided with necessary specialized assistance to overcome their challenges.</narrative>
