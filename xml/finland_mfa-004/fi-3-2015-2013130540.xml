   <narrative xml:lang="EN">F.a: Promotion of Young Workers in IndustriALL Global Union</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project strengthens the active involvement of young people in trade union activities, and it promotes the realization of working life rights in Columbia, Nicaragua, Uruguay, Brazil and Mexico.The position of young workers in the labour market is clearl
y weaker than that of the elder. For every unemployed adult there are approximately three young people in a similar situation.  The employment relationships of the young are by definition weak and often short-termed, which means that these young people are
 left outside the social security structure. They are not in an equal position in the labour market nor in the organisations for workers. The share of young trade union members is relatively small and does not represent their share of the workforce. Young 
people under 35 years are underrepresented in collective bargaining, and only a few labour organisations have a strategy or a policy that takes their special needs (such as odd jobs, weak working conditions, outsourcing, temporary agency work and training 
contracts) into account. A limited number of young people sit in the decision making bodies of the trade unions, thus their voices are not heard in the organization activities. This project supports the more active involvement of young people in the global
 union federation for the industrial sector, IndustriAll, as well as in their own trade unions and work places.By the end of the project, a regional youth network has been created and the trade unions in the sector have permanent structures and activities,
 enabling the participation of the young as well as their access to the management and responsible positions in the unions. The agreements negotiated by the unions include paragraphs that promote equality in relation to generation and gender at work places
. Young trade union activists have been trained to act in order to defend labour rights and to take leading positions in the unions.The project beneficiaries are the young trade union activists in the metal workers&#x2019;, chemical workers&#x2019; and textile worke
rs&#x2019; unions in Columbia, Nicaragua, Uruguay, Brazil and Mexico.The project is executed by IndustriALL Global Union together with the local trade unions.</narrative>
