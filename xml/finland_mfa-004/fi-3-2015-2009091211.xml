   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Malawi Good Samaritan HIV project is part of Africa wide HIV program (GSP) by African Bible Societies that is running in over 20 Sub-Saharan countries. The long term objective of the project is to contribute to the reduction of the spread of HIV and stigma
 of people infected and affected. The main focus is to reduce stigmatization and discrimination of PLHA. The overall objectives of GSP are to strengthen the involvement of churches in  response to HIV by enabling people and organizations to: Get knowledge 
about HIV and AIDS and risky behaviour, Encourage VCT and sexual education, Eradicate stigma and discrimination, Restore PLHA?s human rights dignity and equality and, To renew churches and local congregations&apos; social responsibility. The programme has two m
ain target groups: People with influence as opinion leaders and/or with the capacity to act as facilitators and trainers, and people who are particularly vulnerable to HIV  such as the youth women PLHA  and married couples. Third phase  is especially  targ
eting PVDs  as they are one of the most HIV vulnerable groups. Through PVD strategy the aim is to include PVDs to existing structure of activities. The strategy is based on Information Education and Communication with a focus on behavioral change communica
tion and to work with individuals and communities through sharing and providing supportive and enabling environments. The implementation is based on a two tier strategy: (i) advocacy sensitization and mobilization of community+religious leaders, and (ii) c
onduct training of trainers to reach local communities. The training uses the workshop as a platform to facilitate interaction sharing and reflection to  promote change in attitudes and behavior. The programme also encourages the formation of local groups 
for mutual support and action. Issues of gender will continue to be addressed as was the case in previous phases. Project staff will be equipped with training skills on gender and  human dignity since they  are key elements in the GS program. Project is im
plemented in existing structures that include governmental HIV coordination religious networks and local communities.The key project activities include different workshops: training of trainers (ToT) decentralized workshops (DWs) Follow up (FU) Take Charge
 youth program (TC). There is also an annual capacity building workshops for project staff (Joint Program Review and anglophone capacity building workshop).</narrative>
