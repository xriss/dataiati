   <narrative xml:lang="EN">F.a: Grassroots Dialogues and Sustainable rehabilitation and reconstruction</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">&quot;Program I 1. Grassroots and National level dialogues will be organised under the Social Forum banner. SADED, through its grassroots dialogue, collects memories, thoughts and experience from the grassroots level 2. Those interesting and important memories 
and outcomes of the dialogues will be published and disseminated through newsletters, newspaper articles, blogs and websites.  3. SADED-Nepal prioritizes to interact with various social movements in South Asia. Since it is easy for Nepalese to visit Pakist
an, and Bangladesh in comparison to Indians, SADED-Nepal will engage with social movements there so that regional social movements  especially Social Forum will be strengthened. Program II: Sustainable rehabilitation and reconstruction (after 2015 earthqua
ke)  1. To stay with our green principles to use local technological skills and material for reconstruction: There is a risk that some of the multinational companies will monopolize the reconstruction discourse in order to expand their capital. SADED-Nepal
 has a plan to recruit some of the technicians to mobilize in the affected areas before and during the reconstruction work. They will be given chance to have exposure visits to places like Uttarakhand and Assam of India. These technicians will be able to s
uggest a good engineered structures so that the reconstructed houses with local materials will be equally or even more stronger than that of corporate promoted &quot;&quot;modern&quot;&quot; houses. Dialogues will be organized in the affected areas with the participation of c
ommunity-based organizations and local elites. Also we will invite experts from Uttarakhand and Assam for sharing dialogues in the affected areas.  2. Resuming/Building/supporting public spaces for children and elders in the villages: SADED-Nepal have iden
tified 5 Village Development Communities (VDCs) in Nuwakot  and Rasuwa/Sindupalchowk from where we start relief and reconstruction work of children&apos;s space. While doing so, pre-primary schools, play schools along with the village based public spaces will b
e reconstructed where it is destroyed. We will take a VDC, and after having need assessments in the villages, will help reconstruct damaged infrastructures so that public spaces can resume/start their activities.  Elderly and young people will be involved 
in running these children spaces. Furthermore, midday meals and play materials will be provided in a school and a children?s play space. &quot;</narrative>
