  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The aim of the project is to promote the availability of health and educational services for Palestinian disabled children (Rights of Persons with Disabilities Article 24) The National Institution of Social Care and Vocational Training (NISCVT) started the
 sponsorship program to support the children with multiple special needs (from now on referred to as MSN children) with tuition fees for special schools in 2009. In 2013-15 the focus has been on opening the way for Palestinian MSN children living in Lebano
n and displaced from Syria to the special services. After a difficult start the Family Guidance Centers (FGC) of NISCVT have succeeded to obtain special education places in 16 institutions. A study on the MSN children (n=49) attending the special schools i
n 2013-2014 showed that clinically four of five children progressed at least moderately. Nearly all parents were satisfied and the schools stated that the children?s study motivation parents&apos; involvement and children?s progress was good (75 %). In addition
 to the core activity the project has increased skills of the staff by training developed family-approach social work and encouraged the families to go out with their MSN child in order to get in contact with the community. Thus the project successfully mi
tigates disability-based discrimination. Services for boys and girls are equal although there are more boys than girls in the project due to the higher prevalence of disability rate in male than in female populations.Only a fraction of the Palestinian MSN 
children get rehabilitation and special education services in Lebanon and among the children displaced from Syria the situation is even worse. The project will continue mainly as in the previous years: FGCs offer assessment treatment referral to services a
dditional treatments in FGCs and support to the families. The follow up project will focus more on initial rehabilitation assessment medical tests and medication. Places in special schools will be arranged for 60-80 MSN children (depending on the cost leve
l). Activities with parents (100-160) and siblings (200-250) aim to make the daily environment of the MSN child more stimulating and encourage the family members to share the responsibilities for the care.The NISCVT FGSs will be developed by staff training
 service studies and the ?beneficiaries as project evaluators? model into resource centers that provide information and  support for working with the MSN children.</narrative>
