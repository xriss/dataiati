   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Deaf primary school pupils in Tanzania are facing severe difficulties in their progress to reach secondary level education. Tteaching language in secondary schools is mainly English and the deaf are not offered any help in interpretation. A significant num
ber of deaf pupils drop out from school due to the lack of opportunities to study effectively, consequently they find it extremely challenging to find employment. The main goal of the project is to improve the opportunities for deaf pupils to increase thei
r chances to complete the secondary education. The Deaf Unit at Meru Primary School (MPS) in Arusha is chosen to receive a specific information technology targeted learning environment. This enhancement is achieved by supporting continuing training for tea
chers and developing the skills of all pupils in information technology data searching data processing and in the English language.An important aspect of the technological learning environment is the learning centre. The data projector all computers and ro
om lighting are powered by solar energy. The centre will introduce information technology clubs training for teachers/student teachers as well as classroom teaching. To support and maintain the educational and technical infrastructure two persons with both
 IT and sign language skills will be employed.The beneficiaries are the deaf young people including those who have dropped out from education and local young IT supportive teams. This project and its unique training support will also benefit the area?s tea
chers by providing IT expertise to the teachers at MPS and other educational staff around Arusha in turn enabling them all to offer the most appropriate learning environment for disadvantaged children. Those studying at the Patandi Teachers? College will g
ain experience in practice. Thus the target of effectively teaching deaf children can be further enhanced and improved.This project will support the rights of the young disabled and socially displaced minorities. Also gender equality will be effectuated by
 implementing the new teaching method to more female pupils. At present the deaf female/male pupil ratio in MPS is 36/43. With the new tuition method the numbers of female pupils entering secondary education will most likely see a significant increase.The 
Arusha Special Needs Education Coordinator the headmaster of MPS and FSE ry has jointly developed this project. All above organisations will implement the project mutually.</narrative>
