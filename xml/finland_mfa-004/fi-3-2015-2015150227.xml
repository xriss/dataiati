   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In the project the young volunteers of the youth exchange organization Maailmanvaihto visit primary and secondary schools as well as upper secondary schools and vocational schools in different parts of Finland. The visitors have either worked as a voluntee
r in a developing country or come to Finland from a developing country to work as a volunteer here.In the visits the young volunteers share with children and youth their experiences on daily life realities abroad. Through the visits children and youth get 
a chance to broaden their worldviews and to understand the realities of the developing countries in a grassroots level. In this level the daily life is not necessarily always similar to the picture which is given in the traditional media or public authorit
y communication. The stories of those who have worked as a volunteer abroad can also inspire children and youth towards active citizenship in the future.The aim of the school visits is to bring up daily life realities of the developing countries and to inc
rease knowledge on cultures and living conditions around the world. The aim is also to advance interest towards developing countries internationalism global thinking and international dialogue.The project aims at developing further school visiting activiti
es of volunteers as a form of global education. The visits suit into the school world well because the themes of global education are a part of the curriculums. The school visiting activities of Maailmanvaihto which were started in the autumn 2012 have bee
n planned together so that Finnish and foreign volunteers of Maailmanvaihto among others have participated in planning them. In this project the content of the school visiting activities is developed further. Maailmanvaihto sends and receives yearly in tot
al some 60?70 young volunteers. Voluntary exchange is done to Asia Africa and Latin America as well as to Europe and Oceania. The participants are majors mainly 18?30-year-olds and they often work among children and youth in the educational and social sect
or.</narrative>
