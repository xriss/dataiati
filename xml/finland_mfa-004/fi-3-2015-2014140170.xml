  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project aims to develop a multi-stakeholder alliance at national level in the natural stone quarry sector that shall feed into and lend further strength to the ongoing interventions by the BWI and its affiliate at State-level (Rajasthan). The project s
hall bring together different stakeholders on a common platform including various certification programs such as TFT, Xertifix, ETI to form an alliance and come up with strategies and actions at the country level. A recent study in the sector reveals that 
salaries of the stone quarry workers are really low, working and living conditions are appalling, exposure to serious Silicosis is wide, social security and government of India programs do not reach out to Rajasthan stone quarries, and the use of child lab
our is widely spread in this hazardous industry. Through a strong alliance in between trade unions and certification bodies, an effective advocacy process will be jointly carried out, in order to influence poor working and living conditions, to enable soci
al protection and eradicate child labour.The project shall establish a National-level Alliance of different key players in the natural stone quarry sector including various certification programs to collectively pursue decent work agenda with their respect
ive networks and interventions. The project shall also strengthen efforts to bring about policy level changes at the State level (Rajasthan) so as to include the stone quarry sector under the State Construction Workers? Welfare Board as has been done in ot
her states. Joint meetings on specific issues including social security, OHS and child labour shall form key feature of the project. Broadly, following outputs and results are expected from the project, i) Multi-stakeholder National-level Alliance establis
hed to collectively work to improve working conditions and lessen of child labour use, ii) Regular dialogue established with concerned Government departments, CSOs and Certification agencies, and iii) Inclusion of Stone Quarry sector in the State Construct
ion Workers? Welfare Board.Advocacy work carried out through the National-level Alliance will ultimately benefit workers in India stone quarry industries, particularly in Rajasthan state. Also the trade unions involved and the certification bodies will ben
efit from the project.The project is implemented by Building and Woodworkers? International BWI, their local affiliate RPKNMS and certification bodies XertifiX, TFT and EDI.</narrative>
