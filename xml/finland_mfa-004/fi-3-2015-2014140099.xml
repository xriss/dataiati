  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Eritrea?s education system has significantly improved an expanded since the independence in 1991. Between 1991/2 and 2010/11, total elementary school enrolment doubled and the middle and secondary school enrolment levels tripled.While the Government of Eri
trea has made gains in student enrollment, it is only one aspect of reaching the Education for All goals, another essential goal is building and upholding teacher quality. Currently many of the teachers in Eritrea are unqualified and inexperienced, resulti
ng in poor student performance.Recent initiatives by the Eritrean Ministry of Education are indications of the motivation to continue and expand reforms in education. According to the Eritrean National ICT for Education Policy Plan, all key education secto
r actors indicate the interest for ICTs into education and FCA can offer qualified support to this work. FCA is therefore planning an initiative aimed at ensuring universal and uninterrupted access to quality education and working for better learning outco
mes. Overall objective of the project is to increase the access to and quality of education in Eritrea. Specific objectives will be set after needed assessments for project planning taking place during the last quarter of 2014.Initial proposals for specifi
c objectives are:1. Teacher Training: Strengthen the quality of teacher training in education institutions.2. Professional Development in ICT: Build the capacity of Eritrean educators to implement quality education and improve educational outcomes through 
integration of ICT.3. Curriculum: Improve access to relevant and quality curriculum to enable learners to gain the skills, knowledge and expertise they need to succeed.The project will be implemented in collaboration with the Government of Eritrea and the 
local education institutions. FCA can make use of other partnerships in the sectors of education and technology and context-specific partnerships. An assessment has been conducted of potential Finnish partners who could potentially contribute to the projec
t.  It should be noted that a final selection of partnerships will be carried out together with the Eritrean Government after the assessments and negotiations of cooperation are complete.</narrative>
