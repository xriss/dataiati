  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Ukraine is deepening in its division of the society on the central and regional levels. The violent conclusion to the Euromaidan protest movement and Russia?s annexation of Crimea followed by the advent of the heavily armed pro-Russian separatist movement 
in Donetsk and Luhansk regions that ended up with the full-scale war in the East of the country that are lasting now for few years. There are two streams of work, stemming from different perspectives. The lack of communication channels between Ukrainian an
d Russian high level experts limits the potential resolution to the crisis in Ukraine as well as the future of the bilateral relationship between the two countries, including in the international context of a mutually acceptable future trade and security a
rchitecture of wider Europe.  The project seeks to provide opportunities  to unblock key issues in the official negotiation process and build common ground built and create a foundation created for reconciliation once conflict is settled. CMI will also con
tinue providing platform for the Ukraine-Russian expert dialogue meetings in order to deepen dialogue and find solutions on thematic topics. In September 2014 the Trilateral Contact Group (TCG) has started its work with participation of Ukraine, Russia, OS
CE and representatives of the so called DNR and LNR. Starting from May 2014 four subgroups are working on thematic topics including: security issues, political issues, economic issues and humanitarian issues. It?s been noted that there is a lack of experie
nce among the Ukrainian negotiators in conflict situations due to the fact that Ukraine has had no armed conflicts during the whole 23 years of its independence. It?s thus very important to provide international experience of other peace processes and supp
ort Ukrainian negotiators in their work.  CMI will be supporting the Trilateral Contact Group subgroups in their work within Minsk process by providing with expert support and further provide expertise from relevant conflict zones and peace processes.</narrative>
