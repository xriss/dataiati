   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Despite the peace negotiations the political and ethnic conflict in South Sudan continues and the number of refugees is increasing. The refugee outflow is projected to exceed 800,000 by the end of 2015. Children and women bear the brunt of the conflict: 70
% of the refugees are children, and almost 80% of the refugee households are headed by women. It is estimated that some 35,000 South Sudanese children are unaccompanied or separated from their families. The number of South Sudanese refugees in Uganda was i
n the end of 2015 210,000 most of them settled in the Northern Uganda. The project&#x2019;s goal is to contribute towards poverty alleviation among the refugee population in Ayilo 1 + 2, and Nyumanzi Refugee Settlements and community members in neighbouring vil
lages in Pakele, Dzaipi and Arinyapi sub-counties in Adjumani District in West Nile, Uganda. The specific objective is that &#x201C;Targeted beneficiaries &#x2013; 70 % of them women &#x2013; have acquired skills to become self-reliant in terms of improved literacy (eith
er in local languages or in English) and life skills and active participation to their communities&#x2019; development. This is done by offering functional literacy and English for adult refugees and supporting FAL for Ugandans. The improved educational level w
ill contribute towards improved ability to analyse the environment, to increased self-esteem and capacity to actively take efforts to improve living conditions, which will gradually help refugees and Ugandans nearby to fight poverty. The project will also 
prepare refugees for repatriation in the future. The functionality is emphasised; essential skills needed for refugees to participate in the society and to operate confidently, effectively and independently in life are inclusive. Issues such as better heal
th care and sanitation, improved nutrition, environmentally friendly practises, money transactions and savings, rights and responsibilities of refugees and women are essential part of curriculum. The project will run annually 50 to 70 learning groups; 40 -
 50 for literacy and 10 - 20 for English.  Annually the project trains 1400 - 1500 refugees and about 200 &#x2013; 300 Ugandans literacy learners are helped with materials and training.</narrative>
