   <narrative xml:lang="EN">F.a: Conference on promoting ecological democracy and community rights</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project involves organizing an international conference on ecological democracy and community rights for 200 participants in Sri Lanka. Local communities in the global South lack decision-making power over the natural resources surrounding them. As a r
esult, many communities have become marginalized victims of modern development and environmental damage caused by it. Ecological democracy provides a framework that would enable community participation in decision-making over local environment in their own
 terms, instead of those of companies or officials. In order to make  informed decisions and act accordingly, the communities and grassroots organizations need better access to environmental information. The two-day conference will be held in the turn of S
eptember-October 2014 in Kandy, Sri Lanka. The conference precedes a general meeting of Friends of the Earth International (FoEI), which will be held in the same place. Half of the participants in the conference will be local activists and community repres
entatives, and the other half FoEI network members from 76 countries. The implementing organization, Centre for Environmental Justice, is FoEI &apos;s member organization in Sri Lanka. The conference enables exchanging information and experiences  on environmen
tal problems and democratic management of enviroment between local actors and those coming from different parts of the world. A declaration and action plan to achieve ecological democracy will be made in the conference, and afterwards a publication on the 
conference presentations and discussions will be published. The conference will enhance the capacities of local communities to act on behalf of their environmental and other basic rights and sustainable livelihoods, as well as support international network
ing of the environmental movement in Sri Lanka. Centre for Environmental Justice (CEJ) was established in January 2004. CEJ aims to protect the equal environmental rights of the people, conserve nature and natural resources, support ecologically sound comm
unity activities, promote good environmental governance and ecological sustainability. CEJ provides free legal advice to the people affected by environmental problems, campaigns against e.g. environmental pollutants and climate change, and raises awareness
 on environmental impact assessment processes and the environmental outcomes of development initiatives. CEJ is a member of the Friends of the Earth International and functions as the Friends of the Earth chapter in Sri Lanka. CEJ is closely working with o
ver 70 local and national NGOs in Sri Lanka, and is also a member of several environmnetal forums internationally. www.ejustice.lk</narrative>
