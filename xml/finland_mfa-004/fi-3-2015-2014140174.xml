   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project aims at consolidating a joint agenda for the Colombian trade union movement in view of the post-conflict era.The internal violent conflict of Colombia is one of the longest worldwide. Colombian governments have tried to solve the conflict in th
ree different peace processes. The current peace process is considered widely to have good possibilities to be successful in ending the conflict. Long-term conflict has resulted in civil society, including trade union movement, acting mainly in the very ma
rgins of the society. If the conflict will be terminated, it is of utmost importance that the trade union movement takes the role that belongs to it, as an important actor in questions related to labor policies, economy, politics and social security, as we
ll as in the peace process itself. Trade union movement needs to have concrete alternative proposals and models on how to improve the quality of labor and strengthen democracy. The trade union movement needs to build a new role and identity as during the c
onflict period it has mainly identified itself as a victim of the violent conflict. The project intends at helping unions to create a joint post-conflict agenda, based on relevant research on international experiences of trade unions in post-conflict situa
tions.At the end of the project Colombian trade union movement has a joint agenda to promote Decent Work in the post-conflict society and the role of the trade union movement is strengthened in the society and in the peace process. A research is conducted 
which gives valuable information on how trade unions globally have been participating in peace processes and the construction of post-conflict societies.The beneficiaries of this project are all the actors in the Colombian trade union movement. The project
 is implemented by the Colombian trade union training and research center Escuela Nacional Sindical (ENS) which has long experience on research, analysis and planning of trade union activity together with Colombian unions and labor centers.</narrative>
