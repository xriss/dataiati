   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Deep-rooted gender inequalities and gender-based violence (GBV) are pervasive in Cambodian society, particularly in areas where poverty is widespread; unemployment is high; and education levels are low. The low levels of literacy and education limit women
&#x2019;s options for generating sufficient income for decent living which exposes them and their children to the risk of exploitation and violence. In addition, low family incomes and social attitudes all combine to create numerous barriers to girls attending 
or remaining in school, causing them to drop out before completing their basic education and thereby increasing their vulnerability. Women and girls also have less voice and thus little influence in decision-making processes in their communities due to pre
vailing gender stereotypes.The target area of the project is Siem Reap province which is one of the poorest provinces of Cambodia, with a high number of female-headed households, most of whom are poor and under considerable economic and social stress. Proj
ect objectives include:&#x2022; Empowered women are able to generate income through group businesses and small enterprises&#x2022; Clusters of savings groups formed into Federations in the target areas to provide support to vulnerable women to curb financial crisis 
and all forms of violence&#x2022; Girls from poor families living in the target areas are empowered through access to education (scholarships, vocational and life skills training)  Rights-holders /beneficiaries: The most vulnerable women and girls including wom
en from poor families, landless and women recovering from violence; men and boys will also benefit directly and indirectly from saving groups and community awareness; CWCC staff, family members of targeted women, community members, partner NGOs and members
 of local authorities. Implementing partner: The Cambodia Women&#x2019;s Crisis Centre (CWCC) is a recognised, local non-governmental organisation established in 1997 with the aim of combatting all forms of violence against women and children. CWCC endeavours t
o support and empower the survivors to realise their rights and to lead a dignified life. CWCC has extensive experience in responding to the needs of the most vulnerable groups of society through a wide variety of interventions, including social assistance
, legal protection, community organising, economic empowerment through skills training and small business loans, and promotion of access to secondary education for vulnerable girls.</narrative>
