  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The general purpose is to retrieve and disseminate everyday memory of the disappeared and those executed prisoners prior to their arrest after the military coup of 1973 and the following military dictatorship through the production and broadcast of radio s
pots. Specific Objectives ? Recover the memory of everyday life of the disappeared and executed prisoners prior to their arrest after the military coup of 1973 and the Military Dictatorship through stories of family and/or significant others. ? Develop sto
ries in brief format (micro stories) containing memories submitted by their relatives and/or significant others. ? Produce stories in 1.5 minutes radio spots. ? Disseminate radio spots on other media such as websites of institutions collaborating with the 
project. ? Develop a report of work done and its projections.Through this project the transgenerational harm is a central axis which gives relevance and meaning to this particular mode of approach. Several investigations on the impact of human rights viola
tions and political violence both in Chile and in other countries have given us thoughts on the transgenerational impact of dictatorships.Another dimension that gives relevance to this proposal refers precisely to the repair. In Chile the governments in de
mocracy have focused on national reconciliation and repair of the direct victims of violations of human rights. The repair has been mainly with regard to economic and health dimensions to the affected themselves or their direct family leaving behind the so
cial fracture of the tragedy.It is relevant to note that in recent results obtained by an important survey in Chile- published in September 2013 - there is a significant number of young people who have shown no comment about the coup and Pinochet. This seg
ment between 18 and 25 are those born after 1988 and who grew up in democracy. Having access to the memory on the daily lives of direct victims of the dictatorship (in this case of detained missing and executed political prisoners) would be anchored in the
 present and closer to understanding the experiences of people involved for today?s youth.</narrative>
