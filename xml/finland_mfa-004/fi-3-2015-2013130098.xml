   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Traditionally the role of older people in Namibia has been to advise their families and communities and to receive care and respect by their children. Today their role is often overlooked. Elderly people need immediate social support and practical assistan
ce but it is likely that public support will assume greater dimension only over the coming years. Immediate objectives of the project are: 1) Increased skills on participatory working methods on elderly work among Evangelical Lutheran Church in Namibia (EL
CIN) and the community2) Improved knowledge and awareness on elderly issuesand 3) Responsive family and social support structures established in communities. Namibia has seen the breaking down of the moral fabric within communities which causes a lack of r
espect for elderly people. Older women in particular have to deal with a double battle as they face abuse and inequality because of their age and gender. Participatory community development strengthens human rights and gender equality of elderly. Project r
espects climate sustainability too.The project does not create any new structure or institution but is positioned at the ELCIN Department of Diakonia and Social Services. Along with the project ELCIN will be capacitated to create a new community work appro
ach for the most vulnerable elderly.   The ultimate beneficiaries of the project are the most vulnerable elderly people over the age of 60 and their communities. Particularly attention is paid to marginalised elders without family members and vulnerable ki
nship caregivers who unexpectedly find themselves in the position of raising a second family. In both cases elderly people are subject to abuse. Major indirect beneficiary is the ELCIN.The key project activities include Curriculum Development, Development 
of elderly policy in ELCIN, Training of ELCIN personnel and volunteers, Strengthening institutional capacity of ELCIN, Discussions on sustainable future strategies, Research on relevant approaches, Development of home based care, Training on adult educatio
n, Providing psycho-social support and counseling, Awareness raising campaigns, Annual Ageing Seminars, Lobbying on preparation for ageing,Creating platforms for intergenerational dialogues,Establishing alliances with local authorities,Formation of Elderly
 clubs,Strengthening family ties for elderly support,Improving elderly security,Enhancing integration and networks of elderly in the community,and experience sharing.</narrative>
