creases the chances of to be a victim of violence.The project aims to raise awareness and to establish mechanisms to enable to reduce violence against children in the Rwenzori region of Western Uganda. The aim is to raise awareness of children&apos;s rights vio
lations, discussion about them between local leaders and community members and increase activities to reduce the violence against children, victim services, as well as better involvement of children in violence prevention. The direct target group are legal
