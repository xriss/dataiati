  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Israel/Palestine conflict has been in the center of the Finnish media for decades. Despite this the citizens especially the youth have no basic knowledge of the reasons and parties of the conflict. Those young people who are interested seek knowledge from 
the internet but website which would present the information in a clear and easily understandable way is not currently available. During the project this kind of website will be produced. The website will include the history of the conflict in a clear form
 as well as basics of the present situation. In addition other material (brochure poster infographics comic book) will be produced. Also trainings will be held to train new trainers who can in the future act as experts in their own networks. The project wi
ll be carried out in different cities of Finland. The target group includes political youth organizations environmental organizations and young people involved in these. In addition the project targets students who are involved in student councils and stud
ent groups in universities. Through the trainings and meetings the aim is to open these organizations new perspectives and new ways to work within the Israel/Palestine conflict. The produced material and the information package used in trainings will suppo
rt the targeted organizations and people attending to the trainings during the whole project. The produced material will be in their use as a useful way to find information also after the project.During the project there will also be carried out a wide and
 visible social media campaign. The purpose of this is to persuade new participants to the trainings and public events and also visitors to the created website. The aim is that in addition to the targeted group the website would become a contiunua place to
 seek knowledge for larger audience of the youth too.At the end of the project public events will be organized together with the organizations and people who have participated in this project. Also future operations like school visits and more versatile pu
