   <narrative xml:lang="EN">F.a: Encouraging The Implementation of Village Revitalization to Preserve The Community Land and Forest Area</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Link-AR Borneo aims to encourage the village-based regulation to protect community forest and land as livelihood resources. The village-based regulation would prevent deforestation and degradation of forest and land conversion to oil palm, pulpwood plantat
ion, and mining. Encouraging the village revitalization on natural resources management will contribute to preserve the forest and land as well as community rights. We propose to do this by establishing a Community Conservation and Livelihood Agreement (CC
LA).  The communities will be encouraged to build commitment to protect the land and forest area contained in a document. To encourage the implementation of village revitalization, the CCLA document will be set forth in the village-based regulation as a le
gal form.  This project will be implemented in 5 villages in Ketapang district in West-Kalimantan.  Direct beneficiaries include approximately 250 people, including several groups such as local authorities, indigenous leaders, youth and women groups. Other
 stakeholders are local authorities, catholic church organization, and district government of Ketapang. The proposed project aims to protect at least 1000 ha through community-based agreements, but larger areas are also possible to be included. The project
 is based on Link-AR Bornoe?s previous study on natural resources management in 30 villages. Link-AR Borneo was established in 2009, and registered in 2012, as a result of interaction between students, workers, and social activists who collaborated in the 
Alliance of West Borneo&apos;s People (PRKB) in relation to land grabbing, criminalization, eviction, and other issues. Letters A and R in the nema of the organization refer to Advocacy and Research, which Link-AR aims to combine with action. The aim of Link-AR
 is to propote people&apos;s tenure rights in order to realize justice, preservation, and welfare. The main activities innclude investigation and monitoring, advocacy, and campaigning. Link-AR participates actively in several networks, such as Social Working Gr
oup, which focuses on Asia Pulp + Paper (APP) company&apos;s Forest Conservation Policy (FCP) in Indonesia, a Working Group Tenure, as well as RPHK (Forest Monitoring Volunteer) in West Kalimantan.</narrative>
