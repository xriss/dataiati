   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The activities are to increase the capacity of journalists about the connection between intellectual property rights rights and human rights, to achieve wider media coverage for the right to health campaign, to promote the right to health by identifying th
e political and moral demands and by modifying them as rights and constitutional obligations, applying of legal means, such as by making a legal analysis, by participating in the trials and developing of legal strategies,  to increase and to make more effi
cient the networking and co-operation of local organizations, in order to enable them to make the state responsible for human rights obligations regarding the right to health, to increase the capacity of national organizations to understand the right to he
alth, and to make the related advocacy. ESC rights are fulfilled unevenly across the country and between different population groups, and in particular the most vulnerable groups are affected by the situation. The project aims to: 1) get the media interest
ed in intellectual property rights and human rights in the context as well as the right to health, 2) to promote the health right based litigation and other legal instruments, 3) advocacy work by networking and co-operation of the NGO field, and 4) to incr
ease the capacity of national NGOs to understand the right to health. As direct beneficiaries of the project are 25 journalists involved in the training, non-governmental leaders participating in the meetings and the coalition (the Coalition is Maternal He
alth) and political decision-makers. The project will also benefit the most vulnerable groups who currently suffer the most from the Ugandan health system shortcomings. Center for Health, Human Rights and Development CEHURD was established in 2007 and regi
stered in December 2009. It works in the health-related rights and public health legislation. CEHURDin activities focus on the most vulnerable groups such as women, children, orphans, sexual minorities, HIV-positive, disabled people and refugees.</narrative>
