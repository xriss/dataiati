   <narrative xml:lang="EN">CLAC represents Latin American and the Caribbean Fairtrade producers and workers, and it aims to strengthen and develop base-level producer organizations. CLAC is structured as National Networks in each country and regional Product Networks based on what t
hey produce. Through a currently on-going transition process, the producer networks are set to take over the service delivery to producers and workers. However, due to these recently resumed new and extended mandates and responsibilities, the producer netw
orks face a number of challenges in terms of organizational structures, communications and providing and facilitating more targeted services to producers together. During the project?s planning phase in 2014 the producer representatives throughout the regi
on were involved in analysis and planning workshops. They defined as their most important problems the weakness of internal communication, lack of resources to provide services to members, large distances, diversity of member organizations and low particip
ation of women and youth. The goal of the project is to contribute to sustainable livelihoods for small-scale producers. The purpose of the project is enhanced capacities of Producer Network CLAC to provide key services and advocacy for their members. The 
producer network?s organizational capacity will be improved by organizing a workshop on leadership for the board members. Producer network&apos;s technical expertise to provide services to their members will be improved by giving advice on coffee production and
 markets, by producing manuals for coffee sales, climate change adaptation, and inclusion of youth and women on cooperatives? activities, and by organizing the coffee network?s meetings. Producer network&apos;s capacity for advocacy will be developed through co
untry-specific mapping of political actors, advocacy training and mapping climate change risks for different products, and organizing women&apos;s and youth meetings. Final beneficiaries of the project are CLAC&apos;s almost 700 producer organizations with total of 
over 300,000 farmers. Around 20 % of producers are women. Direct beneficiaries of the project are 264 cooperative leaders and 14 CLAC board members. The project implementation began in late 2014. Implementing partner organization is Latin American and the 
Caribbean network of small Fairtrade producers, CLAC. http://clac-comerciojusto.org/</narrative>
