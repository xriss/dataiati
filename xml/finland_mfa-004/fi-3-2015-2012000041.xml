  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The situation of highly vulnerable children (HVC) and their caregivers in Batu Town Ethiopia suggested the idea of continuation replication and further expansion of the project that was initiated in 2013 responding to the desperation of the large number of
 HVC and their care givers.Orphaned and vulnerable children (OVC) are educationally nutritionally psycho-socially and economically disadvantaged. As the mothers of OVCs are poor and destitute almost all of these children cannot go to school unless they rec
eive support.In addition the already organized cooperatives that were trained in the preparation of nutritious flour need marketing skills in order to penetrate the market in Batu and its surrounding areas and sell their products at a reasonable price. Thi
s will enable the community to provide nutritious food for their children and also enable cooperative members to create self employment.Vocational and technical skill training is given to women so that they can engage in self-employment in the form of asso
ciations and cooperatives that help them gain skills and strengthen their voice.Reducing inequalities is a major focus of this project. As 95 % of the caregivers are women this project has taken their role and gender issues into strong consideration.The ov
erall objective is the improved food security of disadvantaged children through empowerment of caregivers by supplying caregivers with the knowledge and skills needed to enable them to provide nutritious food and generate income and thus provide better and
 sustainable living conditions.The main beneficiaries of the project are 800 mothers and 2 400 highly vulnerable children and their families that are affected by poverty food insecurity and  HIV/AIDS. The project will use and develop the already existing s
tructures created during the first phase of the project.The key project activities include: conducting market research providing fair and safe access to food processing and packaging services improving skills and awareness of women&apos;s groups by means of tra
inings providing a revolving fund strengthening two early childhood care and development centers constructing a shop at local market and conducting an evaluation.</narrative>
