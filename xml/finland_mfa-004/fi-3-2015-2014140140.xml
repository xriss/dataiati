  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project is a continuation of the project Peace and Tolerance in Schools implemented in 2013-2014. MISSEH has for several years already been developing a process promoting the tolerance and peace education among the children and youth of most marginalis
ed neighborhoods of Port-au-Prince and its surroundings. In order to achieve the sustainability of the results of earlier work it is important to continue the peace and education in schools and active promotion of violence prevention and advocacy to reduce
 poverty, one of the generators of conflicts. Also due to the high vulnerability of children and women in Haiti, it is very important that the gender-based violence is addressed and the project aims at consolidating the achievements in education, training 
and sensitisation of men, women and children to prevent, resist and reduce gender-based violence.   The project will train teachers, school administrators and sports instructors in peace and tolerance education methods. The training will provide the teache
rs with skills and methods to conduct conflict management and tolerance sessions in schools. The teaching tools for peace and tolerance education will also be developed and Peacemaker Networks will be established to the participating schools, bringing toge
ther the different actors participating in the project. The sports instructors will organise sports events for the youth of the project area, including those with no access to education, with the aim of promoting peace and tolerance. There will be activiti
es directed to parents of the students to train them in conflict management. Also leaders of religious missions and men and women of the communities are trained in gender equity and women?s rights. In addition, psychosocial support will be provided to wome
n and victims of gender-based violence.Rights-holders /beneficiaries: Teachers, school administrators, sport monitors, children and youth and their families in marginalised neighbourhoods of Port au Prince and its surroundings.Implementing partner:La Missi
