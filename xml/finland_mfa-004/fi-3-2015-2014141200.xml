   <narrative xml:lang="EN">F.a: Reinforcement of local communities and networking with activists to stop the Areng hydro dam</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Mother Nature organization, a volunteer movement made up of local indigenous communities, youth activists, and members of civil society, has been successfully opposing the proposed Areng hydroelectric dam, which would seriously damage the unique biodiversi
ty of the Central Cardamom Protected Forest in Koh Kong province, and seriously infringe on the human rights of local indigenous communities. With the strong relationship with members of the local communities and other activist groups, effective one-step-a
head-approach, and through the use of a savvy media campaign, Mother Nature has been able to delay the process and make the Areng Valley a talking point. During this project, Mother Nature will continue taking advantage of its rapport with influential comm
unity members to ensure that the communities at large are fully informed of what their rights are, and feel empowered enough (with the necessary tools, contacts and strategies) to publicly oppose the project. Also, Mother Nature will increase its media cam
paign to highlight the massive inconsistencies with the dam, pointing at not just the usual human rights violations and the massive ecological footprint, but also highlighting the fact that it has been classed as &#x2018;uneconomical&#x2019; by two large dam builder
s. This will be done through the use of a newly created network, which will concentrate its efforts in punctual, public, and innovative activities / campaigns. Mother Nature organization was created in February 2013 in the village of Ta Tay Leu, Koh Kong p
rovince, which was seeing massive deforestation of its ancient sacred spirit forests. Mother Nature has successfully campaigned agaist illegal logging, and has built a broad-based movement to stop the proposed Chhay Areng dam, as it would severely damage t
he unique biodiversity of the area and seriously infringe on the human rights of local indigenous communities. The goals of Mother Nature are: 1) To prevent the proposed Chhay Areng hydroelectric dam, or any other-large scale development projects, from bei
ng approved inside the Central Cardamom Protected Forest (CCPF); 2) Protect, reinforce, and promote the unique culture, traditions, and livelihoods of the Cardamom Mountain&apos;s remaining forest-dependant indigenous communities; 3) Lobby the Cambodian governm
ent to declare the whole of the CCPF area a UNESCO World Heritage Site; 4) Increase international pressure on protecting the forest area by leveraging national and international civil society networks, social media and mainstream media; 5) Encourage touris
ts and researchers to visit the Cardamoms in order to learn more about these unique and endangered landscapes as well as help create jobs and income in the area; 6) To become Cambodia&#x2019;s first green movement, made of environmentally aware Cambodians. Moth
er Nature does not have paid full-time personnel. As a volunteer-led non-profit movement, the members agree to remuneration that covers only their basic living costs, and no salaries are paid out. www.mothernature.pm</narrative>
