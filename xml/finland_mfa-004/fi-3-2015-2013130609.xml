   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Purpose of the project is to increase the competence of Church leaders in response to the spread of HIV and AIDS in the community and improve caring of People Living with HIV in Burundi. The project will facilitate the awareness raising on the rights o
f all people to reduce stigma and discrimination against people living with HIV/AIDS. The project will be implemented by the Fida partner in Burundi. The partner in this project is the Community of Pentecostal Churches in Burundi (CEPBU) the project will t
arget Church leaders who will benefit from the project&#x2019;s capacity building through trainings. Due to the increased myths and misconception on HIV and AIDS in the community, people living with HIV/AIDS have encountered inhuman treatment from other members
 of the society. Stigma and discrimination has so far hindered the process of HIV Prevention because people fear to go for HIV testing to know about their status. To respond effectively to this challenge, empowering Church leaders who have respected positi
ons in the community can reduce discrimination of people living with HIV and AIDS and enhance the knowledge on HIV and AIDS. During the implementation process, the project will enhance HIV and AIDS responses in the community by creating awareness and train
ing Church leaders on the basic facts of HIV/AIDS. The project will sensitize the community through community forums and church Meetings. The projects activities will involve top Church leaders training, Training of trainers, formulation of HIV and AIDS ma
terials, distribution of HIV materials to the trained Church leaders, formulation of HIV and AIDS policy, establishment of support groups of people living with HIV and AIDS and support to Orphans and vulnerable Children in their education. The goal of this
 project is to contribute to the reduction of the spread of HIV in the community and improve the wellbeing of people living with HIV and AIDS. Through a Just, safe and caring Church/partner, people infected and affected by HIV will have relief and find a s
afe place where people living with HIV and AIDS will be accommodated and involved in community activities.  The society will be transformed to create an HIV and AIDS friendly environment with zero stigmas and zero discrimination. People living with and aff
ected by HIV and AIDS will know their rights and enjoy their wellbeing.</narrative>
