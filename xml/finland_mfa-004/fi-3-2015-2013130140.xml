   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Livelihoods of rural communities in Zambia depend mainly on agriculture. Reliance on natural resources makes them very vulnerable to the effects of climate change such as shortened rain season extreme temperatures and more frequent droughts and floods. Alt
hough many farmers have observed climate variations over the past years they have a very limited knowledge of what is causing the changes and more importantly how to cope with them. This project addresses these issues by supporting the devel. of climate ch
ange adaptation strategies in four communities in Luanshya Monze and Mumbwa districts that are already affected by the changes.The project&apos;s overall objective is to build community resilience to the impacts of global warming through increased awareness and
 enhanced adaptive capacity in the project communities. The main beneficiaries 250 households (mainly small-scale farmers) involve 50/50 women and men and include young and disabled people. The project introduces sustainable innovations and climate-smart p
ractices that will be identified in cooperation with the communities as the most suitable in each context (e.g. agroforestry organic gardening and small livestock production). These activities support the diversification of income generation and a communit
y-driven response to climate change. The project also strengthens the advocacy skills of the community members in order to promote and safeguard their right to food rural employment safe environment and climate justice. The aim is that drawing on the lesso
ns learnt during the project the communities can contribute to evidence-based advocacy at the national level.The project promotes gender equality by empowering women to respond to the impacts of climate change and by involving them in related decision-maki
ng in the communities. Inequality will be reduced by including young and disabled people in local Project Management Committees and capacity building activities. This enables them to raise their views and needs as regards climate change adaptation and to p
articipate effectively in climate-sustainable economic activities. The project&apos;s main focus is on climate sustainability through resilient livelihoods. It also explores communities? options for preparing for and recovering from climate-related shocks.This 
is a new project but it utilises the experiences gained and best practices developed during GLM Zambia&apos;s previous sustainable development projects in rural communities.</narrative>
