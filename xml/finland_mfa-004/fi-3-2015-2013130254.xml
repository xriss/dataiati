   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Although Nepal has made tremendous progress on educational attainment lately the hard to reach group children in the project location villages of Gimdi Asrang and Thuladurlung of Lalitpur district are out of school the drop-out rate is high and the quality
 of education and school management is not satisfactory. Effective management of school and education is seriously problematic highly centralized and with inadequate local ownership.  Besides many community schools have become hotbeds of corruption with lo
cal leaders fighting for the appointment of teachers and resources.  The overall development objective is to attain improved status of education and literacy in project locations through efficient education governance in active engagement of community loca
l government and participation of children. Immediate objectives of the project are enhanced engagement of local governments in education planning and interventions, improved access to school management and quality of education with capacitated accountable
 and democratic School Management Committees (SMC), and increased engagement of parents community and children in educational planning and implementation.The project will enhance the right to quality education for easily marginalized groups such as dalit a
nd tamang (or janajati) children. Inclusive education is promoted to children with disabilities. These actions contribute also to reduction of inequalities. Majority of the target group children are girls and therefore special attention is paid to consider
 gender equality in all activities. Climate sustainability is also taken into account in awareness raising campaigns conducted by child clubs.The project has a comprehensive target group who are key actors on changing school and education environment. It i
ncludes the 4100 target children and their parents policy makers civil society actors media schoolteachers SMCs Parents Teachers Association (PTA) members and education officials. These groups are reached through different interventions, such as capacity b
uilding collaborative consultations with responsible authorities along with wider awareness campaigns and mass mobilizations. The project will be implemented in collaboration of Department of Education Ministry of Federal and Local Governance respective lo
cal governments and District Education Offices and other NGO coalitions active in the sector.</narrative>
