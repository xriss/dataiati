   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Tanzania Environmental and Tourism Educational Organization (TETEO) is liaising with other stakeholders to initiate develop promote and actively participate in activities that contribute to the conservation of nature and the improvement of the better life 
of Tanzania society.The previous project (2013 - 2014) aimed at establishing and promoting Community Based Nature Tourism for community better life in Mwanga District. Activities were successfully implemented but the challenge of conserving crucial attract
ions was raised by by stakeholders during Mwanga Tourism Conefence and project evaluation meeting. in 2014. the meeting recommended that strong initiatives must be taken immediately to conserve forests environment and all attractions in Mwanga and Same so 
as to make Community based Nature Tourism sustainable and profitable to the community. Also it was recommended that more education   and awareness on nature based tourism customer services and tourism entrepreneurship should be increased among the communit
y. Further TETEO came to realize that there is limited capacity of communities and district officials to undertake conservation and sustainable use of natural resources and tourist attractions, limited community focused joint programmes on conservation, li
mited established mechanism for cooperation networking and exchange of information for management of natural forests and tourism attractions and limited programmes for sensitizing communities on the importance and links between conservation livelihood and 
poverty alleviation. There are also limited alternative income generation activities that are friendly to environment and that return a higher value to the degraded environment and increase income to the community as well as create employment..TETEO would 
like to address the mentioned problems through, Capacity building in environment conservation Community Based Nature Tourism Service Production and Hospitality and entrepreneur skills, Also through awareness creation and promote alternative income generati
on activities( handcraft for women and youth tree nursery establishment and tree planting beekeeping biomass charcoaling cage and pond fish farming). Restoration of fragile Ecosystems for Nature Based tourism, Marketing and promoting local tourist attracti
ons products and services (mapping attractions distributing promotional materials and formulation of Village nature based tourism steering committees.</narrative>
