  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project improves working conditions of construction and forestry workers in Zambia and Mozambique through a multifaceted strategy. Numbers of members and their dues payments income are increased and the knowhow of members and their representatives is i
mproved. Negotiations are intensified and the quality of collective agreements improved, making use of e.g. multinational corporations mapping results, with the aim to influence working conditions of the whole production chain (including subcontractors and
 agency workers). Finally, a campaign is run for the ratification and implementation of ILO Conventions no. 94 (conditions in public investment projects) and no. 167 (health and safety in construction sector).Mozambique and Zambia belong to the fastest gro
wing economies in the world with their annual 7-8 % growth rates, which are mainly due to the vast natural resources in mining, oil, gas and forestry sectors. Alongside with these production sectors there are in both countries large on-going infrastructure
 projects that aim at supporting other economic growth. Despite the growth rates the majority of the population remains poor, because atypical forms of employment (such as agency labour and sub-contracting) are more the rule than the exception also in grow
th sectors like construction. Salary levels are inadequate for decent living and trade union resources are rather limited especially in the very challenging and mostly company level negotiation system. Through this project unions in Zambia and Mozambique c
an with our support increase their membership base and negotiation power, as well as influence legislation and public investments of their countries.Increased membership numbers, financial sustainability and improved know-how provide the unions with negoti
ation power and campaign visibility, and these in turn are likely to influence industrial policies of the sector.Beneficiaries are current and new members of the unions, shop stewards, health and safety representatives, campaign coordinators, organisers, e
ducators and lead negotiators in union leadership.The project is implemented by Building and Wood Workers? International (BWI) and its affiliate unions in Mozambique and Zambia.</narrative>
