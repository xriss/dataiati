   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project aims to contribute to the improvement of the economic status and quality of life of poor subsistence farmer families in 100 villages in Mahwa Block of Dausa district (Rajasthan India) through the provision and promotion of biogas technology. It
 is a continuation of the project ?Biogas as renewable energy source in Indian villages? funded by UFF and the Ministry for Foreign Affairs Finland in 2010-2012 and implemented by HPPI. The project had an overwhelmingly positive response from the beneficia
ries and the surrounding community.To achieve the project goal 400 biogas plants are constructed and follow-up activities are planned for 200 plants constructed during phase one. The new plants are built with a contribution from the farmers themselves as w
ell as with government subsidy. From the biogas plants families have access to a clean energy form that can be used for cooking and lighting. The use of bio-slurry the by-product of the fermentation process as farm manure increases agricultural output and 
also reduces expenditure under various heads such as energy chemical fertilizers/pesticides and irrigation. Farmers are grouped in clubs and trained in the use of the plants as well as improved agriculture techniques. Empowerment of women and improvement i
n their quality of life and health is also a key objective of the project. The adoption of biogas significantly reduces indoor air pollution directly leading to improved health. It also reduces the need for fetching firewood and time needed for cooking thu
s increasing time available for learning new skills or engaging in other productive activities. The project will promote the organization of women in Self Help Groups to create a forum where women can be trained on health + hygiene nutrition gain skills fo
r income generation and common saving systems which can help them to significantly improve their family economy.The results the project will achieve over a period of three years are: 400 biogas plants installed and follow-up on previously constructed 200 p
lants 15 masons trained for biogas plant construction agricultural productivity and yield increased 30% savings on household expenditure 100 farmers clubs and 100 women?s Self Help Groups formed 200 beneficiaries getting government support for the construc
tion of the plants women?s work load decreased by 2h/day indoor air pollution decreased by 80% and 20% increase in girls going to school.</narrative>
