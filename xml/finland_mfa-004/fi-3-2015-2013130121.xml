  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In Dar es Salaam DSM Tanzania around 80% of the population lack of improved sanitation and water services. These people live mainly in informal settlements and lack of resources to improve their living conditions. The project aims to improve the social wel
lbeing of the population living in informal settlements by ensuring universal access to improved sanitation and water services. In addition the project intends to increase economic growth and ensures sustainability by promoting the creation of a sustainabl
e community based enterprise. In Keko Machungwa an informal settlement in DSM there is a group of mostly women from the Federation of Urban Poor called PHAST Ujenzi PU who has started activities to address sanitation issues together with a local NGO Center
 for Community Initiatives. However these women have faced many challenges due to the lack of funds and the lack of further knowledge and skills on sanitation. Through this project PU will be trained on all topics related with dry sanitation (DT) and they 
will be empowered so that they can create and run a social enterprise that will provide sanitation services (training and construction of facilities). Dry sanitation will be strongly encouraged because of all the advantages that this system offers: no need
 of complex infrastructure easy to maintain ecological appropriate for places with high water tables (this is the case in DSM) opportunity to use waste as fertilizer. Water harvesting is encouraged and integrated to tackle the issue of water shortage. The 
social enterprise will also commercialize urine and compost as fertilizers and it will sell vegetables grown by using these fertilizers. The project also contains educational events and workshops and production of written visual and audio material to infor
m people about the importance of adequate sanitation and hygiene and about the advantages to use DT and organic fertilizers. In the first year PU will build DT in Keko Machungwa which is located in Temeke municipality (subdistrict/area) second year in Ving
unguti in Ilala municipality and in the third year in Tandale in Kinondoni municipality. By covering these three informal settlements all municipalities of DSM are influenced which ensures the possibility to multiply the sanitation activities in the future
. Dry toilets will be built in households and in schools. Special attention will be given to accessibility in order to avoid exclusion of any marginal group</narrative>
