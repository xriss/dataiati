   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project is a joint venture of the Youth Academy International Solidarity Foundation Media Education Center Metka and Finland&apos;s Somalia network. The project consists of carrying out video trailer workshops in middle schools high schools as well as secon
dary vocational schools. The aim of the workshops is to contemplate possibilities to act with solidarity on different levels of society and to perform deeds of solidarity. The workshops also introduce the idea of agency in the South and include a critical 
examination of the picture portrayed of developing countries in the media. The videotrailers made by young people will also spur debate on development issues outside the workshops. The workshops will be carried out in the spring semester 2016 and autumn se
mester 2016.The workshops will be conducted by trained workshop leaders in several different regions in Finland. All the material needed to conduct the workshops as well as a detailed script of the workshop will be produced during the project. When develop
ing the details and contents of the workshops young people will be consulted to make sure the final workshops are inspiring and such that work in the school reality. There will also be middle schools interns involved in developing the project.This project 
continues the series of global education project carried out by Youth Academy since 2005. During the years 2009-2014 global grassroot comics workshops were held in Finnish schools. Video trailers are a natural continuation to comics workshops as this metho
d also embraces personal reflection on global issues as well as the possibilities of an individual to act and influence. With these methods young people have the chance to create and complete their own story which is an empowering experience. Also new tech
nologies are being used and there is a multitide of ways to share the end products.During the project the digital stories of the young people will be shared online and also an exhibition of the stories will be organized. Local actors of the educational sec
tor will be informed of the workshops and outcome.</narrative>
