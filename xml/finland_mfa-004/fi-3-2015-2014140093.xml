   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Children&#x2019;s access to education is limited; it is estimated that less than 15% of girls between 6 and 15 years of age are attending school in Greater Mundri, and less than a half of them never reach high school. In addition to limited access, the quality 
of education remains poor. Schools are understaffed and it is estimated that over 60% of the primary school teachers have no formal training or even completed primary school and thus lack the skills and knowledge to work as qualified teachers. A limited nu
mber of institutions train teachers and most of them are too costly for high school graduates from poor rural families to access.Another critical challenge facing the newly independent South Sudan is the provision of job opportunities to the youth. In Mund
ri area, besides the agricultural activities that engage over 90% of the population, livelihoods coping strategies for the youth are often limited to motorbike taxi driving and petty jobs offered by the informal businesses. The majority of the youth is ill
iterate and lack marketable skills. The limited livelihood opportunities for the youth has the potential to increase their risk of engaging in alcohol abuse, violent conflicts and petty crimes as alternative coping strategies. The project addresses the edu
cation and livelihood related challenges faced by the youth in the Mundri area of South Sudan. The overall objective of the project is to strengthen the quality of primary education and to improve the livelihood opportunities of the youth through vocationa
l training.   The project is thus divided in two different components: Teachers training (component I) and Vocational training (component II). Teachers training in Kotobi Institute of Teacher Education (KITE) will provide training for at least 60 pre-servi
ce teachers &#x2013; when possible 30 males and 30 females- every two years as well as upgrade the skills of 190 in-service primary school teachers every two years. Additionally the project aims at following on graduate teachers and coach them on the job, build
 education leadership in Greater Mundri Counties and support trainee teachers from remote areas with full board. In addition, KITE&#x2019;s management and teaching are supported through the Teacher&#x2019;s without Borders initiative by a Finnish volunteer teacherTh
e Vocational training in The Kotobi Skills Development Centre (KoSDec) aims at renovate existing physical infrastructure to accommodate trainings and trainees from remote areas and provide them with basic board, resource and staff the vocational skills tra
ining centre. The project supports curriculum development, so that the youth can be trained on employable skills such as masonry/draftsmanship, carpentry/joinery, welding/fabrication, catering/bakery and tailoring, business management, civic education and 
accelerated adult literacy. The project is seeking to involve 50 % of women for both groups of trainees. The project includes also advocacy work for both components:&#x2022; Advocate for the Ministry of Labour and Ministry of Education to give an accreditation 
for both KITE and KoSDeC in order to be able to issue homologated certificates to the students upon completion of the courses. &#x2022; Advocate for the South Sudan government to promote vocational skills in the country through number of key strategies, includi
ng the creation of national vocational training trust. Implementing partner is Mundri Relief and Development Association (MRDA).</narrative>
