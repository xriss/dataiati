   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Children?s access to education is limited, it is estimated that less than 15% of girls between 6 and 15 years of age are attending school in Greater Mundri, and less than a half of them never reach high school. In addition to limited access, the quality of
 education remains poor. Schools are understaffed and it is estimated that over 60% of the primary school teachers have no formal training or even completed primary school and thus lack the skills and knowledge to work as qualified teachers. A limited numb
er of institutions train teachers and most of them are too costly for high school graduates from poor rural families to access.Another critical challenge facing the newly independent South Sudan is the provision of job opportunities to the youth. In Mundri
 area, besides the agricultural activities that engage over 90% of the population, livelihoods coping strategies for the youth are often limited to motorbike taxi driving and petty jobs offered by the informal businesses. The majority of the youth is illit

tion and livelihood related challenges faced by the youth in the Mundri area of South Sudan. The overall objective of the project is to strengthen the quality of primary education and to improve the livelihood opportunities of the youth through vocational 
training.   The project is thus divided in two different components: Teachers training (component I) and Vocational training (component II). Teachers training in Kotobi Institute of Teacher Education (KITE) will provide training for at least 60 pre-service
 teachers ? when possible 30 males and 30 females- every two years as well as upgrade the skills of 190 in-service primary school teachers every two years. Additionally the project aims at following on graduate teachers and coach them on the job, build edu
cation leadership in Greater Mundri Counties and support trainee teachers from remote areas with full board. In addition, KITE?s management and teaching are supported through the Teacher?s without Borders initiative by a Finnish volunteer teacherThe Vocati
onal training in The Kotobi Skills Development Centre (KoSDec) aims at renovate existing physical infrastructure to accommodate trainings and trainees from remote areas and provide them with basic</narrative>
