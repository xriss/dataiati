  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Haiti is one of the most vulnerable in the world to the effects of climate change. There is a lack of knowledge on causes and consequences of climate change on all levels. The project supports local level projects that combine awareness-raising and sensiti
sation of CBOs and communities on climate change, to the support to sustainable livelihoods options. This work is accompanied by advocacy on the national level towards the duty-bearers responsible of planning and implementing climate policies that should b
enefit and protect the Haitian population. The overall objective is to strengthen the resilience of farmers and communities affected by food insecurity, through the implementation of priority actions to adapt to climate change to enhance food production sy
stems. 1. Awareness of local populations, organisations and authorities is raised on climate change and food security: Awareness-raising campaigns through 50 community radios and network of SAKS CBOs; Preparation and distribution of outreach materials in C
reole.  2. Stronger Haitian CSOs undertake advocacy and participate in the development and extension of Government&#x2019;s plans and policies on Agricultural Adaptation (PANA), Climate Resilience (PNRC) and Food security (PNSAN): Financial support for the oper
ation of Civil Society Platform on Climate Change (PSC-CC); diffusion of policies; mapping of interventions on Climate Change in Haiti; Advocacy activities at national level with parliament, political parties, CSOs and universities. 3. Local people&#x2019;s res
ilience is improved by enhancing production systems, strengthening the technical capacity of small farmers and dissemination of best practices and relevant information: A call for proposals for projects on community adaptation to climate change and food se
curity; evaluation of proposals; development of baselines; monitoring tools for community projects; their monitoring and evaluation, auditing.4. Strengthened organisational and technical capacities of local partners of community projects: Assessment of org
anisational and administrative capacity; Development of training plans; organisation of training sessions.The rights-holders of the community projects are farmers on small plots (1 ha or less), vulnerable families, single-parent households and members of c
ommunity-based peasant organisations. The target groups of the awareness-raising workshops will be of two types: 1) The central and local authorities and managers of the decentralised state institutions on central, departmental and communal level; 2) Organ
isations and Civil Society Networks and community media.The project is coordinated jointly between several members of ACT Alliance Haiti Forum members, through the Forum&#x2019;s Climate Change Working Group. A local member, Service Chretien d&#x2019;Haiti (SCH), is
 in charge of the practical project coordination and implementation, and supporting to local partners that implement community projects with CBOs.</narrative>
