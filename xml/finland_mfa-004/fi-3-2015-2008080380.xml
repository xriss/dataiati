   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The programme works for the improvement of rural communities? socio-economic situation and quality of life, as well for the strengthening of community capacities and enhancing children?s in Mogotio, Western Kenya.The 2012 evaluation showed a clear improvem
ent in key areas , though still only a fifth of the population have access to clean water (2007: 8.7%). When a child is ill, health services are now used  by 80 percent of the mothers ( 27% in 2007 ), and 92.7 %  children are vaccinated. Children&apos;s rights 
have become known in the community, 95.5 % of the population now knows what child maltreatment means. The knowledge on how HIV infections are spread and on testing and support facilities has increased within the population of Mogotio. The evaluation recomm
ends that the next period of work focus would shift more and more to strengthen local capacity. In particular, access to clean water and sanitation and malnutrition among children is still a challenge.The new five -year plan has been completed and the firs
t year of Implementation has started. Increasing the availability of clean drinking water has been initiated through the rehabilitation of water points. In addition co-operation with the Ministry of Health has been started to diminish water related disease
s and diarrhea and a campaign has been launched for every household and school to get a toilet. Cooperation has also been done with the Ministry of Health through training of community health workers  on the care and follow-up of the health of children and
 expectant mothers.  In addition emphasize has been given to birth registration. Children&apos;s participation in collective decision-making is encouraged through Children&apos;s Parliament and the situation of women and girls are supported through focus on harmful 
traditions such as female genital mutilation and early marriages, as well as acts of violence against girls. The program beneficiaries are the 23,500 persons living in the programme area. The main partner is World Vision Kenya that runs the implementation 
and accounts for the use of funding.</narrative>
