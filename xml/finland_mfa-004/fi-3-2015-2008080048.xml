   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The overall objective of the information society and ICT-sector development project (TANZICT) is to enhance  Tanzania?s socio-economic development in accordance with national development strategies and national vision 2025 by strengthening national sector 
guidance and coordination as well as science-  technology-  and innovation capacity and public ?private sector cooperation. The project started in 2011. The project purpose is on the one hand to facilitate revision of the government?s ICT policy and streng
thening of the capacity of the Ministry of Communication Science and Technology of Tanzania (MCST) and national institutions and on the other hand strengthening of the business environment in Tanzania especially from a perspective of technology enterprises
 and innovations. Practical innovation solutions will be developed within the framework of the innovation program.  Project?s mid-term review was carried out in 2013. The mid-term review brought out that the components related to the revision of government
?s ICT-policy and strengthening of the ministry had faced problems and delays but the innovation component had instead  progressed well and produced significant results.  Innovation spaces have been created for young technology entrepreneurs which has prom
oted generation of well-functioning entrepreneur communities.  Community based innovation activity has also got off a good start in six regions as well as business incubator activity and cooperation with the most important universities in Tanzania. The mid
-term review found that the project had also promoted the IT-skills entrepreneurship and innovation of vulnerable groups (women disabled youthpeople of remote and poor communities). The mid-term review recommended additional funding for the innovation comp
onent in order to achieve the original objectives and increase their impact further. The objective of the additional funding is to apply well-functioning concepts of Finland?s innovation system more broadly in Tanzania increase support to women entrepreneu
rs Living Lab centers and innovation spaces. The revision of ICT-policy and strengthening of the capacity of the Ministry are progressing again after delays.  The original budget for the project is 5 million euros. Additional funding is 08 million euros. T
he project period is 2011-15. Main actors: MCST COSTECH universities civil society organizations and private enterprises. Support services : Niras Finland Oy.</narrative>
