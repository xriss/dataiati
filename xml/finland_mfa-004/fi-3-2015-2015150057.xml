  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Sudanese women are faced with many challenges most of which are inherent to the very structural inequalities within the Sudanese society. Yet leaning on a strong history of women movement and activism and with a considerable support of international actors
 on human rights and also with the growing conscious of the right-based development approach the women movement in Sudan is currently addressing those challenges with courage and solidarity. It is very clear that Sudanese women have not yet able to enjoy t
he political and economic rights they strived for and gained since the 1970s. Participation of women in the public place is still far behind the desired goal of Sudanese women. According to our analysis we believe that the discriminatory laws that prevail 
at the private place (mainly family household and local communities) have contiuously crippled and chained women from being able to participate publically. SORD is a right based and gender focused membership civil society organization working for social ju
stice democracy and human rights in Sudan. SORD started a project targeting 500 illiterate women in Omdurman (Khartoum state) to erase their illiteracy by adopting a participatory right based curricula which is a slight modification to the international RE
FLECT methodology for adult education. That EU funded project ended in  July 2014. The project helped in establishing 20 literacy classes for 511 women who completed 9 months of education. 70% of those women can read write and know the basics of arithmetic
. More important than that is the fact that those women are now literate about their rights in the areas of education health political participation economic rights and family laws. This literacy is inherent in the contents of the syllabi themselves. The E
U funding depends on call for proposals and the next call is not expected before 2015. Looking at the areas of work of the Finland embassy especially the human rights and gender equality themes fit quite well with this project. The fact that this funding i
s a one year funding also make it logical to continue on an already going on initiative to ensure sustainability and impact.</narrative>
