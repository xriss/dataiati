   <narrative xml:lang="EN">AYB - Community Development in Matareya and Boulaq Abo Ela</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">AYB believes that communities are the heart of sustainable development and out of this belief this community development project aims to empower community members in Matareya and Boulaq Abo Ela and engage them in the development process. From one hand the 
project will develop the capacities of two local community organizations in order to enhance the services they provide to their communities. It will work with a participative approach to foster the inclusion of community members in the decision-making proc
ess and to improve their status in their community in addition to giving further visibility to women and youth as important actors of local development. AYB will do that by formulating a local community committee in each target area composed of the youth v
olunteers staff from the local organizations and other community members which will work to ensure that communities come up with their own developmental community initiatives that address problems from their own point of view rather than just having them i
mplementing imposed ideas from external actors that ignore the realities of the target communities. On the other hand it will help spreading the sense of volunteerism and civic engagement among 300 youth by providing them with the skills they need to cause
 change within their communities through peer-education carried out by AYB?s franchise members at the target areas with the premise that most young people feel more comfortable receiving information from people of the same age group rather than from adults
. AYB will also provide technical support and coaching for creating new activities ensuring that the group dynamic is working and helping them resolve any potential problems. Finally by that this project will promote community engagement in disadvantaged a
reas by applying a ?strength-based? approach aimed at enhancing and maximizing the assets that the communities already possess. The community members are supported in making their ideas a reality by tapping into local community-based resources as well as c
ollaborating with local businesses community leaders family members etc. to help them reach their developmental goals, ensuring community buy-in at all levels.</narrative>
