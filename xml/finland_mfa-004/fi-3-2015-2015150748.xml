   <narrative xml:lang="EN">India has not signed the UN Refugee Convention, but is receiving asylum seekers. For asylum seekers arriving from neighboring countries in India the state grants assistance in obtaining refugee status. Arriving from elsewhere have to apply for refugee stat
us through the UNHCR. This policy divides asylum-seekers into two unequal groups. During the process, the applicant must be able to demonstrate to be entitled for refugee status defined in accordance with international law criteria. The project aims to str
engthen the asylum seekers legal status and their understanding of their rights as asylum seekers, as well as to improve their capacity to achieve the UNHCR calling for a process of refugee status. The project main objective is to inform and provide legal 
advice to asylum seekers. The project target group in India is asylum seekers who apply for refugee status through the UNHCR. These people are mainly from Afghanistan, Burma and Somalia. In addition, the smaller extent of asylum seekers are arriving from t
he Democratic Republic of the Congo, Syria, and Sudan. A large part of ARA&apos;s clients are arriving from Afghanistan. Women and children have been taken into account in the target group because of their especially vulnerable status. The Ara Trust is a human 
rights organization founded in February 2013, which focuses on the provision of legal advice to refugees and asylum-seekers in India. The organization is India&apos;s first and so far the only organization that provides legal advice to refugees and asylum seeke
rs. It is the only Indian NGO that has signed with the UNHCR the Letter of Understanding, a document that formally assigns ARA&apos;s unique role of refugees and asylum seekers facing a legal center. www.aralegal.in</narrative>
