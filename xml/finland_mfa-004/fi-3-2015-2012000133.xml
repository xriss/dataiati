   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Forest resources are used unsustainably in and around Kiwengwa-Pongwe Forest Reserve because of poor farming techniques lack of available land and limited livelihood opportunities in the 12 villages surrounding it. For the same reasons the communities also
 suffer from food insecurity which threatens their right to adequate food. Project aims to tackle these development problems by enhancing sustainable forest management including both conservation and sound usage of forest resources and improving food secur
ity of these communities. To achieve its objectives the project supports agroforestry and other livelihoods such as sea shell and sea weed farming and livestock and beekeeping by providing training and initial material support to groups of community member
s hoping to develop their livelihoods. It also supports tree planting establishes tree nurseries in the area builds wood fuel saving stoves raises environmental awareness and provides capacity building to community based forestry actors.The development pol
icy objectives of gender equality and reduction of inequality are met by supporting livelihood groups of women and agricultural production in which women have an important role and by improving the availability of stable food crops crucial to the most vuln
erable members in the communities. Integrating trees into farming systems planting trees promoting improved stoves and livelihoods relying on forest well-being will conserve biodiversity and biomass in the area so as to combat climate change. While diversi
fying local people&apos;s livelihoods will help the communties to adapt to the effects of climate change.The direct beneficiaries of the project are the 26 supported groups engaging in their livelihood initiatives 200 households receiving wood fuel saving stove
s 11 Forest Conservation Committees (FCCs) and the local partner DFNR. In the end the project benefits the entire village communities of approximately 28 000 inhabitants by improving the access and availability of food in their villages. The project is mai
nly working with the existing structures of and between DFNR FCCs and the village communities but it also supports the activities of newly established umbrella organization of FCCs called Kiwengwa-Pongwe Community Forest Conservation Network (K-P CFCN). K-
P CFCN will receive capacity training during the project for it to fully function as a community based organization enhancing local level forest management in the future.</narrative>
