   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Integration of Vulnerable Women into the Society. This project aims to provide vulnerable women with a safe environment to live in when they leave the safe houses or the prison. We want to provide these women with a better chance after leaving institutiona
l care and to help them re-build their lives and to make different life choices. We want to see a reduction in the re-trafficking rate of victims of trafficking in Albania through this work. Fida will be partnering with &#x2018;The Christian Society for Albania
n Prisoners&#x2019; in Albania. They are a recognised charity in Albania which has been registered since 2002 with the Albanian government. They have been running educational projects in the female prisoners for the past five years. This project will be working
 directly with vulnerable women as they leave prison or the safe houses. Many of the girls and women have no home to go to when they leave prison or the safe house; their families often don&#x2019;t want them back which put them at high risk of being re-traffic
ked. Once a girl leaves we will meet them at the prison gates or at the safe house to transport them to their new accommodation. We will help with their adjustment to independent living and support them in finding employment. If they have completed the sew
ing course we will be able to link them into the business we are running. We will help the individual make a network of friends through work, through church and within the community. We also will be assisting in the reunification with their families and fo
r the women who have children to try and bring them back together. To assist in the rehabilitation of women prisoners and victims of trafficking by providing them with the skills and support needed to successfully reintegrate back into society as productiv
e members.</narrative>
