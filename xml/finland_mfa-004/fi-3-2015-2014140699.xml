   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Turkana is in many ways the most underdeveloped area in Kenya. The proposed project aims to improve the area?s wellbeing by providing assistance in water supply and sanitation sectors in the neediest villages in northern Turkana County which have been sele
cted by the Turkana community themselves.During the project efforts are made to repair and rehabilitate dysfunctional water wells in the project area. In addition ca. 10 new wells with water pans and 10-20 hygienic latrines will be built and also the commu
nities are educated in the proper ways to operate and manage the mentioned facilitie.The Turkanas haven?t needed to pay fees regarding the use of drinkable water in the past. We have learned during our preparatory mission that most of the wells built in th
e Turkana County have not been properly handed over to the consumers/villages which has led to poor understanding on the ownership and responsibility issues. During the project WaterFinns develops together with the Turkana communities a maintenance and man
agement model which will be implemented in the use of the water points and the improved hygienic environment.The perennial boreholes will contribute to people living in stationary villages near schools increase the attendance in schools and decrease the nu
mber of people affected by using unsafe drinking water. This will provide a steady and healthy environment for the children and youth to grow up in.The Project aims to achieve its purpose through three interlinked results (outputs):1: Lessons learned from 
success and failure of long-term sustainability of rural WASH services reported and benchmarks of best practices promoted.2: Strengthened capacities of selected CBOs village spokesmen and wards in their management and efforts of further improving the WASH 
services.3: Improved WASH facilities in selected communities in order to fulfill their needs and HR requirements on a sustainable basis.A key element of the proposed project is to create opportunities for the future water sector professionals to have an in
teresting and unique possibility to participate in voluntary work which focuses on long-term learning of the sustainable schemes.The proposed project partner (GWAKO) has amble experience to carry out rural water and sanitation projects and they also have e
xperience in working in the northern Turkana County.  The proposed project would last two-and-a-half years (2015-2017) and its proposed budget is 257 200 ?.</narrative>
