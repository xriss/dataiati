   <narrative xml:lang="EN">F.a: Entrepreneurship and livelihoods development of vulnerable households and Innovations in Value Chain Systems in Walikale</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The predominant problem in Walikale is the difficulty to find alternative means of living; lack of work both in the formal and non-formal sector, lack of access to savings and credit, lack of access to markets and understanding of how they work, and limite
d economic opportunities in the villages. Food insecurity and chronic malnutrition is still prevalent in some areas.There are a number of NGOs active in the targeted areas but none of them work in the livelihoods sector, where needs are considerable. Most 
NGOs work in the humanitarian relief, including food security and education in emergencies. 80% of the women do not currently exercise their income generating activities, despite many of them being the main bread winners and care takers of their families. 
The coping strategies are such as small kitchen gardens and small livestock.Objective of the project: The targeted community members have enhanced skills and capacity to practice income generating activities, contributing to increased incomes and reduced v
ulnerability.Activities: &#x2022; Cash for work activities for a cash injection for the vulnerable households and to contribute to the create sustainable assets at the community level including small infrastructure and construction&#x2022; Trainings in income genera
ting activities; basics of how to run a business&#x2022; Create Village Saving and Loan Associations (VSLA) to promote savings&#x2022; Support small scale business creation and provide advice and counselling on commercial and agricultural activities&#x2022; Structure the
 agricultural producers in networks (cooperatives) and support local initiatives  for the transformation and commercialisation of the products&#x2022; Other innovative approaches for small scale business and value chain development&#x2022; Advocacy Rights-holders /b
eneficiaries: Vulnerable women (50%) and youth and other community members. The estimated number of direct beneficiaries will be finalised after the baseline study.The specific beneficiary selection criteria will be fine-tuned later but beneficiary identif
ication criteria may include access to land and some existing assets; average household income and ration of children at school/children having finalised the primary school (six years). Extra care will be taken not to exclude but to ensure active participa
tion by women and other vulnerable members in the targeted communities.Implementing partner:The proposed partner for the project is ALPM (Actions pour la Lutte contre la pauvrete et la Malnutrition). ALPM is a local NGO, and a new partner organisation for 
FCA. ALPM has been also accepted as a partner by UNDP. They are currently implementing cash for work type of activities and will bring relevant expertise in the domain. They are present in Walikale and they know the area and the local communities well and 
has extensive contacts in the region.</narrative>
