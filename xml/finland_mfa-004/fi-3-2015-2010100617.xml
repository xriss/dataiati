   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The purpose of the project is to strengthen the Community Based Rehabilitation (CBR) program of the partner which provides services to children with disabilities in the community. The project is implementation by the Free Pentecostal Church of Tanzania (FP
CT) who is Fida&apos;s partner in Tanzania and targets 500 Children and Youth living with disability in Tanga region. Insufficient care and quality service to children with disabilities under five years has so many consequences. Neglect and denial to the childr
en&apos;s rights to basic needs such as nutritious food, good shelter and clothes have impacted children with disability negatively.  Poor living conditions of families have also contributed so much to insufficient support to these children. Both children and t
heir families will need support to reverse the trend. To respond to the core problem, the project will continue strengthening the community-based rehabilitation services and care to children with disabilities. The intervention will be guided by the current
 WHO-CBR matrix in tackling some aspects of disability challenges. The improved care and quality of CBR services for children with disabilities under five years old include integrated nutrition, medical support and mobility assistive equipment. The project
 will also focus on child sponsorship, family empowerment through micro-credit programs and training on sustainable food security. The project&apos;s goal is to contribute to the wellbeing of children with disabilities and their families through a just, safe an
d caring partner in Tanzania. Family members and other community members will be committed and responsible for taking care of their children and youth with disabilities. The community-based rehabilitation program will be improved to enhance self reliance a
nd sustainability.</narrative>
