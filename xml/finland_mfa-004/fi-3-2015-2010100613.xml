   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Project Purpose is to increase the engagement of Fida partners in Eastern Africa on advocacy issues through awareness raising and trainings.  Advocating for human rights brings about positive changes, strengthening civil society and creating a legitima
te space for the protection and promotion of everyone&apos;s rights. Inadequate knowledge on advocacy and absence of leadership guidelines in advocacy has hold back the Church partner from advocacy actions. Fida Partners in Eastern Africa are Full Gospel Church
es of Kenya (FGCK), Pentecostal Churches of Uganda (PCU), Free Pentecostal Church of Tanzania (FPCT), Ethiopian Guenet Church (EGC), Ethiopian Full Gospel Believers Church (EFGBC), the Community of Pentecostal Churches in Burundi (CEPBU), Association of Pe
ntecostal Church of Rwanda (ADEPR) and the Pentecostal Churches in Central Africa (CEPAC). The project will be implemented by Fida Eastern Africa Advocacy Programme through these partners. The target groups are the partners and the people who have had thei
r human rights trampled on like people with disabilities, people living with HIV, children and the voiceless. These people are included in the training and articulate the issues themselves (&quot;human rights by people&quot;, not only &quot;human rights for people&quot;). At 
the same time, the partners are challenged to advocate for, with and through those whose rights are violated. It is the right of every person to be safe from harm, to be treated fairly and with dignity, to live the life they choose, and to have an active p
art in their community and wider society. Human rights has to do with core values that is important for all people based on fairness, respect, equality, dignity and autonomy. The project will empower Fida Partners in Eastern Africa through awareness and tr
ainings on advocacy and support them to develop policy guidelines on advocacy interventions. The project will develop training materials to be used by partners in training and conduct trainings on the manual. Partners will be supplied with every necessary 
material on advocacy responses. The project will monitor and report on the advocacy implementation process. The project aims at contributing to the reduction of violation of human rights through increased involvement of partners in advocating for human rig
hts.  The expected impact is that those who were voiceless will have a voice through the empowered partners and their rights honoured. By the end of the program there should be an improvement in the Human Development Indicators, Human Development Index, Ge
nder Inequality Index, and Corruption Perception Index in Burundi, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda.</narrative>
