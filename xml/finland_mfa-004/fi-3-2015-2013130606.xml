   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The purpose of the project is to increase sustainable and potable water supply for Human and Livestock in Moyale district. Due to prolonged dry spells every Year, Women and children walk long distances up to 7Kms to collect water for domestic use. Young me
n move from one place to another in search of pastures and water for their livestock. The Project will enable the community to access water close to their villages. The Fida partner in Moyale Project is Ethiopian Mulu Wongel Amagnoch Church Development Org
anization (EMWACD) which is a faith based non-profit making indigenous Organization initiated in 1993 and registered officially in October 2009 as an ?Ethiopian Residents Charity?. The partner has a long history and presence in this community and therefore
 understands them well. Moyale is an area which has experienced drought throughout ages. Springs and rivers dried long time ago due to human activities which affected the environment. Sustainable water sources are scarce and cannot be accessed by all commu
nities living in Moyale district. There have been frequent conflicts between the communities as they struggle for the few water points.       The Project will collaborate with the community to construct a water pond which will collect rainy water which hap
pens once in a while. The community will be empowered through training by the project on how to manage the water Pond and protect the environment surrounding the Pond area. The community will be sensitized on peace building and conflict prevention so that 
they don?t harm their neighbours who might come for the same water point. Both Women and men will be empowered on how to use water effectively in their different uses. Through the Project, part of the communities living in Moyale will have access to drinki
ng water for humans and their livestock. There will be increased productivity in homes as a result of reduced long distances to fetch water. Conflicts between pastoralists who travel other places to search water for their Livestock will reduce. Pastoralist
s value water more than any other commodity. It is therefore expected that the wellbeing of the communities will be improved.</narrative>
