   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project &apos;Healthy and well-nourished children studying&apos; is based on development cooperation work by the NGO Martsarin kummikouluyhdistys conducted in Kilingi area North Tanzania for nearly 30 years now. The people of the area are poor and the families c
annot afford educating their children without monetary help. The poor infrastructure of education (school premises) makes it difficult to deliver education - the state should take care of maintaining school buildings but this has not been possible. Healthc
are is also underdeveloped in the area and AIDS and malaria complicate the life of the community. Safeguarding basic education to all children of the area making health care available and enhancing the health conditions of the population by improving sanit
ation and by health instruction are core topics and goals in the voluntary work of the NGO. The aim is to help the community so that children and especially girls can go to school without financial limitation. The NGO also supports young people in their fu
rther education and thus securing better future for themselves. The school heath care work started by the NGO is specific in the area and there is good progress in preventing diseases (see attachment report by the school nurse Edita Tesha).The main benefic
iaries of the project are school children. The main activities for the funding period are maintenance and development of the health care system in the primary and secondary school of Kilingi by supplementing the equipment and increasing health education de
velopment of school education and the learning environment as well as improving sanitation by building new toilets to the school. The health education is beneficial also for the families of the pupils.Of the cross-cutting objectives of the Finnish developm
ent cooperation policy the actions of this project implement especially these two: promoting gender equality and reducing of inequality of all kind. Making education possible for all children secures their future especially in the case of girls and the liv
ing conditions of the poor people are improved by appropriate sanitation making it easier to take care of basic need. The project implements very well several of the principles in the guidelines of civil society  for NGO development cooperation giving for 
example the opportunity to a large number of NGO members the opportunity to a personal experience of development cooperation.</narrative>
