   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Currently Rent to Own Zambia Limited (RtO) focuses its business on the higher income farmers and shop owners to minimize the risk of default. However Rent-to-Own has seen potential for growth in the lower income farmers and shop owners but has not yet expl
ored this potential due to the high risks involved. Lower income clients are more vulnerable to changes in the market and the regular demands of life. To reach these clients a fundamental change to how the company operates will be required.  This shift is 
based on the key contact each client has with RtO. If the key contact the Field Officer is well trained on the specific type of business the client is operating then this Field Officer can provide in depth advice on how to succeed. The current model RtO Fi
eld Officers are operating with requires them to give advice on 7 different types of businesses and has proven to be limiting. 90% of RtO&apos;s sales come from just three products; irrigation pumps refrigeration and maize mills. Expand on the current agent net
work by hiring and training Field Officers to provide support to clients on how to succeed. This will be done for the top three selling products namely; maize mills irrigation pumps and refrigeration. Additional training will be provided on record keeping 
maintenance and marketing skills. This should allow an entirely new set of Clients to access RtO&apos;s services. This model will be trialled and implemented throughout the whole company. However in order to ring fence the FLC funding and be able to demonstrate
 the direct impact of the FLC funding it is our suggestion to use the FLC allocated funds for the development and implementation of this new model in Central province only. RtO uses cutting-edge communications technology to manage a widespread field operat
ion that is fast efficient and effective. A centralized cloud-based management system keeps each member of the Rent-to-Own team up to date with the latest information on their clients. RtO management team also gains access to instantaneously updated overvi
ews of their portfolio and operations. An automated SMS system also sends clients reminders and keeps them informed of the status of their applications.</narrative>
