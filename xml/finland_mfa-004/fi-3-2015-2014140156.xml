  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project improves the capacity and cooperation of steel, mining and energy sector unions to ensure that they can effectively defend and represent workers? interests in five target states in India.The cooperation between the trade unions in these sectors
 has long been minimal, and the rate of organization in these sectors is low. Labour right violations are common especially in the mining sector. The project strengthens the rate of organization and significantly contributes to the cooperation between the 
unions, so that they can better represent and guard the interests of the workers. The ability of the unions to operate in member recruitment, promotion of Occupational Health and Safety (OHS), collective bargaining and solving of disputes will become more 
efficient. In a more concrete way, in 2014?2016 the project aims at getting 35,000 new members to the unions, creating a permanent professional pool of organisers (252 actives), a pool of trade union trainers (84 trainers), functioning OHS committees and 8
4 OHS trainers. The trade union structures of the states are strengthened and they become self-sufficient.  The beneficiaries are the permanent and short-term workers and white collar workers in the steel, mining and energy sectors. In addition, the organi
sers, trainers, OHS representatives, union representatives at the workplaces, actives and the leadership in the Indian affiliates of IndustriALL in the states of Orissa, Jharkhand, Chattisgarh, Maharastra and Andhra Pradesh will benefit from the project.  
Main partner is IndustriALL Global Union, which coordinates the project. The implementing unions are IndustriALL?s Indian affiliates on selected sectors and states.</narrative>
