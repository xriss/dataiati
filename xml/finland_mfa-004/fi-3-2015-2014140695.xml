   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Nyagowa Water Supply</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Kenya has approximately 40 million people and nearly half of the population lack clean drinking water. Nyagowa is situated in an area where water sometimes is found only in small water streams and where cattle and people have to share the same water source
. Drinking water is fetched from streams or from shallow wells water which is not drinkable untreated. In many cases water is collected from roofs and roofs may sometimes be carriers of various diceases spread by birds and small vector animals. Some roofin
g materials are also hazardous for peoples health. Up to 50 % of the deceases are waterborne deceases.The plan of the project is therefore to provide the health facility schools and the local community with clean drinking water which need not to be boiled 
before consumption. If the water flow is high enough the excess water will be led to water basins for the cattle.The plan of the project is to drill a hole to groundwater level in order to pump up clean drinkable water. The pumping system will be driven by
 solar energy (with an option to use landline electricity at times) which is an environment friendly sustainable and affordable way for the people to get clean water. Water will be distributed to strategically well placed water stations through a piping sy
stems and excess water will be distributed to drinking basins for the cattle. Concerning the sanitary conditions there are outdoor latrines built on a two-three meters deep wells in most of the homes. Hygiene is cared for either in streams or in private pl
aces specifically arranged for this nearby the homes. This project will therefore mostly concentrate on how to protect clean water from being contaminated and to encourage people to construct protected latrines where needed. No water flush toilets are in t
he area and the project will not build any either.The plan of the project is also to replace the water catching roofmaterial of the Health Clinic with ironsheets since water is collected from the roof to a tank. Water from the rainwater tank is today used 
for cleaning floors and for other use in the clinic but since the roof material is containing asbestos it should long ago have been replaced. If the roofmaterial is changed the rainwater tank may after a small repair serve as a water reserve for the clinic
 and be used in case of temporary absence of water from the borewell eg during maintenance of the water supply system.</narrative>
