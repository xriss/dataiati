   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project partners  are faced with constantly growing challenges of increasing demand for child  protection of poor children changing operating environment of the Arap Moi Children&apos;s Home (AMCH) need to strengthen the skills and capacity of the AMCH acce
lerating price of quality education and the capacity of the AMCH being set up for a much smaller number of sponsored children than presently. The overall objective of the project is to enhance poverty reduction and human rights by broadening access to equa
l opportunities for orphaned and destitute children and youth in the Nakuru area. The changes in Kenyan legislation on child protection stipulating that a relative&apos;s family is always preferable to an institution for an orphaned child have set new challenge
s to the sponsorship activities of Nakurun lapset ry and AMCH. Whereas all the sponsored children previously stayed at the AMCH now roughly one third of them stays at the home and two thirds in a network of guardian families that the AMCH provides for in t
erms of education and well-being. Two of the three cross-cutting objectives of the Finnish development policy promotion of gender equality and reducing inequalities are in the heart of the sponsorship activity and the project as they focus on strengthening
 equal opportunities for education and well-being for girls and boys. The key challenges for the project based on the Feasibility Study and the Problem Analysis are the capacity and skill requirements for the AMCH staff a school structure for the sponsored
 children which provides better quality education and reduced costs and improvement of working methods of the partners.As its immediate objective the project aims at strengthening the capacity and longer-term sustainability of the existing AMCH activities 
in serving  in a sustainable and effective way  the children and youth enrolled in the sponsorship programme.The immediate objective is addressed through four result areas as follows: 1) promotion of equal education opportunities to the children and youth 
enrolled in the sponsorship programme 2) empowering the guardians to strengthen their capacity to take care of the well-being of the children and youth in the sponsorship programme 3) strengthening the individual and institutional capacities of the sponsor
ship partners to offer quality and sustainability of activities and 4) improving the physical environment of the AMCH.</narrative>
