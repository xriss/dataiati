   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In Tanzania the majority of the population lives in rural communities earning their living by subsistence farming and often lacking even most basic services. Rural communities are however almost totally neglected by the urban-based mainstream media.Vikes h
as been implementing the Mtukwao Participatory Media Project in the Mtwara and Lindi regions in southern Tanzania since 2010 by organizing training for young community media journalists and by supporting community media operations including the constructio
n and launching of a community radio station Jamii FM in Naliendele village in Mtwara. Jamii is Kiswahili and means ?community?.The main objective of the continuation project is to secure the financial and institutional sustainability of Jamii FM radio ope
rations and other media productions. The project aims to raise discussion about issues that are important to the people in rural communities. Through Jamii FM community radio programmes people in the rural communities get their voice heard in local media a
nd have a better chance to take part in the local discussion about issues concerning their livelihoods and the allocation of public resources.The direct beneficiaries of the project are the dozens of young journalists taking part in the Jamii FM programme 
production including female journalists and journalists with disabilities. Hundreds of people benefit from the project by joining the village discussions arranged as part of the radio programmes and other community media productions. When people in the rur
al communities feel that their views are being listened to they are also more inclined to actively try to make an impact on their own living conditions. Among the direct beneficiaries are also all inhabitants within the coverage area of Jamii FM (almost on
e million people) who can listen to the radio broadcasts.The community media activities address human rights issues through the right to information and communication. Special support will be provided to ensure that the programme production is inclusive an
d gives the voice also to women and other vulnerable groups.The key project activities include training of young community media journalists in radio production support for the marketing of Jamii FM support for radio operations ? especially women journalis
ts journalists with disabilities and special programmes about gas production and the environment ? and supporting the procurement of updated media equipment.</narrative>
