   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The majority of the rural population in target districts is involved in subsistence agriculture. The level of food security and awareness of improved agricultural production techniques and practices is relatively low. Farmers haven?t been able to break out
 of subsistence farming practices (use of traditional techniques and varieties of crops) and consequently productivity is low. The objective of the project is to empower communities with the knowledge and skills to take the lead in addressing the challengi
ng in their development process and promote higher level of food security of subsistence farmers and communities through development of upland and swamp agriculture (food and cash crops, poultry).The expected results are: 1) Community Village Development C
ommittees? (VDC) leadership is functional and responsive in addressing development issues and communities have increased knowledge and awareness of peace building, HIV/AIDS and gender equality and, 2) Food security has improved, 3) communities perceive far
ming as a business and practice environmental conservation + management.  The project activities include building up the capacity of community structures (Village Development Committees, VDCs) in target communities to the point of taking the lead in their 
own development. VDC are sensitised and trained for example in participatory rural appraisal techniques, gender equality and conflict sensitivity. Subsistence farmers are trained and supervised in new commercial level agro-techniques and practices and envi
ronmental conservation techniques, and provided with farming inputs. PICEP?s poultry far and Agricultural Demonstration Site is further developed in order to ensure sustainability of the organisation in supporting communities.Rights-holders /beneficiaries:
