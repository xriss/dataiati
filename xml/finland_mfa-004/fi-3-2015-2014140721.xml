   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Since the beginning of 1990 the destructive and prologued civil was in Somalia collapsed also the country?s social infrastructure and education system. The civil war has destroyed educational facilities and influenced the educational possibilities in all o
ver Somalia. Many teachers have left the country due to instability and there is a need for skilled teachers. The provision of vocational and higher education in  Galgaduud region is weak. There are a few private universities. In addition there are some NG
Os that provide some kind of technical training. But there is lack of skilled teaching stand study materials and the school fees are often high. Also the selection of study programmes offered is very limited. Therefore some youths and high school graduates
 move to Mogadishu in search of better educational possibilities but many are completed left out of vocational training. On a larger perspective the challenge is also the lack of  coordination and quality control of education. There are no common curriculu
ms or standards. This project is a continuation for the project that started in 2015 which aims at the development of vocational education in Galgaduud region.  In the project quality vocational education will be provided. The education will be started wit
h nurse training. In the future it will be possible to extend the education also to other fields. The long term objectives of the project are to enhance the sustainable development of education empowerment of the local community and decrease extreme povert
y. These goals will be achieved with a long-term project (1+3+3 years) and Sahed is now applying for funding for the continuation project for years 2016-2018.The activities in the continuation project are: - Training of teachers and enhancement of their pe
dagogical and professional skills. The staff of the project cooperation partner  in Finland DIAK will act as trainers. - The establishment of nurse training and the preparatory studies related to it (such as English and mathematics)- The aqcuiring of neces
