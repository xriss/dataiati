   <narrative xml:lang="EN">F.a: Emergence of a favorable case for the rights of the child in the issues of sexual violence in Kabare in South Kivu</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">As a result of the DRC &apos;s long-running conflict children&apos;s registration system have collapsed. According to UNICEF, in 2011 only 41 % of children were registered. During the project, the organization is going to upgrade its own population register in order
 to provide a more accurate picture about registrations development of the area. A general feature that characterizes the conflict of DRC &apos;s eastern regions is the violence against civilians , particularly sexual violence . Human Rights Watch, the sexual v
iolence is committed by all parties of the conflict. Particularly problematic is the culture of the military government?s impunity. UNFPA estimates that the vast majority of sexual assault victims are teenage girls. In the project area Kabare, and especial
ly in Mudaka administrative region, rebel forces have abducted women and girls as sex slaves. Victims of sexual violence often reject their children born as a result of rape. These children?s risks related to unregistration increase even more, as they are 
already socially disadvantaged. At local level, attitudes prevent the realization of newborn children&apos;s rights. The project aims to promote children&apos;s rights in Kabare ,South Kivu. The aim is to contribute to the emergence of legal system that consideres  
the children&apos;s rights who have born as a result of a rape rapes and who are orphaned because of the war, as well as to inform and train about  the child rights, in particular the rights of the children emerged by the violence and orphaned children&apos;s rights
. Project&apos;s direct beneficiaries are the registered children,  local leaders and government officials involved in the training, health workers, child organizations, primary school teaching staff, religious leaders, police and abandoned children?s foster fa
milies. Coming from the university world, the SOS Information Juridique Multisectorielle SOS IJM was founded in 2007. Organization works in South Kivu, in the eastern part Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC ). SOS IJM &apos;s goal is promotion and facilitating o
f the realization of human rights.</narrative>
