   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Training on domestic and sexual violence and follow-up training for who participated in the training in the past, radio bulletins against domestic violence in English or in Ugandan, trainings in the communities, RECESVID&#x2019;s core funding. Sexual and domest
ic violence is widespread in Uganda. According to the statistics, the women and children are the most vulnerable as direct and indirect victims, but also men are victims. The culture of impunity related to the crimes is a big part of the problem. The prese
nce of the violence against women is maintained especially by the  traditional gender roles, lack of human rights awareness and support structures. The majority of cases of domestic violence are not intervened, and the authorities&apos; attitudes and management
 practices do not encourage reporting the cases. For victims, it is difficult to get a comprehensive rehabilitation due to a lack of  services. The domestic violence suffered by men is discussed publicly only a little. The project aims to raise awareness o
f sexual and domestic violence, as well as their relation to HIV / AIDS infections. Due to increasing awareness, victims of violence can apply for health and legal services, and more violent acts are reported. The aim is to strengthen the RECESVID&#x2019;s capa
city of the human rights and to improve the awareness of RECESVID by web hosting and radio bulleting. The project&apos;s direct beneficiaries are 280 community members involved in training, who are elected from Kampala, Wakiso and Mukono. The participants are v
ictims od sexual violence and domestic violence, perpetrators of violence, refugees, prostitutes, teachers, community leaders, religious and cultural leaders, family matters and child protection and crime prevention, as well as police officers working on t
he rehabilitation of street children. RECESVID was founded by a number of Ugandan human rights activists in August 2009 and has been registered to work in Kampala district. RECESVID&#x2019;s  mission is to rehabilitate the victims of domestic and sexual violenc
e and influence on the reductions of domestic and sexual violence.</narrative>
