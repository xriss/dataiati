  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">During the first project period (2013-14) significant progress was made in strengthening deaf people?s rights in Mongolia. An Information Centre for deaf people was set up 53 people were trained to provide SL interpretation services to deaf people and the 
organizational capacity of deaf NGOs was strengthened.While the capacity of deaf people?s NGOs is slowly increasing more work needs to be done before they become strong organisations capable of fully representing deaf people in Mongolia. The continuation p
roject will build on work carried out in the project?s first phase through further strengthening local deaf NGOs particularly in the areas of advocacy and employment for deaf people.Adequate means of communication are essential for deaf people to be able t
o lead normal lives.  Since most non-deaf people cannot communicate through sign language sign language interpretation services are of crucial importance.  The project will provide advanced training to interpreters trained in phase 1 of the project as well
 as training new interpeters and training SL teachers.Unemployment is a major problem in the deaf community albeit one that is currently poorly researched. Anecdotal evidence collected during the project?s current phase suggests that high unemployment amon
g deaf people is due to several factors. Firstly deaf people find it difficult to read and respond to job advertisements due to poor literacy levels in the deaf community. Secondly due to the low numbers of sign language interpreters it may not be possible
 for deaf people to communicate should they be offered a job interview.The project will address these issues through strengthening cooperation between deaf people?s NGOs and the ?Labour Exchange Central Office? providing job training to deaf people making 
relevant employment legislation accessible and working with (potential) employers to raise awareness of issues related to employing deaf people.  During the first year of the continuation project research will be carried out into the challenges facing deaf
 job seekers.The Information Centre for the Deaf in Ulaanbaatar is an important place for deaf people to get advice and access information.  We will continue and further strengthen the services offered through offering psychological care and peer counselli
ng. The Information Centre?s website will also be further developed.</narrative>
