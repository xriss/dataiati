   <narrative xml:lang="EN">FLC: PACODEO - Peace building and Conflict Resolution in Marsabit County</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Marsabit County perceived problems in the Upper Eastern parts of Kenya are anchored in the poor participation of the communities in the developmental agendas conflicts and tensions over resources insecurity among ethnic tribes and boarder countries inf
lux of cheap and sophisticated weapons from the porous borders of Ethiopia Somalia and Sudan. These includes:-continuous aimless killings invasions poor economic infrastructure unequal or poor distribution of resources misunderstanding between inter-ethnic
 communities and conflict. This is also widely seen to be instigated by politician?s incitement lack of adequate water pasture and grazing boundaries scarcity of resources high level of illiteracy very poor cooperation and dialogue among the Sub counties a
nd regional leaders in two Neighboring Countries of Kenya and Ethiopia.All this has caused unknown number of deaths leading to displacement of people who are forced to seek for refuge in market centre?s where there is police presence closure of schools and
 public offices. There are also cases of continuous and rampant cattle raids which have left majority of the residents without a source of livelihood depending only on government and NGOs supplied relief foods. Some of the conflicts have been caused by cla
ims of some ethnic groups living in some parts of their ancestral land leading to constant retaliations and revenges. Some areas have not only had high incidences of insecurity but uncountable cases of   massacres like North-Horr and Maikona districts. In 
these areas the truth will precede the justice and reconciliation issues and many Kenyans want to know how and what happened. The invasions by groups such as Oromo Liberation Front [OLF] banditry menace[Shifta]and Ethnic Cleansing have led to high cases of
 criminality and criminal gangs unemployment with many of the young persons and the economic means have been suppressed leading to poor means of earning livelihoods. There are also cases of impunity abuse of officers and corruption with high cases of extor
tion. The ethnic communities have element of suspicions hatred strife conflict tensions dissensions and fights surface in one form or another. The communities have experienced an increased chronic banditry activity which has claimed an unimaginable number 
of human lives livestock lost to the warring groups loss of properties of unknown value and houses set ablaze from both sides.</narrative>
