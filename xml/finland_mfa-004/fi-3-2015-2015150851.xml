  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project increases the construction sector workers? awareness on trade union rights and the capacity of the unions to organize and represent workers? interests. Stronger unions can better promote the interests of the construction sector workers and figh
t against the use of child labour.The brick kiln industry work is seasonal and largely employed by migrant workers, whose awareness of labour rights is low and they are therefore vulnerable for exploitation. Organising rates in brick kiln industries are lo
w and weak terms and benefits particularly among migrant workers is a norm. Due to piece rate system and low awareness the use of child labour is common. Working conditions are often bad. Project has been instrumental in unifying construction workers, who 
can gradually negotiate collectively more often about terms and conditions. The respect of child rights is enhanced in the same change process, and children are offered schooling instead of working. The vicious cycle of impoverishment of families is erupte
d through better awareness of rights and collective system.Construction unions are better able to defend and negotiate decent work terms and conditions. Simultaneously, awareness about problems related to child labour is increased. The temptation to use ch
ildren is diminished, when families receive a living wage. When interest representation is improved, the work will also become safer. Project will benefit brick kiln workers at the selected areas, their families and particularly child workers as well as th
e local trade unions.Project is executed by Building and Wood Workers International (BWI), Nepalese Affiliates Committee (NAC) and the member organisations of BWI in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar in India and in Bhaktabur, Lalitbur and Jhapa in Nepal.</narrative>
