   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project increases the negotiation power of the Metal and Allied Namibian Workers? Union MANWU by recruiting 20 000 new members, improving the knowhow of members, activists, officials and leaders and increasing the visibility of the union.The membership
 of MANWU consists of workers in metal and construction sectors, and the number of members has in three years almost tripled to the current level of 15 000. However, the current potential is 40 000 and numbers of workers are still in the increase. For the 
union to get to negotiations in more companies, recruitment of members still needs to be continued and intensified. According to the Namibian law each company must have at least half of the workers organized (meaning the so called ?50 % +1? rule), in order
 to gain official recognition for the union as negotiation partner. Most of the agreements are at company level and national minimum levels are a rarity. MANWU is therefore a pioneer influencing the entire negotiation system that has managed to negotiate n
ational minimum level for the construction sector. Now the objective is to achieve the same in the metal sector, but this requires wider company level coverage. Through the project MANWU also aims at financial and operational self-sustainability by increas
ing its membership and intensifying dues collection.The increased negotiation power and improved knowhow produce better collective agreements, improve the quality of life of workers in terms of income level and occupational health and safety and strengthen
 the workers? rights awareness. At the same time, the increased membership and improved dues collection make MANWU a more sustainable organization also financially.Beneficiaries are current and new members of MANWU, all workers of these sectors and the lea
dership and staff of the union.The project is implemented by the Metal and Allied Namibian Workers? Union MANWU.</narrative>
