  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project strengthens the capacity of vulnerable groups of workers to defend their labor rights and to defend decent work. This is done by conducting a research on working conditions and challenges of these groups and designing a strategy to defend and a
dvocate for the rights.In Colombia, discrimination in labor market based on peoples ethnic background, skin color, sexual orientation and age is very common. Among certain groups, such as afro-colombian, tillers, women and young people, untypical contracti
ng, underpayment, and exploitation are far more common than among the rest of the Colombian population. This discrimination is often invisible, partly because these groups themselves are not able to influence the situation and to defend their legal rights.
 The project responds to this challenge by raising the public awareness on the labor and trade union rights of these forgotten groups of people, and by strengthening their organization.As a result of this project, the awareness of the situation and challen
ges of these groups in the labor market increases, the groups have strategic plans on how to defend their rights and their organization in trade unions grows.The beneficiaries are peasants (particularly rotating workers who are contracted by day, and who a
re often in the most vulnerable situation), women working as domestic workers (particularly afro-colombian) and young people (particularly young people entering to labor market).The project is implemented by Escuela Nacional Sindical (ENS). SASK and SAK ha
ve had several projects before with ENS and the organization has proved to be a reliable project partner. The target groups of the project are dispersed and weakly organized and therefore it is necessary to have as implementing partner an organization with
 sufficient capacity to implement activities and obtain results.</narrative>
