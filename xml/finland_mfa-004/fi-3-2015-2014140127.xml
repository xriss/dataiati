allenges is an immediate priority and one on which we have already scaled up our efforts on recent programme interventions. Working with the local partners successfully requires working hand in hand throughout the project cycle.The FCA programme has consid
erably grown during the past year in Somalia. The fast growth brings several new challenges in terms of transparency and accountability, with a special focus on how to properly manage the operations in the field in such a volatile scenario. This project is
 linked to FCA&apos;s overall goals/strategy in terms of strengthening programme quality in order to achieve better effectiveness, transparency and accountability.The office will be focusing on the set up of proper and efficient standard operating procedures in
 Somalia, including coordination mechanism, MEAL (monitoring, evaluation, accountability and learning) system and safety and security platform. The overall objective of the Country Office is to improve effectiveness, quality, and impact of the FCA Country 
Programme focusing on the thematic areas through established field presence. Activities: ? Strategic and operational planning for the country ? Programme and project PME and administrative support ? Planning and monitoring of the country programme and proj
ects ? Provision of thematic advice to the country programme and projects ? Building the institutional capacity of local partners ? Facilitate dialogue with authorities and various actors at a country level ? Networking at both country and regional level ?
