   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project includes the translation of the guidebook produced by Thai Human Rights Lawyers Association into English, and layout and printing of the book in Thai and English. Activities are divided into 3 stages: 1. Translation from the original Thai versi
on into English by a translator or an institution specialized in civil society work in order to communicate the story naturally and reach out to the public, 2. Production: contracting a producer specialized in pocket book to design graphic arts and story f
ormat in order to avoid serious contents for presentation to the general public.3. Distribution of the publication to various agencies through distributors of well-known printing press, post and by hand. The contents of the book is divided into 3 parts inc
luding 1) essence of the case (background of Mae Om Ki community), 2) analysis of the court case, and 3) academic articles on community/ethnic rights. Siemenpuu?s partner in this project is the Human Rights Lawyers Association (HRLA) of Thailand, which has
 helped two Karen farmers in litigation process over the past years. The rotation farmers were accused of producing climate change and sentenced to prison in a lower court, but the sentence has been since overruled. Now the case is in the Supreme Court of 
Thailand. The Karen case is a watershed case in Thailand and in Southeast Asia, and thus HRLA wants to highlight the discrimination and prejudice towards ethnic minorities that are common in the Thai society. The book also gives guidelines how to support t
he (community) rights of the ethnic minorities and how to proceed in the court cases. The primary beneficiaries of the project are the karens and other forest dwelling ethnic minorities, but the publication is targeted to public organizations (esp. forestr
y agencies), non-governmental organizations and social activists, lawyers and legal practitioners, people living in the forest areas, scholars and universities. The English version is distributed especially in Southeast Asia, where the challenges of ethnic
 minorities/indigenous people are similar. The immediate results of the project are expected to be the increase of knowledge and awareness of the situation of the forest minorities and their rights, and the increase of practical work to help them in legal 
processes.Human Rights Lawyers Association (HRLA) has been established in 2008 by a group of lawyers and attorneys aiming to upholding the rule of law, social justice and Human Rights in Thailand.</narrative>
