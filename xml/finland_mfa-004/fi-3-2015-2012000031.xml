farming instruction in the Clubs and will also learn about other relevant topics including basic business skills health water and sanitation nutrition and more. In groups of 10 the farmers will work two model plots. These will be used to try out new techni
ques so that the farmers can experience improved results without having to risk their own production. As they begin to implement new methods in their own fields and increase their yields the farmers will have a surplus to sell. The Clubs will facilitate th
e organization of shared transport as a method of accessing markets. To increase their capacity further the farmers will be offered literacy and numeracy training which will improve their ability to plan their production and keep track of their progress. T
he Angolan Ministry of Agriculture Rural Development and Fisheries will provide institutional support training and inputs for the farmers.</narrative>
