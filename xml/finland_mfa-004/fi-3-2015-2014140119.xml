   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Poor access to education with regard to poor literacy rates and skills development is one of the biggest problems Sierra Leone. It is estimated that only around 43% of the adult population (over 15 years) are literate (male 55%, female 33%). Girls? school 
dropout is particularly significant causes being for example parents? inability to purchase school materials and cultural practices such as early marriage. Women and girls are very often discriminated against in the rural areas in Sierra Leone in education
 and employment. The districts of Koinadugu and Bombali suffer from lack of adequate opportunities for basic education and access to livelihood opportunities, and women clearly trail behind their male counterparts with regards access to and control over pr
oductive assets, skills and education.The overall objective of the project is to increase the economic and social well-being of vulnerable girls and women in Makeni and Kabala towns in Sierra Leone. Vulnerable women and girls who have had limited access to
 education and often have poor literacy skills are offered a so called ?second chance? to learn vocational skills that are relevant to the current and future employment market and enhance small business opportunities for beneficiaries. New vocational skill
s together with improved life and literacy skills contribute to graduates empowerment, increased self-confidence and contribute to reduced vulnerability.Skills training centres in Kabala and Makeni town provide training in dressmaking, weaving, textile dye
ing, catering and hospitality trades and agriculture. Curriculum content in training centres will include entrepreneurial skills development and incorporate on-the-job training/internships (with external outlets) and production learning opportunities (cent
re based outlet). Adult literacy and numeracy classes and kindergarten/creche services are also provided at the skills training centres.Rights-holders /beneficiaries: Rural and urban girls and young womenImplementing partner: Forum for African Women Educat
