  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">A large proportion of the economically active population of Liberia is engaged either directly or indirectly in small-holder subsistence agriculture, but the bulk of the population still suffers from food insecurity. Women are major players in the agricult
ural sector, where they constitute the majority of small-holder producers and the agricultural labor force in general.  Women carry heavy workload and have multiple roles that include earning income and managing their household. At the same time, cultural 
and social organisation limit women?s access to and control over productive assets. Within the agriculture sector, poultry production still remains a challenge with approximately 95% of the poultry produce being imported from abroad. The project improves t
he poultry sector to a more viable and sustainable sector and in particular targets vulnerable women. The overall objective of the project is to reduce poverty among rural, female-headed households through the development of backyard poultry farming. Addit
ional objective is transformation of partner?s semi-commercial poultry farm into a profit-making independent business entity that integrates backyard farmers into a larger production system and generates income for implementing partner to carry out rural d
evelopment projects thereby reducing its dependency on donor funding and thus increase its sustainability. The project will have the following expected results/impact: 1) Functional and independent farm/production unit developed and opportunities for busin
ess expansion created, 2) beneficiaries income earning capacities improved through backyard poultry layer (egg production), 3) improved farming methods for the cultivation of crops (corn and soya) for feed production adopted by beneficiaries.The project ac
tivities include training beneficiaries through an established Farmers Field Schools (FFS) approach, providing assorted farming tools and implements, and supporting construction of mini-poultries and providing point-to-lay layers at first stage. Other acti
vities include promoting the formation of farmers? cooperatives and training of participants in small business development and management skills in order to properly market and manage their products. In addition, business development support is provided to
 the implementing partner. Rights-holders/beneficiaries: Rural women, in particular vulnerable women  Implementing partner:  Project New Outlook (PNO)</narrative>
