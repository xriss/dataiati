   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Empowering migrant workers from Myanmar in Thailand</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Thai labour intensive export industries rely heavily on around 2 to 4 million migrant workers mostly from Myanmar. While migrants are an essential part of the work force they are generally discriminated against and taken advantage of. Regular abuses agains
t migrant workers during recruitment and actual work processes have been widely documented. Due to gaps in the Thai legal framework and poor enforcement undermining the rule of law migrant workers are often left without sufficient access to seek justice an
d remedies to address unfair and illicit recruitment practices as well as unlawful working terms and conditions. Imbalance of power between migrants and employers have lead in the worst cases to forced labor child labor and situations of debt bondage and/o
r human trafficking. Currently migrants do not have proper channels to voice complaints nor generally the ability and confidence to negotiate better working terms including with large multinational and Thai exporting companies. The overall objective of thi
s project is to support a representative voice to migrant workers in Thailand. The project will empower migrant workers by supporting and providing capacity building to their existing and established grass roots movement the Migrant Worker Rights Network (
MWRN). Project partners will work together in order to create space for negotiations between export companies and their migrant workers staff. This project will combine grass root negotiations in Thailand with European level media and corporate social resp
onsibility advocacy work.This project will not establish new structures but instead will draw upon the existing cooperation between MWRN and Finnwatch established since 2012. The main beneficiary of the project is the migrant community in Thailand and MWRN
. Finnwatch operations in Finland/Europe will support MWRN in creating momentum for organising and empowering migrant workers in Thailand.Key project activities include: research on migrants&apos; work conditions in Thai companies exporting to Europe, organizin
g workers in Thai export factories and through MWRN using joint MWRN/Finnwatch research and publicity as a negotiating tool, capacity building for MWRN (creating better administration yearly planning long term strategy and financial viability), recruiting 
new members for MWRN, training migrant workers, establishing a new MWRN office in Songkhla Province and developing the existing MWRN learning center in Samut Sakhon.</narrative>
