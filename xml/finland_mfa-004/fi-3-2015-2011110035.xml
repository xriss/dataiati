  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The continuation project builds on the previous projects achievements and lessons learned. Tuberculosis continues to be one of the main health problems in Somalia. In addition more and more people are diagnosed or suspected of carrying multi-drug resistant
 tuberculosis (MDR-TB) a form of TB caused by bacteria strains that do not respond to the medicines used in standard TB treatment. PSR is one of the leading agencies working on detecting MDR-TB cases in Somalia and the aim is to increase the local capacity
 on MDR detection through cultures and drug susceptibility tests. In addition PSR will continue to facilitate the operations of two TB Centres offering WHO recommended DOTS Protocol for TB patients/suspects and their families. These clinics are located in 
Hargeisa and Mogadishu respectively. The centres will continue to offer voluntary HIV-testing for TB patients.The objectives of the continuation project are similar to those set for the previous project. The project has been designed in such a way that it 
supports and strengthens Somalia?s own National Tuberculosis Programmes which are part of the Ministries of Health. This project also supports the implementation related to the so-called Somalia Compact which includes the key features of the Peace and Stat
e-building Goals (PSG) of Somalia. In particular this project supports the realization of Goal 5 namely Revenue and Services. At the same time it is in line with other key elements of the Compact such as inclusiveness and increased participation of citizen
s. In addition to the support from the MFA Finland PSR?s TB work in Somalia is supported by the Global Fund to Fight AIDS Tuberculosis and Malaria. All the GF projects support the implementation of the NTPs meaning that this project is also closely linked 
to the overall GFATM TB Programme. Another component of PSR?s TB work is related to WFP?s Nutrition Program. With the support of WFP PSR continues to distribute food products for TB patients and their families with the aim of helping some of the most vulne
rable people of the country. The main beneficiaries of the project include the local people in Hargeisa and Mogadishu suspected or diagnosed with TB ? and their families. The project will ensure that there is no discrimination whatsoever when it comes to a
ccess to treatment and services.</narrative>
