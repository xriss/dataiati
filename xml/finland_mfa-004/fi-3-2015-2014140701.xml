   <narrative xml:lang="EN">he increasing emphasis on rights to access and use natural resources is very important to forest conservation. While such rights are often supported on human rights grounds they are generally discussed from a more pragmatic angle based on the argument that
 people will only invest money time and effort in conservation if they have secure rights which ensure that they will benefit from their investment. The participatory forestry management (PFM) in Kenya has led to the formation of Community Forest Associati
ons (CFAs) recognised in the Forest Act. These CFAs are now performing key forest related governance functions autonomously including the crafting of resource harvesting rules the choice of leadership and conflict resolution. And one of the most critical C
FA resources in the implementation of the Act is its constituent the larger membership. The major reason is the wide perception of marginalisation misrepresentation and lack of tangible benefits emanating from both the CFA and host companies.It is widely r
ecognised that in order to balance community incentives with the burdens and responsibilities they bear rights to revenue streams generated from forest resources must be shared with communities to ensure continued commitment to the PFM process. In the abse
nce of this the viability of CFAs is increasingly threatened by power struggles leadership wrangles and the splintering of groups. Negotiation support to moderate conflicting interests and strengthen internal conflict resolution and governance is necessary
. Also this has brought a scenario that despite CFAs being responsible for diverse management activities in forest protection monitoring and management access to decision-making revenue streams and overall resource control rights are still vested in the Ke
nya Forestry Service.  The perceived disconnect between CFA and their larger constituents have also encouraged the KFS rangers to harass women (the majority users of the forest) who illegally demand a bribe or levy an unconstitutional charge to access the 
forest resources. Normally the CFAs who are supposed to be the custodian of the rights of their constituents do not take action in this regard. To date there is no comprehensive instrument specifically designed to address equity in decision-making and bene
fit sharing. Regulations on access and allocation of forest resources must comply with the human rights of all affected subjects.</narrative>
