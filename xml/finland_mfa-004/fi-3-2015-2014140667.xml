   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The idea of the project is to establish a school and provide basic academic and professional education equivalent to basic technical training grades 7-9 for young people in Namibe province Angola.Existing ADPP buildings in Tombwa Namibe will be renovated e
xpanded furnished and equipped. The result will be a modern accessible school with capacity to educate 70 students on each year of a three year education in total 210 students. Accessibility will be taken into account in all school buildings and premises i
ncluding WASH facilities.The education provides general academic education combined with practical and theoretical training in one of 3 professions: energy assistant environment promoter and preschool assistant. The professions are chosen because of their 
relevance to local conditions. A 100 megawatt windmill park is due to be built in Tombwa and there is increasing focus on alternative energy sources. Tombwa is a desert town with very vulnerable environmental conditions giving the environment promoters amp
le opportunity to practice their trade. Finally Namibe province has one of the highest rates of preschool attendance in the country- although just 13.7%- and ADPP has operated preschools in the town for almost 15 years. Upon graduation the students receive
 a nationally recognized certificate enabling them to seek employment or continue to upper secondary technical education. The students also acquire a range of life skills carry out community actions and gain many new experiences. Environment protection act
ivities form part of the education.  Persons with disabilities will be enrolled at the school and focus will be on ensuring that they are fully integrated. The rights of persons with disabilities will be promoted in the wider community. As part of the prog
ram the students will acquire ICT skills through the Dream School component. The idea is to support the development of rounded young adults with skills which are useful in the workforce and as active members of society. This includes the ability to be prod
uctive an entrepreneurial spirit ability to work as a team to take initiative and so on.  The school will work to foster links with the local business community including visits by local business people and workplace visits by the students. By the third ye
ar of the education the students have a 3 week work experience placement. Special attention will be paid to appropriate placement of students with disabilities.</narrative>
