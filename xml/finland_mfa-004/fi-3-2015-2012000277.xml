   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Strengthening Youth Friendly Health Services Through Community-Based Interventions in Rural India</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Young people in the age group 10-24 years constitute nearly one third of the Indian population. However they remain marginalized in terms of access to health services information on sexual and reproductive health and power to make informed decisions regard
ing their own wellbeing. This translates into poor health and development indicators.This project has the overall objective of improving young people&apos;s access to health information and services in the selected Indian districts (Gazipur and Varanasi rural d
istricts in the state of Uttar Pradesh and Bangalore rural district in the state of Karnataka). The project aims to support the state and district governments in establishing health services for adolescents. The project also aims to support the local commu
nities in promoting young people&apos;s health with emphasis on gender equity and empowerment of marginalized youth.It is recognized that cultural and socio-economic barriers can prevent young people from seeking health services and that special youth friendly 
approaches can assist in overcoming these. Special Youth Clinics have been recently established in the intervention areas as the result of previous collaboration between PSR-Finland and MAMTA-HIMC. However the current services have a limited ability to rea
ch out to the village level necessitating the development of new approaches.The activities of the proposed project comprise (1) provision of health information through schools and dedicated Youth Information Centers in the rural communities (2) training of
 outreach workers teachers and peer educators to address young people&apos;s health concerns (3) raising awareness of village district and state level stakeholders and (4) impact evaluation monitoring and documentation.The services will be established within th
e existing public health infrastructure. Community-based activities aim to strengthen the capacity of current actors such as Panchyati Raj Institutions Village Health and Sanitation Committees and schools. The approach is in line with Indian national polic
ies such as the Adolescent Reproductive and Sexual Health Strategy.The main beneficiaries of the intervention are the young people whose health is critical to the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals 2 4 5 and 6. Other beneficiaries of the proje
ct are teachers the other community members and functionaries of the public health system whose capacity to work with young people will be improved.</narrative>
