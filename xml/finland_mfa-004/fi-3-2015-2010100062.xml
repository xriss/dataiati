   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Unspecified projects in developing countries. The programme is implemented by the Partnership?s member organisations (at the moment 9 Finnish Disabled People?s Organisations) and its Secretariat. The goal of the programme is the realization of the human ri
ghts of persons with disabilities. It is based on the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and takes a human rights based approach (HRBA) to the work.The basic units of our work are projects. Thirty projects are planned for 2016-18.  We
 work in long partnerships with the Southern Disabled People?s Organizations. With a true HRBA to the work persons with disabilities in developing countries ? the Rights Holders ? and the Southern organisations that represent them are the ones that set the
 objectives for the work. Two of the five programme components are binding to all project implementors: each organisation receiving funds from the Partnership should 1) have adequate administrative systems and democratic decision making mechanisms in place
 and 2) eradicate gender based discrimination in their work. Other than that the Southern organisations are free to choose the approach how they address the rights issues of persons with disabilities. Many partners choose to combine advocacy with more dire
ct means of improving the educational employment or social circumstances of persons with disabilities in their respective countries. As long as human rights principles are adhered to and the sustainability requirements of the Partnership are fulfilled the 
Rights Holders? initiatives are the starting point for all work. In Finland the programme aims at mainstreaming disability in the development policy and in all Finnish development work. There is also a rather small but effective communication plan to infor
m the public about disability and development questions. The programme is monitored closely. The monitoring system is tuned to boost learning and proof of accountability comes as a by-product. As human rights approach to programming places equal importance
 on both what should be achieved (outcome) and how it should be achieved (process) we give equal emphasis to both outcome monitoring and monitoring of the quality of processes.</narrative>
