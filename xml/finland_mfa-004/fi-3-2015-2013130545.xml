  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project aims to increase public sector workers&apos; awareness of the International Labour Organisation&apos;s conventions by campaigning for the ratification of Convention Labour Relations for Public Service (No. 151) by the government of Philippines.The lack o
f the right to organise in the public sector in the Philippines and growing outsourcing of public services weaken the workers&apos; status and rights, as well as hinder them from lobbying.  The government has not recognised the bargaining rights of public secto
r trade unions and as a result collective actions are ineffective and often impossible.The project will attempt to get the Philippine government to ratify the ILO Convention 151 (Protection of the Right to Organise and Procedures for Determining Conditions
 of Employment in the Public Service) so that public sector employees&apos; rights and labour market status would become recognised. Recognition of the public sector trade unions would enable them to legally influence the problems that the public sector is faci
ng, such as outsourcing and privatisation of public services.In the Philippines, activists of the public sector trade unions and the leaders of trade unions and local branches form advocacy groups that are in charge of campaigning and advocacy in the parli
ament, different government ministries and executive levels of civil service.Beneficiaries of the project are public sector workers, rank and file member of public sector trade unions, as well as leaders and activists of unions and local branches.The proje
ct is implemented by public sector global union federation Public Services International (PSI).</narrative>
