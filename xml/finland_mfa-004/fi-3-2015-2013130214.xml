   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Ancash county area has a large number of children who do not receive adequate and systematic care from the state and governmental organizations. The reasons for this are several. For example the state and many civil society organizations do not provide the
 appropriately organized child welfare services. Those parties who could potentially be involved in finding solutions to the situation are not aware of the problems with the protection of children. In addition these entities are not familiar with internati
onal guidelines for the protection of children based on good practices. Social services has no models  for smooth cooperation with a multi-professional and motivated teams of professionals. In addition the local county or municipal administrations are not 
familiar with the administrative and lawful ways to assign labor and economic resources for child protection purposes.The main purpose of this project is to achieve effective co-operation between the various child welfare agencies. To achieve this the awar
eness of state authorities and policy-makers dealing with child protection as well as CBOs is raised. The project would create a structure that with effective cooperation  prevents manages and provides solutions to reduce child welfare cases in general. Th
e aim is that the children who despite the above have to be taken into custody would get the right kind of care.The project consists of four parts: 1 The police the public prosecutor and social workers as well as lawyers political decision makers and civil
 society actors are trained and informed in Children&apos;s Rights (especially the right to live in the family) as well as in good child protection practices. 2 Striving to change the legislation and local government agencies so that it would be possible to sho
w manpower and financial resources to the protection of children. 3 To create cooperation network between the various child welfare services and non-governmental organizations. 4 A model to create an alternative to traditional children&apos;s homes so that chil
dren&apos;s right to be cared in a family becomes reality.</narrative>
