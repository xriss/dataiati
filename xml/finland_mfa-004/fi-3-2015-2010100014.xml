   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The overall objective of the project is to strengthen the rights of poor and easily marginalized people especially women and children in villages in North-Western Bangladesh particularly their rights to education and socio-economic rights. Both education a
nd the strengthening of women?s position in society are crucial to the long-term development of Bangladesh.  The project works towards the second and third MDGs i.e. universal primary education and gender equality which are also targets of the Bangladesh g
overnment?s current Five Year Plan (2011-2015).  Climate/ environmental sustainability is also a cross-cutting theme of this project and is included in the project&apos;s two main components (described below).The project has two main components. First the proje
ct will support the creation of new women?s (and some men?s) development groups. The groups will participate in various types of training organized by the project including basic literacy numeracy group management and livelihood training. Group members are
 encouraged to save money regularly into a group fund which will be used for income-generating activities. The project will simultaneously support those groups that are already functioning to transition to operating independently. Groups should operate ind
ependently after functioning for 6 years.  The second component of the project relates to education rights. The project will support the continued operating of those community schools that were set up in the project?s previous phase. The aim of the schools
 is to support children?s access to education- i.e. to ensure that there are good quality primary schools within a reasonable distance of children?s? homes. Project staff will also work with local authorities and communities to ensure that plans are in pla
ce for transferring ownership of project-supported schools to local communities. Each project-supported school will be transferred after having operated successfully for 5-10 years. In addition the project will provide stipends to those children that wish 
to continue their education but are unable to do so due to financial constraints and will arrange vocational training for unemployed youth.</narrative>
