   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Activities of the project are to provide legal aid to asylum seekers, Counseling and workshops for refugees in relation to available services in partnership with local leaders, Continuous communication with the UNHCR for the most vulnerable asylum seekers 
and to speed up the process. India has not signed the UN Refugee Convention, but is receiving asylum seekers. For asylum seekers arriving from neighboring countries in India the state grants assistance in obtaining refugee status. Arriving from elsewhere h
ave to apply for refugee status through the UNHCR. This policy divides asylum-seekers into two unequal groups. During the process, the applicant must be able to demonstrate to be entitled for refugee status defined in accordance with international law crit
eria. The project aims to strengthen the asylum seekers legal status and their understanding of their rights as asylum seekers, as well as to improve their capacity to achieve the UNHCR calling for a process of refugee status. The project main objective is
 to inform and provide legal advice to asylum seekers. In addition, the aim is to get the UNHCR to reform policies so that in the future the asylum seeker would be informed of the reasons why his application has been rejected. The project target group in I
ndia is asylum seekers who apply for refugee status through the UNHCR. These people are mainly from Afghanistan, Burma and Somalia. In addition, the smaller extent of asylum seekers are arriving from the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Syria, and Sudan. 
A large part of ARA&apos;s clients are arriving from Afghanistan. Women and children have been taken into account in the target group because of their especially vulnerable status. The Ara Trust is a human rights organization founded in February 2013, which foc
uses on the provision of legal advice to refugees and asylum-seekers in India. The organization is India&apos;s first and so far the only organization that provides legal advice to refugees and asylum seekers. It is the only Indian NGO that has signed with the 
UNHCR the Letter of Understanding, a document that formally assigns ARA&apos;s unique role of refugees and asylum seekers facing a legal center.</narrative>
