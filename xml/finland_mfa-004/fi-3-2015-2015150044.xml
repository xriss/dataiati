  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Since inception devolution has continued experienced teething problems and power wrangles between the National and County governments. County governments have also experienced in-fighting and corruption. It is anticipated that this will continue for most o
f 2015 and start cooling off in 2016. It is projected that the residual aspect of this struggle will be the clamour for increased resource allocation by county governments. The effect of all this will be politicization of genuine issues of governance and o
vershadowing in the media of other core matters affecting the public (e.g. human rights violations) by news coverage of these power wrangles which media houses seem to relish. Further at both county and national level it is expected that activists champion
ing reforms and calling for accountability for bad governance will face opposition intimidation and threats. Organizations and activists operating at county level are likely to be more vulnerable than those functioning at national level.The change of the s
ystem of governance and the implementation of the new constitution resulted in the increase of state expenditure. This has led to a strain in the financial resources in government. Further consequences include industrial action by civil servants opposition
 to reforms by the Salaries and Remuneration Commission the increase oftaxation on Kenyans increase of cost of living and redundancy. The national pulse for stress among Kenyans is growing and this is reflected in various expressions of violence especially
 in the form of diverse kinds of conflicts connected to access to resources. It is anticipated that this will persist upto 2017 and will form the basis for political campaigns by aspirants. Increased politicization and propaganda by the ruling coalition of
 the advocacy efforts of CSOs in challenging impunity has weakened the sector through intimidation threats and discouragement.  Solidarity among CSOs is at an all-time low because of fear of reprisals and mistrust among organizations. The Deputy President?
s case at the ICC is at an advanced and crucial stage. This means that witnesses their families and intermediaries are still subject to ridicule intimidation and possible aggression with attendant anxiety and other forms of psychological harm. It is projec
t that this matter will not be concluded until late 2016.</narrative>
