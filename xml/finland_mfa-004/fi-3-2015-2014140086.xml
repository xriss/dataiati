   <narrative xml:lang="EN">A vast majority of the inhabitants of Bo &#x2013; the second city in Sierra Leon - live in extreme poverty. There is a high unemployment among young people especially those within the youth age bracket (between the ages of 17 to 35 years). The area also has a v
ery high school dropout rate among young people due to various factors ranging from lack of finances to continue their education to having to work for an income to support other more vulnerable family members. The continuous increase in the fees and cost o
f University education is drastically decreasing access to that level of education for the poor and vulnerable. Consequently, this makes the improvement of the options, quality and access to technical and vocational training institutions extremely importan
t.However, despite these trainings, unemployment remains high as the trained youths lacked the level of skills and competencies required for accessing employment. And for those who wanted to become self-employed they lacked the skills required to turn busi
ness ideas into bankable business plans. Moreover, access to credit facilities and business advisory services continues to be a limitation. The need to improve on the employability of the graduates so that they fit into the context of the work place also r
emains a challenge.The key objectives of the project are to improve the livelihoods of poor young male and female artisans in relation to their respective trades, to adopt improved entrepreneurial practices in the production and sale of goods/services and 
access  resources, business advisory services and wider markets.It is also ensured that the training delivered at the centre meets the industries requirements and occupational standards for key sectors to support a competency based certification &#x2013; this w
ill require partnership with the private sector.The main activity is vocational and skills training in carpentry, masonry, tailoring, welding, hairdressing and catering services. The cross cutting courses will include: literacy and numeracy, life skills, e
mployability skills to include interpersonal skills, communication skills comportment and sensitivity to diversity.Rights-holders /beneficiaries: Vulnerable urban and peri-urban youthImplementing partner: Rehabilitation and Development Agency (RADA)</narrative>
