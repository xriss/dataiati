   <narrative xml:lang="EN">During this phase a mapping study will be conducted, on which results the organizing programs will be designed. Well aimed organizing programs will be implemented, and when necessary in new enterprises a new trade union will be established. In target compa
nies where the negotiation process and industrial relations are more advanced, the focus will be put on negotiating better CBAs and in maintaining social dialogue. Training will be geared on developing young and women leaders.UNI sectors are affected by we
ak respect of labour rights and have weak working conditions. In Bangladesh, the employers are even more hostile toward organizing workers than in Nepal. In addition, the ?artificial offerisation? in Bangladesh, often means that managerial staff cannot joi
n trade unions. Other hostile tactics are outsourcing and application of short term contracts. This project will develop union?s capacity to promote labour rights and working conditions through more effective organizing work, quality negotiation processes 
and training.The project will conduct mapping studies which will enable designing effective recruitment programs. Unions will receive more and skilled organisers, new members, more women and new generation also ultimately to leadership positions. Industria
l relations and negotiation processes will improve. New unions in new companies will receive support in cumbersome registration processes. Trade unions will learn from each other in between countries and sector boundaries.The project enhances NLC?s and BLC
?s capacity to provide support to sector unions in conducting mapping, recruitment and negotiation processes in private service sector enterprises. Sector unions and their negotiators and organisers will benefit also.Project?s key administrators and coordi
nators are NLC and BLC, which will provide support to around ten sector unions in order to implement activities and gain results. Coordinated implementation and approach through NLC and BLC will benefit most UNI affiliates in financing, insurance and in in
formation and communication technology sector (ICTS).</narrative>
