   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The dry areas of Northern Nicaragua are classified as risky areas in terms of the possible consequences of climate change. The purpose of the project is to improve the production and profitability of small scale farmers and entrepreneurs in the climaticall
y risky circumstances to such a level that it guarantees a decent income and increases women?s possibilities to participate in the decision-making in the families, production organizations and the society in general. The project offers new possibilities to
 the Northern Nicaraguan  agricultural producers to adjust the local livelihoods and production systems to the changes which are produced by the possible increase in average temperatures, decrease in water sources and increase in extreme weather phenomenon
.  The profitability is increased in the different production chains through increasing the production and improving the functionality of the production chains. The production of the value chains is increased by improving the production systems and methods
. The project has eight expected results: 1) The annual fluctuations in the productivity of the agriculture and cattle herding are decreased and the profitability increased through a more equal reception of water, 2) the amounts of produce of agriculture a
nd cattle herding have increased and diversified, 3) the level of groundwater has increased through the retention of rain waters, 4) the amount and value of the products of the value chains has increased, 5) goat herding has been established in the area as
 an alternative form of livelihoods, 6) the farmers and animal herders (men and women) know what carbon sink is and how carbon sequestration from the atmosphere can be advanced, 7) the male and female producers apply climate adjusting methods in a planned 
way, and 8) women?s possibilities to participate in the production organizations? and the society?s decision-making as equals with men has improved. The project has 470 direct beneficiaries, of whom 47 % is women and 1650 indirect beneficiaries of whom mor
e than half is women. The project is implemented by ISF?s local partner, the cooperative Cooperativa Multisectorial Campo Verde Madriz R.L (COMCAVEM R.L) .</narrative>
