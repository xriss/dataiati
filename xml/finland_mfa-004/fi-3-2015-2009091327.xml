   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In Lao PDR improved natural resource management (including land use) is one of the most significant development issues to improve economic development and to strengthen people?s human rights and well-being. This has also been one of the most important targ
ets of Finnish supported project (Strengthening National Geographic Services SNGS) since August 2010.SNGS project will end in August 2014. In general the objectives of SNGS have been achieved rather well. Orthophoto coverage at the end of the SNGS will be 
twice the original project area i.e. approx. 2/3 of the country. It has substantially increased technical and institutional capacity of the partner organizations (National Geographic Department NGD and surveying and Mapping Centre SMC). High resolution dig
ital orthopohoto (1:5000) and topographic (1:50000) maps are unique products in Lao PDR.The main challenge beyond the current project is the institutional sustainability. Especially the policy issues on data sharing product pricing and NGD funding still ne
ed further support. The other challenge is the orthophoto coverage because the northern part of the country has not yet been photographed. It is needed so that the NGD and SMC would have a full countrywide orthophoto coverage.The SNGS extension is planned 
to last from August 2014 until December 2015 and it serves as an implementation of exit strategy of SNGS project. The extension will focus especially on ensuring the institutional sustainability. The project purpose is to ensure that the NGD and the SMC ha
ve long term capability and financial means to produce and distribute good quality and up-to-date geospatial data. The expected results are to develop policy and regulations to ensure sustainable production and distribution of reliable accurate geospatial 
data. In addition the remaining northern third of the country is planned to be flown during the SNGS extension and the campaign is funded jointly by Finnish German and Lao governments. The project will also increase the demand for good quality products thr
ough awareness raising.Finnish support to the SNGS is 6 mill. Euros and Lao support is 05 mill. Euros. In the SNGS extension Finnish support (1 Mill. Euros) is targeted to the technical assistance and the German support (07 Mill. euros) to aerial photograp
hy. Lao PDR will support the extension with c. 150 000 Euros.</narrative>
