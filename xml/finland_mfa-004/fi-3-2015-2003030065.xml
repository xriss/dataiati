   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The programme works for the improvement of rural communities? socio-economic situation and quality of life, as well for the strengthening of community capacities and enhancing children?s rights in Meibeki Valley, Western Kenya.At the beginning of the progr
amme, water and sanitation were inadequate and the availability of clean water was weak. This was also reflected in children&apos;s health and education. One of the main goals has been the availability of clean drinking water.  At present the water supply syste
m consists of a more than 162 km long pipeline. Clean water has permanently changed the life of more than 35 000 persons. The evaluation report shows that 89% of households have now access to clean water less than 500m from their homes during the rainy sea
son and 61.7 %, respectively during the dry season . (In 2004: 1.4%)More than 7,000 children are now able to go to school and have time to do their homework, when their time is not needed for fetching water. To ensure better educational possibilities for t
he children, educational conditions have been improved with the support of the parents.  Already more than 2,500 children study in the improved classrooms. With the support of the program, two dormitories have been constructed for secondary school girls.  
The program beneficiaries are the 54,000 inhabitants living in the area, especially women and children, who used use several hours a day to fetch water. Having clean water closer to the homes has freed time for time for other things as well as brought new 
income opportunities, like vegetable farming, agriculture and caring for livestock. A change in the women&apos;s role can be seen: there are many women as village chiefs and school attendance among girls has grown considerably. Children&apos;s participation in colle
ctive decision-making is encouraged through the Children&apos;s Parliament. Children and young people are represented in the village committee and the water committee.The main partner is World Vision Kenya that runs the implementation and accounts for the use o
f funding.In addition there are many partners from different ministries, regional government officials, and religious communities.</narrative>
