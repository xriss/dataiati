   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Human Rights Network ? Uganda (HURINET-U) has so far implemented successfully the 3rd phase of the project titled; CSOs Synergy for peace and justice.  The third project was a progression of the work that had been done with support of the Finnish Embassy o
n peace building human rights promotion training workshops with advocacy elements. This work enabled HURINET make a remarkable progress in its previous project implementation activities ranging from peace building and human rights promotion training worksh
ops and through engagement on cross border issues. The capacity building of the different stakeholders through trainings and dialogues helped in providing a platform for the different stakeholders to not only share with each other knowledge and best practi
ces but also strengthening working relation and joint campaigns in the promotion and protection of human rights. The environment in Uganda continues to be very harsh towards the area of Human Rights with political heads specifically targeting to tarnish th
e names and reputations of Human Rights organizations and peace actors. The Country continues its journey towards becoming a militarized state as the duties of the police and the army continues to overlap each other. The intervention of the government in t
he work of the Legislature as well as the Judiciary has taken an even more interesting turn with the president calling for National Resistance Movement (NRM) caucus meetings to influence the decisions of Parliament and even judiciary. The government also c
ontinues to be threatened by any human rights advocacy. On two occasions government representatives at district level (Resident District Commissioners) have stopped interventions under the Synergy for Peace and Justice Project. Radio talk shows focusing on
 the role of security agencies in cross border conflict have been stopped at the last moment due to the threat towards government. Human rights enjoyment and realization continue to deteriorate with more stringent laws such as NGO Act and the recent public
 order management bill (POMB) which was recently passed amidst the general public outcry as it requires planned meetings to be submitted to police a week in advance and allows to prevent a public meeting if they deem it a breach of peace as such it narrow 
political participation. All these bad laws if not repealed with curtail and narrow the operating space for human rights defenders peace builders and the general public.</narrative>
