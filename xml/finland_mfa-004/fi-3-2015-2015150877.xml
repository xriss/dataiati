   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Coffee is Guatemala?s main export product before bananas and sugar. Climate change threatens the coffee production in Central America as the temperature rise and rainfall fluctuation endanger the whole industry in many areas. In addition the rust disease h
as seriously hit the whole region cutting around a quarter of the harvest. Damages caused by the rust disease have also reduced the employment of seasonal workers.During the project?s planning phase in 2014, the coffee producers identified as their major p
roblems - in addition to climate change and the rust disease - cooperatives? weak governance, low productivity, lack of quality control, shortage of working capital and difficulties in market access. The goal of the Guatemalan project is to improve livelih
ood of small-scale coffee producers. The project?s purpose is to develop the country&apos;s coffee producer organizations to be more efficient and productive. The project develops producer organizations? governance by developing strategic plans for producer org
anizations and supporting production of gender equality policies and deployment of those. Productivity of coffee will be improved by making farm management plans, increasing organic fertilizers? production, by setting up nurseries to replace coffee plants 
and by establishing demonstration plots with special focus on adaptation to climate change. Quality of coffee will be improved by training technicians on repair and maintenance of processing machines. In addition, the project will develop funding opportuni
ties and facilitate market access by training on market knowledge.The project includes all 15 Fairtrade coffee producer cooperatives of Guatemala. These cooperatives are responsible for around 3,4 percent of Guatemalan coffee production and their export vo
lumes are between 5 and 50 containers per year. The direct beneficiaries of the project are around 15.000 coffee producers, of which 17 percent are women. The project implementation began in late 2014.Implementing partner organizations are Latin American a
nd the Caribbean network of small Fairtrade producers, CLAC, and it?s Guatemalan Network (Coordinadora Guatemalteca de Comercio Justo, CGCJ).http://clac-comerciojusto.org/http://www.cgcj.org.gt/</narrative>
