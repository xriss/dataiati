  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The beneficiaries are two Niva?le native people&apos;s communities Yi&apos;shinachat and Quen?a?lay which are situated in Chaco Paraguay in the Pilcomayo river area. This region is practically isolated from the outside world without working infrastructure and basic 
services. The area is traditional living environment of the Niva?le people with harsh living conditions with prolonged dry seasons. Their situation is further complicated by the destruction of the ecosystem by forest loggings that endanger communities&apos; foo
d security as they are dependent on the forest and its alimentary resources since their access to traditional land and fishing waters is districted. The consequences of the lack of alimentation and water resources are serious and endanger their existence a
nd culture habits and traditions. The communities themselves don&apos;t have the capacity to increase food production or create external income sources which causes temporary and permanent immigration. The communities&apos; women suffer the most of the situation as 
they stay in the communities with children taking care of the land that doesn&apos;t guarantee them sufficient alimentary resources. The project rises from the problems and their solutions identified by the women. The aim is to tackle the problems by committing
 the beneficiaries to the goals by applying participative approach and operating in coordination with the beneficiaries. Some of the concreate actions are the formulation of community plans to guarantee water supply and increase water storage capacity. To 
guarantee food security small lamb and goat flocks will be acquired for production of meat milk and wool. Education on the care taking of the animals and production is included. Excess production and wool handcrafts are sold to increase family income.The e
nhancement of women&apos;s role and their empowerment are strongly present throughout the project. The women get education on their rights and their role in communities is strengthened. The communities are in process of organization which Tierra Libre-ISA suppo
rts by giving them training technical and societal advising and association support. Follow-up administration and technical coordination of the project is jointly realized with the communities and Tierra Libre-ISA. The overall aims are achieving food secur
ity and sufficient water supply enhancement of associational and organizational capacities and the promotion of native peoples&apos; rights and equality between men and women.</narrative>
