   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Refugee Consortium of Kenya is a registered national Non-Governmental Organization (NGO) under registration certificate NO. OP.218/051/2004/0230/3356. RCK was initiated in 1998 in response to the increasingly complex refugee situation in Kenya. The cor
e mandate of RCK is promoting and protecting refugee rights in Kenya and in the East Africa region through provision of legal aid in Kenyan courts of law on asylum related matters, legal counseling and advice in the refugee status determination (RSD) proce
ss, advocacy for creation of refugee-friendly policies and laws and promoting and monitoring the protection of refugee rights through research and documentation.Kenya is host to approximately 579790 refugees and asylum seekers from the Horn of Africa and t
he Great Lakes Region. Of these over 70% are women and children. Majority of refugees and asylum seekers are found in 3 main locations namely Dadaab refugee camp Kakuma refugee camp and Nairobi for urban refugees. Whereas Garissa town is settled by pockets
 of refugees it is a major transit point for asylum seekers and refugees to and from Somalia Dadaab and other urban areas. The participatory assessment conducted by UNHCR on 19th February 2014 revealed that women continue to face risk of GBV as a result of
 insecurity in the camps inadequate alternative sources of fuel that force women to go fetch firewood in the bush where women are raped by bandits. Current interactions with clients in our legal aid clinics continue to confirm the same. This indicates ther
e is a continued need for GBV response and preventions. The UNHCR Comprehensive Needs Assessment report highlighted the need to increase support and accessibility of services to persons with disabilities.The main objectives of the proposed project: ?To inc
rease access to justice and legal assistance for refugees and members of host communities? survivors of SGBV within Kakuma and Dadaab refugee camps and Garissa by August 2015,?To improve access of psychosocial support to survivors of SGBV within Kakuma ref
ugee camp and Garissa by August 2015?To enhance protection monitoring of transit corridors for cases on SGBV and trafficking in persons by August 2015</narrative>
