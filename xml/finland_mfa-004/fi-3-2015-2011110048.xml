   <narrative xml:lang="EN">ESCA II project focuses on vulnerable and marginalized Namibian people who have dropped out of mainstream development. The development objective of the project is to improve the quality of life of the people of Namibia to the level of their counterparts in
 the developed world as stated in Namibia?s Vision 2030. The immediate objective is to empower vulnerable and marginalized communities identified in Namibia for self-reliance and engage actively in sustainable national development. Project is implemented b
y Council of Churches in Namibia (CCN) who signed Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Namibian government to become part of the Namibian development agenda through development of community projects in 2010. Namibia is ranked as the most unequal soci
ety in the world. Therefore reduction of inequality is at the very heart of this project that aims to help those who have been left out from mainstream development. Furthermore  poverty and other forms of injustice impact unevenly on men women and children
 and thus there are specific actions that promote gender equality. In this project special emphasis is paid to women who are encouraged to take up leadership positions in their communities. Project respects climate sustainability.The final beneficiaries of
 the project are the most vulnerable communities in Namibia and people who live at margin of human existence or in risk of marginalisation and need immediate social support and practical assistance. The direct beneficiaries are the CCN and its 18 member ch
urches whose capacities to address and respond to socio-economic challenges in Namibia will be strengthened and diversity in societies increased. Churches in their moral responsibilities need to respond to all moral and ethics issues affecting the society.
 The project does not create any new structure or institution but is positioned at the existing structures of CCN yet aiming to strengthen democratic structures and procedures. Key activities are 1) increase of the capacity of CCN and its members to facili
tate targetted responses to socio-economic challenges in Namibia with special reference to community development projects by women and youth, 2) Joint action in community development to result in the successful implementation of community projects includin
g Training of Trainers, and 3) Networking by CCN and its members resulting in targetted advocacy for more equal and inclusive rights-based development.</narrative>
