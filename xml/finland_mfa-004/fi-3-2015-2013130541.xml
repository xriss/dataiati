   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project strengthens the cooperation of metal workers&#x2019;, textile workers&#x2019; and paper workers&#x2019; unions in Uruguay, so that they are able to defend workers&#x2019; rights and negotiate better collective agreements more efficiently.The paper, metal and chemi
cal industries are strategic priority sectors for the Uruguayan government.  They also employ a significant number of workers, which is also seen in the number of foreign investments in the sectors. Even if the Uruguayan trade union field is relatively str
ong, threats can also be seen. Such include, among others, the weak financial self-sufficiency of the unions, weak leadership skills in the labour movement as regards local and company-specific unions, and the fact that young people lack interest in trade 
union activities, followed by a low rate of organization among them. In addition, the new forms of working life (such as the outsourcing chains, the activities of multinational companies and odd jobs) set new kinds of challenges to the unions. The project 
strengthens the cooperation between trade unions in these three sectors as well as the organization of workers. By the end of the project, the membership rate in these three unions has risen by 50% (7,200 new members), the position of the unions and their 
status in the negotiating tables has improved and their role in national level social dialogue has strengthened. The increase in the number of members also strengthens their membership fee accrual as well as their economic sustainability. The cooperation  
between the unions has strengthened and the unions guard workers&#x2019; interests on a national level.The project beneficiaries are the union leaders and member recruitment managers in the metal, chemical and textile workers&#x2019; unions (in particular women and 
young people) as well as the organized workers in these sectors.The project is executed by IndustriAll Global Union together with the local Uruguayan trade unions: UNMTRA (metal), FOPCU (paper and pulp) and UOC (textile and clothing).</narrative>
