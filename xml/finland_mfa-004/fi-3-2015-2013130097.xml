   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The goal of the project is to improve sanitation and waste management in the three project communities and to disseminate best practices of Msunduza to other areas of Swaziland. The project will continue the cooperation established during the Msunduza Dry 
Sanitation Project (MDSP project code 28000301) and the Environmental Health Education Project (EHEP) and combine and utilise the best practices from the two projects. During the project the cooperation network between the University of Swaziland (UNISWA) 
Green Living Movement (GLM) Swaziland the Turku University of Applied Sciences (TUAS) and the City Council of Mbabane (CC) will organise trainings in Mnyamatsini Mangwaneni and Malagwane in sanitation waste management (reduce reuse and recycle) and grey wa
ter reuse. The education will target especially the youth of the communities which will gain skills for income generating activities (e.g. in dry toilet construction gardening and waste collection). A network between the youth groups will be established fo
r peer support. Through them the benefits will be spread to the entire community.Education will target also authorities of the field as well as representatives of different medias in order disseminate improved sanitation and waste management schemes furthe
r and to promote open discussion of the development challenges. Through UNISWA the dissemination is further enhanced by inclusion of future professionals in environmental health integration of project themes and results in their curricula and by provide re
search on critical project themes such as health risks of human originated fertilisers and test-fields with comparative analysis.Cooperation between the two local partners UNISWA and GLM will enable organisational capacity building and transfer of know-how
 for a new local NGO with limited resources. Hence they will gain valuable local networks experience of field work and skills of project management in practise.Women&apos;s and girls&apos; participation in trainings youth groups and decision-making is emphasized. In
equality will be decreased through inclusion of the disadvantaged through increases in income and by access to sanitation.  Affects of the climate change can already be seen in Swaziland as consecutive droughts which is mitigated by constructing waterless 
sanitation facilities with rainwater harvesting systems and grey water reuse.</narrative>
