   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This continuation project is implemented by Vaestoliitto Mannerheim League for Child Welfare and Youth Empowerment and Civic Education. The project continues the work commenced in the first phase during 2013-2015 to enable conducive school and community en
vironment for girls? sexual and reproductive health and education. The overall development objective is improved well-being and health of Malawian girls. The aims of the project are to embed the safe and SRHR model created in the first phase of the project
 to the school and community structures as well as to local policies change community attitudes and empower girls. Immediate objectives are 1) School environment is safe and SRHR friendly 2) Community environment is supportive of girls? education and SRHR 
3) Girls are empowered 4) Project models are accommodated in local policies and programs. The activities of the project focus on capacity building awareness raising empowerment and improving livelihood and well-being. The project will be implemented during
 2016?2018 in the districts of Dedza and Mangochi in 10 primary and secondary schools and their surrounding communities. Project activities will be implemented in rural villages where attitudes are generally negative towards girls? education and advancing 
girls? SRHR. Girls face many other obstacles in attaining education such as early marriages and pregnancies sexual harassment and abuse bullying and poverty. In addition harmful cultural practices compounds the poor SRHR situation of girls. Therefore immed
iate beneficiaries of the project are girls between 10-18 years teachers parents boys traditional and religious leaders community structures and government official in the local level. Boys? and girls? net enrolment rates to primary education are high in M
alawi. However only half of the children reach grade 5 which means they leave school before they are literate and numerate. Only 18 % of children will transit from primary to secondary education. Gender inequalities contribute to higher school dropout amon
g girls than boys as it is often preferred to give boys more resources to attend school. Traditional cultural beliefs poverty and illiteracy contribute to child marriages within the project areas. Girls may also need to sell sex in exchange for food but al
so for good grades within schools.</narrative>
