   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The main goal of this project is to enhance the primary school teachers? skills to teach reading in local African Bantu languages with a special attention to children who have reading disabilities (dyslexia) or other severe handicaps in learning. This is a
chieved by developing a comprehensive step by step digital eLearning environment for boosting literacy teaching and learning. This continuation project will support the children&apos;s equal rights to quality education. In Sub-Saharan Africa 60% of primary scho
ol age children on Grade 4 do not achieve the basics in reading (EFA 2014). It is well known fact that illiteracy is one of the main risks for achieving human rights and the development of democracy. In collaboration with our network of African literacy ex
perts we aim to address this huge challenge. Our focus is to develop and implement the range of eLearning materials that are currently designed in our 1 year preparatory project with our African partners. The eLearning environment will assist teachers to u
se effective methodology in literacy instruction in local languages. This unique project will contribute to the improvements in literacy teaching and learning outcomes equally among girls and boys in Kenya Tanzania Namibia and Zambia. Finland is among the 
countries which have the highest literacy rates in the world. International research shows that the major factor behind this success is the nature of Finnish alphabetic system (transparent) and teaching method that is compatible with the regular orthograph
y (there is only one way to spell a word or read a word). Nearly all Bantu languages in Africa have similar transparent alphabetic system to Finnish providing the opportunity to apply Finnish teaching methods and expertise at the time when the language pol
icies and strategies have been revised so that mother tongue or local languages are used as a medium of literacy learning and instruction in primary schools. Also there are widely used eLearning support service for Finnish children which was developed by N
iilo Maki Institute and University of Jyvaskyla (www.lukimat.fi). The eLearning environment project consists of 3 phases: planning and designing  (2015) content development (2016/2017) and distribution and implementation (2018). In all phases the leading A
frican and Finnish experts in literacy learning and teaching collaborate to produce high quality evidence based practices for education.</narrative>
