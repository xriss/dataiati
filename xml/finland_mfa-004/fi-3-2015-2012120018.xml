   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project strengthens the transport sector trade unions and their negotiating activities in Peru and Venezuela.The transport sectors in Peru and Venezuela are unregulated and relatively shattered into small companies.  The share of the informal economy i
s also significant in the sector. The biggest problems for the workers include very low salaries (often even under the minimum wage defined by law), inadequate social security, longer driving times than regulated by law (up to 16 hours) and dangerous worki
ng conditions. The deficiencies in working conditions threaten the lives of both the workers and other drivers and pedestrians. Furthermore, the drivers are often subject to physical violence. In addition, HIV infections have increased considerably among t
he drivers. The negotiating capacity of the labour organisations for the workers is weak in particular due to the company-specific organizational structure and the low rate of organization.By the end of the project, the membership rate of the transport sec
tor trade unions has risen, the negotiating practices have become more effective and union cooperation has strengthened. The participation of young and female workers in union activities has increased. In addition, the union leadership and the activists ha
ve received training.  The development of the unions towards a single sector-specific trade union has progressed in both countries.The project beneficiaries are the decision-makers, activists and members in the trade unions for the transport sector.The pro
ject is executed by the International Transport Workers&apos; Federation (ITF) and its affiliates in Peru and Venezuela.</narrative>
