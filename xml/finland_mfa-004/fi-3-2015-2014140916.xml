   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In Kosovo post-conflict society gender based violence and especially violence against women is a big problem. Starting from 2011 Finland has supported a project of the UN Kosovo team (UNDP UNFPA UN Women UNICEF OHCHR) against Domestic violence with 1 130 0
00 euros. The project supports the implementation of Kosovo&apos;s law strategy and action plan against domestic violence by 1) awareness raising (prevention) 2) increasing capacity of the local domestic violence protection mechanisms (protection) 3) enhancing 
economic independence of (potential) domestic violence survivors (reintegration) and 4)scaling-up. The project supports the implementation of the UN SC resolution 1325 (Women peace and security). The project is in line with the Finnish development policy s
trategy. The project has produced information and studies on gender based violence in Kosovo and raised the topic of sexual violence related to conflicts to the awareness of the decision-makers. As a result of the project the capacities of the pilot munici
palities to produce user-friendly services to the victims of domestic violence has been increased. The project has supported the establishment of coordination mechanisms against domestic violence delivered training on gender responsive budgeting. The mid-t
erm review conducted in 2013 recommended to extend the project with at least one year which was done. The political development has made inclusion of the Northern Kosovo in project activities possible. One million euros&apos; additional funding is proposed for 
the project especially for the extension of the project to the four Northern municipalities in 2015-2016. By supporting the Northern Kosovo  Finland supports the integration of the structures of the Northern Kosovo under Kosovo administration which is impo
rtant for Finland politically. In order to ensure sustainability support to the earlier pilot municipalities will be continued and cooperation between North and South will be enhanced. Special attention is paid to the economic reintegration of the victims 
of domestic violence -and in this regard the project has seamless cooperation with other Finnish funded projects which support the economic development and employment in Kosovo.</narrative>
