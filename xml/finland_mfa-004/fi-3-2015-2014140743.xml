   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Key objective of the project is to contribute in adding the skills and knowledge of the Tanzanian actors in healthcare related information and communications technology (ICT) where there already is an identified need for deeper know-how in the area. The ma
in focus is in private sector actors (ELCT TOHS ALMC Uzima Mission Clinic) and in organizations and institutions that will be capable in spreading the know-how further even after the project finishes (APHFTA CSSC UDSM NM-AIST).The implementation phase of t
he project aims at strengthening the competence of the Tanzanian collaborators in various aspects of healthcare related ICT especially in relation to Health Information Systems (HIS) including open source based systems, their adoption ongoing evaluation fu
rther development maintenance interoperability etc. The topics will be chosen together and the focus will be in those development challenges that are identified by the Tanzanian collaborators. To reach the aim of increasing skills and knowledge the plan is
 to organize training sessions and courses research projects workshops and hands-on working opportunities with Finnish specialists in close collaboration with the Tanzanian partners combining both healthcare and ICT expertise. A special Collaborators&apos; Work
shop will be conducted once a year alternately in Tanzania (2016 and 2018) and in Finland (2017). In these workshops detailed plans and objectives for the following year will be defined together. At the same time workshop trips give an opportunity to be ex
posed to health facilities in Finland for Tanzanians and in Tanzania for Finnish collaborators and to share experiences - both positive and negative - about using HIS&apos;s in those facilities. The key idea in all capacity building is to focus in the needs tha
t are expressed by the Tanzanian collaborators, Finnish specialists will have no ready-made answers but provide their expertise for seeking locally appropriate and sustainable solutions together both parties learning by doing in the process.One of the obje
ctives of the project is also to train local entrepreneurs in marketing delivering maintenance and further development and support of HIS thus contributing in creating and supporting local small and medium-sized enterprises (SME).</narrative>
