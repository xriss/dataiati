   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project works with Uighur people who are Muslim minority, living in Xinjiang Province, Far Western China. They are Turkic people, about ten million of Uighurs are living in Xinjiang. Uighurs have their own language, which is very close to Turkish but i
s written with simplified Arabic alphabets. The purpose of the project is to assist the local partner to develop more effective health education materials and methods for use in rural villages so that the Uighurs will have an opportunity to learn about goo
d health and disease prevention through their own language and culturally suitable methods. The health education is especially targeted for primary school children and women of the rural areas of Kashgar Prefecture.Fida cooperates with the Kashgar Prefectu
ral Health Bureau, which is a Government Department responsible for all health related issues in the Prefecture. The specific department which has invited Fida to the area is Mother + Child Care and Community Health, which is working closely in the rural v
illages, especially in health education. The main aim of the project is to increase and improve primary school students&#x2019; habits for common disease prevention and better hygiene, to decrease the instances of women&#x2019;s infections in rural areas and to crea
te together with target group and partner locally made effective health education messages for public information channels.In practise, the project is developing a health education curriculum for village primary schools and facilitating the training of tea
chers to use it. The curriculum is based on local context, participatory teaching methods and materials, all in Uighur language. As the students learn about good health interesting ways, they go home and share with other family members as well, spreading t
he health information to parents and siblings. Special activities and events around health topics such as dental care, personal hygiene, sanitation, environment etc. are organised in schools together with teachers. Through them, the communities will learn 
about good healthy habits as well. The students will be creating their own songs, role-plays, poems and other items, which will be published in local TV and radio for all community members to see and hear. Another important part of the project is women&#x2019;s
 health and related infection prevention. Together with the partner the project will create participatory and relevant materials which can be used throughout the health system in villages.</narrative>
