   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The aim of the project is to highlight empowered women in developing countries. The purpose is to counterweight the dominant representations and stereotypes that depict women in developing countries as helpless or weak and to rather describe them as active
 citizens. The primary target groups are high school aged youth and young adults as well as senior citizens. Within the framework of the project workshops are held for high school aged pupils. The participants are led to critically scrutinize the media rep
resentations of women from the global south and make a more detailed study on a chosen woman leader/role model. The pupils&apos; work is illustrated through posters that are then put together for publication. The posters are displayed in the cooperating schools
 and in open exhibitions for the general public. In addition there are public morning talks and/or presentations on the subject arranged in the schools where the exhibitions are held.The message of the project is brought to young adults and senior citizens
 through a film and literature group in which novels and movies representing women&apos;s everyday life in developing countries (eg. Afghanistan Iraq Nigeria Somalia) are discussed together. In the film and literature group we seek to dismantle the eurocentric 
world view and to learn to read see and listen the message of the media from a political perspective and to understand how the image the media creates affects us all. In each session there is an expert by experience from the country/culture in question so 
that she is able if necessary to confirm or correct the perceptions created by the novel or movie and to talk about her own experience as a woman in a developing country. In addition during the project a seminar on representations of the Global South in th
e Finnish media is arranged for media students and professionals.The project seeks to create a wider social debate on how the women from the Global South are presented in Finland and to diversify this one-sided image.</narrative>
