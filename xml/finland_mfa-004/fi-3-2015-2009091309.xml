   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project focuses on the approximately 6300 Lhomi people living in the remote area of the highlands in northeast Nepal Khandbari and Kathmandu. The main development problems are: extreme poverty very high child + mother mortality no functional healthcar
e system and poor education. In addition there are no roads and there is no electricity. The objectives of this project are threefold: - Increase the number of functionally literate children and adults in both Lhomi and Nepali- Provide awareness raising an
d training in hygiene and basic healthcare midwifery veterinary skills- Set up 3 pilot MLE preschoolsA conclusive review of all the national policy papers concerning literacy work in Nepal indicates that the objectives and activities of this project are cl
early in line with the strategic plans and policies of the government of Nepal. During a meeting in March 2008 between NELHOS the Ministry of Education and the Non Formal Education Centre (NFEC) the government representatives were very interested in the Lh
omi project. Additionally Nepal?s most recent PRSP has been used as a reference point to lend more legitimacy to the project?s activities. There are two targets in the PRSP that are directly taken into account through this project:1. To improve literacy ra
tes of people over 15 years old2. To increase literacy rates of women and girls over 15 years oldThe project?s ethos is influenced by international development policy objectives including the eradication of poverty through increased education promotion of 
women?s empowerment and gender equality use of environmentally friendly technology and the promotion of education as a basic human right. NELHOS seeks to improve the economic and social position of the Lhomi people through providing mother tongue education
 to Nepal?s Lhomi community in combination with vocational training. The link between education and poverty reduction is widely acknowledged in the international community. The project will also give women and girls a second chance to learn to read and wri
te in Lhomi and Nepali. Approximately 85% of the project?s participants in the first stage were women, this was very successful.In order to accomplish the project?s objectives the following activities will take place:- Set up community development committe
es in 18 villages- Manage an adult literacy program- Set up 3 MLE pilot preschools- Provide vocational training- Build NELHOS?s capacities</narrative>
