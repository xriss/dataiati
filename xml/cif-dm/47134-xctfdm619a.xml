   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project is instrumental to the government&#x2019;s strategy to de-risk the geothermal program incrementally to a level that would allow attracting a qualified private developer to partner with and undertake the larger and more complex investments at the Wotten Waven-Laudat field. Such strategy includes: (i) developing the 5-7 MW SGPP (small geothermal power plant) for the domestic market, which, in addition to diversifying the local generation mix, will transform what is now a geothermal green-field into a less risky brown-field development; (ii) protecting the operability of SGPP in the face of residual risks; (iii) undertaking a comprehensive assessment to evaluate the viability of a larger plant on the same reservoir (LGPP, large geothermal power plant) for export purposes and to identify a clear roadmap for moving forward; and (iv) with the benefit of a functioning SGPP and a clear roadmap in hand, taking the necessary actions for identifying and selecting a qualified private partner. The project scope is articulated in the following three components:
o Component 1: Development of Domestic Geothermal Power Generation Capacity (estimated costs US$34 million);
o Component 2: Contingent Financing in Aid of Additional Drilling (estimated costs US$9 million); and
o Component 3: Technical Assistance for Advancing LGPP to Development Status and Soliciting Private Sector Investment (estimated costs US$2.5 million)</narrative>
