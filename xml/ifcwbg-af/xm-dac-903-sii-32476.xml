   <narrative xml:lang="EN">(i) Enhance use of telecommunication services in a low income country, through the roll-out of a 3G network, which will enable more people to access to broadband data services especially given Afghanistan&apos;s low fixed line penetration of less than 0.2%. (ii) Expand geographic coverage: While approximately 60% of the population is within reach of its network, Roshan is planning to extend service further to rural and untapped areas, with a population coverage target of 80% in five years. (iii) Extend economic opportunity and financial inclusion to all Afghans: Roshan&apos;s M-Paisa service has provided, since 2008, the Afghan population with mobile banking services, such as money transfers, bill payments and salary payments to the unbanked population in the country.  There are approximately 130,000 M-Paisa users and with the introduction of better quality 3G technology, the number of users is expected to grow to approximately 1.3 million by the end of 2016. (iv) Improve the well-being of people in Afghanistan through its corporate social program, Roshan Community: Roshan will continue to develop and financially support a wide range of programs aimed at improving the well-being of the people of Afghanistan that are focused on six main areas: healthcare, education, commerce, social welfare, arts &amp; culture and the environment.  (v) Provide political risk mitigation: In view of the increasing challenging security situation in Afghanistan coupled with the planned withdrawal of troops in 2014, country risk and security concerns continue to be the primary barriers to foreign investment in Afghanistan. By supporting this project, IFC is expected to send a positive signal to potential investors that it is possible to finance infrastructure projects in Afghanistan.</narrative>
