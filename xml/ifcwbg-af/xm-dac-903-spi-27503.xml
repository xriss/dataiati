   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Afghan Centre of Multi-Professional Education and Training Family Hospital (ACOMET or the Hospital) is a greenfield hospital and training center in Kabul, Afghanistan (the Project).  The Hospital officially opened in August 2007 and focuses on cardiology, dermatology and family medicine and also has a pharmacy and laboratory.  ACOMET also has an on-site training center, through which it provides a diploma in family medicine and internship opportunities for students at neighboring medical schools.  IFC has been requested to provide debt financing of up of to $4.5 million.  This financing will be used to acquire the remaining medical equipment needed to complete the first phase of the project.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The development impacts of this project include: 
 
- Delivery of high quality health care services to Afghan people: Afghanistan is among the least developed countries in the world.  ACOMET will bring much needed health care capacity and new services to Afghanistan. 
 
- Training critically needed medical workers: Due to the recent conflicts in Afghanistan, many medical professionals emigrated from the country.  This combined with the general global demand for health care workers has caused a critical shortage of trained workers in Afghanistan.  ACOMET will focus on providing quality medical education to doctors and nurses in Afghanistan and provide valuable internship opportunities to students.  Furthermore, the health care workers who remained in Afghanistan during the war were professionally isolated from the rest of the global medical community receiving poor out-dated training.  ACOMET will offer continuing education to bring its employees up to speed with global standards. 
 
- Retain income in Afghanistan: Hundreds of Afghans travel to neighboring countries for medical treatments each year due to the lack of quality facilities locally.  The Hospital will be able to treat a portion of these patients keeping the income in the country and reducing the hardship of travel for patients and their families.  Also, the opportunity to receive high quality medical treatment locally will save Afghans the high cost of travel and medical expenditure abroad.  
 
- Demonstration of excellent clinical standards and corporate transparency: ACOMET is committed to achieving excellent clinical standards and maintaining transparent corporate practices.  Through this, it will act as an example to other private hospital and other businesses in Afghanistan.</narrative>
