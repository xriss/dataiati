   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project consists of a risk sharing facility for a portfolio of up to EUR20 million (to be committed in two tranches of up to EUR10 million each) with TEB Sh.A. under IFCs Small Loans Guarantee Program (SLGP) which is supported by the IDA18 IFC-MIGA Private Sector Windows Blended Finance Facility (IDA PSW-BFF) to de-risk and scale up lending to SMEs, in this case with a focus on underserved very small enterprises (VSEs), women-owned SMEs (WSMEs) and agri-SMEs in Kosovo (the Project). IFCs exposure for both tranches will be up to EUR10 million, or 50% of the risk sharing facility. IDA PSW-BFF was created by the Word Bank Group to catalyse private sector investment in IDA countries, with a focus on fragile and conflict-affected states. The Project will also be potentially supported by the Women Entrepreneurs Finance Initiative (We-Fi) should TEB Sh.A. achieves significant growth in lending to women-owned SMEs. We-Fi is a collaborative partnership among 14 governments, six multilateral development banks (MDBs), and other public and private sector stakeholders, hosted by the World Bank Group. It seeks to address financial and non-financial constraints faced by women-owned small and medium enterprises in developing countries. IDA PSW-BFF and We-Fi support would enable to the Project to reach segments facing serious market failures which IFC could not otherwise serve.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project is expected to have a strong development impact as follows:

(i) Scaling up small loan financing to SMEs, including underserved segments such as women entrepreneurs and farmers in Kosovo, which in turn supports job creation; 

(ii) With the risk sharing facility, encouraging alternative financing structures and promote cash flow-based lending in a market dominated by collateral-based lending; and

(iii) Promoting growth in agribusiness, a key economic sector: Approximately 60% of the country&apos;s poor live in rural areas and depend on the agricultural sector for their livelihoods. In this context, the project will reach the base of the pyramid by directly supporting the most vulnerable segments of the population.</narrative>
