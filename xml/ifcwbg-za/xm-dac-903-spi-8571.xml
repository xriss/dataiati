   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Summary Of Project Information (SPI)       Project Name    South Africa-Unicell Paper Mills (Pty) Limited              Region    Sub-Saharan Africa        Sector       Project No008571   Projected Board DateDecember 4, 1997   Company NameUnicell Paper Mills (Pty) Limited   Technical Partner and/or Major Shareholders    	The major shareholder is Cosco Ltd, an investment holding company controlled by the Sharma Group.  Cosco Ltd, which is the sponsor for the project, will have an 85% equity stake in the project.  The Sharma Group has a long history in the paper manufacturing business, and owns paper mills and converting plants in Botswana, South Africa, Swaziland, United Arab Emirates and Zambia.  The Group has a talented pool of managers and technical personnel well versed in paper manufacturing and marketing.    Project Cost Including proposed IFC investment    	Project Cost is estimated at US$47.3 million; the proposed IFC investment consists of a Senior (A and B) loans of US$27.0 million, a Shareholder loan of US$3 miilion and a nominal equity investment of US$45,000.    Location of project and Description of site    	The project will be located in Germiston area in the Gauteng province of South Africa.    	    Description of Company and Purpose of Project    	The project is to install and operate an integrated paper mill, consisting of deinked pulp (DIP) mill, tissue paper mill and converting lines.  The DIP mill will havethe capacity to produce 120 tons per day (40,000 tpa) of deinked pulp from waste paper.  Fifty percent of the output will be fed into the downstream tissue facility to produce 60 tons per day (20,000 tpa) of tissue paper and converted tissue products. The remaining deinked pulp (20,000 tpa), in the form of wetlap, will be sold to Swazi Paper Mills, an existing client of IFC, and a part of the Sharma Group.      	IFC Role &amp; Developmental Impact:  The project offers an opportunity for IFC to assist in the advancement of a regional group, and in the fostering of economic integration in the SADC area.  Besides itself providing financing, IFC will play an important catalytic role by arranging a B-Loan.  The project will have a strong developmental impact.  It will contribute positively to the environment through its use of recycled waste paper.  The labor-intensive means employed in collecting waste paper, is particularly important given South Africas unemployment rate of 30%, which is actually much higher in the black community.  Employment creation is a major priority of the government policy.  The project will create employment both directly and indirectly for some 340 people.  Training programs will be instituted to reskill and train local staff; this will include appropriate overseas training.      Environmental Category and Issues    	This is a category B project according to IFCs environmental review procedure.  The key environmental and health and safety issues include air emissions, effluent treatment and discharge, solid waste and sludge management and disposal, hazardous materials storage and handling, and workplace health and safety.  The only significant air emissions generated are particulates, sulfur oxides, and nitrogen oxides from the coal-fired steam boiler, which will be appropriately controlled to meet World Bank standards for these units.  Process effluents will be pretreated and discharged  to the municipal sewerage system.  Solid wastes and effluent pretreatment plant sludges will be disposed by a third party contractor in an approved off-site landfill.  Hazardous chemicals will be segregated and stored in areas with adequate spill containment.  Adequate fire protection features and procedures will be provided, and the installation will comply with World Bank health and safety requirements.    	IFC will monitor the sponsors ongoing compliance with World Bank policies, and environmental, health and safety guidelines during the life of the project by evaluating monitoring reports submitted annually to IFC.      The  is  from the Public Information Center.
