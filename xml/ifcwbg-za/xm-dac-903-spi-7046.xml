   <narrative xml:lang="EN">SUMMARY OF PROJECT INFORMATION     Project Name			South Africa, WIP Motors    Region				Sub-Saharan Africa    Sector				Automobiles    Project No   				   007046    Company Name			WIP Motor Holdings    Location of project   and Description of Site   	   	The project will be located at 22 Anderson Street, Central Johannesburg, South Africa.    Projected Board Date		June 16, 1995    Description of Company and Purpose of Project    The project is to operate a BMW franchise dealership which will engage in the selling of new and used BMW cars, and sale of parts and service to these cars. BMW cars are locally manufactured in South Africa.  WIP Motors would be a successor to JSN Motors, a BMW dealer franchise, who has relocated to larger premises at a suburban site in Sandgate.  BMW (SA) has undertaken to make a positive contribution to the economic empowerment of  previously disadvantaged business investors by awarding the existing dealership to Women Investment Portfolio (Pty) Limited, a consortium of black women investors.  To ensure a successful and profitable business, WIP has formed a joint venture with Imperial Holdings Limited (IHL), a successful motor company with diversified operations, to operate WIP Motors.  WIP has formed a company, WIP Motor Holdings, to represent their interest and act as the holding company for WIP Motors.    Technical Partner and/or Major Shareholders    	The joint venture partners, WIP and IHL, are the major shareholders.  WIP was incorporated in September 1994 and represents the investment interests of a consortium of approximately 30,000 women from previously disadvantaged communities.  WIP&apos;&apos;s primary goals are wealth creation for its members through strategic investment opportunities, which typically target a variety of professional women groups including the YWCA and Young Professional Women.  IHL is a diversified industrial holding company conducting business in four decentralized divisions:  Car rental, leasing and tourism; Motors; Transport; and Insurance, finance and property.  IHL has many years of experience in the motor industry with Toyota, Nissan, Mercedes and BMW dealerships nation-wide. Their car rental subsidiary runs a fleet of 200 BMW cars.  They, therefore, have an existing relationship with BMW (SA).  IHL will play a major role as a technical partner in the operations of the dealership until such time that the WIP members have acquired the relevant skills and experience.
