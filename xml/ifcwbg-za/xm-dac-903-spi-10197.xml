All deductions are payroll-based and the loans are repayable over nine months. The loan is required to enable the company to expand its lending operations in this sector.         Education is probably South African&apos;&apos;s single biggest constraint on economic growth and the integration of the black population into the mainstream economy.  By providing finance to Edu-loan, IFC is assisting in empowering learners so that they can have a higher standard of living in the future.         IFC&apos;&apos;s role and contribution is the provision of finance to a company financing education, to obtain additional funding to complete the company&apos;&apos;s financing plan, and to structure the deal.     Environmental Category and Issues    	Based on the available information, this is a category C project according to IFC&apos;&apos;s environmental review procedure.  No further environmental review is therefore required.    Date SPI sent to InfoShop April 18, 2000    This Summary of Project Information is prepared and distributed to the public in advance of consideration of the proposed transaction by the Corporations Board of Directors.  It is provided for the purpose of enhancing the transparency of IFCs activities and should not be construed as presuming the outcome of IFC Board consideration.
