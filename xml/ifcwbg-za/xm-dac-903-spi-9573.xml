  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Spier Estate, nestling under the mountains surrounding the picturesque town of Stellenbosch in the heart of South Africa&apos;&apos;s wine country, is presently one of the top ten tourist sites in the Western Cape province. The attractions include the old buildings which also serve as the conference center and various restaurants, a picnic area, the working winery (which is part of Winecorp, a separate Capricorn company), a Cheetah conservation center, and an outdoor theater used for the annual Spier Festival. The project will help create 2,000 new jobs over the next five years through (i) expanding the existing farming activities, (ii) developing new initiatives in horticulture distribution, (iii) widening the scope for attracting extra business to the existing conference center by providing tied accommodation via an adjacent 150-room limited services hotel aimed at the domestic conference market, and (iv) constructing a new 250-room resort hotel and golf course aimed at international travelers. In addition, three separate villages will be constructed on the estate, partly to provide affordable quality housing for estate workers and partly for sale and rent to others. In keeping with the sponsor&apos;&apos;s philosophy, each village will contain a mix of different housing and will be designed as a balanced community. One of the villages includes a new school which has already been built, replacing a dilapidated rented property.    IFC&apos;&apos;s participation in the project with loan and equity will help create an appropriate financial structure, as loans are not readily available from South African institutions for longer maturities (the other major lender will be the US Overseas Private Investment Corporation).</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project is located on 650 hectares south-west of the town of Stellenbosch, about 40 km from Cape Town, adjacent to the R310 road. The estate was bought by Mr. Enthoven some six years ago, mainly in order to save the buildings which had fallen into disrepair. These date from the late-seventeenth to mid-eighteenth century and represent one of the largest collections of Cape Dutch architecture. Since acquiring the estate, Mr. Enthoven has invested over $20 million in improvements, both to rehabilitate the buildings and to secure the economic well-being of the 500 existing jobs.    The activities on the estate are mostly congregated in the south-west corner. The farmed area occupies the south-east portion and some adjacent areas leased from the Stellenbosch Municipality. The proposed 250-room hotel and golf course is to be located in the north-west corner, approximately 1 km from the existing hub. Most of the rest of the estate is presently undeveloped and not suitable for farming.</narrative>
