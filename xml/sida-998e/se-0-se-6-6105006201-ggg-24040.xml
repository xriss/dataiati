CapPlus conducts market assessments to be able to better serve low income clients and to ultimately select financial institution partners that are most willing and/or prepared to serve this market with integrity and scale, delivering impact where it is most needed. These market assessments are also exploration opportunities for the financial institutions, as they have a chance to learn more about best practice and potential that is &#x2018;out there&#x2019; in the field. It also helps catalyze more interest in financial inclusion for the poor, as key questions, challenges, market trends and opportunities are discussed.</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">Market assessments:
CapPlus conducted short visits to follow up on and update the market assessment work for impact opportunities carried out in 2015/16 (e.g. in Jordan and the West Bank). The initial research focused on an overview of both customers (at a very high level) and SME sectors in these geographies, in-depth review of the economic situation on the ground, socio-economic challenges, development of the financial sector, key players in the financial services sector, as well as information on MSMEs and their development. Since this research was completed, CapPlus has continued to engage with financial institutions (FIs) in these countries and in 2017 returned to meet in-person with a number of institutions and further these relationships to understand their needs and identify possible partners for high impact capacity building projects down the line.
Diagnostics:
Many of the financial institutions CapPlus works with have strong growth plans for enhancing and strengthening their small business banking operations. A prerequisite to confirm that the FI is proceeding on the right strategic path and to ensure effective support activities is to complete a diagnostic assessment of the structure and implementation machinery the bank has in place, including through a gender lens. The diagnostic tool that CapPlus has developed is used to review financial institutions&#x2019; small business structure and operations in order to identify gaps and challenges with respect to the current credit infrastructure, IT and systems, processes and staffing (both position gaps and competency gaps). This work is followed by a focused analysis of opportunities to apply new technologies, business models and risk management systems as well as a recommendation framework to address high-potential opportunities. The assessment ensures that there is alignment between the strategic plan and the operational plans management looks to roll out but goes further by assisting the FI in prioritizing the areas of operation on which to focus development and providing a suggested timeline and sequencing for such activity. CapPlus conducted 3 new diagnostics in 2018 as well as continued follow on work with five FIs on diagnostics started in previous years. These activities included institutions based in Ghana, Lebanon, Tanzania, Kazakhstan, Uganda and Nigeria.
From the example from Ghana (SASL) CapPlus identified a number of strategic and structural issues that SASL should address to continue to expand and serve low income clients at its optimal potential. CapPlus noted challenges with internal controls, capital adequacy issues, and insufficient credit analysis skills for larger loans. Key recommendations from the assessment included: Risk management strengthening, Strengthening of SME lending, Diversification of revenue streams and Increase operational efficiencies.
Long-Term Projects:
CapPlus worked with seven FIs over the reporting period on long term capacity building projects: CRDB Bank (Tanzania), Khushhali Microfinance Bank (Pakistan), Fortis Microfinance Bank (Nigeria), Premier Credit (Kenya), Jamii Bora Bank (Kenya), BRAC Uganda Microfinance (Uganda), and Coopsama (Guatemala). History shows the complexity of the many moving parts that go into supporting local organizations to make the changes, which their leadership want to achieve in their drive to expand profitable and impact into underserved markets.
Key lessons to implement:
1. Governance: Full board buy-in from the beginning is unrealistic and almost impossible to attain, despite it desirability. Senior management buy-in is key from the outset, and developing pathways to reach and influence the board is a process.
2. Permanent regional presence: Long-term local or regional staff will be valuable in unblocking challenges as they occur because the company can respond more cost-effectively and timely.
3. Results indicators:&#x2022; Loan volume: It does not make sense to have an indicator that says that 100% of financial institutions will have a particular growth percentage in the volume of loans. External factors such as regulatory changes in Kenya or internal factors like a large fraud (as occurred in West Africa) may mean it is prudent not to lend for a while. The current results framework does not accommodate this reality.&#x2022; Sustainability: The target in the results framework was that 100% of all interventions should be sustainable within the life of the project. For different reasons (timing of project start and/or external/uncontrollable factors), a more realistic measure is 75-80%. In addition, if a FI is undergoing a particularly stressful period, it may need its partners to stepup and invest alongside it to achieve the best long-term result instead of proving sustainability in a shorter period.</narrative>
