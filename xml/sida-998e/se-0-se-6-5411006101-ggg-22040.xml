    <narrative xml:lang="EN">Progress highlights:
During FY 2020, InfoDev continued&#xA0; to&#xA0;engage in the Agribusiness Entrepreneurship Program, Digital Entrepreneurship Program and entrepreneurship for digital projects, whilst emphasising gender outcomes and contributing to climate change mitigation. Due to the COVID-19 crisis, and subsequent shutdowns, disbursements decreased.
In FY20, the Agribusiness Entrepreneurship program continued to mainstream solutions developed in earlier years of the program, and the approaches tested with the agribusiness innovation centres, into larger country-level projects. The program contributed to several knowledge notes on COVID-19 response particularly focusing on agribusiness SMEs and the role of public sector in accelerating SME digital platform adoption. COVID-19 recovery response actions included: engaging SME to increase online presence, building ICT skills, engaging ICT providers to help SMEs integrate ICT solutions.
The Digital Entrepreneurship Program supported digital entrepreneurship activities, ensuring linkages to WBG&#x2019;s technology-focused initiatives, such as the Digital Economy for Africa program. InfoDev implemented a Global Firm-level Adaptation of Technology survey that focused on analytical work, data collection and capacity building. The survey was revised and later adapted to COVID-19 context.
InfoDev under the Entrepreneurship for Development projects&#xA0; has together with the Climate Technology Program connected entrepreneurs with the knowledge, funding, and markets needed to innovate and grow businesses.&#xA0;The new projects deployed emphasized greater leverage and alignment with government priorities.&#xA0;
InfoDev continued its gender commitment by launching several projects emphasising female commitment, such as the Women&#x2019;s coding boot camps. Additionally, InfoDev implemented several project with a gender-inclusive culture and specific frameworks for gender specific targets in terms of job creation and training participation.
InfoDev achieved the majority of its output targets for the program. For example, to date the program has delivered 750 workshops, seminars, and training events run nearly 2,700 coaching sessions for entrepreneurs forged more than 107 partnerships with financial service providers and operationalized 15 partnerships with investors. Further, more than 100 entrepreneurs raised early-stage finance, with an aggregate value of USD27.5 million. In addition, over 50 entrepreneurs raised growth-stage finance with a value of USD17.2 million. Additional sales revenue generated by the firms totalled USD 43.8 million.&#xA0;
InfoDev project has contributed to leveraging additional funding to an amount of USD 2.4 billion in World Bank lending towards shared priority areas.&#xA0;
Examples of activities implemented, and results achieved:
(GLOB/NORM) The implementation of the Firm-level Adoption of Technology (FAT) survey has advanced across several countries, although some activities had to be paused during spring-summer 2020 due to COVID-19. The project has three key activities: 1) Analytical work; 2) Data collection and 3)&#xA0; Capacity building. The preliminary results of the survey, based on data collected in Bangladesh, Brazil, Senegal, and Vietnam show that the survey instrument works well to measure technology adoption at the firm-level and will allow InfoDev to develop new insights on how policy can support technology adoption.
(GLOB/NORM) InfoDev supported a joint World Bank and International Finance Corporation study on &#x201C;Facilitating Market Access for Agribusiness SMEs through Partnership with Lead Firms&#x201D; was launched and was used in designing/implementing World Bank operations in Tanzania, DRC and Sierra Leone. The Agribusiness Diagnostic Toolkit was implemented in Sudan, Sierra Leone, Nepal and Liberia. Based on the lessons from this study, the program contributed to the Policy Note on focusing on the role of Private Digital Platforms on COVID response to support SME suppliers.
(GLOB/NORM) The MDTF program partnered with the&#xA0; WB Environment and Natural Resources Global Practice&#x2019;s team specializing in the forestry sector on &#x201C;Enhancing Contribution of SMFEs to Poverty Reduction, Jobs and Growth,&#x201D; a project that aims to develop an analytical framework and associated tools on SMEs constraints in the forestry market and solutions that have addressed the constraints.
(NAT/INST)The XL Africa program continues to generate positive outcomes for digital startups with innovative business models in Africa. Since its conclusion in FY19, XL Africa has generated more than 500 jobs and received USD 27 million in financing. The training material developed under the XL Africa program on digital acceleration was also adapted to e-learning and put online in the World Bank Groups online Open Learning Campus.
(NAT/INST) The Sahel Entrepreneurship Marathon targets early stage entrepreneurs in the Sahel region. The program ran across Guinea, Mali, Mauritania, Senegal, Burkina Faso, Chad, and Niger and contributed to generating broader interest around entrepreneurship with over 1,200 applicants across the region. In the Marathon du Sahel,&#xA0; examples of innovative entrepreneurial solutions to climate change that received funding includes; Pay-as-you-Go - an energy start up in the AE program, and Moonsoft - a bio-energy start-up.&#xA0;
(NAT/INST) The FY18 initiated program in Sierra Leone, aimed at scoping the agribusiness ecosystem, had in FY20 advanced activities under firm-level support to increase productivity.InfoDev also supported the Sierra Leone Agro-processing Competitiveness Project to conduct a pulse survey on the agro-processing SMEs that were selected as the first cohort for technical assistance through the SME Facility. Based on the survey findings, the MDTF program supported the design of a COVID-19 response to support: (i) building digital delivery models for training and knowledge sharing on basic business skills and entrepreneurship support; and (ii) repurposing portions of the matching grants to support investments in digital technology.
(NAT/INST) The Kenyan Industry and Entrepreneurship program is a USD 50 million lending project targeting innovation and productivity in select private sector firms. Funds were used to run entrepreneurship and other design pilots including gender outcomes, documenting best practices for the local market and providing direct inputs into the design and implementation of the program. The program allowed the World Bank team along with Government counterparts to identify specific ways of supporting women in technology, women founders and women-led SMEs.
(NAT/INST) The Zambia Agribusiness and Trade Project (ZATP) features a component on agro-processing SMEs that was designed based on insights gained through infoDev&#x2019;s Agribusiness Entrepreneurship Program. The Ministry of Commerce, Trade and Industry commenced implementation in 2019 through MarketConnect a private sector implementation partner, for the Agribusiness Innovation Center (AIC), which aims to increase the productivity and sales of Zambian agro-processing SMEs. Zambia is in a difficult overall macroeconomic situation with inflation steadily on the rise, currency depreciation and negligible access to working capital. This combination of factors has had a negative impact on the business community in Zambia. The AIC was able to provide necessary and timely technical assistance and funding to support the resilience and competitiveness of SMEs.
(GOAL/BENE) The Women&#x2019;s Bootcamps project provided young women with basic IT skills through trainings to add a market-relevant skill set&#xA0;and enable access to increased job opportunities and higher-quality jobs. Through the project interventions, teams were able to register a total of 4,700 women in Colombia, 7,100 in Argentina and introduced the concept of women&#x2019;s coding boot camps&#xA0;in Pakistan.
With the above presented results of InfoDev activities during FY20, the overall assessment is that good results were achieved, considering the COVID-19 impact. InfoDev continues to implement large-scale initiatives and have been able to respond to the current COVID-19 pandemic. Collaboration with stakeholders and a continued emphasis on gender and environmental outcomes indicates that InfoDev is achieving its overall objectives.</narrative>
