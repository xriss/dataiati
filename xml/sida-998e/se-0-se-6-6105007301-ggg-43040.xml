    <narrative xml:lang="EN">NRGF= The Natural Resources Governance Framework of IUCN The contribution was a 5 MSEK add-on to the IUCN core support from Sida, and therefore, in principle, covered by the overall results framework agreed with IUCN framework partners (core donors). In addition to this, IUCN agreed to provide narrative reporting on NRGF progress and results. Reports have been delievered as agreed and provide, together with the mid-term review and other communication, the basis for this statement. The main motive for Sida&apos;s earmarked support to NRGF development was the desire to stimulate considerations on rights and governance throughout the whole of IUCN and its operations: In order to design and make use of the Natural Resource Governance Framework, individuals from different parts of IUCN would have to be involved in mapping needs and options, formulating strategy and prioritise resources - and thereby build up engagement and a structure for further governance work. And, informed by the final and previous reports, Sida assesses that this is very much what happened, although with some delays, and not always in the order expected, and not always with appropriate engagement at all levels. This initial phase has provided some basic premises for continued work: 1. Increased coordination and collaboration between different parts of IUCN. The development of the NRGF implied close collaboration between the IUCN Commission on Environmental, Economic and Social Policy (CEESP) and the IUCN Secretariat, with additional inputs from NRGF regional Working Groups, the Environmental Law Centre and the IUCN World Commission on Environmental Law, the Responsive Forest Governance Initiative and some other parts of the IUCN Secretariat (e.g. Regional Offices and Thematic Programmes). 2. Scoping activities to identify needs and priorities at regional level in Asia, Africa and Latin America, and a global survey to map existing governance-related work across IUCN, have informed the overall strategy, established networks and provided a basis for identifying how NRGF can build links and synergies with existing work within IUCN and provide a basis for identifying key gaps and needs that NRGF can help to address through its work. 3. An NRGF strategy has been developed, with four components: - developing STANDARDS, METHODS AND TOOLS to assess natural resources governance and promote its improvement; - building a body of KNOWLEDGE on governance of natural resources; - serving as a PLATFORM to promote linkages, share experience, and mobilize concerted action to improve natural resource governance; - promoting and supporting improved ACTION on natural resource governance in IUCN projects and programmes. This strategy should guide the continued development of the NRGF by IUCN. 4. Written materials include an Initial NRGF Design outline, an Assessment Guide, and conceptual papers. When completed, there will be a conceptual paper for each of the proposed 12 NRGF principles. The first four papers deals with 1) inclusive decision making, 2) tenure rights, 3) social and environmental accountability, and 4) access to justice and the right to sustain nature. In addition, the Environmental Law Centre and the World Commission on Environmental Law have developed a methodology for evaluating the effectiveness of legal principles for natural resource governance. According to the final report&#xA0;of the Sida-financed NRGF-project, the standards framework that was developed will now be used to assess and align all governance related tools that IUCN deploys. The new 4-year results framework that was approved by IUCN Members as part of IUCN&#x2019;s 2017-2020 Programme contains two targets and associated indicators (out of a total of 30) that explicitly require the use and application of the NRGF. All IUCN Programmes will be required to report on the use and application of governance and rights-based tools that are consistent with the NRGF. Furthermore, IUCN commits to actively promote, among its members, governance approaches that are consistent with NRGF. The strategy and working papers of NRGF can be found on this link: https://www.iucn.org/commissions/commission-environmental-economic-and-social-policy/our-work/knowledge-baskets/natural-resource-governance</narrative>
