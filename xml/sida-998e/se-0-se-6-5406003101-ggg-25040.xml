    <narrative xml:lang="EN">In May 2013, Sida approved the Human Rights and Business Country Guide programme proposal for a period of three years, from June 2013 to June 2016. The project was extended by another year in December 2016.
The programme had three outputs:
Human Rights and Business Country Guide Website
The Human Rights and Business Portal is the first free resource for companies to identify, assess and address human rights risks in their operations and supply chains around the world. The Portal describes human rights risks in law and practice for target countries, and presents due diligence recommendations for private-sector actors to prevent and mitigate those risks.
The Portal is aimed at businesses, civil society, governments, multilateral institutions and all other local and international actors, to enable these actors to ensure that private-sector investment fosters sustainable development in line with human rights standards. Through legal analysis, statistical indicators, sector briefings, poverty reduction strategy alignment and company best practice case studies, the Portal enables all stakeholders to understand the impacts and responsibilities of the private sector, given the local human rights context.
The website was launched in December of 2013. The initial goal was to have 5,000 unique users per year, however this indicator was revised to 5,000 clicks per month. The most visits to site per month in Year 2 were 4,606 in April 2015. Aside from that peak, the site averaged 2,907 per month.
The country guide methodology of providing an overview of business impacts on human rights in a country context has become very useful in National Action Plan processes, particularly when conducting a National Baseline Assessment.
Multiple Multi-national businesses have expressed the value of the country guides and a clear need for a resource like the Country Guide website. Many companies stating that the guides have been particularly helpful in initial risk assesments.
DIHR is convinced that there is still a need for a free resource on business impacts on human rights in country contexts, however operating the Country Guide website as a standalone website beyond the project period is not sustainable, as the production of Country Guides was never envisioned to be done by DIHR, but by local partners. As such, the Country Guides were one output of local partners that gained capacity on business and human rights, and provided a great starting point for partners to become familiar with the dimensions of business impacts on human rights in their country. What was seen after Year 1 was that local partners generally required resources thus the updating and expansion of the Country Guides depended on concerted fundraising efforts by local partners.
Human Rights and Business Country Guides
Originally, DIHR had aimed to publish 40 Country Guides by the end of the project period (2016). This was to be done through a mixture of partner-driven and DIHR-driven Guide production processes. While in both cases, local partners were to be involved, only 10 In-Country Processes were partners actually trained on business and human rights, and received funding for researching the Guides. In the remaining 30 countries, DIHR was to take the main research responsibility, with interesteed local partners providing quality assurance and local sources for the information. However, it became apparent that partners were restricted in their input to the guide, on the one hand due to lack of capacity and understanding of business and human rights issues, and on the other by the lack of funding we could offer. This led to a re-conceptualisation of the project after Year 1: The goal for Country Guides by the end of the project was cut in half (20 Guides by 2016), and focus was placed on deeper engagement with local partners, providing basic capacity building on business and human rights issues, and support fundraising efforts by interested partners. The expectation was that with the re-conceptualisation of the project, local ownership would be increased and partners would be better equipped to engage and follow up the project. Local ownership&#xA0;of the Country Guides is critical to the success of the project; firstly to inspire local partners to work on human rights and business beyond the project, secondly&#xA0;to incorporate the local information only local partners could contribute to was important to create an arms-length from DIHR and the Danish state.
Although DIHR could not guarantee partners&#xA0;future resources to keep respective Country Guides afloat after the project periods end, the production of the country guides was however extremely useful, as teh methodology of analysing business impacts on human rights in the country context supported strengthening the capacity of partners and often influenced other activities by the local partner, for example National Baseline Assessments on Business and Human Rights (e.g. South Africa, Zambia, Chile, Serbia, Colombia, Kenya).
There is a high demand, especially from multinational companies for a free human rights and business resource and many corporate actors gave DIHR positive feedback onthe country guides. What has been found though is that if the country guides website&#xA0;were to be given over to other organisations to run the resource would not be able to be free of charge. Most multinational companies already have access to this type of resource.
In-Country Processes
In all 10 In-Country Processes, our partners acquired lasting capacity on business and human rights, illustrated by various concrete business and human rights-related activities, as well as efforts to include the topic in institutional strategies and fundraising efforts. The following are examples from some of the partner countries:
In Belarus, the local partner the Belarus Helsinki Committee hosted three &#x201C;business breakfasts&#x201D; to introduce the Country Guide to businesses in Belarus. During these events, which focused on the banking sector, the IT sector, and consultancies, the findings as well as due diligence recommendations were discussed among the participants.
Based on the Country Guide intervention in Kenya, the local partner, the Kenya Human Rights Commission managed to anchor a process to develop a National Action Plan on Business and Human Rights within the Kenya Department of Justice, making this the first African NAP process that is government backed from the start. The Country Guide was an official deliverable to the Steering Committee, together with a National Baseline Assessment supported by DIHR and published in 2017.
In Chile, the Country Guide was used by the inter-ministerial group to inform National Action Plan priorities and recommendations. The National Action Plan on Business and Human Rights was launched in August 2017, making extensive reference to the SDGs throughout the document. Under each Pillar of Guiding Principles and their respective actions, the NAP includes the linkages between the pillar in question and the relevant aspects of the 2030 Agenda. Additionally, through numerous NAP actions, the government commits to linking these agendas in practice.</narrative>
