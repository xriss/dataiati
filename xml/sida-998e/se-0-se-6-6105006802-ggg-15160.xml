    <narrative xml:lang="EN">Sida has supported DRPI between&#xA0;2003-2015, with over four phases of the project and a with total financial support of SEK 28 million.
An external evaluation conducted in 2015 concluded that the following results had been acheived since 2003:
? The development and adaptation of a unique, holistic methodology for monitoring disability rights that is built on the full participation of PWDs and that is carried out by DPOs;
? The effective implementation of an approach that works with DPOs to gradually develop their capacity to be able to collect, analyse and use data for reporting and advocacy
? Effects at three levels, i) individual PWDs, raising awareness of their human rights; ii) DPOs, giving them the tools to better understand the needs of those they work for; and, iii) coalitions of PWDs and DPOs, giving the means to come together to better understand different perspectives and to work to-gether to claim their rights; and,
? An approach that is based on a set of core principles, has been built from the bottom up, that takes time and is well considered, and which works well in the right context.
DRPI AWARE (Global Affairs Canada Employment Project) &#x2013; is a&#xA0;5-year project which&#xA0;created the conditions for&#xA0;the DRPI methodology to be utulized to help implement an employment strategy for persons with disabilities in India, Bangladesh and Nepal to start with and then with the potential for further replication in other countries.&#xA0;DRPI&#xA0;developed&#xA0;their methodology and&#xA0;adapted it to specifically target the monitoring of Article 27 &#x2013; Right to Work and Employment of the CRPD.&#xA0;Monitoring results have assisted in identifying barriers to employment, which will help direct best practices for increasing sustainable employment for persons with disabilities.&#xA0;This methodology was also presented to the World Bank and also won&#xA0;the Zero Project Innovative Practice award in 2017.&#xA0;
The unexpected results and lessons learnt is the need for support and endorsement of regional and international human rights bodies such as UNCRPD Committee and/or OHCHR on usage of the methodology that is developed, in this case the DRPI participatory methodology. It is also important that they recognize the significance of data from multiple sources (e.g. interviews or media) so DPOs could&#xA0;see its&apos; value in their submissions to these bodies. Strategic efforts to build strong partnerships with global/international human rights bodies should not be underestimated when assessing the&#xA0;potential of sustainable results after the project ends. There must be stronger cooperation with National Human Rights Institutions as well, as they in many cases have the mandate to conduct monitoring but lacks&#xA0;the appropriate&#xA0;methodology.
Another lesson is that monitoring should&#xA0;include the recognition of the distinction between legal action, policy, programs and services to identify what those actions based on human rights encompasses. For example, having a place to live is qualitatively different than having a place to live with dignity and autonomy (choice); attending a school is&#xA0;different than being included within an inclusive and dignified learning environment, where there is no bullying and isolation. Having a monitoring system and tools that are designed to fully recognize and include these differences are key to meet the needs of people with different abilities.</narrative>
