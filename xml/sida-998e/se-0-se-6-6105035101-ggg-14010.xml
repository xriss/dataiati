   <narrative xml:lang="EN">GWP&#x2019;s vision is a water secure world. To realise this vision GWP supports countries to advance governance and management of water resources for sustainable and equitable development. This is pursued by promoting Integrated Water Resources Management, a cross-sectorial policy approach, designed to replace the traditional, fragmented approach that has led to poor services and unsustainable resource use. As a means to achieving long-term impact towards water security, GWP seeks to influence water governance through the promotion of Integrated Water Resources Management principles. Policy development, strategic planning, legislative change, investment planning and transboundary agreements are examples of processes where GWP actively contributes both &#x2018;inside&#x2019; and &#x2018;outside the water box&#x2019; at the global, regional, national and subnational levels. Due to the multitude of circumstances under which water management and climate resilience touches upon people&#x2019;s lives, the impact that GWP strives to achieve can manifest itself in many different ways. Increased climate resilience among vulnerable communities, reduced incidences of water borne disease and protection of fragile ecosystems are examples of the obvious benefits of strengthened water governance and its consequent actions. However, there are also less obvious knock-on effects. This includes a reduction in migration and the displacement of communities &#x2013; the implications of which reach far beyond the countries and regions who are suffering the direct consequences &#x2013; as food security and economic opportunities related to water management increase.According to the GWP &#x2018;theory of change&#x2019;, the achievement of sustainable impact as described above is best achieved through improvements in governance structures, planning frameworks, institutional capacity and management instruments. By embedding the notion of water security into governance processes such as development planning, institutional reform, legislation, etc. an enabling environment is created through which water sensitive investments are made. GWP therefore aims to influence governance processes by working with actors at all levels to instigate improvements in identified &#x201C;change areas&#x201D; which cover the wide array of the water governance spectrum. Such influence typically manifests itself through key water governance outcomes such as a revised water policy, a new national climate change adaptation plan, a restructured institution, the introduction of a tariff structure, etc. The identification of the governance processes that will be targeted is thus a crucial part of GWP&#x2019;s work programming as the instigation of this change is exactly what the subsequently identified activities and outputs are designed to do.</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">Resultaten &#xE4;r tagna fr&#xE5;n Draft Progress Report 2019 och rapporterades i f&#xF6;rra CoP fr&#xE5;n 11 november 2019. Outcome results  The following results were presented in the GWP Annual Progress Review for 2018: - 46 tangible key water governance outcomes have been recorded in 2018 as influenced by GWP through the application of an IWRM (Integrated Water Resources Management) approach. These outcomes represent the governance change deemed necessary to enable more sustainable water management. To better communicate its outcome level results and the work that GWP contributed to their achievement, in March 2018 GWP launched an online, interactive map showing how it has contributed to better water management over the years: https://www.gwp.org/en/interactivemap/ Some of the key areas across which these achievements have occurred include: Investment planning: GWP&#x2019;s support to investment planning is most advanced on the African continent. To better coordinate the ongoing support to more than 70 countries, cities and river basin organisations, GWP has established the Africa Water and Investment Programme. The AIP is the overarching framework for upstream support to a range of investment planning processes, including projects under the Programme for Infrastructure Development in Africa. Outside of Africa, investment plan support has been provided in Slovakia, China and Peru resulting in the approval of a further 6 investment plans or strategies. Policies, plans and legislation: The development of new water-related policies at the regional level (the Regional Water Agenda and Plan for Central America) and the national levels (a National Water Policy in Guinea; the Zambia Climate Change Policy). The advancement of strengthened national water legislation, including the adoption of a law on climate change regulation in Benin, a White Paper reviewing the National Water Act of Lesotho, and the approval of water tariff reform through the introduction of a water tax in the Chinese provinces of Hebei and Shaanxi. The finalisation of national and river basin development plans, including the National 10-year Action Plan for the Monitoring &amp;amp; Evaluation System of Water Resources and WASH in Mauritania, the Water Development and Management Master Plan of the Mekrou basin, and the Gender Action Plan of the Zambezi Watercourse Commission (ZAMCOM). The establishment of new multi-stakeholder platforms to engage in water management at different scales, including new Area Water Partnerships in Pakistan, and the Mashi Basin Parliament and watershed Committee in Rajasthan, India. Accessing finance: Closely linked to the investment planning work, GWP also assists mandated stakeholders to unlock funding. Almost &#x20AC;10 million was mobilised on behalf of the Volta Basin Authority (VBA) and the Central American Commission for Environment and Development (CCAD) for flood and drought risk reduction projects. Substantial support has also been provided to national governments to access funding from the Green Climate Fund (GCF), including the development and submission of a proposal to develop the Zambia National Adaptation Plan on behalf of the Ministry of National Development Planning. SDG implementation: The facilitation of multi-stakeholder workshops in close to 40 countries as input to the establishment of a national IWRM baseline score for SDG indicator 6.5.1 was successfully concluded in collaboration with UNEP-DHI. The partnership has continued with the design and piloting of an action planning process to support select countries in prioritising a set of IWRM actions as a means of advancing on SDG 6 targets and water-related goals more generally. The work is being coordinated under the GWP SDG6 Support Programme along with other SDG workstreams on integrated monitoring and a range of country- and regional-level activities targeted specifically at SDG 6 implementation. Transboundary cooperation: Well established cross-border water management support has continued in key transboundary river basins in many regions. As well as ongoing engagement with mandated trans-national institutions in, among others, the Volta, Limpopo, Drin, Lake Chad, Danube, Zambezi and Orange-Senqu basins, GWP was also involved in the establishment of a new basin authority in the Como&#xE9;-Bia-Tano&#xE9; Basin in West Africa, and the advancement of water sharing agreements and institutional framework covering the Buzi, Pungwe and Save river basins in Southern Africa. Youth engagement: The launch of the global-level Youth for Water and Climate platform (#YWC) along with two major regional initiatives in Central and Eastern Europe (Youth Voices ? Policy Choices project) and West Africa (#TonFuturTonClimat project) has coincided with substantial progress on youth engagement at the country and regional level. This has involved the establishment of new water and youth networks (Kenya, Armenia, Central Africa-for water &amp;amp; climate), building the capacity of youth to engage directly in water management initiatives (China, Armenia, Honduras, El Salvador), and empowered youth networks to influence water governance through representation in decision-making processes (Cameroon, Tunisia). Collaboration with Cap-Net: In 2018 GWP and UNDP Cap-Net have been exploring potential alternatives regarding the future relationship between the two organisations. Whereas the ambition to forge a closer relationship between the two organisations has been under consideration for some time, recent developments, including the development of GWP&#x2019;s new strategy, the recently commissioned institutionalisation review of Cap-Net and emerging donor priorities, have generated more momentum for a tighter collaboration. Whereas details of the future relationship are still under discussion, both organisations are confident that stronger administrative and programmatic synergies will be achieved by the end of 2019. Impact stories  Significant efforts have been made during the strategy period to establish a more robust monitoring framework for linking GWP&#x2019;s activities and outputs from across the network to outcome and impact level results. This has been done primarily to demonstrate tangible progress in water security through the application of an IWRM approach, thereby justifying continued promotion of the concept, but also as a learning exercise to better understand the role of governance in achieving water security and GWP&#x2019;s role within it. One means of documenting this relationship is the development of GWP &#x2018;Impact Stories&#x2019;. These are being produced to demonstrate quantified impact linked to the governance change and direct interventions promoted by GWP as measured through the number of people benefitting from increased water security and the value of investment in water management interventions. New stories developed in 2018 include: IWRM planning and implementation in Benin Curbing Unregulated River Sand Mining in Sri Lanka Strengthening Community-Based Flood Management in Mae Sot, Thailand.
