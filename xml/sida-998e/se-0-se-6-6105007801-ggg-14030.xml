WaterAid&apos;s global strategy have four overall targets which are connected to outcome through qualitative and qualitative indicators. Only three of the global targets are relevant for monitoring as number three is regarding fundraising and Sida fund will not be used for fundraising. Target 1: 25 million people supported with access to water and sanitation through partners.Target 2: 100 million people reached through influence work.Target 4: Being operational in 30 developing countries.(...)</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">WaterAid Sweden have provided Sida with an application for global funding for the implementation for WaterAid&apos;s Global Strategy 2009-2015. WaterAid is an international federation consisting of five member countries (UK, USA, Australia, Canada and Sweden). WaterAid works to provide the poorest and most marginalised communities with safe water, sanitation and hygiene facilities through a combination of advocacy and service delivery. The global strategy aims to provide 125 million people with WASH during the current strategy period. 79 % of Sida funds will be transferred to implementing members of WaterAid who channel the funds to their respective country offices. The country offices implement the country programmes through procurement of goods and services for service delivery as well as advocacy work. 
A new global strategy will be in place from April 2015 and the continued support from Sida will depend on Sida&apos;s approval of WaterAid&apos;s new strategy. The Sida contribution to the implementation of the global strategy will be 95 million SEK for the agreement period 2014-2018.</narrative>
   <narrative xml:lang="SV">WaterAid &#xE4;r en global v&#xE4;lg&#xF6;renhetsorganisation som arbetar med att st&#xE4;rka fattiga m&#xE4;nniskors tillg&#xE5;ng till vatten, sanitet och hygien. WaterAid  &#xE4;r internationell federation best&#xE5;ende av fem medlemmar (WaterAid UK, WaterAid Aus, WaterAid US, WaterAid Sweden och WaterAid Canada). WaterAid international &#xE4;r WaterAid&apos;s globala f&#xF6;rvaltningsstruktur som best&#xE5;r av ett mindre sekretariat. 

WaterAid Sweden har inkommit med en ans&#xF6;kan f&#xF6;r globalt st&#xF6;d fr&#xE5;n Sida f&#xF6;r implementering av WaterAid&apos;s globala strategi. WaterAid&apos;s globala strategi 2009 - 2015 har som m&#xE5;l att ge totalt 125 millioner m&#xE4;nniskor tillg&#xE5;ng till s&#xE4;kert vatten samt f&#xF6;rb&#xE4;ttrad hygien och sanitet. Sida&apos;s finansiering f&#xF6;resl&#xE5;s best&#xE5; av ett k&#xE4;rnst&#xF6;d till WaterAid Sweden p&#xE5; 95 miljoner SEK mellan 2014 - 2018. Undantaget att Sida&apos;s medel ej ska anv&#xE4;ndas till WaterAid&apos;s insamling.
De st&#xF6;rsta delen av Sida&apos;s k&#xE4;rnst&#xF6;d vidaref&#xF6;rmedlas av WaterAid Sweden till WaterAid internationals implementerande medlemmar (WA UK, WA Aus, WA USA) som i sin tur kanaliserar st&#xF6;det till respektive landkontor som de ansvarar f&#xF6;r. Landkontoren implementerar landprogrammen genom att upphandla varor och tj&#xE4;nster f&#xF6;r att ge fattiga m&#xE4;nniskor tillg&#xE5;ng till vatten, sanitet och hygien samt bedriva p&#xE5;verkansarbete. 
En ny global strategi f&#xF6;r WaterAid kommer att vara antagen och implementeras fr&#xE5;n f&#xF6;rsta april 2015. En f&#xF6;ruts&#xE4;ttning f&#xF6;r utbetalning av Sida medel till WaterAid Sweden &#xE4;r Sida&apos;s godk&#xE4;nnande av WaterAid&apos;s nya globala strategi 2015 - 2020 och dess resultatramverk.

   <description>
    <narrative xml:lang="EN">The results are difficultly comparable to the objectives of the intervention. The reason is that WaterAid decided on and started to implement a new strategy from 2015. This was according to expectations, but the&#xA0;new strategy put more emphasis on&#xA0;catalysing work, as well as on less&#xA0;quantitative expected results. The accompanying results framework was furthermore delayed, partly as a result of the respective country offices&apos; own strategy developments and its required new approach to measure more indirect results and systematic change. An evaluation was undertaken to assess the achievement of the first phase of the agreement period and the attainment of the 3 targets as stated above. However, though WaterAid since 2015 hasn&apos;t had any overarching expected results, there has been yearly targets and the quantitative results monitored have been reported.
After the shift in strategy in 2015, WaterAid has reported following global quantitative results as a result of their direct work;
2015/2016:&#xA0;1,95 million people reached with safe water, 3,1 million people have improved level of sanitation and&#xA0;4,71 million people have been reached with hygiene messages;
2016/2017: 1,6 million people reached with safe&#xA0;water, 2,3 million people have improved level of sanitation and&#xA0;3,2 million people have been reached with&#xA0;hygiene messages;
2017/2018: 1,44 million people reached with safe&#xA0;water,&#xA0;1,42 million people have improved level of sanitation and&#xA0;2,58 million people have been reached with&#xA0;hygiene messages.
The declining numbers of direct beneficiaries are a result of the shift from direct service delivery to strategic influence, capacity building etc. to support public and private service providers to scale up or work more strategically, as well as advocacy on policy, budget, and work on increased accountability. The reduction in actual number also represents the more difficultly reached target group of the &quot;leave no one behind-agenda&quot;. Projects seeking to address marginalised groups require more capital-intensive work and cannot benefit of economy of scale.
In the annual report for 2017/2018, WaterAid has reported on the influencing work and their first attempt to capture indirect results- See below.
Besides head counts of beneficiaries, WaterAid has provided annual reports with a fair number of examples of policy advocacy work, results from work strengthening the civil society, specific work on disability, climate change and much more. (see conclusion of performance per year or WaterAid&#x2019;s annual reports)
Sida has yearly contributed to approximatively 3 % of WaterAid&#x2019;s global turn over.
During the agreement phase, there has been one external review of internal steering and control (with specific focus on Nigeria and Tanzania) and one external evaluation on the results, with focus on the achievement of WaterAid&apos;s strategy ending 2015 as well as specific thematic focus on disability and WASH in health.
The review of internal steering and control presented a number of recommendations that WaterAid Tanzania and Nigeria have addressed according to reports.
The evaluation concluded that WaterAid&#x2019;s strategy effective until 2015 was accomplished to a large extent, although the goal of indirectly reaching 100 million people has not been possible to verify.
The new strategy is considered very much in line with the SDGs and has meant shifting focus from service delivery to influencing systemic change working together with actors in other sectors. Implementing the current strategy, the evaluation concludes that WaterAid has&#xA0;demonstrated achievements in both their advocacy and policy work but highlights that WaterAid&#x2019;s monitoring system doesn&#x2019;t capture change at institutional and community level sufficiently.
The evaluation furthermore concluded that in terms of WASH access for disabled people, WaterAid is a leader in promoting disability inclusion in the WASH sector, though further work is required to ensure its approach to disability is fully understood and mainstreamed internally.
In terms of WASH in health, WaterAid is considered a major player promoting WASH in the health sector, through an integrated programmatic approach. WaterAid&#x2019;s achievements in WASH in health interventions, and its longer-term sustainability, are not yet being recorded in a systematic way.
There were recommendations at different layers, but the general ones&#xA0;included the necessity to ensure an effective monitoring system that captures both outcomes and impacts and the imperative to carefully manage ambition and focus efforts on ensuring the gains already made at the policy level are adopted and sustained for the long-term, both at the national and district levels. Sida assesses that WaterAid responded well to the outcome of the evaluation and has made an adequate response to address the recommendations.
Report of indirect results for the year 2017/2018;
-the work has included improved WASH-services at 132 health facilities, visited by 1,37 million patients, and at 477 schools with 151 000 students.
-Work in over 3000 communities, plus a number of cities, where 1,6 million people have had improved access to clean water through public buildings.
-Overarching work in 84 counties with a total population of 21,5 million people and strengthened capacity for service delivery including work at 26 water utilities.
-the systematic advocacy and capacity building work has resulted in 14 new or strengthened policy&#x2019;s to which WaterAid has contributed through information, support to civil society to bring their voice etc.
The annual report includes gender statistics on beneficiaries. For the year 2017/2018 their was a slightly higher figure for female beneficiaries than men.
Concrete health results from the work can be exemplified by an intervention in some districts in Nepal. The proportion of mothers or caregivers&#xA0;practising good hygiene habits increased from 2% to 53% after one year of targeted health and hygiene information at immunisation clinics. The proportion of diarrheal cases reported were also significantly reduced. The information included safe breastfeeding, handwashing with soap, food hygiene, water treatment and faeces management.
The annual report 2017/2018 also includes examples of how WaterAid has influenced other actors&apos; work. In Mali, WaterAid ran a three-year program to integrate water, sanitation and hygiene into 23 health facilities. The program also included the development of a guideline based on the experiences, in partnership with Ministry of Health and WHO. Since then, other partners are using these guidelines to improve another 450 facilities across the country, out of a total of 1,100.
Sida and WaterAid acknowledge that in many processes and activities WaterAid is only one of many actors and that all results cannot be attributed only to the contribution of WaterAid. However, Sida appreciates that WaterAid has a tendency to spur initiatives, engage others, catalyse processes, have the technical capacity to qualitatively support development and persistently follow these through.
The cooperation with WaterAid Sweden has worked well. WaterAid is proactive in sharing information they believe to be relevant to Sida, and quick at responding when requested for additional information. WaterAid is always on time with reporting, and in case of any delay they always ask permission for additional days in beforehand.
The agreement did not include a final report and therefore there is no report on accumulated results.</narrative>
