    <narrative xml:lang="EN">General question: Results related to the intended outcome 2016Question: Summarise results related to the intended outcome (this information will be sent to Open Aid)Answer: RESULTS ACHIEVED FROM WSP&apos;s WORK IN ITS SIX BUSINESS AREAS
(Note: Results concerns both total achievements for FY11-16 as well as for only FY16)

1. Scaling Up Rural Sanitation and Hygiene:

&#x2022; WSP has helped governments increase access to sanitation services for 49 million people: 
25 million people have gained access to sanitation services, and 24 million people have stopped practising open defecation.
&#x2022; WSP&#x2019;s efforts to assist governments in strengthening the enabling environment for at-scale service delivery has helped leverage approximately US$2.9 billion in investments for rural sanitation.
&#x2022;Most progress in achieving indicators was made for &apos;Strengthening Policy and Regulatory Frameworks (80%), Public Sector Capacity (69%) and Service Provider capacity (55%).

2. Creating Sustainable Services Through Domestic Private Sector Participation (DPSP):

&#x2022; CAMBODIA: As of June 2016, WSP&apos;s efforts have resulted in 13 202 latrines sold to rural households by local latrine suppliers, as a result of training in behaviour change communications of district administrations.
&#x2022; From January through December 2015, the local private sector expanded water and sanitation services to 2.1 million people with WSP assistance under the DPSP program. This in turn propelled the cumulative result since program inception to 6.1 million beneficiaries. Over the life span of the program, WSP has leveraged a total of 82.5 MUSD in private-sector investments, and influenced over 217 MUSD in investments made by a combination of donors and development finance institutions,
&#x2022; From January to December 2015, WSP&#x2019;s support to the domestic private sector helped 850,000 people gain access to improved sanitation. The total number of beneficiaries since program start is 2.1 million people.
&#x2022; Firms supported by WSP&#x2019;s work with the private sector enabled 1.25 million people to gain access to improved water supply in 2015, exceeding the number of beneficiaries in the previous years by 14 percent. This brings the total number of people obtaining improved access to water services, as a result of DPSP, to 4 million since 2011.
&#x2022; Since 2011 the cumulative amount influenced in private-sector investments for DPSP is 82.5 MUSD. Targets were established annually for the period 2012&#x2013;2014. This illustrates how the investments achieved far surpassed the target amount, representing increased interest and willingness of the private sector to engage.

3. Supporting Poor Inclusive Water Supply and Sanitation Sector Reform:

&#x2022; A portfolio review during FY16 covering 35 new projects started after June 2015 shoved that 91% of projects included poverty assessments to  inform project designs and 91% of projects included pro-poor indicators for measuring access for poor.
&#x2022; 315 urban water and sanitation providers (utilities were supported by WSP to strengthen performance monitoring and accountability arrangements since 2011.
&#x2022; The WASH Poverty Diagnostics-WPD (initiated and financed by Sida), is a WSP flagship initiative, aims to inform country policy and program design by generating an evidence base on the relationship between WASH service delivery, monetary and non-monetary poverty, and the nature of inequalities in WASH services. The WASH Poverty Diagnostic has been a global initiative that implemented in 18 countries across six regions. The WPD will inform country policy and program design to improve service delivery to the poor by generating an evidence base on the relationship between WASH service delivery, monetary and non-monetary poverty, and the nature of inequalities in WASH services. The WPD has aimed at defining the following: the poor and vulnerable population; the level of access and quality of WASH services as compared to better off segments of society; the linkages with inadequate WASH services and human development indicators such as health; and the binding constraints to improve the quality of services for the poor and vulnerable who lack them, and defining the role that institutions play in service delivery.

4. Targeting Urban Poor and Improving Services in Small Towns:

&#x2022; WSP has supported 20 national policies in 14 countries and strategies over the last six years to more effectively address water and sanitation service delivery needs for poor consumers in cities and small towns.
&#x2022; In KENYA, WSP&apos;s support to the development of the MajiVoice mobile phone based customer feed back system has led to increased accountability and tracing of complaints from customers  made resolution rates increase from 46 to 94%, with halving of resolutions times. It also has created clearer performance indicators for the regulator.
&#x2022; In MOZAMBIQUE,a framework for small service providers was developed for extension to under served areas, now being institutionalised in 38 towns with between 10 000-100 000 people. In Maputo micro-enterprises were supported for improved solid waste collection, including faecal sludge in unplanned inner city areas.

5. Adapting Water Supply and Sanitation Delivery to Climate Change Impacts:

&#x2022; As of June 2015 WSP has supported a small subset of country governments to mainstreaming climate change adaptation and disaster risk management approaches into 9 national and subnational water and sanitation policy frameworks, strategies and practises in Latin America and Asia (ie. Vietnam). As WSP had limited engagement in CCA and DRM over the whole period FY11-16, and the WSP climate change activities ended in 2015, there are only minimal results and milestone reported for July 2015-une 2016. this is sad as Sida has reminded the Bank over time about the need to have dialogue with governments on different levels about development of approaches for climate proofing of latrines - and water wells - in times of flooding.

6. Delivering Water Supply and Sanitation Services in Fragile and Conflict Affected States:

&#x2022; WSP&#x2019;s work in eight countries in Africa has confirmed that the current approach in Fragile and Conflict Affected States has shown that the vast majority of aid is being delivered directly by international agencies and non-state actors&#x2014;an approach that persists for too long after the peak of the crisis, between 6 to 10 years (see WSP report &quot;Delivering Water Supply and Sanitation in Fragile States: The Transition from Emergency to Development&#x2014;Evidence from Country Case Studies in Africa&quot;).
&#x2022; Progress in FCAS have been modest due to a number of negative shocks in the countries and the WASH sub-sectors where WSP has worked.

Other Results:

&#x2022; SHARING GLOBAL KNOWLEDGE:108 publications were produced through WSP in FY16, including field notes, technical briefs, World Bank economic and sector work, and knowledge products exceeding the 2016 milestone of 100. The total number of publications produced since 2011 is 687.
&#x2022; WSP collaborated with the World Bank, UNICEF, and WHO to assess the global costs of meeting the water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH)-related targets associated with extending two levels of WASH services to unserved households by 2030. The research concluded that current levels of financing can cover the capital costs of achieving universal basic service for drinking water, sanitation, and hygiene by 2030, provided resources are targeted to the needs. Extending basic WASH services to the unserved will cost US$28.4 billion per year, or 0.10 percent of the GDP of the 140 countries included in the report. However, the capital investments required to achieve the water supply, sanitation, and hygiene SDGs amount to about three times the current investment levels. The capital financing required to extend safely managed water supply and sanitation services to the unserved is approximately 0.39 percent of the GDP, or a little over three times the historical financing trend of extending access to the unserved.
&#x2022; Gender dimensions in WASH Policies and Strategies: A 12-country review of gender dimensions of WASH policies was completed in FY16, showing that women have different needs relating to water and sanitation and that very few policies highlight emerging issues of MHM and school WASH.</narrative>
