  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">i) Contribution to food security: The Project will provides liquidity to the food supply chain, ensuring agribusiness companies (and the farmers linked to them) have the funding need to produce efficiently, contributing to food security. Many AMERRA clients are low cost producers of exported food commodities, contributing to making staple foods as inexpensive as possible.
 
ii) Despite their contribution to food supply and rural livelihood, smaller and medium-sized agribusiness companies (and the farmers that supply them) have historically had insufficient access to finance from private sector sources, in particular finance that extends for more than one crop season. The unfavorable supply-to-demand dynamics for financing to this segment continues to deteriorate as commercial banks who had been operating in some parts of the supply chain continue to retreat from it to meet capital requirements. The Project supports the launch of the next generation of closed-end funds from a firm whose business model has successfully intermediated capital from institutional investors in North America that have not historically not invested significantly in these agribusiness segments in the emerging markets.</narrative>

In 2012 and in 2014, IFC approved two medium-term loans to support an AMERRA-managed fund totaling US$60 million which has since been repaid as loans in the debt portfolio began maturing. IFC is currently considering providing two further loans totaling up to US$100 million to help AMERRA in support of its newly launched AMERRA Agri Fund III, L.P. (Onshore III) and AMERRA Agri Offshore Fund III, L.P. (Offshore III), increasing the capital they have to lend (the Project). &#xA0;  The two funds will have similar portfolios and the distinction is that Onshore fund is open to most U.S. institutional investors whereas the Offshore Fund is available to non-US institutional investors and tax exempt U.S. investors.</narrative>
