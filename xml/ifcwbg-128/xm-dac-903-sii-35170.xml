   <narrative xml:lang="EN">AMERRA Capital Management, LLC, (AMERRA) is an investment fund manager, focused on providing customized agriculture-focused and commodity-based finance solutions to producers, processors, distributors and traders, mainly in the Americas. AMERRA has about US$800 million in assets under management across several funds and accounts managed for single institutional investors.IFC approved a US$ 50 million loan to support AMERRA in 2012, which has since then has been fully deployed in AMERRAs operations.   IFC is currently considering providing a new loan of about US$ 10 million to help AMERRA extend its reach to new clients and to countries where it has historically not been as active.  In 2013, AMERRA started making additions to its team which is supporting an increase in its lending operations in Paraguay and Uruguay.  Between 2009-2014,  AMERRA has been deploying capital raised largely from US institutional investors with a small but focused team led by its principals, who have decades of commodity finance experience. AMERRA has proven a good complement to the banking sector in terms of providing finance solutions to clients in the agribusiness value chain where assessment of lending risks is specialized and where client needs often require shorter response times than banks are able to provide. The proposed project entails IFC extending about US$ 10 million as a medium-term loan to help fund a part of the portfolio of AMERRA Agri Fund II, L.P. (Agri Fund II), increasing the capital it will have to lend (the Project).</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Project will support liquidity in the food supply chain and help ensure agribusiness companies (and the farmers linked to them) can continue to maximize production in scenarios of high commodity prices, which would make a contribution to food security. Many AMERRA clients are low cost producers of food staples.   Despite their contribution to food supply and rural livelihoods, smaller and medium-sized agribusiness companies (and the farmers that supply them) have historically had insufficient access to finance from private sector sources, in particular finance that extends for more than one crop season. The supply-to-demand dynamics for financing of the agricultural sector continue to show insufficient supply from the established financial sector and commercial banks that had been financing some parts of the supply chain but continue to be under pressure to strengthen their capital ratios, which limits their activity in the sector.   The IFC Project supports the expansion of an innovative firm whose business model includes providing financing into this segment by intermediating capital from an institutional investor segment in developed countries that has not historically invested significantly in these agribusiness segments from the emerging markets.</narrative>
