   <narrative xml:lang="EN">AMERRA Capital Management, LLC, (AMERRA) is an investment fund manager, focused on providing customized agriculture-focused and commodity-based finance solutions throughout the Americas to producers, processors, distributors and traders.  AMERRA has about US$600 million in assets under management across five funds and accounts.  After successful deployment of investor capital through several funds during 2009-2012, AMERRA is in the process of raising additional equity for the AMERRA Agri Fund II, LP (AMERRA Fund II) which will provide a broader range of finance solutions to its existing and new clients, especially longer loan maturities than it has not been able to provide up until now. The proposed project entails IFC making about US$50 million of credit available to AMERRA Fund II for up to 5 years, leveraging the capital it will have to lend (the Project).</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Despite their contribution to food supply and rural livelihoods, smaller and medium-sized agribusiness companies (and the farmers that supply them) have historically had insufficient access to finance from private sector sources, in particular finance that extends for more than one crop season.  Recently, the unfavorable supply-to-demand dynamics for financing to this segment has deteriorated as working capital needs have risen across the agribusiness supply chain with higher commodity prices at a time when the commercial banks who had been operating in some parts of the supply chain have come under increasing pressure to strengthen their capital ratios.  The IFC project supports the expansion of an innovative firm whose business model includes providing financing into this segment by intermediating capital from an institutional investor segment in developed countries that has not historically invested significantly in these agribusiness segments from the emerging markets.</narrative>
