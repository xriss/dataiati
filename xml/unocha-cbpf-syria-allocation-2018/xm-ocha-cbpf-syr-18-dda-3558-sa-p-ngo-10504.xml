   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Providing wide range of protection services including GBV, PSS and legal services to women headed household with specific focus on children and adolescents in Deir Ez Zor</narrative>

  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">During 7 years of war in Syria, mothers and children faced various violations still they kept standing, and continue struggling for their lives and their rights.
Children lost their houses, most of their families, their schools, and a big number of them are living under the poverty line.
Indeed, most of them lost their fathers, the family&apos;s breadwinners, and suddenly mothers themselves forced to play that role on top of other duties they have to fulfill in their traditional societies. This challenge for those mothers and for us as foundations working in the protection sector. 

This also alarmed us that we must give the Syrian children more attention and efforts or we risk losing a generation. 

This project is targeting female-headed households, through providing them with various protection services, such as PSS, CFS, and legal services.

 DEZ has been included in SHF as a project area specially IDPs , and the information we have from our last assessment in Dier Az Zour shows that there is a large number of families who lost their men in the war in different ways. 
Therefore, the project will target the host community, the IDPs and the returnees in the areas of Al Joura, Ayash and al Mayadeen. 
BW used to offer child protection services during 6 years in both of rural Damascus and Tartous in addition to some activities with refugees in Turkey under the name of SYCCR Syrian center for child rights, which became part of BW after its registration.

During that period, we have developed our special programs, mechanisms and handbooks tailored for the Syrian context and take into consideration sensitivities of the Syrian situation. 

This program is targeting the whole society to close the protection circle around children. When implementing our activities we follow child protection minimum standards in every area we have access to. 

Therefore, as CPMS says child protection sector cannot work alone, and we should integrate child protection into other humanitarian sectors and under the Standard #16 that tell us how to find our community mechanisms and manage the intervention process. We find that empowering mothers is part of child protection process.

By working in parallel with both of mothers and children, and help them start their early recovery journey. The project aims at providing child protection services to 900 beneficiaries between mothers children and adolescents in the area of in Dier Az Zour city. Starting by establishing a community center, including building the capacity of its staff, and outreach team to collect data from the community and map cases that require intervention, kick start activities in the center, for mothers and childres. Activiteis implemented in the center will include, group session, individual session, psyco-drama for children, musical sessions, drawing labs, life skill programme for adolescents, GBV awareness session for the adolescents. Mothers will be targeted by PSS session, group and individual sessions, as well as psychological consultancies for mother, psyco-drama for mothers, GBV awareness sessions, and legal consultancies. Mixed session that will target mothers and adolescents will cover, social integration and social participation. The children will be provided with in class meals to avoid having poor and hungry children sitting in protection classes, to guarantee the services implementation in and out of the center.</narrative>
