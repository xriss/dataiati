   <narrative xml:lang="EN">GOPA/DERD intervention to distribute NFIs to the IDPs from Eastern Ghouta  Afrin</narrative>

  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">After a seven-year long crisis, and on the month of March 2018, the mass evacuation of the inhabitants from East Ghouta in Rural Damascus and from Afrin in rural Aleppo began. This event, which was unexpected by all the humanitarian organizations operating in Damascus and Rural Damascus and Aleppo, led to the evacuation of more than 105,000 individuals from Ghouta and arround the same number Afrin to the time of writing, and the number of evacuated families is still increasing by the hour, and which is still expected to increase drastically. The locations where the evacuated families went were mainly the camps of Herjalleh, Adra Al Oumalia and Al Dweir , where most families went, in addition to other locations like Al-Nashabia and Najha. Other locations are currently being prepared to accommodate more families such as Al-Bardeh in Damascus. And to Tal Refaat,Nubul and Zahara in Aleppo.
The Syrian Government and humanitarian organizations responded with all their available resources to this crisis, and the response included the distribution of Food Items and Core Relief Items to the evacuated families, as well as the distribution of water tanks, as an emergency response to the families&#x2019; most basic needs. Food Items were distributed with abundance, in addition to beddings, blankets, and other Core Relief Items.
In order to plan GOPA-DERD&#x2019;s response to this emergent crisis, GOPA-DERD&#x2019;s teams were split into 7 groups which went on the field in order to perform a needs assessment in the following locations: Al-Dweir, Herjalleh, Al-Nashabia, Tishreen,Tal Refaat, Nubul , and Zahara, in order to assess the location&#x2019;s situation and to plan their response for the coming period.
During GOPA-DERD&#x2019;s visit to the camps, the conclusion was that this emergency response did not cover the basic needs of the families at all. There are still many emergent needs which, if not covered, will lead to humanitarian disasters. Hygiene is an issue that was neglected during this response since several cases of lice and scabies were spotted, as well as clothing because families had to leave their locations hastily.
Due to GOPA-DERD&#x2019;s large experience in the field and to the emergent needs. Intervention in the NFIs sector by dustributing differnt Hygienic kits i addition to winterization items which are highly recommended.
The purpose of this project is to provide direct assistance to people living in collective shelters in Damascus and rural Aleppo. This will take place in locations where GOPA-DERD have access.</narrative>
