       <narrative xml:lang="EN">Outcome 1: 
1.1.1 Capacity gaps: the draft of the report on the NDA capacity assessment has been completed. The required trainings are identified in the report. The NDA will continue to seek for support on this. 

1.1.2 on Technical training: NDA received technical training on climate finance in Bangkok (July 2019) and in Lao (August). NDA then requested that this training be repeated for more staff and other ministries. This training was done under GCF Readiness by an international consultant in Vientiane, Laos in August 2019. This training has provided fundamental knowledge for Department of Climate Change and other participants from relevant ministries. 

1.1.3 Staleholder engagement mechanisms, NDA piloted the bi-monthly meeting by inviting all relevant stakeholders to share and discuss issues concerning to GCF/GEF, which received good outcomes. However, this has not been continued after the project ended as NDA affirmed that they could not take on, partially because of budget and times. But NDA noted that should be continued as it is the platform to keep each other informed about GCF/GEF. 

1.1.4 Climate Finance Steering Committee. Existing committee on Global Environment Fund (GEF), the NDA planned to merge Climate Finance Steering Committee under GCF to be kind of Committee on GCF and GEF . This has not yet been done because the government of Laos plans to restrcuture first before forming committee. This planned to be done by the end of 2019. With this, 1.1.5 on capacity-building has not been implemented. 
                             
Keys lesson learned, include:                                                                                                                                                               The request for project extensions should have been made to the GCF Secretariat immediately after the devastating widesprade Floods of 2018, recognizing that this would have had significant impacts on the country and on project implementation. 

Recognizing the internal processes of the government would be very useful to allow sufficient timing to complete the request. In addition, NDA understands that coordination is the key to success. Given the fact that this is totally new to several stakeholders, it has been difficult to pull things together and ensure that all different sectors are on the same page. 

As activities are interlinked, it is important to prioritize and have a correct sequence at the beginning that enables activites to take place in a timely manner. This is being addressed by taking more times to discuss and agree on how relevant stakeholders can work together, ensuring effective and efficent coordiantion and actions are addressed in a timely manner. In addition, recognizing the capacity of the different sectors varies, this will continue to be a challenge , and will be addressed by enhanced/ better coordiantion and planning.                             

1.1.5- Capacity-building for 1.1.4: partially achieved 

1.2.1: Establish a No Objection Procedure, the No Objection Procedure was developed, updated, finalised, translated and published throuhg a series of workshops, consultations with stakeholders. It is now NDA is disemminating and distributing the document to relevant stakeholders for their further use and reference. 

The No Objection Procedure was launched at the GCF-GEF National Dialogue in February 2019 and circulated in English and in Lao. Subsequently the Government has had a peer-to-peer exchange with the Government of Thailand for comparison of the No Objection Procedure. 

The No Objection Procedure was produced as a living document with the expectation of updating every 6 to 12 months. The first update completed in August 2019. 

1.2.2: Facilitate technical meeting: hosting the GCF GEF Mission supported the NDA&#x2019;s capacity building in its role on coordinating among sectors and in assessment of the key concepts of the GCF projects to support their role in offering the No Objection Letter. 

Challenge: As this document is expected to be updated from time to time. With limited capacity and resources, it is challenging to have this document updated every 6-12 months. However, it requires NDA to be proactive in updating this document by reaching out to potential development partners, i.e. UNDP and other UN agencies to support. 

The key lesson learned is that NDA as well as participants feel that the requirement and processes of the fund are rather complicated. This need more capacity development for NDA and relevant stakeholders to be able handle this smoothly and be able to access the fund directly in the future. 


1.4.1 Develop NDA capacity and associated protocols: NDA capacity developed with climate finance training (aug 2019); participation of NDA and NDA staff in regional and global workshops and meetings; sharing best practices of country programmes as a guide for development of the Lao country programme. In addition, this acivity has been built the foundation for the NDA, especially Training on Climate Finance in August 2019. From this training, the report template for multi-stakeholders is being developed to provide inputs to the NDA to report to UNFCCC. The template will be further improved by the NDA. 

The Climate Finance Workshop was organized in July 2019. The main objective was to enhance understanding of the processes in proposing fund from GCF. Representatives from various sectors attended the workshop to learned what is climate finance, why is it important? In aiddtion, participants also undertook exercises on how to prepare proposals by taking into account the required criteria. This activity has been a driver in capacity development allowing stakeholders to understand the processess and requirements. 

A Climate Database workshop was also organized for relevant stakeholders.Guidelines have been developed and shared and Department of Climate Change, MoNRE will continue to develop together with other agencies, i.e. FAO, Global Green Growth Institute (GGGI). 

NDA piloted bi-monthly meetings, which invited different development partners, relevant government agencies to update and exchange on GCF, discuss coordination among stakeholders and share exepreinces. The pilot received positive feedback from participants. 

1.4.2 Create GCF related information repository, all required equipment has been purchased. However, the Department of Climate Change has not been able to establish the website because no budget has been allocated to cover internet hosting and maintainence fee, which costed USD3600 annually. Stable internet signal is needed to maintain the website server. 


Challenges- Regarding website, the main challenge is on maintenance and updating the information. This requires time, resources and capacity. This can be addressed by UNDP continuing to monitor progress. This should be further evaluated as to the worth of the investment. NDA is considering other donors to support the webiste. 

Lesson learned: Establishing website needs be planned earlier to allow technical issues to be addressed before proceeding procurement. To this end, technical persons, especially those who manage IT, should be given enough time to prepare and plan accordingly. 

The Climate Finance Training is been received very postively. Given that GCF is new to most of the stakeholders. The training provided basic information, sharing an overview of the fund, themes, clarifying the details of requirements. In addition, allowing participants to do excercise in preparing proposals, meeting the requirement. 

The activities mentioned-above, allowed participants to learn and understand more about Climate Finance, they now have increased their confidence in developing donor proposals.

2.2.3 Option for a system of call for concepts: capacity constraints at the beginning were a result of dependence on local consultants and the capacity of the consultants. When the international consultant was recruited to address pending issues, not all were able to be addressed in the given time. NDA plan to open the call for National Adaptation Proposal (NAP) in late 2019 or 2020. 

2.2.4 Establishment of technical thematic groups: NDA plans to establish a Secretariat to review proposals and this will include members from different sectors including: agriculture, public work, health etc. 

The main challenge in the completion of this document was in data and information collection and in coordiantion amoungst the many stakeholders. 

The NDA found it challenging to strengthen its own capacity as they have many competing priorities. This is also related to a lack of human resources both quantity and quality. It was mistakenly thought that all work would be completed by consultant rather than DCC.                                                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                                                                               The lesson learned from the development of the Country Programme is that inclusive consulation assist all in better understadning and addressing challenges, workl and outputs; ensuring cpacity and skill set of staff are provided in a timely matter was also another key lesson.  As a living document it will be updated from time to time. as conditions and priorities cahnge - for example the development of the 9th Five year National Socio-Economic Development Plan which is due in 2020 

The final lesson was that leaders from the relevant sectors recognise that they need to pay more attention and have a greater understadning of GCF to ensure that more projects are developed against government priorities in a timely manner.</narrative>
