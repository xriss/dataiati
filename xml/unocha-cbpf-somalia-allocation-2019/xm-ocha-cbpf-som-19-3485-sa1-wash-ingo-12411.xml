  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Limited access to safe water in Somaliland is endemic and is worsening with prolonged drought. Poor, below-average rainfall in northern and central Somalia during the Deyr season of 2018 has resulted in a harsher than normal dry season. 
Most water sources across Sool and Sanaag regions in the north are not suitable for human consumption and approximately half of the birkads are damaged, and a quarter of them did not harvest any run-off because of the lack of rains. In addition, poor access to latrines leads to prevalent open defecation across Somalia/land. 
The aim of the proposed project is to provide lifesaving support to and rebuild resilience of affected communities through providing sustainable solutions to water access. Oxfam prioritizes activities that enable communities to access continued water supply from existing groundwater sources, reduce the walking distance for women/girls to fetch water at a reduced cost, contain human feaces contaminating the environment and surface water sources, and promote behavioural change on personal hygiene and handwashing at critical times.
Oxfam is present in hard-to-reach and in some of the most neglected geographical areas of Sool and Sanaag regions and continues to prioritize presence based on where the highest &#x2018;unreached&#x2019; needs lie. There is a committed and robust humanitarian team (over 30+) in Somalia based out of a main office, a field office, and two sub-offices. The current team has strong technical capacity in response management, with technical coordinators for WaSH and a robust 3-person MEAL team that guides quality and accountability of programming in the field. Working with partners on some interventions/responses, also affords good complementarity in understanding the local context and assuring 2-way sharing of technical knowledge and skills that could enrich growth and progress in addressing the needs of the target population. 

2 desalination units are proposed in Oog and Garadag. Oxfam will engage in a public private partnership with Boreal Light (which has expertise in operating desalination plants and can provide operation and management training) and the Somaliland Ministry of Water Resource Development (MoWRD). Oxfam already has good relationships and experience with both parties, having closely collaborated around 2 existing desalination units funded in other areas by other donors. The MoWRD supports and endorses desalination work in Somaliland. 

Boreal Light is a leading actor in this sector, specialized in renewable energy solutions for water treatment facilities. It manufactures affordable solar water desalination systems and has extensive expertise in the region, including Kenya and Somaliland. It has identified a local agent in Somaliland who will be responsible for operating, maintaining and managing the desalination units under the SHF project for a period 12 months. The training provided in this time will present a sustainable model after the end of the project period. 

To ensure value for money for this funding and program complimentary, ACTED and Oxfam will coordinate on key activities in Sanaag. At project inception, there will be a training workshop on key learning from WASH programming in the region to share experience: e.g. borehole drilling, sharing supplier lists and good practices in drilling and rehabilitation works, engagement with communities and local authorities. Other topics are likely to cover hydreological surveys, desalination and solarization. WASHCO training to be jointly undertaken after asset completion. Cost savings will be on printing materials, vehicle, and stationary. Joint mapping of WASH facilities in El-Afweyn and Ainabo to assess status of available assets, beneficiaries reached and to analyze gaps and investments necessary to provide support. .A joint MampE exercise will be done twice in the project period.</narrative>
