   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Life-saving shelter assistance for 31,800 most vulnerable IDPs and Host communities in Elbarde and Xudur through distribution of standard Non-Food Items and Construction of Emergency Shelters.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In the context of deplorable shelter conditions facing IDPs and vulnerable host communities in Xudur and Elberde, AVORD is submitting this proposal with the aim of providing critical Non-Food Items (NFIs) and emergency shelters to save the lives of 31,800 persons. The target group will be selected from communities affected by deteriorating nutrition in both districts with special consideration to most vulnerable households, including new arrivals and protracted IDPs living in makeshift buuls without adequate access to basic necessities including shelter. 

AVORD will adapt a systematic approach to beneficiary selection with a clear criterion to prioritize the most vulnerable in target communities including the marginalized, unaccompanied children, older Persons, persons with disability, single women, pregnant and lactating mothers, single headed-households, persons with chronic illness or psychological condition, large families and/or families with babies, toddlers or children attending school, persons at risk as identified by protection officers and those with special needs. The project team will undertake a vulnerability assessment involving documenting of household profiles among the IDPs and host communities in target areas to identify the most vulnerable who are in urgent need for shelter assistance.  Data will be collected through a number of methods including structured interviews with households heads, Focus Group Discussions (FGDs), and direct site observation. Collected data to inform beneficiary selection will also be segregated by gender to ensure that no group is left-out. List of beneficiaries along with their contact numbers will be availed to SHF and other actors responding in the area as needed to avoid overlap. Mindful of the Somali context and utilizing its expertise in target locations, AVORD will pay attention to issues of diversity in the targeting process. 

Following need-based and transparent selection of beneficiaries, AVORD will provide affected households with standard NFI kits comprising of 1 Plastic Sheet, 3 Blankets, 2 Sleeping Mats, I Kitchen Set, 1 Mosquito Net, 1 Solar Torch and 2 Jerry Cans with the capacity of 10 Liters each. Since there are no functioning NFI markets in Elberde and Xudur as observed recently by own assessment team, AVORD will use an in-kind modality for project implementation. The proposed content in each set is based on current Shelter Cluster standards for people in humanitarian emergencies. In addition to NFIs, emergency shelters will be constructed for newly displaced households living in the open or under deplorable shelter conditions. Proper site planning will be undertaken during the construction of shelters to ensure effective mitigation of hazards and reduce congestion levels while enhancing protection levels for at risk women and girls. AVORD will also employ an owner-driven approach by capacitating the IDPs to undertake the construction process. 

Protection will be mainstreamed throughout project duration by closely coordinating with other partners operating Sexual and Gender Based Violence (SGBV) crisis centers and facilitating principled referrals where necessary. The effectiveness of the aid package will be ascertained through Post Distribution Monitoring exercise thus ensuring that beneficiaries access their services safely and in a dignified manner. An elaborate feedback and complain mechanism will be setup to ensure accountability to the affected population.

In the delivery of the proposed package, AVORD will seek Integration with other clusters and own interventions in the region to ensure complementarity, value for money and efficiency of the response.</narrative>
