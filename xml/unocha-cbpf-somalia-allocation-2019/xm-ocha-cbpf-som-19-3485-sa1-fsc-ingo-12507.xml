   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Provide Emergency food security and livelihoods responses for drought affected pastoral communities and pastoral drop-outs in Burco district, Togdheer region</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The detrimental effects of underperforming rains are impacting the parts of population that is still trying to recover from the effects of an extended drought in northern and central Somalia. The deteriorating food security outlook, combined with the worsening malnutrition calls for a rapid and well-targeted scale up of response to save lives and support recovery. The project is aimed at improving the ability of vulnerable HHs to meet their basic needs, supports protection and recovery of livelihood assets through life-saving UCT, animal treatment services and emergency fodder provision in Burco district Togdheer region. The project targets 1137 vulnerable drought affected pastoralist HHs including women, men, boys, girls, and female headed households who are classified under IPC 3 amp 4. The drought has severely and directly affected pastoral communities whose sources of food, income and water are diminishing and increasingly at risk. This has led to household food insecurity, sharp increase in debt levels among poor households and a severe reduction in access to safe water for both domestic and animal use. Additionally, the drought affected households rely on food purchase from local markets, have weak purchasing power due to limited income and lack access to credit services due to cumulative debt and therefore not able to purchase veterinary drugs, fodder and water, which is essential when livestock body condition is so poor thus susceptible to opportunistic diseases.

COOPI prioritizes respect for the rights, dignity and safety of the people affected by crisis and is committed to taking account of, giving account to, and being held to account by the populations benefiting from the intervention. During implementation, the beneficiary women, girls and the disabled will be included in decision making processes, monitoring so as ensure that the most marginalized and vulnerable are represented and have influence. The project will be guided by the principles of DO NO HARM, ensuring safety and dignity of target population is upheld and at the same time providing for accountability, participation and empowerment. In order to improve household immediate access to food, unconditional cash transfer will be provided to 1137 drought affected pastoralists HHs including girls, pregnant and lactating women, boys and men to enable them immediately access food, water, healthcare, and other basic services. 

To protect key livelihoods assets of pastoralists, livestock belonging to 400 vulnerable pastoralists HHs (including female headed) affected by drought who cannot afford costs for livestock drugs and treatment services will be provided with treatment. This activity will prevent deaths and reduction in production through treatment of livestock against bacterial infections. Moreover, emergency fodder provision for core breeding herd belonging to 200 HHs during stress periods will prevent losses and ensure milk availability for children. The activity is aimed at protecting livestock assets of the drought affected pastoral communities from starvation, opportunistic infections and death. This activity is envisaged to reduce workload and stress on women and girls who are responsible for feeding livestock. In addition, GBV  and exploitation associated with searching of livestock feed and transporting fodder for long distances will be mitigated through the proposed livestock feed provision
In summary the following activities will be carried out:
1. Provide unconditional cash to 1137 HH. 2.) Provide livestock treatment support for 400 HH. 3.) Emergency fodder provision for core breeding herd belonging to 200 HHs during stress periods to prevent losses and ensure milk availability for children.</narrative>
