   <narrative xml:lang="EN">- Speak truth: Our global and national engagement will galvanise urgent action on AIDS, particularly around the crisis in HIV prevention.
- Unlock barriers: Our advocacy with communities will challenge social and gender norms and influence governments and other institutions to develop and implement laws, plans and policies to ensure full access to services.
- Invest in solutions: We will tailor our innovative solutions to respond to the needs of the most marginalised people.
- Build a sustainable future: Our technical assistance for civil society and governments will enhance the delivery, governance and monitoring of comprehensive national HIV responses.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Global Plan of Action drives the work of the Frontline AIDS partnership between 2020 and 2025. The Plan sets out ten critical actions that we will prioritise to help the world secure a future free from AIDS for everyone, everywhere.

We believe that if the 10 actions in this plan are successful, they will make a significant contribution towards global efforts to reduce new HIV infections and AIDS-related deaths.

No single organisation can end AIDS alone. We must work collectively, bringing our skills and experience in HIV, health and human rights to address the challenges that drive the epidemic.

Our Global Plan of Action is a call to action for everyone who wants a future free from AIDS.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">We work with marginalised people who are denied HIV prevention, treatment and care simply because of who they are and where they live. This includes people living with HIV, sex workers, people who use drugs, transgender people, gay men and other men who have sex with men, as well as adolescent girls and women.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">Communities affected by HIV have been the driving force behind some of the most inspiring responses to the COVID-19 pandemic. Together with our partners, we have extensively redesigned how we serve and support people with HIV programmes when it is not possible to meet them face to face or unsafe to attend clinical services. All over the world, our partners flexed swiftly and decisively to find different ways of reaching their clients, from organising home deliveries of antiretrovirals by bicycle and take-out methadone doses to telephone counselling, online outreach and more. We are proud to say that, despite many restrictions, people are still being reached with lifesaving HIV and SRHR services. Indeed, our flagship SRHR Umbrella Grant programme in Uganda managed to reach more than 600,000 people in its lifetime, with most of that taking place in the past year. 

In the first integrated HIV and neglected tropical disease (NTD) programme of its kind, together with our Kenyan partner LVCT we are addressing the intersection between HIV and female genital schistosomiasis (FGS). Through a pilot programme that has the potential to radically reduce HIV risk for women and girls, we are developing new ways of screening and support for both issues. In another first, the pilot has involved LVCT working with the Kenyan Ministry of Health&#x2019;s NTD department from inception and the organisation is now looking at ways to include FGS strategies in its USAID-funded DREAMS project that focuses on HIV prevention among adolescent girls and young women.  

Throughout 2020, we have continued to develop and advocate for innovative packages of support for people who use drugs. Important advocacy wins were the significant increase in harm reduction funding in Mozambique, and the opening of Uganda&#x2019;s first OAT programme, which was a result of years of advocacy by the Ugandan Harm Reduction Network (UHRN), supported by PITCH. The programme opened at Butabika hospital in Kampala in October 2020 and, with funding from PEPFAR, the clinic has been integrated into a public health facility. All referrals are made from UHRN&#x2019;s drop-in centres where psychosocial support officers prepare people to enrol in the OAT programme and offer support once they are enrolled.  

In Myanmar, our Integrated Harm Reduction Programme funded our partner Mahamate to appoint 12 peer counsellors in government-run drug treatment centres. Their role is to improve people who use drugs&#x2019; adherence to OAT (including new clients), support their involvement in HIV prevention and treatment and to offer psychosocial support. They also play an important administrative role assisting with data entry, restocking supplies and packaging take-home doses of OAT which became an essential function during the pandemic.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">Following the onset of COVID-19 in early 2020, we developed a Call to Action on HIV, TB and COVID-19, which was endorsed by almost 200 civil society partners, from global coalitions to frontline community organisations. The Call urges the international community to&#x202F;sustain&#x202F;progress on HIV and TB, to&#x202F;adapt&#x202F;HIV and TB programmes to also address COVID-19, and to&#x202F;protect&#x202F;human rights. We have used it to sound the alarm in key spaces like the UNAIDS PCB, the AIDS 2020 conference and in the UNAIDS strategy process. At the June 2020 Programme Coordinating Board, the UNAIDS Executive Director Winnie Byanyima specifically referenced the Call in her opening address and called on governments and donors to sustain their commitments to the AIDS response despite the new pandemic. Ms Byanyima has been an increasingly vocal advocate for HIV prevention and the newly finalised global AIDS strategy reflects an increased focus on the prevention crisis and the need to break down barriers to access for key populations, adolescents and women.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">In our SRHR Umbrella programme in Uganda, a mid-term review in 2019 taught us that we needed to invest more in support for mental health and livelihoods, so during 2020 we trialled new packages of support in these areas. Community-based screening and referrals and training of peer supporters in understanding mental health were delivered in 2020 and will help us understand how we can leave behind a sustainable service. We have also ramped up our work on mental health in our READY+ programme, which reached 20,000 young people with holistic and integrated HIV care in 2020. This programme carried out an evidence review into &#x2018;What works&#x2019; to support the Mental Health of Young People Living with HIV in 2020. The community adolescent treatment supporters (CATS) model, which the READY approach builds upon and was pioneered by our partner Africaid-Zvandiri, has been recognised as being significantly more effective in preventing viral load failure than standard models.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">In response to the increase in gender-based violence brought about by COVID-19, we developed resources for partners to support them to address gender and HIV in the context of COVID-19. This is a lens that has been largely missing from other resources looking at either the gender dynamics of COVID-19 or its impact on the HIV response.  

During 2020, we continued to advocate for&#x202F;stronger investment in addressing the linkages between&#x202F;violence against women and girls and HIV, and to strengthen commitments to gender equality&#x202F;and human rights in the new&#x202F;UNAIDS and Global Fund strategies. To mark the 25th anniversary of the adoption of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action, we highlighted the Unfinished Business19 of the Beijing agreement to protect women and girls from HIV. We joined with feminist organisations to push the agenda around violence against women and HIV at AIDS 2020 where we launched our report &quot;Violence is everywhere&quot;. At AIDS 2020 we also focused on the harmful and disruptive nature of US foreign policies, in particular the negative impact of the Global Gag Rule on communities affected by HIV and joined advocates around the world in calling for its permanent repeal.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">Reports of human rights violations increased as COVID-19 spread, throwing up new questions about rights and restrictions during an emergency. Our partners wanted to use REAct &#x2013; our flagship community-led human rights monitoring and response programme &#x2013; to support their communities, but first we needed to adapt it to make it fit for purpose during COVID-19 times. We had to support existing&#x202F;users to continue to implement REAct in this new environment and find ways to provide training and technical support virtually. 

Six countries were due to start implementing REAct when the COVID-19 crisis struck and, determined not to delay, we converted the usual four-day face-to-face training workshop into a series of webinars with an accompanying training manual. Documentation tools were adjusted to better capture gender-based violence incidents and to assist partners to provide linkages to services. The need for stronger support systems led to us creating an online community of practice &#x2013; a space for organisations that are implementing REAct to share information, opportunities and experiences. 

In 2020, REAct went live in six new countries: Uganda, Mozambique, Zimbabwe, Lebanon, Uzbekistan and Russia. It is now being actively implemented in 12 countries in total.  Altogether, 2,233 clients were registered, and 2,345 cases documented across the REAct portfolio in 2020. One outcome worth highlighting was in Moldova where legislation related to marginalised people remains repressive and discriminatory. REAct evidence recorded that in the city of Orhei, 27 cases of people who use drugs were having to travel to another city 50km away to receive opioid agonist treatment. This data has enabled partners to enter into negotiations with the Ministry of Health about the opening of an OAT site closer to home.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">Through our PITCH programme we have supported communities to make their voices heard in key Univeral Health Coverage (UHC) decision-making spaces so that national UHC health plans and policies consider their particular needs and circumstances. 

Under PITCH, we worked with 31 community-based organisations in Indonesia, Kenya, Nigeria and Zimbabwe to strengthen their knowledge on health financing and budget advocacy. This included the development of policy briefs and situational analyses to better understand how resources are being allocated. The partners were then able to take part in round table discussions with key decision makers to engage more closely with national and regional processes, thereby widening their sphere of influence.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">Using platforms like the Commission on the Status of Women, the UNAIDS Programme Coordinating Board meetings and the Global HIV Prevention Coalition, we have been vocal in demanding political leadership for HIV prevention, full funding, and action to remove discriminatory laws, end harmful gender norms and roll out comprehensive sexuality education. As a result, during the course of 2020, we have seen increased recognition with UNAIDS, the Global Fund and other donors now acknowledging HIV prevention as an urgent priority. Whilst Frontline AIDS cannot claim to have singlehandedly brought about such a shift, our unrelenting focus on fighting back for prevention has undoubtedly helped to influence opinion.  

With the Global Fund in the process of preparing its next strategy, Frontline AIDS and partners produced a series of regional papers for Fund board members making the case for prioritising HIV prevention, especially among marginalised populations, as well as investing in community responses. In January 2021, we organised a series of regional meetings to ensure that partners had the opportunity to continue inputting to the Global Fund strategy process in detail.   

From our attention-grabbing &quot;Don&#x2019;t You Forget About Me&quot; video for World AIDS Day and our noisy and determined online presence at AIDS 20209 to shadow reports tracking progress on prevention, together with our partners we have seized every opportunity to bang the drum for HIV prevention. Providing a community perspective, the seven shadow reports have catalysed significant policy changes at national level. In Malawi, HIV prevention advocates used the 2020 shadow report alongside those from the previous two years to get the government to update or establish size estimates for men who have sex with men, trans people and sex workers, and develop programmatic targets and HIV service packages for these groups. In Zimbabwe, advocacy off the back of the past three years&#x2019; shadow reports contributed to the development of the country&#x2019;s first national drug masterplan, which includes a focus on harm reduction. In Nigeria, the first-ever harm reduction programme got off the ground under the country&#x2019;s Global Fund grant thanks to Frontline AIDS&#x2019; efforts. In Kenya, the work of our partners resulted in there finally being official recognition at a policy level of trans people having specific HIV-related needs.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">We strengthened gender-transformative approaches in several of our programmes including PITCH where we built the capacity of partners to apply a gender-transformative lens in their advocacy, helped by our guides &quot;What does it take to achieve a gender-transformative HIV response?&quot; and &quot;Engendering universal health coverage&quot;. Under the SRHR Umbrella programme, we started to build a stronger focus on preventing and responding to gender-based violence through awarding grants that aim to accelerate community-led innovation in this area. 
 
In Zimbabwe, we contributed to mainstreaming gender equality and social inclusion within the organisations and institutions that are part of the four-year Evidence and Collaboration for Inclusive Development (ECID) programme. We did this by embedding the Looking In Looking Out (LILO) methodology originally developed by our partner Positive Vibes to address negative attitudes towards people with diverse sexual orientation, sex workers and people who use drugs. Participants reported a significant improvement in understanding concepts related to gender, marginalisation and diversity, and indicated a commitment to working more inclusively &#x2013; especially with and for people with disabilities &#x2013; and to addressing internalised gender biases and prejudices.</narrative>
