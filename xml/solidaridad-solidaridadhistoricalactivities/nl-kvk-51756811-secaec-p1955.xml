   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Anti Child Labour in ASM Gold Mines in Uganda project</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Up to 1.5 million children are involved in artisanal small-scale mining (ASM) globally, which the International Labour Organization have identified as exposing children to greater risks than any other sector (collapsing mines, carbon monoxide poisoning and mercury use are just some of the risks children may be exposed to). The drivers for the participation of children in mining can be found in a lack of (access to) education and chronic economic poverty.

To effectively tackle child labour in ASM communities, a multi-faceted approach is therefore needed. In this context, our two-year programme seeks to affect change at the community, mine and supply chain levels &#x2013; establishing an enabling environment for child-free mining sites by creating a range of incentives for behaviour change.

Our work at community level will employ an area based approach to child labour, focusing on involving all stakeholders within the area, including teachers, parents, children, unions, community groups, local authorities and employers, to work together to end all forms of child labour. Only by embedding awareness of the prohibition of child labour and access to education in the whole area the approach will be sustainable.

At the mine and supply chain levels we will seek to support the formalisation and economic prosperity of mining sites as a strategy to addressing the poverty-driven causes of child labour in ASM communities. Our programme will provide incentives for community action to remediate against child labour through conditional access to credit (to invest in improved mining equipment) and international markets (with links to off takers and the creation of an export model for verified small-scale mined gold).

By creating a multi-pronged approach including incentives for behaviour change, our programme will contribute to our vision of economically prosperous and child-free mining communities within the next 5 years.

The project will take place in Busia district, Uganda. There are an estimated 50,000 small-scale miners in Uganda with up to 30% of these (15,000+) being children. Busia sits in extreme East of Uganda on the border with Kenya and has a historic gold mining tradition, including a wide range of small-scale mining sites in varying degrees of formalisation.

Our project will work with Artisanal Small-scale Mining Organisations (ASMOs) in the Busitema and/or Buteba sub-counties of Busia District, which house combined populations of 45,000 people. As the baseline report for Uganda demonstrated, to effectively tackle child labour in mining in the region, actions need to offer alternatives and have impact on the main causes of child labour in artisanal gold mining in the region which is lack of decent work and income for adults, unstable family situations, lack of awareness around child labour and the importance of education and the costs for and lack of sufficient schools and quality education.</narrative>
