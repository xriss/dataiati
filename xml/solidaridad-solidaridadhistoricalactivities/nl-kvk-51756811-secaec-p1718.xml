   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In Ethiopia, we supported the Confederation of Trade Unions of Ethiopia (CETU) to develop and submit an evidence based policy paper to the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs and the Standing Committee on Women, Youth &amp; Social Affairs. This paper has been critical in the final decisions on formulation of key policy achievements in Ethiopia, relating to maternity leave and probation period under the Labour Law. Maternity leave was extended up to 120 days, helping to allow female workers to return to their jobs. Lobbying and negotiations led in the end to something of a compromise between employers and labour organizations: for new employees the probation period was limited to a maximum of  60 days. 

In Myanmar, Solidaridad was proud to be part of the clear organizational development of CTUM during the project period. From a nascent organization with a skeleton staff, scant resources and fundamental capacity gaps, they have grown and professionalized over the period in a remarkable manner. This has not only been evidenced by such developments as their capacity to lobby the State Counselor to order formation of a tripartite National Complaints Mechanism in January 2020, but has also been evident in their response to the political crisis following the closure of the project. CTUM have been among the leaders of the opposition, with their communications and leadership displaying a strategic outlook and international character that has clearly been developed through their relationship with Solidaridad and other international partners. The decision to focus on building the particular capacity of Ms. Khaing Zhar as a future leader of the organization appears to be reflected in her prominent leading role, in an internationally-oriented campaign to exert pressure on the authorities to respect labour norms and end the oppression of union members. 

Overall, our textile programme was severely hampered by socio-political events outside of our span of control. The popular uprising and violent response of the Military Junta led to the cessation of all our activities in Myanmar. In Bangladesh, a terrorist attack created a climate that made it early on too unsafe to continue with the programme. In Ethiopia, the political turmoil and armed conflict in Tigray led to halting the programme in 2020. For both Bangladesh and Ethiopia, planning exercises are underway and continuation is foreseen under our RECLAIM Sustainability! programme. It is not likely our office in Myanmar will reopen in the short term.</narrative>
