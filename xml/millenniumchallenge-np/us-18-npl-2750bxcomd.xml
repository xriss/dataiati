   <narrative xml:lang="EN">MCC&apos;s Nepal Compact is designed to increase the availability of electricity and lower the cost of transportation in Nepal. These investments will help the Government of Nepal better deliver critical services to its people, ease the movement of goods around the country, and open up new opportunities for private investment. Strengthening the reliability of key infrastructure will put the country&apos;s economy on a firmer growth trajectory, advance stability, support regional security, and reduce poverty.</narrative>
