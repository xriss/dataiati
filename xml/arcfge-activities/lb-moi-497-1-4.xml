   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In late 2017, ABAAD has contacted several universities in Beirut regarding possible endorsement and use of the national GBV Case Management Curriculum in light of their involvement in the peer review process of the curriculum. The universities included: the University of Saint Joseph/Social Work School, Lebanese University/Faculty of Public Health, La Sagesse University, and the Lebanese American University/IWSAW) and they all expressed interest in the curriculum. Following thorough consideration of the different university curriculums, ABAAD planned to launch the accreditation process through the formation of a peer-review committee representing the different academic institutions. As part of the process, ABAAD has contacted these academic institutions in order to ensure that knowledge of a unified case management curriculum is mainstreamed across institutions and across new generations of front-liners, especially those graduating from faculties of social work. However, MOSA as lead on this curriculum, and to ensure that the use of the curriculum is standardized on a national scale, leaned more towards engagement with the Lebanese University which is Lebanon&#x2019;s public university.. Knowing that such government procedures in Lebanon are highly centralized and bureaucratic, this would be a very lengthy process. Alternatively, a proposition was made by MOSA to possibly integrate the curriculum as part the courses under the Master Gender Studies at the Lebanese American University where amount can be invested in covering the expenses for a group of MOSA Social Workers to complete this course and become certified as trainers on the curriculum on national level and the on the National GBV SOP. This process will be led by MOSA following the launch of the curricula, which was delayed in its completion due to gap in cabinet formation,</narrative>
