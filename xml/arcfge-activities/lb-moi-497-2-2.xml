   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The need for a code of conduct to regulate the way journalists and reporters deliver the information and to set limits to how far they can go in smearing the survivors&#x2019; reputations and/or jeopardizing their lives, lead to the need of producing a toolkit that would build the knowledge and skills of these journalists on issues related to gender-based violence. This toolkit aims at reaching out to all the journalists/ reporters and training them to better tackle the cases of violence against women and perceive it as part of human rights, and not just another sensual story, in addition to encouraging a deeper understanding of the cases and the best ways of addressing them. For this end, a peer review committee was formed that includes specialists in the GBV sector, academics, trainers and linguists, and the toolkit has been developed. This was steered by desk research on coverage trends of GBV and women survivors of violence, and with the aim of ending negative stereotypes and generalizations of GBV and GBV-survivors, redirecting media coverage to ensure the highest standards of conduct, as well as protecting survivors from defamation. It&apos;s composed from seven main chapters: - Introduction - Women&#x2019;s rights in the international laws - Gender based Violence against women and girls - Principles and associated ethics to cover cases of violence against Women and girls - Gender Sensitive Media- Coverage - How to interview survivors of violence - Terminology - Annexes and document</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This toolkit was designed for several reasons, some of which being that women in conflict/post-conflict contexts, particularly in the Middle East, are subject to societal and historical/traditional constraints that limit them severely in seeking help for GBV. The media, widely consumed, has a large part to play in the depiction of women survivors of violence in conflict/post-conflict contexts. Rather than portray women as &#x201C;immoral&#x201D; or as responsible for the violence perpetrated against them, this tool aims to shift the media lens that covers GBV in these contexts. In the context of UN Security Council Resolution 1325, this toolkit aims to localize the global convention to protect women and children of all nationalities exposed to GBV.</narrative>
