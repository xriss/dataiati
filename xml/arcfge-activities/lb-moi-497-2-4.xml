   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Journalists, particularly those covering violence and conflict zones, often suffer from symptoms of trauma and emotional stress because of the nature of the stories they report on. After conducting a prior needs study, Fe-Male conducted three self-care sessions for journalists working in the field of GBV and women&#x2019;s rights. The prior needs study was conducted in Beirut, Bekaa, and Tripoli through FGs with journalists working on the field, as well as a survey that was circulated via a mailing list and social media. These sessions focused on the concepts of mindfulness, stress reduction techniques as well as wellbeing and resilience. The specific learning objectives of these self-care sessions include: - Developing knowledge of the essential self-care practice, including key intervention concepts and practices: essential self, self-care, discipline, mindfulness - Understanding the process of emotional awareness - Developing knowledge and understanding of research-based health benefits of mindfulness - Exploring tools to use for developing a personal self-care practice - Developing knowledge and understanding of the process, tools and needed apparatuses for self-regulation - Learning the process of integrating resilience into wellbeing</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="AR">Our partner was able to give a pilot self-care session to journalists in the field of women&#x2019;s rights and GBV-related issues. This session, conducted by the expert consultant, certified life coach and positive psychology expert, Mr. Milad Hadchiti, was driven based on the aforementioned prior needs assessment. Based on this assessment, sessions were based in Beirut on January 31, 2018, February 28, 2018, June 20, 2018 &amp; July 18, 2018, and in Tripoli (Northern Lebanon) on March 17, 2018, and June 19, 2018 targeting 92 Lebanese participants with 19 Male (21% of the participants) and 73 females (79% of participants) . These sessions were based primarily on stress reduction, wellbeing and resilience, based on the needs gauged earlier and the content was mostly practical and intended for the relief and the well-being of the participants and not to increase a certain knowledge. Based on the participants&#x2019; recommendations (and request, a one-day self-care session is not enough for the journalists who daily face hardships and some of them are in direct contact with victims or survivors of GBV and people who suffer. It is recommended that each session could be conducted in a form of a retreat, where the journalists can actually separate themselves from their surrounding for a while and enjoy the stress- releasing techniques. A short video/documentary was created to document these sessions, including interviews with the participating journalists.</narrative>
