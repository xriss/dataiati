   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Between March and June 2017, 75 ISF members and officers across all Lebanese governorates received training&apos;s on CMR sensitization through four (two-day) sessions, on the following dates: 1. 28 &amp; 29 March 2017 2. 18 &amp; 19 April 2017 3. 23 &amp; 24 May 2017 4. 20 &amp; 21 June 2017 The table below shows the increase in knowledge/month between February &#x2013; June 2017, according to the pre/post test results: March: pre-test 34% - post-test 84% -- % of change 50% April: pre-test 26% - post- test 80% -- % of change 54% May: pre-test 29% - post-test 81% -- % of change 52% June: pre-test 27% - post- test 85% -- % of change 58% These sessions aim to ensure proper implementation of law 293 related to domestic and sexual violence, provide training on women survivor&#x2019;s protection needs, and maintain proper referral pathways. They will equip ISF centers with CMR PEP kits (post-exposure procedures in the case of rape/sexual assault). This is important as there are no unified national procedures for CMR, and ABAAD wants to ensure that the first persons of contact for victims of SGBV in the judicial/legal/investigative sphere (i.e. the ISF) are well-versed in the appropriate procedures for victims of sexual violence and assault. Through joint efforts, the Internal Security Forces (ISF) and ABAAD are raising awareness on crimes of sexual violence. In July 2017, ABAAD conducted a ToT on CMR sensitization for ISF senior officers. ISF then issued Memo # 339/204 s.4 in September 25th, 2017 on &#x201C;Standards of Interaction and Investigation in Human Trafficking and Sexual Assault Crimes, and standards of support to survivors of such crimes&#x201D; (annex #25). This memo was then designed as a flyer and poster, translated into two languages (English &amp; French) that the Non-Arabic speakers can understand it, and distributed in the ISF Police Stations and to the public via checkpoints (ISF officers flagged down cars and passers-by, handing out pamphlets highlighting the laws protecting women and the role of the ISF in enforcing these statutes. The pamphlets include information on the steps women should take if they are experiencing any form of violence or harassment). Six meetings were then held with the head of the Internal Security Forces as well as the ISF Head of the Training and Research Department, where an MOU was signed between ABAAD and the ISF (annex #25). These meetings resulted in an agreement between the ISF and ABAAD to 1) launch a national media campaign in 2018 on the ISF Due Diligence, and 2) conduct capacity building workshops for ISF members on the official memo, namely covering issues related to sexual assaults, clinical management of rape, as well as trafficking against women. Based on that, in November and December 2017, a ToT was issued to five high-ranking officers from the ISF where their graduation ceremony took part on October 2018, during a conference organized under the patronage of the Director-General, General Imad Othman , in the presence of Minister of State for Women Affairs Mr. Jean Agassbian, H.E. Ambassador of the Netherlands in Lebanon Mr. Jean Weltmanns, the Director General of the Ministry of Information Hassan Falah, representatives of relevant ministries, the leadership of the army, security institutions and civil defense, judges, as well as representatives of civil society organizations. During 2018, weekly two days training sessions were given to more than One Thousand Two Hundred (1200) ISF officers for an average of 22 officers per session, with 96 female ISF officers (8% of the total participants) and 1104 male officers (92% of the participants). And with the aim of building their capacities on CMR, we used simultaneous interactive and informative sessions making the participation more appealing. Such activities included movies, role playing, and exercises attempting at creating a holistic understanding of the problems discussed in the sessions and addressing the following topics: - Essential concepts of sexual assault - Acquiring skills to handling survivors of sexual assault - Psycho-social and ethical elements needed when approaching a survivor of sexual assault - Important considerations to acquire when handling survivors of sexual assault in the male, children, and elderly population - Defining the clinical management of cases of sexual violence - Introducing the basics of prophylactic methods via the sexual assault aids kit - Interagency standard operating procedures (SOPs) for SGBV prevention and response in Lebanon - Referral systems in Lebanon - Practicing the essentials And on the second day, using explanatory/informative documentary and presentation on the memo. With the aim of building their capacities on topics related to human trafficking and sexual assault, monitoring/identifying indicators, and conducting investigations (annex #25). All ToTs conducted were done so with the objective of expanding the pool of trainers and ensure sustainability and a consistent flow of trainers within the Lebanese Internal Security Forces. This also dually acts as an exit strategy for ABAAD, as the ISF begins taking on the responsibility and due diligence in training its officers. Nevertheless, this memo was lunched during an activity organized jointly by The General Directorate of the Internal Security Forces and Abaad on April 14, 2018; an activity was about a parade by an ISF cycling squad, the Harley Davidsons Ladies Club and Lebanon Bikers from Ain Mreiseh neighbourhood of Beirut through two awareness checkpoints at the National Museum and Chevrolet roundabout areas to finally reach the Memorial of the women victims of domestic violence in Baabda, presidential palace road. During their tour, the cyclists distributed leaflets among passers to familiarize the above memo. Towards the end of the activity, the head of the PR division at ISF, Colonel Joseph Musallam, said: &#x201C;When the ISF set its priorities for the protection of freedoms and human rights, it took into consideration the crimes committed against women,&#x201D; and stressed the need to rethink some of the outdated inherited customs that impede the realization of women&#x2019;s rights. Abaad director, Ghida Anani, for her part, pointed out that the memo is a sharp translation of ISF commitment to the file of domestic violence and violence against women and girls.</narrative>
