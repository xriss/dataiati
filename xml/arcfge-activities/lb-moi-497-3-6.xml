   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In the last years, policy briefs and studies conducted by the GBV sector highlighted the need to establish a specialized service for GBV survivors with MH challenges Were women and girls who are survivors from Gender Based Violence (including teen adolescent girls) and who have at the same time mental health challenges are not being currently able to access a specialized emergency safe sheltering program that is also well prepared to appropriately deal with persons having mental health challenges, especially if they are having some active mental symptoms. When these women and girls are accessing the regular GBV shelters, their situation might be aggravated if kept without appropriate mental health care. Hence the need to establish a facility specifically tailored for women and girls (teen adolescents) who have mental health challenges. In addition, there is no current national mental health standards for the establishment of such mental health facilities. Based on these analyses, ABAAD met with MoSA in order to coordinate the launching of such a service, to ensure its sustainability. In recent months, ABAAD and MOSA, and based on several meetings chose Jbeil as a hub for providing holistic services, from a Men Center to a shelter, and will be coordinating closely with MoSA&#x2019;s Social Development Centers (SDCs) in the area. Moreover, ABAAD intend to proceed with a model of Mental Health facility, featuring high quality standardized physical structural and operational methodologies and technics, which is first of its kind in Lebanon.</narrative>

     <narrative xml:lang="AR">Abaad has consulted with the NMHP/MOPH for the development of accreditation criteria/standards to establish this specialized service facility. These accreditation standards, will provide a framework and act as a reference for organizations willing to establish a mental health facility targeting women and girls with mental health challenges and who are GBV survivors. . In parallel, we initiated negotiations with MoSA in September to ensure their full engagement and buy-in throughout the activity. Moreover, The first draft of the accreditation standards for the residential mental health facility was developed based on literature review. This draft was further reviewed based on findings from field visits to 2 specialized emergency safe sheltering program of 2 different organizations, and the detailed review of the first draft between NMHP and Abaad technical persons. The accreditation standards hence developed is targeting persons with mental conditions (including women and adolescents) residing in a facility for mental health treatment. Women can be accompanied by children. The persons in the residential mental health facility are expected to actively participate in the development of their care and recovery plan that will include rehabilitation and social reintegration activities related to their mental condition, and appropriately tailored to their GBV survivor condition. The persons in the residential mental health facility are expected to actively participate in the development of their care and recovery plan that will include rehabilitation and social reintegration activities. Some persons will be transferred to other facilities after mental health stabilization. The average length of stay is expected to range from few weeks to several months. The proposed mental health standards contain Measures of Quality linked to one of the following seven elements of quality: Accessibility, Appropriateness, Continuity of care, Effectiveness, Efficiency, Safety, Continuous Improvement Of Performance. The Measures of Quality are also distributed among the following three levels: Basic: Addresses basic structures and processes linked to the foundational elements of safety and quality improvement in primary health care service delivery. Advanced: Builds on the foundational elements of quality and safety, emphasizes key elements of participant-centred care and consistency in the delivery of services through standardized processes. Excellence: Demonstrates a commitment to excellence and leading the primary health care field in terms of quality and safety. The land dedicated for the activity was purchased toward end of the contract&#x2026;Call to tender was initiated for design and built and accordingly construction process proceeded.</narrative>
