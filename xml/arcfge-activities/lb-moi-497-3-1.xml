   <narrative xml:lang="EN">ABAAD conducted two bilateral meetings with the Ministry of Telecommunications (MoT) to discuss possibilities of exemption of fees for this helpline. In order to maintain the national identity and scope of the hotline, ABAAD coordinated with MoSA between June and August 2017 to discuss possibilities to co-producing the service once the National GBV SOP is officially launched. ABAAD in parallel developed the database system, log system, documentation and necessary referral sheets, data analysis, and mapping of the referral systems for the different services, all in line with the National GBV SOP.

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Despite the tireless work of NGOs and local partners to provide services and assistance to women survivors and at-risk of SGBV, there still remains a gap in the accessibility to all women, despite their mobility, nationality, sexuality, age or socioeconomic background. For this reason, ABAAD introduced in this project a national, centralized helpline to provide access to and knowledge of existing services (many of which are provided by ABAAD). This helpline provides information to any woman who calls, as well as secure a more comprehensive referral pathway to women with limited mobility, all in line with the aforementioned National GBV SOP.</narrative>
