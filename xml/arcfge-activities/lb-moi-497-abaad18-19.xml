   </title>
   <description>
    <narrative xml:lang="EN">Activity 1 - ABAAD plans to centralize and produce systemic help-line services for women survivors of SGBV, through increasing the human capacity of help-line operators by recruiting four social workers, and produce relevant tools (data-base, log system, documentation and referral sheets, as well as analysis data production). Activity 2 - ABAAD plans to increase the service hub for men with abusive behaviors, through up-scaling/replicating the current Men Center Model that is run by ABAAD since late 2011. In this activity, ABAAD plans to collaborate with relevant centers such as Red Cross and Social Development Centers affiliated with the Ministry of Social Affairs, and equip them to provide engendered psycho-therapy sessions for men and male youth with abusive behaviors. This up scaling process will target three governorates in Lebanon besides Beirut, thus covering North Lebanon, South Lebanon and Bekaa area. To do so, ABAAD will sign MOUs with relevant referral entities such as ISF, general security offices, courts among other to institutionalize referrals for the Men Center. Moreover, an additional 6 psychotherapists will be recruited to cover the increase in demand and service provision; two will operate in the three additional areas, besides the current two psychotherapists at ABAAD Beirut Based Men Center. It is to be noted that bi-monthly meetings will be held among the 8 psychotherapists, and quarterly follow-up meetings will be also maintained for ensuring quality of mental health services provided. Activity 3 - ABAAD plans to hold 8 community-based training programmes with around 120 male youth and boys on active-non violent attitudes and behaviors. These training programmes will include the provision of the sessions, and accompany the youth groups to implement peer-to peer education/actions in their communities. Activity 4 - ABAAD plans to upscale the multi-sectoral services provided at the three Mid-Way transitional Houses with an additional component/services, socio-economic empowerment/livelihood that is. For this end, ABAAD plans to equip the current three MWH each with computer labs, and relevant space for language acquisition classes. These will mainly benefit women and girls survivors of GBV who are seeking shelters at ABAAD three Mid-way Houses. Moreover, ABAAD wants to ensure continuous training and capacity building for MWHs team and other GBV and Child Protection partners on issues related to how to deal with difficult scenarios within safe sheltering programs, such as mental health cases, suicidal attempts, cases of death in the family, trauma-affected women, etc... Hence, a total of 8 training sessions will be held throughout the project targeting social workers and frontlines. lastly, it is very important to maintain an emergency fund that would cover medical needs, medications, as well as forensic doctor fees namely for women survivors of sexual assault/rape or sexual violence from all nationalities. Activity 5 - ABAAD will continue to provide women survivors of SGBV with multi-sectoral services namely legal education sessions, psycho-therapy sessions, as well as CMR services. These services will be provided for women referred to the MWH or the 8 Model Centers for Holistic Care (run by ABAAD) or those who reached ABAAD through the help-line center over the course of two years. Activity 6 - As per ABAAD 5 year strategy related to the provision of women and girls survivors of GBV with GBV multi-sectoral services, ABAAD in this project would like to upscale/establish a new facility/space specifically tailored for women and girls (teen adolescents) who have mental health challenges. For this end, ABAAD will consult with many international and national institutions and ministries for the best modality to establish this specialized service facility (such as Hospital De La Croix, Ministry Of Public Health/National Mental Health program, John Hopkins University). Once established, this facility will be accredited, certified, equipped, furnished, and equipped with the needed human and material resources to serve women with mental health cases. It is expected that around 250 women and girls (who don&apos;t have access to any of the long-term shelters in Lebanon due to inclusion/exclusion criteria) will be accommodated and served at this new facility. Activity 7 - ABAAD plans to launch a nation-wide media campaign to promote GBV holistic services namely the central helpline, the Men Center up-scaled services, as well as those for women with mental health issues. For this end, ABAAD will engage with the right-holders and beneficiaries, and will produce baseline assessment, media tools, and IEC materials, and lead on a national social and street media campaign. It is expected that this campaign will reach out to more than 100,000 people, while it will specifically target women and girls survivors of GBV as well as men with abusive behaviors.</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">Activity 1 - ABAAD plans to hold 8 training workshops targeting 324 ISF members on issues related to the Clinical Management of Rape and proper referral pathways. ISF members were assigned by the national implementation mechanisms of the new law 293, to act as one of the frontline entity to respond to women survivors (including women survivors of sexual violence) protection needs, and ensure proper implementation of the law, through maintaining proper referral pathways. ABAAD has assessed an extensive need of the ISF Officers&#x2019; Training Institute to build their capacities on gendered applications of the new law 293. Hence, this activity will aim at equipping the ISF centers with CMR PEP kits (post-exposure procedures in the incidents of rape/sexual assaults and foster their role in the referral mechanisms. Furthermore, 4 training of trainers will be organized targeting midwives to widen the scope of trainers on CMR in Lebanon and strengthen midwives role in identifying and referring cases of SGBV in Lebanon. Activity 2 - ABAAD plans to produce an interactive toolkit on sexual education in Lebanon in Arabic, to ensure access to knowledge for male and female youth to sexual education and issues related to SRHR, child marriage, child sexual abuse, cyber safety commercial exploitation and intimate partner violence. For this end, a specialized interactive tool will be developed based on rapid KAP survey and then validated and produced with the participation of teen adolescent girls and boys (Lebanese and Syrian). This interactive tool will be introduced for endorsement and mainstream from the Ministry of Education, Ministry of Public Health, MOSA and the GBV sector for ultimate use and dissemination of the tool. Moreover, three induction/training workshops will be held targeting service providers in three governorates on the use of these tools and how to engage boys and girls on issues related to sexual education and SRHR. ABAAD plans to roll-out the produced tool on sexual education in Lebanon in Arabic, through organizing a total of 64 sessions over the course of the project in 2017 and 2018 targeting around 1280 young women and men in refugee and host communities. Activity 3 - ABAAD plans to launch a nation-wide media campaign to announce for ISF due-diligence and accountable role in addressing GBV issues and in responding to the GBV needs of women. Another campaign will be held during the 16 Days of Activism that comes each year between November 26 and December 10 to shed light on the combatting GBV efforts in Lebanon in partnership with relevant ministries and national organizations.</narrative>
