    <narrative xml:lang="EN">SSF and ABAAD joined their resources to provide to each shelter residents a tailored service based on their background, needs and expectations at professional level. Consequently, to contribute to the achievement of this activity, Safadi recruited an SGBV social worker to coordinate with ABAAD&#x2019;s Case Managers and started the process. This social worker conducted info sessions with the beneficiaries to inform them about the project and to recruit a group of trainees, she met the MWH case workers to discuss the beneficiaries&#x2019; potential, set action and exit plans with ABAAD case worker for each beneficiary, prepared pre-posttests with the trainers according to the type of training, and attended a training workshop to ensure efficiency and increase in knowledge of the beneficiaries. The coordination between Safadi and ABAAD ensures delivery of both: a comprehensive system and the tailoring of activities to women survivors of or at risk for SGBV. The two-fold nature of these activities ensures the best possible outcomes for the MWH beneficiaries. Safadi team has conducted a pilot activity for six women in the Bekaa MWH,: - Developing an orientation system linking women in the safe shelters to community resources and the labor market - Assessing training centers and NGOs offering vocational training in local communities - Conducting case studies of women and girls in MWH in coordination with ABAAD&#x2019;s team, and drafting a personal life-plan for these women while centering the economic integration process - Drafting accelerated vocational training curricula adapted to women&#x2019;s capacities and resources including personal development and managerial skills. - Providing sessions given by a certified trainer on the basics of beauty care for any women with an interest or already established cosmetic skills. The aim of this is to tailor the socioeconomic development activities to the needs and interests of women in the shelters, rather than provide generic trainings. - Linking women to other NGOs responding to the integration process - Ensuring joint follow-up between Safadi Foundation and ABAAD - Conducting placement and job training and providing certification and individual kits for certified women - Assessing the MWH&#x2019;s beneficiaries in the North and South MWH to check: number, profile, interests and skills in addition to the homogeneity of the groups regarding their age category and the period of residency. Based on the found results, it has been agreed to implement this activity with previous women beneficiaries of the MWH, and the activities took place at the nearest Women and girls safe space WGSS (Mount Lebanon: Choueifat, North: Quobbe) - Implementing two one-month Vocational Trainings for two groups of targeting 35 women participants and 1 Three months vocational training targeting 21 women participants from both refugee and host communities. By the end of this training, women participants gained marketing and managerial skills; - Linking women to other NGOs responding to the integration process and providing a placement program for trained and graduated women - Ensuring joint follow-up between Safadi Foundation and ABAAD - Closing ceremony and certification and individual kits distribution for graduated women coinciding with the IWD, in close coordination and support of respective municipalities.</narrative>

     <narrative xml:lang="EN">implement economic-empowerment project activity. PALWHO, a Palestinian organization targeting mainly Palestinian beneficiaries, conducted vocational training for 40 women over 80 sessions, including sewing, embroidery, cooking, and literacy, etc. ABAAD assessed the need to expand the trainings beyond the MWH to Palestinian camps, and decided to recruit PALWHO, given their extensive history in working on empowering Palestinian women in Lebanon. PALWHO&#x2019;s knowledge of the sociocultural context of Palestinian women in Lebanon aimed to provide specifically tailored activities for these women. The aim of this extension beyond the MWH was to reach underserved women in Palestinian camps, and to address the issue of socioeconomic empowerment and life skill building for women with limited mobility outside the camps.</narrative>
