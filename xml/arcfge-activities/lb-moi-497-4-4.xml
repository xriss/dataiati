   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Between October and December 2017, ABAAD launched a nation-wide media and advocacy campaign under the slogan &#x201C;Life_for_Life&#x201D; Campaign, with its primary goal of calling on decision-makers and legislators to amend Chapter Seven of the Penal Code to sentence incest rape perpetrators to life imprisonment. For this end, several bi-lateral meetings were held between October and November 2017, with official stakeholders to discuss ways of strengthening fair legislations with regards to protection of women form S-GBV. The campaign provided people with different key messages on several gender-related topics, and created a nation-wide awareness. This broad awareness propagated towards stakeholders, policy makers, and political leaders, with some of them endorsing different causes, which culminated in the Lebanese President speaking against gender based violence, and lighting the presidential palace orange, as a sign to &#x201C;Leave No One Behind&#x201D;. More specifically, the above-mentioned stakeholder meetings held with the ISF, Ministry of Women&#x2019;s Affairs, Ministry of Social Affairs, Lebanese President and the National Commission for Lebanese Women, aimed at discussing possible ways of issuing policies, statements, memos to ensure protection of women and girls from all forms of violence. As a result of these meetings four (4) main official statements were issued, from the Lebanese President Micheal Aoun, the UN Representative Philippe Lazarini, H.E Jean Ogasapian as well the head of the NCLW in Lebanon. These statements focused on condemning all forms of GBV and on the necessity of expedite national efforts and processes to adopt a NAP for UNSCR 1325. In his speech during the unveiling of the statues dedicated to women survivors, President Aoun described violence against women as a type of barbarism &#x2013; the result of an absence of human feeling towards another being. &quot;One of my goals as president is to eliminate the legal differences between men and women, although this is a small step towards eliminating gender-based violence&#x201D;. Lazarini reiterated the message of the Secretary&#x2013;General delivered on the occasion of the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women, that every woman and every girl has the right to a life free of violence. He assured that the United Nations is committed to addressing violence against women &amp; girls in all its forms. Nevertheless, on the occasion of the 16 Days of Activism against Gender-Based Violence 2018, ABAAD, in partnership with the Office of the Minister of State for Women Affairs and the National Commission for Lebanese Women, and with the financial support of the Dutch Embassy in Lebanon, the British Embassy in Lebanon and the Norwegian People Aid, and a number of partners and allies, has launched the &#x201C;#ShameOnWho?&#x201D; nationwide campaign</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="AR">&#x201C;Life_for_Life campaign aimed at raising women&#x2019;s awareness about the necessity to report sexual abuse, particularly due to the detrimental psychological damage that incest crimes leave on girls and women which might even lead to suicide. This campaign has contributed to achieving the set objectives of strengthening legislation and raising awareness to create an enabling environment. It is to be noted that this set objective falls under ABAAD&#x2019;s four-year strategy for 2017-2020; hence, assessing the extent of achieving this objective could not be limited to one off media campaign and its related events. the &#x201C;#ShameonWho?&#x201D; campaign calls for the prosecution of all rapists and promotes a public opinion that supports the victim instead of judging her. The aim of this campaign is to press for tougher sanctions and accelerate trials against rapists, in cases of sexual violence and rape in particular, and to change social perceptions that stigmatize and shame female rape victims, pushing them to cover up the crime. It also aims to create a supportive public opinion that condemns the act of rape as a crime punishable by a deterrent punishment.</narrative>
