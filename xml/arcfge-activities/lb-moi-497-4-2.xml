   <narrative xml:lang="EN">ABAAD sub-contracted MARSA as well-known local expert organizations on SRHR, to produce this interactive toolkit; In that vein, our partner adopted a participatory approach starting by conducted a KAP survey on SRHR in Lebanon. The objective of this ad hoc survey is the production of an interactive toolkit on sexual education and awareness for youth in Lebanon in the Arabic language. The contacts for the KAP survey were collected from more than 8 organizations working with boys and girls all across Lebanon (Akkar, Baalbek- Hermel, Beirut, Beqaa, Mount Lebanon, Nabatyeh, North, South), with a focus on marginalized communities, including camps and informal settlements and highlighted misconceptions of sexual health, especially in regards to starting-age of sexual activity, its potential risks, and the preventive methods that ought to be taken. Hence, the toolkit material was developed</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Lebanon is still considered a somewhat progressively conservative and religiously diverse society. Considering the sensitive nature of Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights (SRHR) in the region, there are very few accessible, thorough or holistic resources on the topic. SRHR is an imperative aspect of public health, psychological and personal health, and deeply impacts women and young girls, particularly those with less access to resources. This is two-fold. On one hand, lack of knowledge and access to SRHR exacerbates VAW and SGBV. Because there are very few resources about SRHR, women and young girls are more likely to be exposed to violence and sexual exploitation. On the other hand, lack of access to SRHR significantly increases health risks otherwise mitigated by knowledge and accessible services unwanted pregnancies, specifically HIV and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs).</narrative>

     <narrative xml:lang="AR">The contacts for the KAP survey were collected from more than 8 organizations working with boys and girls all across Lebanon (Akkar, Baalbek- Hermel, Beirut, Beqaa, Mount Lebanon, Nabatyeh, North, South), with a focus on marginalized communities, including camps and informal settlements and highlighted misconceptions of sexual health, especially in regards to starting-age of sexual activity, its potential risks, and the preventive methods that ought to be taken., The KAP survey was filled by youth participants between 18 and 24 of age in both Lebanese and non-Lebanese populations; The groups consisted of diverse participants of different sexes, (192 filled surveys in total, 93 Males, 97 Females, 2 Trans), and religious sects. Then, a Literature Review and evaluation of previous work was performed on resources that were available, and scientifically based published researches that were executed with main focus on the tool, and Meetings have been conducted with more than of 8 selected organizations and NGOs, where the framework of the survey, in particular, in regard to gaps, needs, and perceptions where discussed. The KAP Survey data analysis confirmed: - The theory that the youth is not aware of the measures they would have to take before having experiences which could lead to having psychologically, health-related and physically traumatic experiences. - A prominent indicator that awareness about STIs and the risks that unprotected and protected sex harbour is not fully understood or informed to the youth. Also, the majority have only focused on HIV disregarding the other infections: especially that these other infections are more viral and readily transmitted through non-penetrative sexual experiences that these youths are apparently unaware of. - Ignorance about body rights and SGBV. - Communications struggles considering sexual reproductive health and rights among families, different generations, religion, society, politics, and different convictions. - Misconception of consent, labelling, bullying, harassment, tolerance, acceptance, and difference between Gender, Sex, Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity, Sexual Behaviour, and Sexuality. - Becoming more aware and educated about contraception and sexual health will decrease the number of unsafe sex, unprotected experiences, and unplanned/unwanted pregnancies. - Almost all participants (97%) wanted to receive more information, the youth are eager to learn more in order to become more responsible to avoid contracting and transmitting infections. - The majority prefers to receive these information and trainings from NGOs, workshops, and organizations that hold the highest preference percentage (19%), followed by Universities (12%), and equal preference for Schools and Women/Men of Religion (8%). - Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights, Body Rights, , Sex and Gender Based Violence, Sexually Transmitted Infections, Mental Health, Marital Life, LGTBIQA rights and awareness, Child Marriage, Clinical Management of Rape, Religion and Sex, Women Rights, Sexual Health Centre&#x2019;s (decreasing order) were all proposed by the participants, and it strengthens our hypothesis that there&apos;s lack of knowledge concerning these topics. Hence, the toolkit material was developed , yet not limited to the above listed results of the mentioned KAP survey, and includes 10 Learning Objectives in Arabic titled as: - Ethics, Rights and Obligations - Toolkit Learning Model - Youth Development and Body rights - Sexuality - Communication - Sexually Transmitted Infections - Harassment - SRHR - CMR In addition to the development of a booklet on how to utilize the Arabic produced tool and how to plan and train on the 10 Learning Objectives all in Arabic. The toolkit Validating did occur with pedagogy experts between May and Jul 2018 and was conducted and approved by the consultant of the tool validation.</narrative>
