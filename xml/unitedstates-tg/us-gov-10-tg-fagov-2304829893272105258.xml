    <narrative xml:lang="EN">In 2005, after 15 years of economic stagnation and political instability, Togo started along a gradual path to democratic reform. Since then, Togo has held several elections deemed free and fair by international observers, including a presidential election in April 2015. Togo has also sought to liberalize business regulations, trade policies, and worked to re-engage with the international community. The United States, along with the rest of the international community, aims to encourage the Government of Togo (GOT) to further political and economic reforms. FY 2017 assistance seeks to develop a professionalized military that respects civilian leadership and democratic institutions.</narrative>
