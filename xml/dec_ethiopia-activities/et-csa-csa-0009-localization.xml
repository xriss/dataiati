   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Development Expertise Center (DEC) in collaboration with the Ethiopian Civil Society Organization&#x2019;s Council (ECSOC) organized dialogue forums on the localization of aid in Ethiopia. Local NGOs inadvertently contributors to the repression of freedom of speech in the community, it is planned to influence ING, donors and government to shift the power. Therefore, the forum intended to influence in-country development actors (government, international NGOs and individual donors) to support community philanthropy and localization of aid. The rationale behind this call was to support community philanthropy and to share awareness of the concept of localization of aid in Ethiopia which pave the way to materialize the localization of aid. The forum and the established platform were encouraging to put into practice localization of aid in Ethiopia which DEC and consortium members established good relationships with ECSOC, CSOs and the Authority of Civil Society Organization (ACSO).</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The rationale behind the forum was to support community philanthropy, to share experiences and raise awareness on the concept of localization of aid in Ethiopia to Civil Society Actors&#x2019; (CSAs) which pave the way to materialize localization of aid. The dependency of local NGOs on foreign funding leads to a loss of local legitimacy. Civil Society Actors (CSAs) tend to become closer to donors than the local communities which they were established to represent and serve. This upward accountability to donors hampers fulfillment of local communities&#x2019; priority needs which inadvertently contributes to infringing civic rights and erodes local communities&#x2019; freedom of speech in &#x201C;Community/Society&#x201D; civicus as passive recipients of aid.
Therefore, considering the prevailing challenges, localization of aid strategy dialogue forum organized by both parties to materialize the agenda in the country by inviting Government co signatories(GOs), Local Non-Governmental Organizations (LNGOs), International Non-governmental Organizations (INGOs) and Community of Practices (CoP) in reshaping the current funding strategies and restore freedom of speech, particularly on who defines priorities for local action which has asymmetric power relationship among community, local actors and donor including magnitude of funding goes to community development.</narrative>
