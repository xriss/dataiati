   <narrative xml:lang="EN">IFC anticipates that the project, supported by IFCs advisory services engagement with Davivienda, will improve access to finance for: (i) social low income households that are beneficiaries of the governments social housing program; (ii) WSMEs, where the financing gap in Colombia is significant; and (iii) green assets, primarily green buildings.  Beyond the Project-level impact, IFC anticipates that the Project will promote inclusiveness as it will trigger market-wide impact on financial inclusion of women. Additionally, the Project will promote an increase in climate financing available in the Colombian financial sector, which in turn will contribute to improved environmental sustainability (e.g., water savings, energy savings, and GHG emission reduction).</narrative>
