   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Cartones America is planning to reduce their use of energy at their plant in Cali, Colombia. The energy efficiency improvement project planned by Cartones consist several sub-projects which will help it to reduce its energy consumption and thus reduce the operating cost for energy by almost 17% annually. This project is an overall energy systems improvement which will consist of improving the electrical system, such as lowering the voltage setting on the transformers, improving the transmission efficiency of motor by using poly V-belts instead of ordinary V-belts, increase the efficiency of the electric motor by replacing large standard efficiency motors with high efficiency motors and also down sizing motors so that they operate at optimal loading, the plant will also install variable speed drives on some application so that the supplied power to the machines matches the demand and also improve its lighting and refrigeration systems. On the thermal side the plant will be improving the efficiency of its boilers by installing automatic air-fuel regulators, improving its insulation on its steam pipes, valves and flanges and most importantly it will be improving the steam/ condensate management system at its Paper machine 3 so that its specific steam consumption will be reduced. Together, these Cleaner Production investment for energy efficiency qualify for funding via IFCs Board approved Cleaner Production Lending Pilot, a $20 million Facility via which IFC can provide Cleaner Production sub-loans to its existing portfolio clients.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Cartones Americas Cleaner Production Investment are expected to result in:  - Improved Energy Efficiency and Reduced Costs: By implementing this project, the plant will improve its overall electrical and thermal energy consumption. Key energy saving areas are in the motors and pumping (electrical), and steam use (thermal). The CP Project is expected to improve energy efficiency of CAMEs Cali plant by 16.5%, translating into an estimated 11% in annual energy cost savings.  - Reduced Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Emissions: Implementation of the CP Project is expected to reduce GHG emissions from the Cali plant site by approximately 4300 tons of CO2 equivalent per annum which is about 11% of the total existing GHG emissions of this site.</narrative>
