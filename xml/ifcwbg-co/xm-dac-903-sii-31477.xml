   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Haime family (via its Foundation) will build a 410 bed high quality hospital in Cartagena, in association with Fundacion Santa Fe de Bogota. This hospital will be built in three phases; for the first phase there will be 151 beds. The design of the hospital will be at the level of the best hospitals in Latin America, and will have the latest technology in medical equipment.    The project caters to the population of Cartagena and the Atlantic coast of Colombia, where hospital infrastructure is insufficient, especially for high complexity services. In general terms of medical service (low and high complexity), the Atlantic Coast region has 8.5 beds per 10,000 inhabitants, below Colombian average of 10 beds per 10,000 inhabitants and significantly below the levels of Argentina and Brazil (40 and 24 beds per 10,000 inhabitants respectively).  The project fits with IFCs strategy to support health care in the region by increasing access to high-quality health care, improving standards of quality and efficiency, facilitating the exchange of best practices, and creating jobs for skilled professionals. Aside from fulfilling these requirements, this project also fits with the Government of Colombias (GoC) priority to increase the provision of health services.</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project is located within a green area protected by natural barriers that ensure the environmental quality of the project. Thanks to its privileged location, the project will provide excellent conditions for the patients, as well as an optimal working environment for the medical group and its partners. The Hospital will be built in Cartagena, located 12 miles from the center of the city.   Key environmental factors in the project will be the conservation and improvement of water sources, respecting and applying local and international legislation. The low population density of the area helps to maintain natural green areas, as well as those areas to be created by the project. Impact on existing ecosystems will be minimal, through the implementation of a regulator plan during construction.</narrative>
