   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The development impact of the project is expected to be high as IFC&apos;s investment will enable greater cross-border financial integration in LAC, as it will continue to support Itau-CBC to consolidate in the Colombian market by supporting its SMEs and climate-smart loan portfolio growth. Furthermore, the proposed transaction will support the creation of a financial services platform with deep roots in Latin America. This is expected to diminish the volatility derived from large international investors entering and exiting developing markets. 

Supporting the Itau Group in a highly-concentrated market as the Colombian banking sector is key to secure competition amongst banks, which in turn can translate into more affordable terms for the public, specially SMEs and climate-smart projects. One of Itau-CBC&apos;s strategic objectives is to continue focusing on the SMEs business, as more than 62% of SMEs in the country report lack of available financing as a material constraint for growth.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project consists in a proposed syndicated subordinated loan to Itau Corpbanca Colombia (Itau-CBC or the Bank) to support the Bank consolidation in the Country, support the growth of its SME and climate-smart loan portfolio and strengthen its capital requirements (the Project). By providing the most needed form of long-term financing for the Bank at this time, the Project will enable IFC to continue supporting a key partner in Colombia and Latin America with an interest in increasing its footprint in the SME and climate-smart segments.</narrative>
