   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The American flyfishing company, Sweetwater Travel and its Mongolian parner, Hovsgol Travel, have been operating a successful flyfishing ecotourism business on the Eg and Uur rivers since 1995.  The two companies established an NGO, the Taimen Conservation Fund (TCF), to assist the local communities manage the EUWA natural resources.    The project aims to establish a partnership between the local communities, government institutions and bodies, and tourist companies to collaboratively and proactively establish a natural resource management regime for the Eg-Uur Watershed Area (EUWA) in the north-western region of Mongolia.  The underlying rationale of the project is to treat wildlife as a locally managed concessionable natural resource, rather than a simple public good, thereby enabling the local communities to maximize the economic returns from its use.  The financial sustainability and biodiversity conservation vehicle for the project is high-end, low impact catch and release flyfishing ecotourism.      The project promotes poverty reduction by supporting community based initiatives in sustainable land and resource use.  The GEF intervention provides the conditions to initiate a natural resource user fee system, which will tap into these returns to fund biodiversity conservation and community development  on a financially sustainable basis.</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Eg-Uur watershed area (EUWA) is located in a remote region of Norther Mongolia where the Eg and Uur rivers meet.  The high priority biodiversity conservation zone that is the focus of this project consists of approximately 15,000 Ha within the EUWA.  The Eg river is 474 km in length with 40,454 km2 of catchment area, originates from Lake Hovsgol and flows south where it meets with the Uur river.  The Uur river is 331 km in length with 12,300 km2 of catchment area, originates from the Kheven-Saluu mountains in NE Hovsgol Province and flows south until it meets the Eg river.  The combined Eg-Uur, recognized from this point on as the Eg river, flows for another 200 km until it reaches the Selenge river.  The triangular shape watershed area, consisting of the Eg and Uur rivers until the point of confluence with the Selenge river is recognized as the Eg-Uur Watershead Area, a total area of aproximately3.48 million Ha.</narrative>
