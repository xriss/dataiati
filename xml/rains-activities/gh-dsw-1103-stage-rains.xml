   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Strategic Approaches to Girls&#x2019; Education (STAGE) is implemented in nine regions of Ghana between 2018 and 2023. It combines two mutually supportive tracks for highly marginalized girls - formal and non formal education tracks - bringing a holistic approach to the education of girls and lowering the barriers that they face at the individual, community, school, and system levels. STAGE works in areas of Ghana where high levels of extreme poverty in combination with deep-seated traditional and social norms exist resulting in negative impacts on women and girls. STAGE targets girls who are highly vulnerable and systematically marginalized due to factors such as early marriage, teenage pregnancies, disabilities, and others. Under the STAGE project, RAINS works in the Nanumba South and Kpandai Districts in partnership with World Education, Inc. (WEI) to improve learning outcomes in numeracy, literacy, and life skills, and to establish relevant and appropriate partnerships, educational and vocational pathways for the successful transition of girl beneficiaries between 10 and 19 years old to formal education, a vocational learning opportunity, or some form of employment.</narrative>
