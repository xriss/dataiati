   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Emergency food security rehabilitation to disadvantaged IDPs, and most vulnerable host community households in two payams namely; Mundri payam and Bangolo payam of Mundri West County</narrative>

  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project will be implemented in two payams namely Mundri payam and Bangolo payam of Mundri West County. This project is aimed at providing immediate access to food by supporting the livelihoods of &#x2018;food and nutrition insecure households of the most disadvantaged and vulnerable IDPs and host communities&#x201D; in Mundri West county of Western Equatoria State. The project directly targets 800 vulnerable households of primarily IDPs (40%) and host community (60%) by providing vegetable and crop seeds which will improve food production and contribute to better nutrition and improvement in household income and also better their livelihoods. The beneficiaries will be targeted basing on context and selection criteria developed with the community in the target County of Mundri West. Special focus will be given to people with disability to make sure they are not left out&#x37E; the modality to be used will be one kit per HH. Capacity building training will be conducted for 3 days on improved vegetable production and good farming practices to selected beneficiaries of vegetable seeds at the Payam level. Each of the 2 target Payams will have all beneficiaries benefiting from the training. The overall project objective is Improved food Security and Livelihoods at the house hold level to mitigate potential shocks such as conflicts, drought, flood and diseases by July 2017 targeting 4800 food insecure IDPS and Vulnerable host Community individuals.  MAcDA has conducted the necessary assessments, also involving other agencies). We also worked closely with local leaders, IDPs and host community representatives in mapping the emergency needs. This is corroborated by reports from our field coordinators and staff. The needs were captured through various tools (questionnaires, case studies) and methodologies including interrogative observation, interviews and discussion meetings with key community leaders and local actors, focus group discussions with IDPs and host community members. A post distribution monitoring will be conducted to obtain feedback from the beneficiaries for example regarding, timeline, quality and quantity of the kits provided. This also helps MAcDA and its partners to learn and also improve future programming. The outcome of the PDM will reflect in the interim and final report.
A number of factors are known to predispose these deteriorating conditions including a) chronic erosion of ability to access enough and quality food, worsened by economic crises currently compounded by spiral price increases and poor production in 2016, continued population displacements resulting from renewed localized conflicts. This created a knock-on effect of multiple shocks from 2016 i.e. early season dry spells, high food prices, lack of alternative incomes, human and livestock diseases. Target communities have employed strategies, including eating less preferred foods, limiting meal size, food gathering to cope with continuing deterioration of food insecurity. For the above reasons, target communities have prioritized the need for provision of inputs for food production (crop and vegetable seeds) and training in basic agronomics.</narrative>
