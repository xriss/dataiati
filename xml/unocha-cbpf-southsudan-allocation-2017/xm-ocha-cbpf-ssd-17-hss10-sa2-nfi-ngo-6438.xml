   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project will respond to specific needs of the most vulnerable 2,600 households among the conflict-affected IDP population of CES -Lainya and Terekeka counties- and EES -Magwi county. In Greater Equatoria majority of the population is facing Crisis (IPC Phase 3) and Emergency (IPC Phase 4) levels of food insecurity. Between January and May Central Equatorians in IPC Phase 4 increased from 30,000 to 130,000, the number of Eastern Equatorians in IPC Phase 4 remained high, from 110,000 in January to 115,000 in June, while those in IPC Phase 3 increased from 345,000 to 430,000 (IPC Communication Summary, June 2017). In both States most counties have been affected both by conflict and food crisis, major causes of displacement. Humanitarian access was hindered for most of 2016-17, and majority of the population has been caught up in circular displacement (IDMC, 2017), losing all its properties. Humanitarian assistance has been problematic especially in CES, due to lack of static partners on the ground and difficulties in accessing deep field locations. In Central Equatoria, some international humanitarian partners have been able to reach centers such as Lainya and Kajo-keji with distributions, however no humanitarian assistance has been provided to the displaced population in the surrounding areas.
LCED will integrate the static response on the ground through mobile response, and will collaborate with other mobile partners to develop efficient interventions and avoid duplication of services. LCED will strengthen its mobile capacity by hiring a trained Programme Associate with a strong background in reporting, CBI and ES/NFI distribution, and one new NFI Assistant as part of the Emergency Response Team (ERT). The LCED ERT will conduct needs assessment/verification, registration and distribution of Non-Food Items (NFI) and Emergency Shelters (ES), particularly focusing on gender and age-related needs. Assessment/verification will allow the ERT to identify appropriate ES/NFI solutions for the most vulnerable households. The LCED management will be involved in initial assessments and the monitoring and evaluation exercises, in order to guarantee transparency and accountability and ensure that the project objectives are followed through. LCED will continue to closely collaborate with the S/NFI Cluster in order to guarantee the provision of ES/NFI to the affected population in a timely and efficient manner, and provide monthly update on the implementation progress. 
LCED will target 2,030 households for distribution of NFI, prioritizing the most vulnerable households, including those whose members are pregnant and lactating mothers, children under 5, elderly and disabled persons. 20% of the total beneficiaries (520 HH) will be targeted for distribution of emergency shelter material, targeting population in dire need and not on the move. Assessments/verifications will determine the areas where such intervention will be sustainable, and the communities most in need, particularly where movement of the population is precluded -hence people cannot collect shelter material by themselves- but humanitarian access is granted. Finally, LCED will implement a cash voucher pilot project for 50 households in Lainya county, CES, where humanitarian assistance has been difficult in the past year, while the population have some freedom of movement. The project will include a market assessment, and will target only populations which are not likely to move in the following 3 months and have access to the market.
LCED has been implementing similar projects in the past. In 2014 LCED became part of the S/NFI cluster and has been conducting distribution of ES/NFI, including shelter reinforcement kits in the Juba PoC (UN House), and in Greater Mundri counties.  In 2017, it implemented a cash voucher pilot project in Mundri West county, targeting 80 most vulnerable households with access to the market. More information is given under the justification.</narrative>
