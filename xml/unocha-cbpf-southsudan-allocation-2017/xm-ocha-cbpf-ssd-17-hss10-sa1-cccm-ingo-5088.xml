   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Support information-based decision-making by affected populations and humanitarian responders in the UN PoCs through Communications with Communities: Support for Boda Boda Talk Talk project in the UN House PoC.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project seeks to support the CCCM cluster by addressing communities&#x2019; need for better access to information, and to have a stronger voice and better accountability in the humanitarian response. It does this through supporting humanitarian agencies across all clusters and sectors to build stronger Communications With Communities (CC-CWC) and Accountability Strategies. The project is built on Internews&#x2019; best practice and lessons learnt from last three years&#x2019; humanitarian response in South Sudan, supporting the Camp Coordination and Camp Management Cluster (CCCM).
The project aims to ensure the most vulnerable communities (particularly women, children, elderly and socially excluded) affected by the conflict, have better access to reliable, accurate, timely and effective information so that they can: make informed decisions about their own lives have a stronger voice to demand accountability to services delivered by humanitarian actors (through multiple channels of communication to deliver feedback) and are more engaged in the humanitarian response and service delivery as partners and decision makers with humanitarian actors. 
The primary purpose of this project will be to support the ongoing Boda Boda Talk Talk (BBTT) service in UN House POC. In May 2014 Internews launched BBTT in the UN House Protection of Civilian (PoC) sites in Juba (PoC 1 and PoC 2), to provide people affected by the conflict with lifesaving and life enhancing information. The project was rolled out following the success of the first BBTT project in Tong Ping, which was launched earlier in the year in February 2014. Internews used its many years of experience and expertise in responding to the information needs of people affected by crisis to study and document the good practices and lessons learnt. The project will therefore draw from the learning and experience from the existing Humanitarian Information Services projects in the PoCs (Juba, Bor, Bentiu and Malakal) and will continue to support the ongoing project in the UN House PoC by developing practical/durable tools and solutions to improve the disaster preparedness mechanism and resilience frameworks. 
The UN House PoC has a total of approximately 38,942 population and this project aims to reach at least 60% (23, 365 people) of the total population. The PoCs are generally characterized by lack of adequate information about services and the humanitarian response mechanisms. Hence, despite the various coordination efforts by humanitarian organizations, misinformation and rumors have often delayed the response and little or no attention has been given to community feedback. BBTT, a Humanitarian Information Service (HIS) intervention, provides critical information that can inform, protect and empower affected communities and also facilitates a two-way communication between affected communities and humanitarian organizations.
BBTT is an audio production program, with well-trained community correspondents and information officers who produce audio programs and gather feedback from the communities and humanitarian organizations. The audio programs are broadcast at listening stops and through listening groups where the local population has the opportunity to discuss and provide feedback. The BBTT project in UN House is a 30 minutes program produced 3 times a week and distributed using standing speakers and rotating listening stops in PoC 1 and PoC 3. The team also manages around 100 listening groups in the POC, which are consulted on a weekly basis to provide feedback and comments about important issues affecting the community. With a current team of 12 community correspondents, mobile feedback officers and communication with communities&#x2019; officers, it has continued to broadcast essential lifesaving information to the PoC community. Its programing has been an essential and integral part of the humanitarian response system for the past three years.</narrative>
