   <narrative xml:lang="EN">By October 2017,5,350 children (2350 boys and 3000 girls), 650 women and 200 men  who are in urgent need of protection services including family tracing and reunification services, GBV response services and documentation and referral of children experiencing grave violations to essential child protection services,  will benefit directly from this emergency project in priority locations in Southern Unity,  and Eastern Equatoria States.

Through RRM missions, the following services will be provided directly by UNICEF CP staff: 
1. Identification, registration and family tracing and reunification (FTR) services and temporary care placements for separated, unaccompanied and missing girls and boys
2. Community psychosocial support (PSS), and referrals when needed for women and children including survivors of GBV 
3. Provide thorough awareness Prevention messages to the affected population including children
4. Monitoring and reporting of the general child protection situation and specific Monitoring and Reporting Mechanism (MRM) participation, where appropriate
5. Conduct rapid assessments to better understand the needs of women and children along with mapping of the available services on the ground &#x2013; these assessments will not only assist in identifying vulnerabilities and risks but also support mainstreaming of GBV and Child Protection across other sectors
6. Coordination with other relevant partners to inform broader service delivery, including through regular engagement with cluster mechanisms and the Child Protection Information Management System (CPIMS). 

UNICEF will also transport and pre-position emergency child protection supplies and will deploy Child Protection staff in the famine locations during RRM missions in IPC 4 and 5 areas and where famine has been announced and protection concerns are high. It is important for UNICEF to approach through RRM as that is best quickest way to reach out to very vulnerable groups. During UNICEF RRM missions response package includes providing life saving relief supplies to children and families including nutrition, health, NFIs and materials for registration of separated children and organizing psychosocial interventions with children and caregivers. These supplies provide immediate relief and support to malnourished children, separated and unaccompanied children and other vulnerable groups of children and families who need assistance.
UNICEF will continue to oversee and arrange air transport for reunifications and, throughout the project, will support children and their families to link with other services and sectors, drawing on both UNICEF&#x2019;s other programme sections and its broader network of partners through the various clusters. In addition to the direct implementation through this programme, UNICEF will continue to provide information and technical support to other partners and the broader Protection Cluster to ensure continuity of service delivery and promote the sharing of good practices and lessons learned. UNICEF aims to build community capacity around identification of vulnerable children and women, psychosocial support and monitoring and referral to services. Prevention messages linked to separation, GBV, recruitment and mines will be an integral part of information provided to children and the community at large</narrative>
