   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Management of Acute Malnutrition in Emergency in Ayod County of former Jonglei State</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">RMF is the only nutrition partner implementing integrated nutrition programs in Ayod County in partnership with UNICEF and WFP. The humanitarian situation in Ayod is deteriorating due to ongoing insurgency in the northern part of Jonglei. The fighting between Juba government and SPLA IO reached Ayod in February 2017 and active combat continued till the end of March causing massive displacement and RMF nutrition centres in Katdalok in Kuach-deng, Mogok in Mogok Payam and Yian in Pajiek Payam were all vandalized and nutrition supplies including compound items looted. RMF then suspended its OTP/TSFP in Katdalok and Yian and OTP/TSFP/SC in Mogok while continued to response to the malnutrition crisis in its remaining active sites- 3 OTPs, 3 TSFPs and 1 SC which are registration high number of beneficiaries and exerting pressure on the limited number of capacitated nutrition team and nutrition supplies. Part of Kuach-deng is now under the Juba government and has no civilian population, some people have started returning to Mogok amp others moved toward Wai where World Vision ceased operation in May 2017.

A recent FSNMS round 18 puts the GAM rate for Ayod to 17.7% which is critical and above threshold level of 15% and also the most recent FewsNet report shows Ayod is IPC level 4, emergency.  This project is designed to enable RMF scale up its response in Ayod through re-establishing an OTP/TSFP amp a SC in Mogok, an OTP/TSFP in Wai and strengthening the existing nutrition centers in Gorwai, Jiech and Pagil to reach more beneficiaries and prevent under malnutrition for the most vulnerable at risks. This funding will not only strengthen the OTP, TSFP and SC activities but will also strengthen Community Outreach activities and mobile services.  Through the ongoing PCA with UNICEF and FLA with WFP, RMF will continue to get nutrition supplies from UNICEF and WFP for the scale plan.

RMF will work closely with WASH, health and FSL partners to ensure synergies and combat the the life threatening malnutrition crisis in Ayod County.  The collaboration with county health department and health partner will ensure that necessary services are provided on HIV/AIDS and STIs for community at risk and RMF will integrate information on HIV and STIs transmission and prevention in their routine health education conducted at the facility and the community levels to create awareness on HIV transmission and prevention.

RMF will continue to implement its waste management policy ensuring routine segregation of medical and regular wastes and deposing is done appropriately. Will actively involve the community and discourages the community from deforestation instead encouraging planting of trees, use of cow dung as source of animal manures during crop planting to increase soil fertility and improves soil structure and productivity and promotes the planting of leguminous plants e.g beans, groundnuts and cowpeas as they increase soil nutrients.

RMF will continue with its approach of focusing on a person as a whole by providing medical/physical/emotional/economic amp social support, accountability amp feedback mechanism to ensure complains from the affected population registered and addressed promptly/appropriately. Always encourages the participation of the affected population in management and implementation of the project, all our team on the ground are South Sudanese nationals and some are recruited from the affected populations. RMF team meets and discusses with the Payam administration, local areal leaders/chiefs regularly about the progress, challenges, lessons learnt amp way forward. RMF approach ensures transparency in our work, and is shared with the affected population.

This proposal is designed in a such that all acute malnourished children (boys/girls) under 5 (SAM amp MAM) amp Pregnant and Lactating Women to benefit from the project without discrimination. Generally the whole community in the catchment area will be benefi</narrative>
