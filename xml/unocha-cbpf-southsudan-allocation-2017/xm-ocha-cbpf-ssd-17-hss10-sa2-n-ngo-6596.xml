   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Provision of life saving nutrition Nutrition services to Gemaiza IDPs and Terereka host communities in Terekeka, Central Equatoria.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In May 2017 there was outbreak of fighting between the Mundari and Dinka Bor tribes of Mangalla North Payam and Gemeiza Payam of Terekeka state, resulting into displacement of 20,325 individuals into the 8 islands of Gemeiza on river Nile in Terekeka county.  It was reported that significant life was lost on both sides during the clash, looting and destruction took place, which has force thousands to flee on the islands for safety and protection and hence, livelihood activities of normal situation totally disrupted increasing the vulnerability risk among the affected population currently living on the islands as mentioned above.   During the inter-agency assessment in May, it was observed that the affected population has serious food security problem as most of their reserve was looted in the course of fighting and as result it was reported that three people died of starvation. The IDPs survived through one meals per day or in 24hrs and other coping mechanisms includes eating wild leaves, some sale of assets to get food. There is limited access to market in Muni, Terekeka and Kuda more than five hours across in western ban. In as much as the nutritional status of the children according to MUAC screening was found to be stable ( as reported- ), it&#x2019;s quite evident that the situation will deteriorate and worsen if no immediate intervention is not instituted considering  SAM of 2.9% ( based on MUAC) and MAM of 7.9% ( based on MUAC) was serious.   The common morbidity occurring in these locations among children under five are, ARI, Skin, Eye and Diarrheal disease and however no mortality was recorded, no cholera outbreak reported as well. Most of the under-five have been vaccinated for routine and the recent measles campaign. The WASH at the IDPS side  is  very, very bad ( as reported by the assessment team)  , there is need for more clean water source since some of the water points  get dirty during the rain seasons.  This can be potentially dangerous especially water borne diseases and cholera outbreak leading serious acute malnutrition among the young children.

AFOD already has on-going nutrition, community health and education programs funded by UNICEF, WFP and HPF2 in Terekeka county. The current Nutrition program only addresses needs of the host population and did not factor in the influx of IDPs during the planning phase.

AFOD is therefore planning to address the nutritional needs of the vulnerable groups &#x2013;the children below 5yrs and PLW. AFOD will work closely with other partners already on the ground e.g. ADRA, Terekeka County Health department (CHD) and partners from the education, protection and GBV cluster during implementation of the Nutrition intervention among IDPs. This planned response will therefore be easily integrated into the health/Nutrition/education interventions which AFOD already has in Terekeka county. As part of the planned response, AFOD will improve access to Nutrition services among IDPs in Gemeiza payam by carrying out weekly outreaches to the IDPs camps and the surrounding host communities  to provide nutrition screening, treatment and nutritional education. The nutrition outreaches will be integrated with health components like immunization, growth monitoring and malaria screening/treatment.</narrative>
