   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Education in Emergencies Support Project targeting Most Vulnerable Children (Girls and Boys), Men and Women in Yirol East and Yirol West Counties, former Lakes State</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Internally displaced children and youth including women and men have particularity been vulnerable to likelihood of water borne disease outbreaks like Cholera particularly among children who are at high risk due to poor sanitation and hygiene facilities in the already overcrowded IDPs camps. This is in addition to protection risks including attempted recruitment by armed groups (boys) sexual exploitation, abuse (girls) and physical violence girls, boys, young women and men. Despite 81% of schools having received support from external actors in 2016, unprecedented levels of food insecurity, malnutrition and the current cholera outbreak are projected to significantly affect learning and school retention more so among conflict affected counties such as Yirol West and Yirol East (IPC Alert June 2017 South Sudan Situation Reports on Cholera-110).

Children under 19 years, majority of whom are school going children constitute nearly 50% of the total cholera cases and majority using untreated water sources, lack of household chlorination of drinking water.
Proposed activities targeting 8,000 children (girls and boys) and 1000 adults (men and women) herein will promote and enable school enrollment and retention of these children and youth in addition to recovering from distress, and additionally intensify WASH actions and cholera preparedness messaging to safeguard them against water borne and hygiene related diseases in addition to putting in place measures for Cholera awareness, addressing GBV and protection concerns. 
Keeping in line with the strategy, all schools targeted for emergency WASH/Cholera interventions  will already be supported by other donors for teachers&#x2019; incentives, textbooks, teaching and learning supplies and teacher trainings. This is in addition to scale up of PCO&#x2019;s current UNICEF funding in Lakes State, among other donors (negotiations ongoing) to scale up education activities in the proposed counties.

This will be an emergency component aimed at scaling up and formation of synergies to have a multi-sectoral approach in addition to collaboration with other partners implementing Health, Nutrition, WASH and Food Security and Livelihoods programs. Children&#x2019;s vulnerability will also be reduced through the provision of live-saving messages on child protection, hygiene, health, nutrition and GBV.

PCO is operational in Lakes State through Current UNICEF funding with experienced technical teams and relevant office space in Rumbek, logistics and strong grass root networks that can be easily deployed, including staff redeployment to proposed areas for scale up interventions. The project will also ensure gender balance, accountability to affected populations, protection, environmental conservation and youth engagements at all stages of implementation.</narrative>
