   <narrative xml:lang="EN">SCI is seeking to deliver a six months emergency health project in three IPC4, IPC3, and hot spot counties namely Nyirol, and Kapoeta North. The overall objective of this project is to reduce morbidity and mortality from Malaria, Diarrhea/chorea as well as acute malnutrition among children under five years of age, and strengthen the CHD&#x2019;s capacity to prevent, detect and respond to outbreaks of epidemic prone diseases. 

The project&#x2019;s thematic sector focus will be health, and it will be effective August 01, 2017 to January 31, 2018. A total of 220,797 beneficiaries will be addressed directly with lifesaving as well as health, sanitation and hygiene promotion activities. Public health emergency interventions focusing on screening, treatment and referral of children with life threatening health conditions mainly diarrhea, malaria, pneumonia and acute malnutrition, as well as strengthen the surveillance and response to diseases outbreaks. Specifically, SCI will provide and preposition drugs and medical supplies for an anticipated disease outbreaks of acute watery diarrhea (AWD)/cholera, and Malaria provide transportation/vehicle support to CHDs during the response of outbreaks of diseases whenever needed strengthen disease surveillance through community volunteers, promote health, sanitation, hygiene and MIYCN (maternal infant and young child nutrition) targeting children under five years of age, and pregnant and lactating women (PLW). 

This project will be implemented in counties currently supported by SCI, and thus the proposed activities will complement existing health, nutrition and cholera re
This project will be implemented in counties currently supported by SCI, and thus the proposed activities will complement existing health, nutrition and cholera response activities, as well as the mobile emergency responses provided by SCI&#x2019;s emergency health unit in Kapoeta North. The IPC released in June 2017 categorized these three counties as IPC phase 3 and 4 with very critical food insecurity situation. The IPC state that a dramatic deterioration in the proportion of population having sufficient access to food, with Jonglei in May 2017 continuing to record the lowest level of access to food since April 2016. 

SCI has experiences of supporting community based management of diarrhea and malaria, and this has contributed for improvement of health in Akobo, Nyirol and Kapoeta North. Community based management of diarrhea and malaria is an ideal lifesaving approach in emergency contexts as it can help to increase access to those areas and community groups not reached through the ordinary health system, as well as promote key preventive health messages. A total of 432 (232 in Nyirol and 200 in Kapoeta North) community based distributers (CBDs), and 22 CBD supervisors (12 in Nyirol and 10 in Kapoeta North) will be trained to screen and treat cases of malaria, diarrhea, and pneumonia, screen for malnutrition, as well as disseminate health messages on epidemic prone disease, sanitation and hygiene as well as MIYCN, 80 healthcare providers will be trained on Integrated Diseases Surveillance and Response (IDSR), 12 ORP (oral rehydration points) will be established to provide treatment on acute watery diarrhea/cholera, and long lasting insecticide treated bed nets will be distributed through the CHDs.

This project will have three objectives. Objective 1 will focus on providing emergency lifesaving intervention focusing on cholera/diarrhea, malaria, and pneumonia among children under five years of age objective 2 will focus on intensifying surveillance and integrating capacity building for the CHD to prevent, detect and respond to outbreak of epidemic prone diseases focusing on cholera/malaria /measles and other diseases and objective 3 will focus on promoting health, sanitation and hygiene and MIYCN messages through community volunteers, as well as strengthening quality and accountability to affected pop</narrative>
