   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project will aim at increasing timely and equitable access to safe water supply and hygiene services to (women, men, girls and boys) the affected populations in Lainya and Twic East Counties in CES and Jonglei States.

THESO has been responding to the ongoing humanitarian crisis since the onset of the conflict in the country both in conflicted affected states and non-crisis states delivering both basic emergency and developmental WASH services to date
. 
The following are the main objectives of the proposed project in the two counties of Lainya and Twic East County Jonglei State
To enable target populations access to safe, equitable, and sustainable sufficient quantity of water supply for drinking, cooking, and personal and domestic hygiene (15 L/p/day)
To ensure the affected populations have reduced risk of contracting WASH-related diseases, or negative impacts on nutritional status, through access to improved hygienic practices, hygiene promotion and delivery of hygiene products and services on a sustainable and equitable manner. 

THESO&apos;s response strategies.

THESO will support WASH Cluster response in payams of critical malnutrition in Twic East county by ensuring provision of a minimum standard of improved basic water supply and hygiene promotion services in the target areas. The activities include Drilling/installation of community/institutional new boreholes, comprehensive rehabilitation of non-functional community/institutional hand pumps, upgrading the mini-water yard to a complete water yard powered by solar system, rehabilitation of sanitation facilities at health/school facilities, distribution of WASH NFIs, and hygiene promotion campaigns both at institutional and community levels

THESO will ensure that WASH services, specifically in regards to water supply facilities incorporate the minimum safety and access considerations with use of the WASH Cluster water supply Checklist, developed with the GBV Sub-Cluster.

THESO will work with WASH Cluster and NFIs, Logs and other clusters to ensure adequate supplies are strategically pre-positioned in the field to respond to new displacement and potential disease outbreaks through the 2017 rainy season.

THESO will maintain its active participation in the WASH Cluster meetings both at the state and National levels where ideas and project updates are shared and monthly WASH reports are submitted and carry out WASH implementation activities accordingly. 

THESO will encourage active participation of the local community including women and children in the implementation of the proposed project in the payams in the proposed counties accordingly
through Consultation with local authorities at all levels, women, men, boys and girls in the selection of the project payams within the county based on the identified needs. Hygiene promoters including hand pump technicians will include host community and IDPs men, women, boys and girls in the targeted project sites in the county. The local authorities, host community and IDPs men, women, girls and boys will be involved in the design of the community and institutional water supply facilities putting into consideration the need for safe access for females to water supply facilities. THESO has been also delivering emergency WASH services in UN-House POCs and area outside POCs in Juba since January 2014 up to date, and this means THESO has a lot of experiences in both developmental and emergency WASH service delivery in South Sudan context.</narrative>
