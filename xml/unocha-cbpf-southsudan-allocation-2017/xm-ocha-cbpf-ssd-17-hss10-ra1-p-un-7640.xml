   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Children continue to be disproportionately affected by the ongoing conflict, with high levels of population displacement and family separation affecting over one million children, causing severe psychological distress and leaving children vulnerable to exploitation, abuse and neglect. More than 16,000 children have been registered as unaccompanied, separated or missing since December 2013, with 9,730 cases remaining open. Continued capacity building of partners in 2017 has improved the quality of follow-up for unaccompanied and separated children, however further support on identification and registration, family tracing and reunification, and interim care arrangements is needed to ensure the protection of children.
An estimated 19,000 children &#x2013; mainly boys &#x2013; have been recruited into or used by armed forces and armed groups since December 2013, creating a high need for disarmament, demobilization and reintegration support. Meanwhile, girls are less likely to access school and psychosocial support (PSS) activities due to their traditional responsibilities in the home. Over a million children are estimated to be suffering from profound psychosocial distress. PSS activities in communities and schools are vital to help children deal with their experiences, and efforts are ongoing to strengthen community-based support mechanisms.
Decades of war has resulted in a high number of land mines and explosive remnants being scattered across the country, and are killing and injuring civilians, threatening communities and limiting mobility. Without awareness on the threats that unexploded ordinances pose and how to identify them, populations continue to be at high risk of death and injury when in contact with such devices. Children are particularly exposed when playing in mined areas and picking up explosive remnants of war out of curiosity. Ongoing mine risk education activities are critical in order to mitigate this life-threatening risk.
Communities are the primary support mechanism for women, men, girls and boys affected by the conflict. It will be important to continue working with and building on existing community structures and networks. These are also best placed for identifying vulnerable children, and can greatly reduce the risk of exploitation, violence and abuse of children. It is important to continue establishing and updating appropriate referral pathways and raising awareness of these within communities, as well as engaging communities on safety mapping to identify protection concerns.

UNICEF will procure and deliver critical, child-friendly supplies for psychosocial support activities for girls and boys in the conflict-affected Equatorial, Unity, Upper Nile, Jonglei and Barghazal regions in order to promote structured, nurturing environments and a sense of normalcy and routine among affected girls and boys. This supplies will also support hundreds of children that are currently been prepared for release from armed groups in Yambio. PSS Facilitators will develop daily activity schedules, with input from children and adolescents, and facilitate child- and age-appropriate activities, including drawing, games, sports, cultural songs, dance, and games and most importantly life skills sessions with adolescents. The use of, Recreational, Child Friendly Space and Adolescent kit materials integrated within facilitated PSS activities support greater cohesion among children, adolescents, and their families, and help children to create positive relationships with peers and caregivers, which are essential for healing and resilience. Tents, mats, and tarpaulins will be used in both PSS and family tracing and reunification (FTR) activities to host those participating in activities, ensure families are aware of the most urgent FTR and PSS services, and provide a central location to assist with lost, missing, and separated children identified during crises and conflict. Reintegration kits will support the most vulnerable children.</narrative>
