  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project aims to provide emergency shelter and non food items to the most vulnerable person specifically the the displaced and some host communities.This is a proposed 5 months project starting 1st August 2017 focusing on distribution of Shelter and NFI kits using a rapid response mechanism to reach out to 12,853 beneficiaries across-Eastern Equatoria, Jonglei,Lakes, NBeG,Unity, Upper Nile, Warrap and Central Equatoria. 

The exact locations within the selected  states will be confirmed during the assessment in first week of the project but they will fall within the counties prioritized by the shelter cluster.The project locations will be selected based on the priority of cluster and where the assessment reports show the need. Also  the feedback and information received by other agencies providing humanitarian assistance in different locations informed NRC team of areas with gaps and thus will do verification and registration of  beneficiaries to receive direct the NFI items. 

Number of distributions made will determine the number of PDMs. NRC is aiming at two distributions ( 50% of PDMs) other agencies will do the 50% PDM especially ACF.

The action will target mainly lactating and pregnant women, households with malnourished children, and households with members who have certain health complications. Besides unaccompanied children, unaccompanied elderly and persons with no community linkages will be targeted.  

In terms of mode of delivery, NRC will in line with humanitarian priorities for 2017 as outlined in the Humanitarian Response Plan (HRP) as well as the nature of the emergence in South Sudan. The project will promote timely delivery of assistance through deployment of rapid response teams.NRC response teams will be ready for deployment for  5 days for assessments and 14 days for full-fledged delivery of NFIs and other activities per location.
 
The team will work in close consultation with the Shelter cluster and its activities will be informed largely by the gaps identified through the multisector/agency assessment missions in which NRC will participate and/or carry out alone depending on the situation between August and December 2017.  Through this assessment, NRC will adapt the project to  the specific needs of men, women, girls and boys and respond accordingly or refer to relevant service providers in case the needs cannot be covered by the response. NRC also apply its check list of protection mainstreaming to complement the multi sector assessment. NRC will also internally coordinate its response with its Food Distribution, WASH and Education rapid response teams to achieve holistic and integrated NFI/shelter response. 

The distribution of Shelter and NFI kits will be done in 

Distribution sites will be identified  together with the community and will put into consideration the minimum standards of protection. The locations which will not expose women and girls to risk of sex and gender based violence (SGBV) with shade and which are not in long walking distances  will be chosen. The distribution sites will also ensure provision of gender and disability sensitive latrines or designated areas of ease with hand washing facilities. As much as possible, beneficiaries will be encouraged to bring their own drinking water in cases safe water sources are not available in nearby the distribution site. Elderly, physically incapable, pregnant women and others who require special attention will be prioritized during distribution. Feedback desk will also be provided at each distribution side.

NRC will complement its distribution by community awareness campaign and information sessions. Besides, NRC will organize practical demonstrations to improve the understanding and proper usage of distributed items. Due to the nature of the distribution, NRC may not be able to undertake post distribution monitoring (PDM). However, when and where possible NRC will undertake PDM.</narrative>
