The overall project objective is Protecting vulnerable populations affected by the crisis against hunger, malnutrition and destitution at HH level for 57,000 people (9,500HH) vulnerable IDPs and Host community in the target location of Akobo County. This project is aimed at scaling up the ongoing intervention in partnership with FAO in Akobo County, also to compliment other ongoing WASH, Nutrition projects in partnership with UNICEF, health intervention in partnership with IMA in Akobo County, as well as the ongoing WASH intervention in partnership with UNICEF. Nile Hope shall liaise with FAO to get in kind support for the fishing and vegetable kits for 57,000 individuals which corresponds to 9,500HH
Nile Hope has conducted the necessary own  assessments, also involving other agencies like for example in Akobo , we participated in several IRNAs . We also worked closely with the County authority, RRC, local leaders, IDPs and host community representatives in mapping the emergency needs. This is corroborated by reports from our field coordinators and staff. The needs were captured through various tools (questionnaires, case studies) and methodologies including interrogative observation, interviews and discussion meetings with key community leaders and local actors, focus group discussions with IDPs and host community members. A post distribution monitoring will be conducted targeting 15% of the beneficiaries to obtain feedback from the community for example regarding, timeline, quality and quantity of the kits provided. This also helps Nile Hope and its partners to learn and also improve future programming. The outcome of the post monitoring distribution (PDM) will reflect in the interim and final report</narrative>
