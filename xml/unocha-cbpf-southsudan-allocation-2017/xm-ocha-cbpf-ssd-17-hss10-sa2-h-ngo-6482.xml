  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Nyirol County where this project will be implemented has been categorized in phase 4 by the IPC. Twenty nine (29) suspected cholera cases with 4 deaths (CFR 13.79%) have been reported from Nyirol County. In addition, there has been massive displacement from the neighboring counties into Nyirol due to the fighting between the two warring parties and displacement with the county due cattle raiding from the neighboring Murle tribe. These have deteriorated the health conditions with communicable diseases such as Malaria, acute respiratory infection (ARI) and diarrhea causing significant morbidity and mortality among this population especially children under 5 years (Health Cluster February2017 report) with malaria accounting for 30% of consultations followed by ARI at 19% and diarrhea at 17% and malnutrition have already skyrocketed at 29.2% as indicated by the SMART Survey conducted by MEDAIR during the post-harvest period of Feb 2017. The result is a population chronically prone to disease with some 5,435 People mostly women and children currently in dire and urgent needs of health services, especially treatment of SAM with medical complication in the county. 
The project is aligned to Health cluster objective of Improving access and scaling up responsiveness to essential health care by focusing on the major causes of mortality among U5C (malaria, diarrhoea, pneumonia, measles), cholera respond and preparedness, SAM with complications, emergency HIV/AIDS and Tuberculosis, basic emergency obstetric and neonatal care including the clinical management of SGBV in conflict affected and vulnerable populations. This will ensure 90% of the population of the vulnerable communities to have access to Primary Health Care by increasing access to primary health care services to Vulnerable Communities through, cholera response and preparedness and availing minimum essential stock of SAM treatment for medical complicated cases in CASS existing facilities in Nyirol County.
The beneficiaries of this project are mainly women and children of both Host community and IDPs who are residing with the Host community in Pultruk and Chuill payams. Locations were selected based on vulnerability and areas that are not covered by CMA and CASS program, these areas include Pultruk (Pultruk PHCC), and Chuil (Chuil PHCC). Within the Payams, the project targets to reach at least 90% beneficiaries through treatment and prevention of Cholera.
CASS, one of the lead agencies providing primary health care and Nutrition services in Nyirol County with funding from UNICEF have been facing the challenge of inadequate funding to mitigate this emerging shock. CASS believe that this gap will be mended by SSHF funding to Improve access and scale up responsiveness to essential health care by focusing on the major causes of mortality among U5C (malaria, diarrhoea, pneumonia, measles), SAM with complications, emergency HIV/AIDS and Tuberculosis, basic emergency obstetric and neonatal care including the clinical management of SGBV in conflict affected and vulnerable populations.
Being a national organization, CASS has a better understanding of the local context as well as the capacity to provide the most critical services during emergencies even within limited humanitarian corridor where international agencies cannot operate this leaves CASS as the best agency to implement this project.</narrative>
