   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Project Summary: 
Project Aim: 
The IRW intervention on &#x2018;&#x2019;Timely Provision of WASH Services to the Conflict Affected Populations of Lainya and Yei Counties in Central Equatoria in South Sudan.&#x2019;&#x2019; WASCAP aims on tackling effects emanating from conflict and natural calamities through providing emergency WASH and related Non-Food Items (NFIs). 
Target Groups and beneficiaries:
The intervention will link to recovery thus resilience building of the communities mainly through community WASH infrastructure building to assist 12,500 (men 3100, Women 350, Boys 2900 and Girls 3000) direct and indirect beneficiaries in Lainya and Yei Counties affected by conflict that erupted in July 2016. 10,470 people from IDPs (Men 2,650, Women 2550, Boys 2620 and Girls 2650) and 2,030 (Men 450, Women 950, Boys 280 and Girls 350) host communities will be provided with access to safe water as per agreed standards (7.5-15 litres per person per day) of whom the same population of 1,800 people will be provided with access to appropriate sanitation facilities and WASH related NFIs and the target population will benefit from WASH infrastructure as the few existing facilities are already strained. Currently millions of displaced people cannot access basic needs given the volatility situation. 
Project Target Locations:
IRW-SS field staff observations ascertain that the displaced population in Lainya and Yei are at risk of contracting malaria, acute bloody or watery diarrhea and measles. There is an indication of Famine due to scarcity of food approximately 85% in the affected areas lost their livelihood. IRW-SS supports over 20,000 IDPs in Juba (Mahad and Mangatein) yet the gaps in water and sanitation, Non-food items (NFIs) and medical supplies are evident.
IRW-SS will therefore preposition the project intervention in Counties of Yei and Lainya IDPs who are hit hard by the crises to provide water and sanitation services to the affected communities in Yei and Lainya.
Mode of Delivery: 
The response will provide clean water, reduce common diseases, promote community hygiene, and distribute WASH NFIs. This is facilitated through IRW frontline Team who will be fully based in Yei and Lainya to ensure beneficiaries are fully involved in the project in a participatory manner. All project materials will be delivered through procurement or core pipeline support.
IRW-SS will continue working in Central Equatoria Yei and Lainya to give water and sanitation services and non-food items in a sustainable manner. Central Equatoria State is experiencing heavy brunt of the civil war. Given this geographical location the state experienced massive displacements and destructions. Any flare up in violence would quickly become catastrophic for children, leading to high levels of mortality.

WASH: Access to water in the three states is below the minimum standard of 500 persons per hand pump. WASH cluster data indicates that in CES there are more than twice the SPHERE standard number of persons per hand pump. One borehole serves over 3 villages - and besides drinking water, it also brings disease and ill health. According to IRW-SS assessment of Yei and Lainya Counties, Some pumps are corroded and produce brownish water that smells and they believe they will get stomach diseases if they drink from it. Typhoid, acute diarrhea and respiratory infections have all increased this year because of the dirty water from the pump and the untreated ponds which are contaminated. With the current displacements in Yei and Lainya due to civil war the population is increasing and so the existing water source is already overstretched and over used by communities. Shortage of water also affect women as they have to walk a long distance in quest of water and exposed to risk of abuses, girls will have to spend longer hours at the water source which deprives them of school. State government in these areas insists that the population needs more boreholes. Over 80% of households.</narrative>
