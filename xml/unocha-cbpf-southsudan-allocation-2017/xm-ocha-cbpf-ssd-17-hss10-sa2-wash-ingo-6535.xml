   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Life-saving WASH support and preparedness for vulnerable IDPs and host communities affected by violence and are at risk of Cholera in Kapoeta East County of Eastern Equatoria State</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">INTERSOS will provide lifesaving WASH support in response to the specific needs of IDPs, Host Communities, children, women and vulnerable groups in Kapoeta East county of Eastern Equatoria State who are affected by recent violence and are at risk of cholera.

INTERSOS will carefully consider the specific needs, concerns and priorities of women and girls, men and boys of different ages and disparities such as disabilities in its response, incorporating protection principles during implementation.

INTERSOS will cover Kapoeta East county mainly focus on corridor between Narus to Kuron payams uncovered by existing partners. Following a triangulating security and access-related information available in Kapoeta and Torit (consultation with IOM and INTERSOS team based as SFP for S/NFIs Cluster) INTERSOS is confident that the proposed locations are accessible for assistance, and therefore lifesaving WASH intervention can be achieved. 

Considering additional needs and large rural areas in Kapoeta East, NTERSOS, in consultation with IOM (Focal Point for cholera response Kapoetas) has identified Narus and Kuron as uncovered by current partners and cholera cases from these locations have been continuously reported.

At the moment Kapoeta East county needs more grants and SSHF funding is crucial for further delivery of WASH services to fill the gap and to expand lifesaving WASH activities amid large number of reported cholera cases and dire WASH needs as revealed by Cholera focal point team.

INTERSOS will maintain flexibility to change target locations, in case of cholera outbreaks or any developments in security situation and/or access constraints.

Considering WASH Cluster&#x2019;s recommendations and feasibility, INTERSOS will ensure usage of the following lifesaving WASH activities as an integrated WASH package to respond cholera and New displacement to meet WASH needs including: 

Water Supply: Water supply will include borehole rehabilitation/repair, hand pump mechanics training and establishment of Water Sources management committees for the rehabilitated/ repaired water sources with availability of basic spares. 

Sanitation: Sanitation services will include construction and repair of emergency latrines in communities as well as at CTCs, CTUs and ORPs. WASH committees will be engaged for maintenance and usage of latrines. INTERSOS, in consultation with health partners, will also facilitate target CTCs for the Infection Prevention Control support and provide technical WASH services.

WASH NFIs distribution: provision of WASH NFIs (aqua tabs/PUR, soaps, Jerry cans, buckets, MHM kits) for vulnerable groups affected by the conflict and risk of cholera

Hygiene Promotion:
Focusing on areas with active transmission of cholera, INTERSOS will work closely with community hygiene promoters to organize sessions on hygiene promotion, such as usage of house hold water treatment, hand washing and prevention of diarrheal diseases with special focus on prevention of WASH-born disease. Hygiene promotion activities will continue with more focus on promotional and demonstration activities like latrine use and maintenance, safe water chain, households&#x2019; visits. 
IINTERSOS will target communities living in in areas affected by Cholera and are at risk of WASH related epidemics. In addition, key local leaders (heads of village, traditional leaders) will be encouraged to participate to the sessions and help mobilizing the population. 

School WASH activities to support school feeding programs: INTERSOS, while providing technical support to education partners, will also support existing school feeding programs being implemented in proposed areas by forming and training of school WASH and Nutrition clubs, conducting awareness sessions through child2child approach to spread hygiene messages and provide technical assistance.</narrative>
