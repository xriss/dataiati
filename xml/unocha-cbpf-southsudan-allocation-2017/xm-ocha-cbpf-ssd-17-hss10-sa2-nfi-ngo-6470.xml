   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Provision of Emergency shelter and Non Food Items for new internally displaced persons  in  Ayod County of Jonglei State</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The population of Ayod County  according to reports from local authorities is 168,310 individuals as of February 2017, out of which 65,300 are IDPs. Following the on-going armed conflict in Unity State, there is continued displacement of population. This caused an influx of IDPs into Ayod, which border Unity State to the South. IDPs mainly originated from Bentiu, Juba, Yei and Malakal. The major reasons for leaving their previous location according to new arrivals  was a lack of food (64%), followed by insecurity (61%). Fears of child abductions, was also a major driver. The host communities have shared food, cooking utensils and water collection Jerry cans to the IDPs. 
About 70% of households are headed by women, most of whom are widows, as a large number of men were reportedly killed during the conflicts of December 2013 and July 2016. In Ayod County, IDPs make up about 10-35 percent of the total population. Over 50% of the IDPs are women and children. These target groups are the most vulnerable and in most need of support.Both IDPs and host populations suffer extreme problems with drinking water accessibility, lack of non-food items (NFIs) and food insecurity.
An average of 70% of the IDPs  are integrated into the host communities, which are congested and the sanitation is poor. Most of the IDPs intend to stay until the situations in their places of origin normalizes.
There is no major conflict threat in Ayod. The main means of transport is by air. As a result of humanitarian access constraints in most villages, the remaining IDPs and local community in Ayod are likely to continue facing dire humanitarian conditions. 
IDP shelter needs in Ayod  appear to be greater compared to local community members, with 42% of IDP hosting settlements reporting that IDPs mainly live in imporovised shelters, with at least some of the IDP population in the village living outside. These findings suggest that IDP shelter needs outside of formal displacement sites remain high and that local communities are not adequately equipped to absorb the Shelter/NFIs needs of displaced populations.
 This project therefore aims at providing emergency shelter and NFIs to the new IDPs in Ayod County to ensure Improved quality of life of newly displaced IDPs through provision of Emergency Sheter/NFI support. ADA will focus on the major need to target vulnerability of the women and children especially women and child headed households, the elderly, pregnant and lactating mothers, with the aim to contribute to improved protective environment of the vulnerable women, men, girls and boys, among  the IDPs, returnees and host communities.This project will also ensure that the urgent shelter and NFI needs of 13,425 vulnerable households are provided. ADA will use the lifesaving criteria to ensure the protection and promotion of health and dignity of the vulnerable IDPs  and to save the lifes of the most vulnerable including returnees and host communities.
This project will compliment other projects that ADA is already implementing particularly the major gaps in Shelter/NFIs, and at the same time food security, education and child protection in Ayod (Pager, Pajek, Kadak, Mangok, Wai, Kotdalok,Kandak). ADA being a static partner in the above locations will contribute towards success of the project since ADA has a good relation with the communities and authorities on ground. ADA can therefore use available staff in the given locations to conduct activities and in case of further need, a mobile team of ADA, which is available will be in position to deploy in the locations. 
S/NFIs needs include plastic sheets, blankets,mosquito nets and kitchen sets, targeting 13, 245 beneficiaries.</narrative>
