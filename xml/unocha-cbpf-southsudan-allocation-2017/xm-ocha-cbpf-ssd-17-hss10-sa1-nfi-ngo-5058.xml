   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Distribution of Non-Food Items and Emergency Shelter to conflict affected displaced population in Greater Mundri counties.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The overall aim of the project is to save lives, alleviate sufferings, and enhance community resilience through provision of appropriate shelter solutions and Non-Food Items to vulnerable and displaced population in Greater Mundri. The project will respond to specific needs of most vulnerable households among the internally displaced and conflict-affected population of Mundri West, Mundri East and Mvolo counties, Western Equatoria State. 
The LCED Emergency Response Team (ERT) based in Mundri will identify the deep field locations where conflict-affected population have fled, conduct needs assessment, verification, registration and distribution of Non-Food Items (NFI) and Emergency Shelter (ES) material, particularly focusing on gender and age-related needs. This static team is composed by two field officers, one NFI assistant, and one emergency response officer. In addition, as Deep Field Coordination (DFC) focal point on behalf of UN-OCHA, LCED will negotiate access to deep field locations with local authorities, with the support of UN-OCHA. 
The proposed interventions include direct distribution of emergency shelter material and NFI to the most vulnerable, displaced households in Mundri West and Mundri East counties, identified through specific assessment and verification conducted by the LCED ERT using the S/NFI cluster tools. In addition, due to the lack of WASH partners in Greater Mundri, and the high needs of the population for WASH NFI, LCED will implement multi-sectoral response, combining the distribution of ES/NFI with WASH items, where applicable. The interventions will also include a cash voucher pilot project, for 80 selected households in Mundri town, Mundri West county, where the security situation is relatively calm, and the population has access to the market. These 80 households will be selected among the most vulnerable IDPs, considering their dire need for shelter and NFI, their lack of financial capacity to purchase S/NFI at the local market, and the impossibility of collecting shelter material by themselves from the nearby bushes. The cash vouchers will allow the population to purchase NFI and/or shelter material, according to their most urgent needs (to be established during the assessment). The reason for not implementing a cash voucher programming only focusing on blankets is that from the past assessments and distributions in the area, LCED observed a high need of other NFI and shelter material among the IDP community, besides blankets. Displaced households are in high needs of emergency shelter, mosquito nets, blankets, sleeping mats, kanga and kitchen utensils among others. LCED will collaborate with the FSL cluster and with IOM, which have implemented cash programming in the past, in order to evaluate the security and access in Mundri town, and to conduct a feasibility study. 
The LCED management, including the Project Manager and the Executive Director, will be involved in the initial assessments, as well as in monitoring and evaluation exercises, in order to guarantee transparency and accountability, and ensure that the project objectives are followed through. LCED management will also guide the general coordination with the S/NFI cluster and UN-OCHA, closely collaborating with the two entities in order to guarantee the provision of ES/NFI to the affected population in a timely and efficient manner, and provide monthly update on the project implementation progress. As Site Focal Point (SiFP) for Greater Mundri, LCED will collaborate and coordinate joint interventions with mobile partners, when needed, and explore avenues for involving NNGOs and INGOs in the area, to expand its coverage and ensure that the population&apos;s needs are met.</narrative>
