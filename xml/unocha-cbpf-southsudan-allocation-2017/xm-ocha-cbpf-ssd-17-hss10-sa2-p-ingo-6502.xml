   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Integrated Protection Mobile Team (IPMT):
The mobile GBV units will operate from Juba and work closely with the Protection Cluster and other units  of the IPMT. Regular rapid missions will be undertaken to hard-to reach areas of the country with extraordinary humanitarian needs. INTERSOS will train and equip two mobile teams, each composed by 2 qualified and experienced GBV staff and 1 Security Officer, which upon arrival will conduct a rapid need assessment to identify the most urgent protection needs of vulnerable women and girls affected by the conflict and respond through direct GBV services and assistance. In each location, the mobile GBV team will identify a safe and accessible area to quickly set up a temporary confidential space, which the GBV staff can use as Listening Centre to receive survivors or women and girls at risk of GBV and provide quality care and PSS that responds to the individual&#x2019;s concerns, but does not intrude. The provided services will focus on initial healing and the ability to identify and strengthen own coping mechanism. This service can be accessed by female and male survivors or women and girls at particular risk of sexual violence, exploitation, abuse, denial of resources or forced early marriage. In case of longer deployments, the safe space can also serve as a temporary WGFS where the staff can conduct recreational activities with women and girls. An integral part of the intervention will include establishing new or strengthening existing referral pathways to connect women and girls to multisector GBV response services and the distribution of dignity kits. To achieve sustainability of the intervention INTERSOS will aim at identifying a qualified GBV partner to establish a static or semi-static presence or other viable support mechanism immediately after each mission. In cases where this is not possible the GBV mobile team will ensure that monitoring and follow-up missions are undertaken by INTERSOS teams outside the IPMT or other GBV partners. The mobile team will also prioritize the training of front-line agencies, community-based organization (CBOs) and key actors and community leaders in basic GBV concepts, provision of PFA and use of referral pathway for safe and dignified referrals. 

Prevention and Response in Northern Jonglei:
INTERSOS will also provide services in two counties in Northern Jonglei where humanitarian needs are on the rise following clashes, which have displaced an estimated 100&#x2019;000 individuals. Specifically, INTERSOS will contribute to a more protective environment for the conflict-affected population of two counties (Nyirol and Uror) through life-saving GBV prevention and response activities. To reach remote areas, where currently most IDPs are staying INTERSOS will apply a semi-static approach, which will include the establishment of a temporary Listening Centre and WGFS to provide women and girls a safe and supportive environment. Qualified and skilled Case Workers will provide focused, non-specialized MHPSS services to survivors and other groups at high risk of GBV. Those services will include emotional support and referrals to appropriate services and be survivor-centered focusing principally on strengthening the individual&#x2019;s resilience. In the WGFS women and adolescent girls can further participate in recreational and income generating activities. This safe space will provide a sense of normalcy to women and girls whose routine was disrupted by the conflict and peer support through the dialogues that take place amongst them. In case of new displacement INTERSOS will expand its semi-static response and deploy a mobile team composed by 2 GBV Case Workers and 2 Community Mobilizers, who will provide PSS in the new displacement site. INTERSOS will also regularly train first responders in GBV mainstreaming and provision of PFA to equip them with the necessary skills to refer survivors in a dignified manner to appropriate services.</narrative>
