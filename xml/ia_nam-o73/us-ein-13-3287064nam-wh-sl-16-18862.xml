   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In Sierra Leone, 94% of the population does not have access to electricity due to poor infrastructure and unaffordability. Without clean, affordable and reliable electricity, areas like education, health, and communications are negatively impacted.

To address this issue, WHI and Mobile Power Ltd., a small UK start-up, partnered in 2016 to provide clean &amp;amp; affordable energy to the beyond-the-grid population in Sierra Leone. As part of our program, we provide portable battery systems that are powered by solar energy to deliver clean energy at an affordable price. The smart-battery rental system, designed by Mobile Power, is available at local shops and provides users with sufficient clean energy to charge mobile phones and power bright LED lights.

WHI and Mobile Power launched the first Mobile Power Sierra Leone site in 2016 in Pate Bana, a village heavily impacted by the recent Ebola outbreak. The pilot was the first chance to test pricing and customer demand and to make sure the technology and business model would thrive in Sierra Leone. The program provides a low-cost, highly scalable business model with a healthy return on investment for shop owners.

Thanks to this partnership with Mobile Power, WHI is: (1) providing solar-powered lighting and power through smart battery pack technology; (2) improving local economic development through opportunities for entrepreneurs and micro-enterprises, and (3) increasing awareness and utilization of solar energy technology generating jobs.</narrative>
