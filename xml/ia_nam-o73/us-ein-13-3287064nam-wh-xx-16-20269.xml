   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Hurricane Matthew Relief in Haiti</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">On October 4, 2016, Haiti was devastated by Hurricane Matthew, the most powerful Caribbean hurricane in nearly a decade. According to Reuters, as of October 10th, 1,000 people have died and 1.4 million people are in need of assistance. An outbreak of cholera, a deadly diarrheal illness that spreads through contaminated water, has already begun.

To address the dire situation in Haiti, World Hope International will be delivering 2,000 water filters, 2,520 hygiene kits and 342 tarps to the most affected areas of Haiti during the week of October 10th. These life-saving goods will be distributed through Global Partners and local Wesleyan churches.

We are able to immediately provide these life-saving supplies thanks to our network of NGO and business partners. Brink Trucking Lines has donated their services to ship the filters and hygiene kits to the staging point, where our nonprofit partner Airlink will airlift the shipment to Haiti. Supplies landed in the week of October 10 and the distribution began shortly after. The distribution took place through partnering Wesleyan churches in Haiti&#x2019;s Southern Peninsula, where the hurricane hit the hardest, and also on the island of La Gonave in support of the La Gonave Wesleyan Hospital.

We have heard from our Haitian brothers and sisters that there is still great need and a continuing threat of cholera. Current efforts are underway for a second shipment of relief supplies including more water filters and tarps.</narrative>
