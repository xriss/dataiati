  <title>Increasing Retention and Completion at 40 Ugandan Schools</title>
  <description>The project aims to increase retention and completion rates amongst 13,981 pupils at 40 rural Ugandan schools. This will be achieved by providing training for 8,841 parents, 520 School Management Committee members and 283 teachers to ensure that parents actively participate in school development and that the schools are well managed and governed. In particular the project will focus on ensuring that the specific needs of the 7,072 female pupils are addressed.</description>
