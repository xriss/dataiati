   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Fair, Green and Global Alliance (FGG) aims to increase the power and decision-making influence of organised, mobilised and informed civil society, especially women, to advance fair and green trade and value chains. FGG believes that poverty, inequality and exclusion are caused by power asymmetries. We see the unprecedented power of capital over people and planet as the primary obstacle impeding realisation of fair and green trade and value chains. The FGG programme focuses on recalibrating power within the global architecture of trade and value chains by amplifying the voices of targeted rights-holders &#x2013;  small producers and traders, workers, fishers, rural and Indigenous peoples, religious and ethnic minorities, and migrants, especially the women and youth among them &#x2013; who are practising, claiming or defending human rights and fair and green economic practices, and/or whose rights are being ignored, threatened or violated by corporations and/or governments. We aim to transform social relations so that these rights-holders&#x2019; voices are heard and heeded. FGG&#x2019;s eight members (ActionAid, Both ENDS, Clean Clothes Campaign, IT for Change, Milieudefensie/Friends of the Earth International/Friends of the Earth Europe, Samdhana Institute, SOMO and the Transnational Institute) cooperate with some 1000+ partners and allies in our many worldwide networks to strengthen collective capacities to advance a common vision of fair and green trade and value chains.</narrative>

      <comment>
       <narrative xml:lang="EN">Through SCS1, the Ministry considers how many laws and policies are better implemented as a result of CSO engagement. FGG does this through its &#x2018;6SCS1&#x2019; indicator, for which it counts the &#x2018;practice change part&#x2019; of its generic indicator 6, in which policy and practice change results are combined. To be more precise: FGG counts the number of laws, policies and norms implemented for sustainable and inclusive development. In 2021, FGG contributed to 39 such changes in practice.  

Examples of such successful practice change include: 
For strand 1 &#x2013; trade and investment agreements: The European Union (EU) adopted and started implementing the Country-by-Country reporting in 2021. FGG, together with Tax Justice Network Netherlands and Europe, had actively lobbied for public Country-by-Country legislation in the EU. This legislation will improve the fiscal transparency of multinational companies, which is critical in tackling tax avoidance.  

For strand 3 &#x2013; public financial institutions: In July 2021, the Independent Complaints Mechanism (ICM) associated with EU Development Finance Institutions (DFIs), found a complaint filed by FGG partners, involving making a Financial Intermediary (FI) eligible. This is a ground-breaking change in practice by this non-judicial grievance mechanism. Development banks are increasingly outsourcing their lending to commercial banks and other financial institutions, which then invest it onward, often with little oversight. The eligibility decision set an important precedent for communities affected by other EU DFI funding via FIs to seek accountability before the ICM upon the fulfilment of certain technical conditions. The case complaint that led to the decision alleges that EU DFIs failed to ensure that FirstRand Bank, an FI, had adequate Environmental and Social risk management systems in place to monitor its own high-risk clients and, specifically, the performance of the New Liberty Gold Mine that FirstRand financed.  

For strand 4 &#x2013; tenure rights: A Chinese investor in the Mubende area in central Uganda was prevented from grabbing land for a so-called &#x2018;conservation&#x2019; project from the Nakonsonzi community. In 2012, the investor expropriated land from the communities using cruel and harsh methods, even including killing landowners and evicting others. Various Mubende district leadership bodies &#x2013; such as the local government&#x2019;s natural resource unit, the police, the District Local Chairman (IV), district councillors, the Local Council chairperson, and a Member of Parliament (MP) &#x2013; summoned the investor to engage in a dialogue with the community threatened by this land grab. This happened after an FGG partner had presented a draft report to the Mubende leadership based on a fact-finding mission in Nakosonzi community in December 2021, which had demonstrated human rights violations, illegal evictions, destruction of property and crops, illegal arrests, and detention of the community members and the forceful expropriation of land.   Following community dialogues, which confirmed the allegations and brought massive evidence of human rights violations and land grabs by the investor, the investor was summoned by the district Local Council and the MP for Mubende district to stop the evictions and to conduct an environmental impact assessment. In addition, in response to further demands by the authorities, the investor agreed to register all the tenants on the land and compensate them; second, to refrain from planting any new trees on the land prior to an environmental assessment; third, that in any further plans for lands to be sold, the Local Council Chairman should be involved in the process; and finally, the investor also agreed to collaborate on an assessment of the exact demarcations and squatters on the land. This matter became a national concern and was aired on nationwide television (NBS).  

For strand 6 &#x2013; rules for business and corporate conduct, cross-sectoral: the second evaluation of NCPs, carried out by OECD Watch (of which five of the eight FGG members are members), helped prompt 13 NCPs to improve their procedures or structures to better facilitate access to remedy and civil society input. Specifically: six NCPs redrafted their procedures, often improving language such as by clarifying their commitment to accepting plausible claims (18 in total) or their openness to accepting claims filed by civil society organisations (CSOs) rather than only directly affected people (20 in total); two more NCPs (17 in total now) have committed to follow up on existing agreements and recommendations; two more NCPs (38 in total) have published procedures in national languages and English; and three more NCPs (13 in total) now involve non-government stakeholders in the processing of complaints.  

For strand 7 &#x2013;rules for business and corporate conduct, extractives: In 2021, as a result of petitions, communiqu&#xE9;s and media campaigns by a group of FGG-supported Ugandan CSOs, the network of community champions, youth leaders and women&#x2019;s groups from the Albertine region they support, five fossil-fuel companies (Total Energies, CNOOC, Petroli&#xE8;res, PetroAfrik Energy, Niger Delta Petroleum Resources) that had shown interest in the second round of oil exploration in the biodiverse Albertine  Graben region licensing subsequently shied away, thereby halting the project.  

For strand 8 &#x2013; rules for business and corporate conduct, garment sector: After global pressure, the NBC Universal brand followed three other brands already producing goods in the Kanlayanee factory in Mae Sot, Thailand, and agreed to full compensation for 26 Burmese migrant workers who had been victims of wage theft. The workers received all the wages and severance legally owed to them, which amounted to more than 3.46 million Thai baht, approximately &#x20AC;96,000. For two years, these workers were illegally paid less than a dollar an hour, were forced to work unpaid overtime, and had their holiday pay withheld. When they spoke out to demand justice, the factory closed down; and when they demanded their legally owed wages, the workers were blacklisted. Throughout 2021, through the &#x2018;NBC Universal #PayUp&#x2019; campaign, the FGG Alliance campaigned against NBC Universal after the other three international brands that had previously been producing goods in the Kanlayanee factory, paid the workers&#x2019; dues. Simultaneously, FGG supported the workers via its Urgent Appeals system. All four brands that produced goods in the Kanlayanee factory agreed to pay their employees in full. That means that they paid these workers not only the severance pay due after losing their jobs, but also full compensation for the minimum wage violations inflicted on them.   

For strand 10 &#x2013; promoting inclusive governance systems: In 2021, in various ways FGG lobbied to safeguard the participation of civil society in UN decision-making processes and policy development. In July 2021, UNCTAD agreed to allow CSO participation in the events around UNCTAD 15 be determined by self-nomination procedures rather than selection by UNCTAD. This provides more room for CSOs to determine how to best make their voice heard at these events. This decision followed joint lobby and advocacy by the wider CSO network actively engaging with UNCTAD 15, with FGG support and facilitation.    

For strand 11 &#x2013; cross-cutting civic space: In Indonesia, FGG&#x2019;s urgent action grant for the COVID-19 response channelled through a partner CSO working in Apokayan, East Kalimantan was used to lobby at the district and national level to increase indigenous peoples&#x2019; access to COVID-19 vaccines. The partner negotiated with the National Human Rights Commission to convince the Ministry of Health to increase its allocation of vaccines to indigenous peoples. This resulted in the Ministry of Health increasing the amount of vaccines allocated to indigenous communities, not only in Apokayan but also in other remote areas like West Kalimantan, Maluku and Mentawai in Sumatra.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">In FGG&#x2019;s indicator framework, the indicator linked to SCS1 and SCS2 groups both policy and practice change together in the same indicator (i.e. per result area C, D, E, F # instances in which key actors adopt and/or implement). FGG policy/practice recommendations. However, in order to still be able to link to both the SCS1 and SCS2 indicator we collect disaggregated data on policy and practice change respectively. For SCS1 we measure instances in which key actors change their practices advancing fair and green value chains.   

In 2022, the FGG Alliance&#x2019;s work aims to contribute to 65 changes in practices for sustainable and inclusive development. This work takes place under the umbrella of four result areas, aimed at improved government policies (result area C), corporate regulation by governmental institutions (result area D), corporate conduct (result area E) and policy space and funding for transformative practices (result area F).  

Result Area C 
When it comes to governmental policies, the practice change FGG aims for is often focused on the implementation of international policies by national and local governments and both in the global North and South as well as by international organisations. FGG&#x2019;s plans for achieving practice changes regarding international land-related policy frameworks such as the Voluntary Guidelines on the Governance of Tenure (VGGTs) and Free Prior and Informed Consent (FPIC) are a good example of this. Various FGG members, including ActionAid, Both ENDS, Samdhana and TNI will engage in work aimed at the implementation of (elements of) the VGGTs and FPIC in national or international tenure policy frameworks. As a result of FGG lobby towards various governments, including Bangladesh, Guatemala, India, Indonesia, Kenya, Malaysia, the Philippines and Uganda, we expect amongst others Kenyan government bodies at various levels to implement FPIC and the VGGTs to expand civic space and protect human and women&#x2019;s rights, including in the review of the National Land Policy. In addition we expect (district) governments in Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines to recognise and implement elements of the VGGTs (e.g. by issuing ordinances), leading to increased protection of communal and individual land rights, especially those of indigenous peoples. Finally, we expect civil society recommendations on the integration of the VGGTs to be incorporated in the UNCCD policy advice to combat desertification.  

Result Area D 
For the practice changes of governments regulating private sector actors ensuring respect for human and environmental rights in public financial flows is one of the key focuses. For example, in 2022, FGG members aim to push export credit agencies (ECA), such as ADSB, to improve their practices to ensure that human rights, the climate and the environment are protected in the projects they finance. This means amongst others to actualise the Dutch government&#x2019;s commitment to stop all direct public finance for fossil fuel projects abroad by the end of 2022. Both ENDS and Milieudefensie/FoEI together with amongst others partners in Mozambique, Uganda, Togo, and Ghana will continue to advocate for the recommendations of these partners on stopping ECA support for fossil fuels to be heard and actually implemented in practice. In addition, in the Mozambique LNG project, we also aim for ADSB, the AfdB and the Dutch embassy to verify whether Total and Van Oord implement the OECD guidelines for multinational enterprises. On top of divestment from fossil fuels and solid human rights due diligence, we also expect our advocacy with partners towards ADSB to lead to the implementation of a communication protocol on how they involve local communities, including women and youth, in their decision making processes. We aim to achieve these changes in practice through connecting our partners, exchanging information, jointly strategising and advocating, e.g. by raising awareness about ECA supported fossil fuel projects in Mozambique through social media.    

Result Area E 
In FGG&#x2019;s indicator framework, practice change is not always necessarily preceded by policy change. One of the key practice changes that FGG aims for related to corporate conduct is obtaining remedy and/or other compensation for people and communities negatively affected by corporate misconduct, i.e. who have been subjected to rights violations by corporations. In 2022, FGG members including ActionAid, Both ENDS, and Clean Clothes Campaign will continue to pursue corporate accountability in grievance cases where the rights of people or communities have been violated by corporations, through complaint mechanisms, urgent appeal cases or strategic litigation. ActionAid and partners in Bangladesh, Guatemala, Kenya, and Uganda will continue to strengthen the capacities of communities affected by land grabs and displacement linked to large scale investments, to be able to understand land rights, and to be able to advocate for these rights to be respected and obtain remedy from corporations where injustice has been done. In cases where land rights have been violated, ActionAid and partners will provide legal aid and pursue Public Interest Litigation trajectories, amongst other things. ActionAid aims for mining and natural stones firms and other private actors in Kenya, Zimbabwe and Uganda, to improve their compensation for communities after land grabbing and respect the rights, including the right to freedom of expression, of (E)HRDs who challenge these land grabs. In addition, Both ENDS and partners will lobby for and expect to achieve stronger compliance, stricter sanctions and remedy by RSPO members through RSPO related grievance and conflict resolution mechanisms. Clean Clothes Campaign will engage in a number of Urgent Appeal cases, regarding wage theft, severance pay, factory closures, and freedom of association of garment workers. We expect brands and suppliers to provide remedy in 5 such cases. For example, in Myanmar, we aim for Myo Aye and/or other political prisoners to be released from prison through active lobby by CCC towards brands, the Dutch Embassy, and MSIs.   

Result Area F 
For the practice changes related to transformative practices, FGG measures the instances in which key actors have taken concrete steps showing that they have increased policy space and funding for transformative practices (i.e. systemic alternatives/FGG solutions). One of the changes in practice that we aim for in 2022 is increased policy space and funding for agroecology. Agroecology &#x2013; applying ecological principles to agricultural systems &#x2013; is one of the key alternatives that FGG (AA, BE, MD/FoEI, Samdhana, and TNI) promotes as a sustainable alternative to large scale industrial agriculture. We see this as a way to combat the pressing challenges to which industrial agriculture contributes, such as climate change, biodiversity loss and land degradation, the effects of which are mostly felt in the Global South. Agroecology promotion will be a key element of just agriculture &amp; food transitions, of a feminist economy and of climate justice. The agendas for inclusive land governance and transition towards inclusive and sustainable local food systems as well as climate resilience for communities and women are highly intertwined. Agroecology is an inherently feminist alternative as it explicitly relates to female autonomy and the construction of spaces of equal participation between men and women. While much of FGG&#x2019;s work on agroecology will be on the level of agenda setting, in some cases we already expect key actors to change their practices in 2022. We aim for 4 instances in which county governments in Kenya, change their practices by increasing funding and promoting resilience building initiatives such as agroecology.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">Through SCS1, the Ministry considers how many laws and policies are better implemented as a result of CSO engagement. FGG does this through its &#x2018;6SCS1&#x2019; indicator, for which it counts the &#x2018;practice change part&#x2019; of its generic indicator 6, in which policy and practice change results are combined. To be more precise: FGG counts the number of laws, policies and norms implemented for sustainable and inclusive development. In 2021, FGG contributed to 39 such changes in practice.  

Examples of such successful practice change include: 
For strand 1 &#x2013; trade and investment agreements: The European Union (EU) adopted and started implementing the Country-by-Country reporting in 2021. FGG, together with Tax Justice Network Netherlands and Europe, had actively lobbied for public Country-by-Country legislation in the EU. This legislation will improve the fiscal transparency of multinational companies, which is critical in tackling tax avoidance.  

For strand 3 &#x2013; public financial institutions: In July 2021, the Independent Complaints Mechanism (ICM) associated with EU Development Finance Institutions (DFIs), found a complaint filed by FGG partners, involving making a Financial Intermediary (FI) eligible. This is a ground-breaking change in practice by this non-judicial grievance mechanism. Development banks are increasingly outsourcing their lending to commercial banks and other financial institutions, which then invest it onward, often with little oversight. The eligibility decision set an important precedent for communities affected by other EU DFI funding via FIs to seek accountability before the ICM upon the fulfilment of certain technical conditions. The case complaint that led to the decision alleges that EU DFIs failed to ensure that FirstRand Bank, an FI, had adequate Environmental and Social risk management systems in place to monitor its own high-risk clients and, specifically, the performance of the New Liberty Gold Mine that FirstRand financed.  

For strand 4 &#x2013; tenure rights: A Chinese investor in the Mubende area in central Uganda was prevented from grabbing land for a so-called &#x2018;conservation&#x2019; project from the Nakonsonzi community. In 2012, the investor expropriated land from the communities using cruel and harsh methods, even including killing landowners and evicting others. Various Mubende district leadership bodies &#x2013; such as the local government&#x2019;s natural resource unit, the police, the District Local Chairman (IV), district councillors, the Local Council chairperson, and a Member of Parliament (MP) &#x2013; summoned the investor to engage in a dialogue with the community threatened by this land grab. This happened after an FGG partner had presented a draft report to the Mubende leadership based on a fact-finding mission in Nakosonzi community in December 2021, which had demonstrated human rights violations, illegal evictions, destruction of property and crops, illegal arrests, and detention of the community members and the forceful expropriation of land.   Following community dialogues, which confirmed the allegations and brought massive evidence of human rights violations and land grabs by the investor, the investor was summoned by the district Local Council and the MP for Mubende district to stop the evictions and to conduct an environmental impact assessment. In addition, in response to further demands by the authorities, the investor agreed to register all the tenants on the land and compensate them; second, to refrain from planting any new trees on the land prior to an environmental assessment; third, that in any further plans for lands to be sold, the Local Council Chairman should be involved in the process; and finally, the investor also agreed to collaborate on an assessment of the exact demarcations and squatters on the land. This matter became a national concern and was aired on nationwide television (NBS).  

For strand 6 &#x2013; rules for business and corporate conduct, cross-sectoral: the second evaluation of NCPs, carried out by OECD Watch (of which five of the eight FGG members are members), helped prompt 13 NCPs to improve their procedures or structures to better facilitate access to remedy and civil society input. Specifically: six NCPs redrafted their procedures, often improving language such as by clarifying their commitment to accepting plausible claims (18 in total) or their openness to accepting claims filed by civil society organisations (CSOs) rather than only directly affected people (20 in total); two more NCPs (17 in total now) have committed to follow up on existing agreements and recommendations; two more NCPs (38 in total) have published procedures in national languages and English; and three more NCPs (13 in total) now involve non-government stakeholders in the processing of complaints.  

For strand 7 &#x2013;rules for business and corporate conduct, extractives: In 2021, as a result of petitions, communiqu&#xE9;s and media campaigns by a group of FGG-supported Ugandan CSOs, the network of community champions, youth leaders and women&#x2019;s groups from the Albertine region they support, five fossil-fuel companies (Total Energies, CNOOC, Petroli&#xE8;res, PetroAfrik Energy, Niger Delta Petroleum Resources) that had shown interest in the second round of oil exploration in the biodiverse Albertine  Graben region licensing subsequently shied away, thereby halting the project.  

For strand 8 &#x2013; rules for business and corporate conduct, garment sector: After global pressure, the NBC Universal brand followed three other brands already producing goods in the Kanlayanee factory in Mae Sot, Thailand, and agreed to full compensation for 26 Burmese migrant workers who had been victims of wage theft. The workers received all the wages and severance legally owed to them, which amounted to more than 3.46 million Thai baht, approximately &#x20AC;96,000. For two years, these workers were illegally paid less than a dollar an hour, were forced to work unpaid overtime, and had their holiday pay withheld. When they spoke out to demand justice, the factory closed down; and when they demanded their legally owed wages, the workers were blacklisted. Throughout 2021, through the &#x2018;NBC Universal #PayUp&#x2019; campaign, the FGG Alliance campaigned against NBC Universal after the other three international brands that had previously been producing goods in the Kanlayanee factory, paid the workers&#x2019; dues. Simultaneously, FGG supported the workers via its Urgent Appeals system. All four brands that produced goods in the Kanlayanee factory agreed to pay their employees in full. That means that they paid these workers not only the severance pay due after losing their jobs, but also full compensation for the minimum wage violations inflicted on them.   

For strand 10 &#x2013; promoting inclusive governance systems: In 2021, in various ways FGG lobbied to safeguard the participation of civil society in UN decision-making processes and policy development. In July 2021, UNCTAD agreed to allow CSO participation in the events around UNCTAD 15 be determined by self-nomination procedures rather than selection by UNCTAD. This provides more room for CSOs to determine how to best make their voice heard at these events. This decision followed joint lobby and advocacy by the wider CSO network actively engaging with UNCTAD 15, with FGG support and facilitation.    

For strand 11 &#x2013; cross-cutting civic space: In Indonesia, FGG&#x2019;s urgent action grant for the COVID-19 response channelled through a partner CSO working in Apokayan, East Kalimantan was used to lobby at the district and national level to increase indigenous peoples&#x2019; access to COVID-19 vaccines. The partner negotiated with the National Human Rights Commission to convince the Ministry of Health to increase its allocation of vaccines to indigenous peoples. This resulted in the Ministry of Health increasing the amount of vaccines allocated to indigenous communities, not only in Apokayan but also in other remote areas like West Kalimantan, Maluku and Mentawai in Sumatra.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">In FGG&#x2019;s indicator framework, the indicator linked to SCS1 and SCS2 groups both policy and practice change together in the same indicator (i.e. per result area C, D, E, F # instances in which key actors adopt and/or implement). FGG policy/practice recommendations. However, in order to still be able to link to both the SCS1 and SCS2 indicator we collect disaggregated data on policy and practice change respectively. For SCS1 we measure instances in which key actors change their practices advancing fair and green value chains.   

In 2022, the FGG Alliance&#x2019;s work aims to contribute to 65 changes in practices for sustainable and inclusive development. This work takes place under the umbrella of four result areas, aimed at improved government policies (result area C), corporate regulation by governmental institutions (result area D), corporate conduct (result area E) and policy space and funding for transformative practices (result area F).  

Result Area C 
When it comes to governmental policies, the practice change FGG aims for is often focused on the implementation of international policies by national and local governments and both in the global North and South as well as by international organisations. FGG&#x2019;s plans for achieving practice changes regarding international land-related policy frameworks such as the Voluntary Guidelines on the Governance of Tenure (VGGTs) and Free Prior and Informed Consent (FPIC) are a good example of this. Various FGG members, including ActionAid, Both ENDS, Samdhana and TNI will engage in work aimed at the implementation of (elements of) the VGGTs and FPIC in national or international tenure policy frameworks. As a result of FGG lobby towards various governments, including Bangladesh, Guatemala, India, Indonesia, Kenya, Malaysia, the Philippines and Uganda, we expect amongst others Kenyan government bodies at various levels to implement FPIC and the VGGTs to expand civic space and protect human and women&#x2019;s rights, including in the review of the National Land Policy. In addition we expect (district) governments in Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines to recognise and implement elements of the VGGTs (e.g. by issuing ordinances), leading to increased protection of communal and individual land rights, especially those of indigenous peoples. Finally, we expect civil society recommendations on the integration of the VGGTs to be incorporated in the UNCCD policy advice to combat desertification.  

Result Area D 
For the practice changes of governments regulating private sector actors ensuring respect for human and environmental rights in public financial flows is one of the key focuses. For example, in 2022, FGG members aim to push export credit agencies (ECA), such as ADSB, to improve their practices to ensure that human rights, the climate and the environment are protected in the projects they finance. This means amongst others to actualise the Dutch government&#x2019;s commitment to stop all direct public finance for fossil fuel projects abroad by the end of 2022. Both ENDS and Milieudefensie/FoEI together with amongst others partners in Mozambique, Uganda, Togo, and Ghana will continue to advocate for the recommendations of these partners on stopping ECA support for fossil fuels to be heard and actually implemented in practice. In addition, in the Mozambique LNG project, we also aim for ADSB, the AfdB and the Dutch embassy to verify whether Total and Van Oord implement the OECD guidelines for multinational enterprises. On top of divestment from fossil fuels and solid human rights due diligence, we also expect our advocacy with partners towards ADSB to lead to the implementation of a communication protocol on how they involve local communities, including women and youth, in their decision making processes. We aim to achieve these changes in practice through connecting our partners, exchanging information, jointly strategising and advocating, e.g. by raising awareness about ECA supported fossil fuel projects in Mozambique through social media.    

Result Area E 
In FGG&#x2019;s indicator framework, practice change is not always necessarily preceded by policy change. One of the key practice changes that FGG aims for related to corporate conduct is obtaining remedy and/or other compensation for people and communities negatively affected by corporate misconduct, i.e. who have been subjected to rights violations by corporations. In 2022, FGG members including ActionAid, Both ENDS, and Clean Clothes Campaign will continue to pursue corporate accountability in grievance cases where the rights of people or communities have been violated by corporations, through complaint mechanisms, urgent appeal cases or strategic litigation. ActionAid and partners in Bangladesh, Guatemala, Kenya, and Uganda will continue to strengthen the capacities of communities affected by land grabs and displacement linked to large scale investments, to be able to understand land rights, and to be able to advocate for these rights to be respected and obtain remedy from corporations where injustice has been done. In cases where land rights have been violated, ActionAid and partners will provide legal aid and pursue Public Interest Litigation trajectories, amongst other things. ActionAid aims for mining and natural stones firms and other private actors in Kenya, Zimbabwe and Uganda, to improve their compensation for communities after land grabbing and respect the rights, including the right to freedom of expression, of (E)HRDs who challenge these land grabs. In addition, Both ENDS and partners will lobby for and expect to achieve stronger compliance, stricter sanctions and remedy by RSPO members through RSPO related grievance and conflict resolution mechanisms. Clean Clothes Campaign will engage in a number of Urgent Appeal cases, regarding wage theft, severance pay, factory closures, and freedom of association of garment workers. We expect brands and suppliers to provide remedy in 5 such cases. For example, in Myanmar, we aim for Myo Aye and/or other political prisoners to be released from prison through active lobby by CCC towards brands, the Dutch Embassy, and MSIs.   

Result Area F 
For the practice changes related to transformative practices, FGG measures the instances in which key actors have taken concrete steps showing that they have increased policy space and funding for transformative practices (i.e. systemic alternatives/FGG solutions). One of the changes in practice that we aim for in 2022 is increased policy space and funding for agroecology. Agroecology &#x2013; applying ecological principles to agricultural systems &#x2013; is one of the key alternatives that FGG (AA, BE, MD/FoEI, Samdhana, and TNI) promotes as a sustainable alternative to large scale industrial agriculture. We see this as a way to combat the pressing challenges to which industrial agriculture contributes, such as climate change, biodiversity loss and land degradation, the effects of which are mostly felt in the Global South. Agroecology promotion will be a key element of just agriculture &amp; food transitions, of a feminist economy and of climate justice. The agendas for inclusive land governance and transition towards inclusive and sustainable local food systems as well as climate resilience for communities and women are highly intertwined. Agroecology is an inherently feminist alternative as it explicitly relates to female autonomy and the construction of spaces of equal participation between men and women. While much of FGG&#x2019;s work on agroecology will be on the level of agenda setting, in some cases we already expect key actors to change their practices in 2022. We aim for 4 instances in which county governments in Kenya, change their practices by increasing funding and promoting resilience building initiatives such as agroecology.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">SCS 5, on the number of CSOs with increased lobbying and advocacy capacities, corresponds with FGG indicator 2, on the number of targeted civil society actors with strengthened capacities for lobbying and advocacy. In 2021, through the FGG programme, 591 civil society actors were able to strengthen their lobbying and advocacy capacities.  

Examples of such successful capacity development include: 
For strand 1 &#x2013; trade and investment agreements: By engaging in an FGG-led platform on the Energy Charter Treaty (ECT), aimed at knowledge exchange and joint strategising, CSOs in Bangladesh, Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda improved their understanding of the negative impacts of the ECT and its potential expansion throughout low- and middle-income countries worldwide. Through the platform, these CSOs were able to connect to CSOs from Africa, Asia, Latin America and Europe. With their support, for the first time, the CSOs from Bangladesh, Kenya and Uganda developed plans to start advocacy in their countries to raise awareness of the ECT among policy-makers and civil society actors. They consider this important, because the ECT and its expansion agenda were little known, although the treaty poses serious risks to these countries, including in terms of their ability to address among other things the negative impacts of energy-related infrastructural projects or to take climate-related action in the future.   

For strand 2 &#x2013; climate and environmental policy: Eleven CSOs from African, European, Asian and Latin American lower- and upper-middle-income countries (LMIC/UMICs) and two movement allies shared via a webinar and a workshop their critical analysis (including a deepened gender analysis) of, and developed positions for the food sovereignty movement on, nature-based solutions to climate change (NBS). FGG facilitated the webinar and workshop. Informed by their partners&#x2019; analysis, one FGG member later submitted a contribution on NBS to the UN Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (UNCESCR) consultation on the &apos;Draft general comment (No. 26) on Land and Economic, Social and Cultural Rights&apos;, raising awareness of the dangers of land sequestration for carbon capture. CSOs also used this document at the UNFCCC COP26 to raise concerns about NBS.  

For strand 3 &#x2013; public financial institutions: In early 2021, two CSOs in Liberia increased their awareness and enhanced their technical skills to file a complaint before the independent complaint mechanism of the EU Development Finance Institutions (DFIs). Since the start of the New Liberty Gold Project in Western Liberia, funded by FirstRand Bank (a financial intermediary of the Dutch bank, FMO), communities have faced forced relocation, pollution and police violence. Security risks, coupled with the weakness of Liberia&#x2019;s legal framework in protecting villagers&#x2019; rights from corporate abuses, led Liberian CSOs to seek international NGO assistance, including FGG, to investigate accountability opportunities across the project&#x2019;s supply chain.   

For strand 4 &#x2013; tenure rights: In West Kalimantan Indonesia, 20 indigenous women from four communities who are involved in land-rights cases with oil-palm plantations and the forestry sector attended training on women&#x2019;s leadership for human rights and environmental defence. This training helped strengthen their leadership capacity and their ability to advocate for women&#x2019;s issues in their own communities. The women&#x2019;s groups also received training on FPIC and human rights, in particular community- and gender-based human rights and environmental defence monitoring systems. These training sessions form the basis of advocacy efforts planned for the coming years.   

For strand 5 &#x2013; agroecology: In 2021, through FGG training, a Philippine indigenous people&#x2019;s group strengthened its organisational capacity by developing a five-year strategic plan, and promoted their traditional food systems and agroecology practices. By engaging in national dialogues to connect this group to other communities, government institutions, academics, and CSOs, the group enhanced its capacity to articulate their practices.   

For strand 6 &#x2013; rules for business and corporate conduct, cross-sectoral: Three Latin American CSOs strengthened their knowledge of legislation for corporate regulation and due diligence. Together with FGG members, they developed advocacy materials and organised a seminar on due diligence as a means to strengthen the capacity of other civil society actors.   

For strand 7 &#x2013; rules for business and corporate conduct, extractives: In September 2021, in West Kalimantan, Indonesia, four trans-migrant communities and indigenous peoples strengthened their skills in participatory mapping of their indigenous customary territories in order to defend them from land grabs by oil-palm plantations and mining companies.   

For strand 8 &#x2013; rules for business and corporate conduct, garment sector: Through extensive knowledge production, information exchange, and joint strategising, among other things, 75 partners from Bangladesh, India, Indonesia and the Philippines strengthened their knowledge about living wages, workers&#x2019; health and safety, freedom of association, and other issues relevant to garment workers. A concrete example of such capacity development concerns FGG&#x2019;s support to the formal launch of the Migrant Women Forum (MWF), a loose network that seeks to work specifically on the issues of women, gender, and migration, mainly in Asia and the Middle East. In the launch webinar, in which two FGG partners from the Philippines participated, the CSOs assessed how COVID-19 has been affecting women migrant workers, explored COVID-related developments in the Asia&#x2013;Middle East corridor, and identified support and services available to them.  

For strand 9 &#x2013; rules for business and corporate conduct, tech sector: 16 CSOs from LMIC/UMICs, including India, Indonesia and Philippines, participated in a two-day online institute on feminist perspectives on the digital economy and society, organised by FGG. The institute reached over 75 participants from civil society, the private sector, and academic institutions. By organising this institute, FGG provided conceptual and analytical inputs and in-depth capacity development on diverse topics such as the platform economy and macroeconomic shifts, voice and claims-making in a &#x2018;platformised&#x2019; society, and feminist agendas for policy in the digital economy and society.   

For strand 10 &#xAD; promoting inclusive governance systems: In Colombia, women community water leaders (including members of aqueduct boards and local administrative boards) discussed women&#x2019;s social and political participation in the community management of water in a series of four workshops, tours, and an inter-municipal meetings of municipal water managers. This process strengthened the capacity of women leaders and their links with other women leaders in community water management. The workshops and meetings took place in an area where women&#x2019;s right to social and political participation is often violated, particularly among rural women.   

For strand 11 - cross-cutting civic space: In 2021, two partners from Uganda strengthened their knowledge on shrinking civic space through organizing strategy meetings with FGG members and with Ugandan lawyers on state repression to strengthen their response towards shrinking civic space.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">In 2022, FGG will contribute to 444 CSOs in LLUMICs increasing their capacities to effectively lobby and advocate. For this indicator FGG counts all civil society actors, including CBOs, communities, and networks, with whom we engage in mutual capacity development (i.e. we our direct partners/and or country offices as well as the partners of our direct partners and/or country offices in LLUMICs). Mutual capacity development is the essence of FGG&#x2019;s way of working aimed at collaborating with partners to strengthening each others capacities needed to effectively lobby and advocate (incl. knowledge, constituency and network building, access to decision makers, advocacy skills, leveraging pressure points and ability to act freely and safely). It is a  process  in  which  all  civil  society  actors,  regardless  of  their country of origin, participate as equal partners. FGG partners and members  combine  their  complementary  roles  and  expertise  to achieve their joint goals.  

FGG has long been raising awareness around the impact of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). This massive Chinese Foreign Direct Investment initiative, has caused harmful environmental, social and economic impacts, according to social movements, affected communities and non-governmental organisations across the globe. In 2022, FGG will strengthening its lobby and advocacy capacities in relation to the BRI. FGG partners from LLUMICs and members will further develop our analysis of and knowledge on the role of Chinese investments under the BRI, in particular in relation to the energy transition. Based on this joint analysis, we will jointly develop our advocacy positions and strategies for our advocacy towards national governments in host countries of Chinese investments and the CBD for improved environmental governance in relation to BRI projects as well as the need for investment agreements to be subjected to the same standards and rules as trade agreements. We will also strategically and financially support our partners to increase their capacity to monitor the development of a special investment protection mechanisms that is expected to govern BRI investments.   

One of the key issues that has been central in the FGG programme is the promotion of fair and green trade and investment agreements. In 2022, FGG partners and members will continue to engage in mutual capacity development to strengthen our lobby and advocacy aimed at making current harmful trade and investment agreements fairer and greener. FGG partners and members will increase their knowledge and understanding of ISDS and other harmful clauses in trade and investment agreements, such as the EU FTAs with Indonesia, Tunisia, Mercosur, and Mexico respectively, under negotiation in 2022. We will also build a global movement around the interface between trade and climate and strengthen the knowledge and advocacy capacity of partners around what these FTAs should contain instead, such as sustainability chapters that protect human rights and the environment. Specific attention will go to EU-Mercosur, as Latin American countries are subjected to most ISDS lawsuits. FGG partners and members will work on strengthening the knowledge of the EU-Mercosur FTA, and ISDS mechanisms among CSOs, by monitoring and documenting existing and new cases in Latin America and augmentation for legal changes to prevent the implementation of ISDS. FGG members will support FGG partners in conducting research on impact of the EU-Mercosur agreement on climate, forests, food and human rights &#x2013; including specific gender related impacts.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">SCS 5, on the number of CSOs with increased lobbying and advocacy capacities, corresponds with FGG indicator 2, on the number of targeted civil society actors with strengthened capacities for lobbying and advocacy. In 2021, through the FGG programme, 591 civil society actors were able to strengthen their lobbying and advocacy capacities.  

Examples of such successful capacity development include: 
For strand 1 &#x2013; trade and investment agreements: By engaging in an FGG-led platform on the Energy Charter Treaty (ECT), aimed at knowledge exchange and joint strategising, CSOs in Bangladesh, Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda improved their understanding of the negative impacts of the ECT and its potential expansion throughout low- and middle-income countries worldwide. Through the platform, these CSOs were able to connect to CSOs from Africa, Asia, Latin America and Europe. With their support, for the first time, the CSOs from Bangladesh, Kenya and Uganda developed plans to start advocacy in their countries to raise awareness of the ECT among policy-makers and civil society actors. They consider this important, because the ECT and its expansion agenda were little known, although the treaty poses serious risks to these countries, including in terms of their ability to address among other things the negative impacts of energy-related infrastructural projects or to take climate-related action in the future.   

For strand 2 &#x2013; climate and environmental policy: Eleven CSOs from African, European, Asian and Latin American lower- and upper-middle-income countries (LMIC/UMICs) and two movement allies shared via a webinar and a workshop their critical analysis (including a deepened gender analysis) of, and developed positions for the food sovereignty movement on, nature-based solutions to climate change (NBS). FGG facilitated the webinar and workshop. Informed by their partners&#x2019; analysis, one FGG member later submitted a contribution on NBS to the UN Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (UNCESCR) consultation on the &apos;Draft general comment (No. 26) on Land and Economic, Social and Cultural Rights&apos;, raising awareness of the dangers of land sequestration for carbon capture. CSOs also used this document at the UNFCCC COP26 to raise concerns about NBS.  

For strand 3 &#x2013; public financial institutions: In early 2021, two CSOs in Liberia increased their awareness and enhanced their technical skills to file a complaint before the independent complaint mechanism of the EU Development Finance Institutions (DFIs). Since the start of the New Liberty Gold Project in Western Liberia, funded by FirstRand Bank (a financial intermediary of the Dutch bank, FMO), communities have faced forced relocation, pollution and police violence. Security risks, coupled with the weakness of Liberia&#x2019;s legal framework in protecting villagers&#x2019; rights from corporate abuses, led Liberian CSOs to seek international NGO assistance, including FGG, to investigate accountability opportunities across the project&#x2019;s supply chain.   

For strand 4 &#x2013; tenure rights: In West Kalimantan Indonesia, 20 indigenous women from four communities who are involved in land-rights cases with oil-palm plantations and the forestry sector attended training on women&#x2019;s leadership for human rights and environmental defence. This training helped strengthen their leadership capacity and their ability to advocate for women&#x2019;s issues in their own communities. The women&#x2019;s groups also received training on FPIC and human rights, in particular community- and gender-based human rights and environmental defence monitoring systems. These training sessions form the basis of advocacy efforts planned for the coming years.   

For strand 5 &#x2013; agroecology: In 2021, through FGG training, a Philippine indigenous people&#x2019;s group strengthened its organisational capacity by developing a five-year strategic plan, and promoted their traditional food systems and agroecology practices. By engaging in national dialogues to connect this group to other communities, government institutions, academics, and CSOs, the group enhanced its capacity to articulate their practices.   

For strand 6 &#x2013; rules for business and corporate conduct, cross-sectoral: Three Latin American CSOs strengthened their knowledge of legislation for corporate regulation and due diligence. Together with FGG members, they developed advocacy materials and organised a seminar on due diligence as a means to strengthen the capacity of other civil society actors.   

For strand 7 &#x2013; rules for business and corporate conduct, extractives: In September 2021, in West Kalimantan, Indonesia, four trans-migrant communities and indigenous peoples strengthened their skills in participatory mapping of their indigenous customary territories in order to defend them from land grabs by oil-palm plantations and mining companies.

In the launch webinar, in which two FGG partners from the Philippines participated, the CSOs assessed how COVID-19 has been affecting women migrant workers, explored COVID-related developments in the Asia&#x2013;Middle East corridor, and identified support and services available to them.

For strand 10 &#xAD; promoting inclusive governance systems: In Colombia, women community water leaders (including members of aqueduct boards and local administrative boards) discussed women&#x2019;s social and political participation in the community management of water in a series of four workshops, tours, and an inter-municipal meetings of municipal water managers. This process strengthened the capacity of women leaders and their links with other women leaders in community water management. The workshops and meetings took place in an area where women&#x2019;s right to social and political participation is often violated, particularly among rural women.   

For strand 11 - cross-cutting civic space: In 2021, two partners from Uganda strengthened their knowledge on shrinking civic space through organizing strategy meetings with FGG members and with Ugandan lawyers on state repression to strengthen their response towards shrinking civic space.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">For its ninth SCS indicator, the Ministry counts the number of actions in support of better NGO and/or labour/trade union legislation, policies, by-laws or codes of conduct that improve civil society space. FGG has a strong focus on civic space. Through FGG&#x2019;s 5x sub-indicator, FGG counts the number of key actors that support a recommendation that is primarily aimed at contributing to civic space. In 2021, 24 key actors supported such a civic space-focused FGG policy or practice recommendation.  

Examples of such key actors supporting a civic space-focused FGG policy or practice recommendation include:
For strand 1 &#x2013; trade and investment agreements: In July 2021, the UN Secretary-General presented the report of the UN Working Group on the issue of human rights and transnational corporations and other business enterprises on Human rights-compatible international investment agreements to the General Assembly. It includes various CSO demands and recommendations and highlights the importance of &#x2018;developing an investment policy from the bottom up with the meaningful participation of all stakeholders, including civil society organizations, women&#x2019;s organizations and trade unions&#x2019;. FGG actively contributed to this process including by participating in regional consultation meetings of the working group and by providing written submissions.   

For strand 2 &#x2013; climate and environmental policy: FGG, invited as an expert to the Dutch Advisory Committee on Bio-feedstock, was able to articulate concerns and recommendations regarding approval of bio-feedstock. FGG offered oral advice and textual input on addressing social, environmental and women&#x2019;s rights issues. The Committee adopted these contributions and incorporated them in its formal advice to the Ministry of Infrastructure and Water Management concerning the latter&#x2019;s framework of minimum criteria for bio-feedstock. Key FGG recommendations adopted by the Committee include ensuring respect for human rights &#x2013; women&#x2019;s rights in particular &#x2013; consultation with local stakeholders including civil society, and land rights as well as ecological and climate sustainability.   

For strand 3 &#x2013; public financial institutions: In May 2021, the Dutch development bank FMO expressed support for FGG recommendations to improve its disclosure practice, by inviting civil society actors to provide input to a new roadmap on disclosure to be developed, showing willingness to explore and take steps to increase transparency regarding investments and improving its own disclosure standards, after advocacy by FGG in the structural dialogue. Positive steps are that FMO has invited civil society to help in improving local disclosure practices, and that it is considering longer disclosure periods and publishing more extended project information.   

For strand 4 &#x2013; tenure rights: In Myanmar, after the coup, opposition forces established a new political structure: the National Unity Government (NUG). Myanmar CSOs actively lobbied the NUG on inclusive land and natural resources policies. These proposals were favourably received and are part of developments towards a federal constitution.  

For strand 5 &#x2013; agroecology: See the result elaborated on for strand 10.  

For strand 6 &#x2013; rules for business and corporate conduct, cross-sectoral: On 10 March 2021, the European Parliament passed a resolution with recommendations to the European Commission for legislation on corporate due diligence and corporate accountability. The resolution calls for a law to hold European multinationals accountable for their impact on human rights and the environment overseas. A specific element of this resolution, which directly touches upon civic space, is the call for better access to European courts for victims of corporate misconduct around the world. FGG has been actively campaigning for such legislation, including by bringing cases of affected communities to decision-makers and the public.  

For strand 7 &#x2013; rules for business and corporate conduct, extractives: The RSPO adopted a proposal to adopt an Outreach to Intermediary Organisations Programme in Honduras and Guatemala and seek a partnership with a Central American counterpart that is trusted by CSOs and communities. The outreach will specifically enhance the capacity of CSOs, community-based organisations (CBOs), unions and women&#x2019;s organisations to act safely and freely by addressing human rights violations in particular of (female) workers and communities living adjacent to (expanding) palm-oil plantations.   

For strand 8 &#x2013; rules for business and corporate conduct, garment sector: Global Organic Textile Standard (GOTS), an international standard-setting body, asked relevant associated certification bodies to respond to the findings of FGG&#x2019;s Tamil Nadu report. Investigations at the relevant sites took place, including unannounced audits. After the report&#x2019;s publication, GOTS contacted FGG to discuss the findings. The key issue that emerged during the meeting between GOTS and FGG was the need for GOTS to improve its policy and practice with regard to engaging with local civil society stakeholders. GOTS has since announced that it is working on improving its stakeholder engagement policy and practice.   

For strand 9 &#x2013; rules for business and corporate conduct, tech sector: The Special Rapporteur on the Right to Freedom of Speech and Expression for the General Assembly Report on Gender Justice cited FGG&#x2019;s submission (citation 112) in her Report, to argue that the rising tide of online gender-based violence, harassment, trolling, doxxing (revealing private information about an individual or organisation without their consent), and other harmful activities shows that social media platforms are not treating online gender-based violence with the urgency, seriousness, and resources it requires.    

For strand 10 &#x2013; promoting inclusive governance systems: During the UN General Assembly in March 2021, the UN Special Rapporteur on the Right to Food showed his support for and presented the position of the CSM (Civil Society and Indigenous Peoples&#x2019; Mechanism for relations with the CFS) on the undemocratic process and content of the UN Food Systems Summit (UNFSS), and the priority it gives to corporate interests rather than the rights and needs of civil society actors. The CSM, in which also FGG is involved and through which it actively advocates for policy support for agroecology, argued that &#x2018;The UNFSS is taking the place of the democratic multilateral system, including the CFS and the Rome Based Agencies for the governance of food yet without recognising their leading role, and without upholding the rights and responsibilities of States, the rights of peoples and instead giving a leading role to the corporate sector&#x2019;. Extensive FGG advocacy contributed to the outcome that at its 49th plenary session in October 2021 the Committee on World Food Security (CFS) did not agree to implement UNFSS outcomes. The FAO Council&apos;s 168th Session in November/December 2021 &#x2018;noted that the Summit did not have a negotiated outcome&#x2019; and did not welcome a follow-up to the process but stressed the need to maintain existing UN structures.   

For strand 11 &#x2013; cross-cutting civic space: Six Ugandan environmental and human rights defenders who were arrested in October 2021 have eventually been released without charges thanks to a call for action to mobilise international pressure promoted by FGG and French CSOs through the Internationalist Solidarity System of one of the FGG members. The petition for the release of the environmental and human rights defenders was signed by 208 organisations, including many FGG partners, and FGG partners sent letters to Ugandan embassies in Europe, Africa and Latin America.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">In 2022, FGG will contribute to 43 actions in support to better NGO and/or labour/trade union legislation, policies, by-laws and codes of conduct that improve civil society space. For SCS9, FGG counts the targets/results on its 5x indicator: # key actors who support and/or promote FGG policy/practice recommendations that aim to contribute to expanding/defending civic space.  

We observe that civic space has been shrinking for years, a development that has been worsened by the pandemic. Many governments prioritise the interests of private sector actors over human rights; and too often (violently) repress civil society actors and environmental and human rights defenders speaking out against environmental and human rights violations.   

In response to this injustice, FGG members and partners put considerable efforts into supporting (indigenous) EHRDs on the front lines, doing everything in their power to enable them to do their work safely. This work will continue in 2022, amongst others through the Internationalist Solidarity System. In urgent cases, FGG will provide legal, medical, psychological and relocation support via emergency funds, including Urgent Appeal funds and &#x2018;small-grants for urgent action&#x2019;. FGG members will show solidarity with frontline communities and labour activists on specific cases of corporate abuse and impunity. FGG partners and members will collectively raise awareness about the dangers faced by EHRDs and the need to defend the rights of these communities. Specific attention will be given to strengthening knowledge of digital security and the safety of women EHRDs. We will also give special attention to supporting indigenous peoples movements. We will support IPLCs defending their ancestral lands by organising paralegal trainings to enable them to read investment contracts and trainings on safety and security and we will help them to build a movement, e.g. by improving strategic communications, strengthening their communication infrastructure to increase connectivity between partners, and by facilitating linkages with law groups to increase IPLC&#x2019;s access to legal services. Where possible we will also provide support in addressing basic mental health and psychosocial support needs of both IPLCs and staff who are on the frontlines. By holding &#x2018;menoken&#x2019;, we will provide inclusive spaces for young IPLCs, persons with different abilities, young women, and other groups to nurture a next generation of IPLC leaders and rights defenders.   

Examples of support from key actors that we seek to defend or expand civic space include: 
- Government actors in Indonesia and Philippines recognise and uphold indigenous peoples rights, support spaces for dialogues, and allow for IPLCs to voice their issues and needs. 
- Policymakers from Kenya increase their support for the promotion of accountability and upholding of human rights principles by the state through the promotion of strengthened application of safeguards to protect human and women&#x2019;s rights defenders. This will allow (W)EHRDs and CSOs to be included in democratic decision-making platforms. 
- At FMO, as a result of the dialogues between FMO and CSOs first steps are taken towards a different theory of change, moving away from trickle down assumptions and investing in powers that be towards being more transparent, taking a role that addresses concerns of partners in cases, and integrating our concerns in policy reviews.  
- Government actors will support FGG recommendations on improving the Digital Markets Act, which we expect to contribute to defending civic space by reducing the control and influence of Big Tech platforms. 
- A policymaker from India will support our policy recommendation for the expansion of input spaces and mechanisms for civil society actors into governance spaces for the digital economy.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">For its ninth SCS indicator, the Ministry counts the number of actions in support of better NGO and/or labour/trade union legislation, policies, by-laws or codes of conduct that improve civil society space. FGG has a strong focus on civic space. Through FGG&#x2019;s 5x sub-indicator, FGG counts the number of key actors that support a recommendation that is primarily aimed at contributing to civic space. In 2021, 24 key actors supported such a civic space-focused FGG policy or practice recommendation.  

Examples of such key actors supporting a civic space-focused FGG policy or practice recommendation include:
For strand 1 &#x2013; trade and investment agreements: In July 2021, the UN Secretary-General presented the report of the UN Working Group on the issue of human rights and transnational corporations and other business enterprises on Human rights-compatible international investment agreements to the General Assembly. It includes various CSO demands and recommendations and highlights the importance of &#x2018;developing an investment policy from the bottom up with the meaningful participation of all stakeholders, including civil society organizations, women&#x2019;s organizations and trade unions&#x2019;. FGG actively contributed to this process including by participating in regional consultation meetings of the working group and by providing written submissions.   

For strand 2 &#x2013; climate and environmental policy: FGG, invited as an expert to the Dutch Advisory Committee on Bio-feedstock, was able to articulate concerns and recommendations regarding approval of bio-feedstock. FGG offered oral advice and textual input on addressing social, environmental and women&#x2019;s rights issues. The Committee adopted these contributions and incorporated them in its formal advice to the Ministry of Infrastructure and Water Management concerning the latter&#x2019;s framework of minimum criteria for bio-feedstock. Key FGG recommendations adopted by the Committee include ensuring respect for human rights &#x2013; women&#x2019;s rights in particular &#x2013; consultation with local stakeholders including civil society, and land rights as well as ecological and climate sustainability.   

For strand 3 &#x2013; public financial institutions: In May 2021, the Dutch development bank FMO expressed support for FGG recommendations to improve its disclosure practice, by inviting civil society actors to provide input to a new roadmap on disclosure to be developed, showing willingness to explore and take steps to increase transparency regarding investments and improving its own disclosure standards, after advocacy by FGG in the structural dialogue. Positive steps are that FMO has invited civil society to help in improving local disclosure practices, and that it is considering longer disclosure periods and publishing more extended project information.   

For strand 4 &#x2013; tenure rights: In Myanmar, after the coup, opposition forces established a new political structure: the National Unity Government (NUG). Myanmar CSOs actively lobbied the NUG on inclusive land and natural resources policies. These proposals were favourably received and are part of developments towards a federal constitution.  

For strand 5 &#x2013; agroecology: See the result elaborated on for strand 10.  

For strand 6 &#x2013; rules for business and corporate conduct, cross-sectoral: On 10 March 2021, the European Parliament passed a resolution with recommendations to the European Commission for legislation on corporate due diligence and corporate accountability. The resolution calls for a law to hold European multinationals accountable for their impact on human rights and the environment overseas. A specific element of this resolution, which directly touches upon civic space, is the call for better access to European courts for victims of corporate misconduct around the world. FGG has been actively campaigning for such legislation, including by bringing cases of affected communities to decision-makers and the public.  

For strand 7 &#x2013; rules for business and corporate conduct, extractives: The RSPO adopted a proposal to adopt an Outreach to Intermediary Organisations Programme in Honduras and Guatemala and seek a partnership with a Central American counterpart that is trusted by CSOs and communities. The outreach will specifically enhance the capacity of CSOs, community-based organisations (CBOs), unions and women&#x2019;s organisations to act safely and freely by addressing human rights violations in particular of (female) workers and communities living adjacent to (expanding) palm-oil plantations.   

For strand 8 &#x2013; rules for business and corporate conduct, garment sector: Global Organic Textile Standard (GOTS), an international standard-setting body, asked relevant associated certification bodies to respond to the findings of FGG&#x2019;s Tamil Nadu report. Investigations at the relevant sites took place, including unannounced audits. After the report&#x2019;s publication, GOTS contacted FGG to discuss the findings. The key issue that emerged during the meeting between GOTS and FGG was the need for GOTS to improve its policy and practice with regard to engaging with local civil society stakeholders. GOTS has since announced that it is working on improving its stakeholder engagement policy and practice.   

For strand 9 &#x2013; rules for business and corporate conduct, tech sector: The Special Rapporteur on the Right to Freedom of Speech and Expression for the General Assembly Report on Gender Justice cited FGG&#x2019;s submission (citation 112) in her Report, to argue that the rising tide of online gender-based violence, harassment, trolling, doxxing (revealing private information about an individual or organisation without their consent), and other harmful activities shows that social media platforms are not treating online gender-based violence with the urgency, seriousness, and resources it requires.    

For strand 10 &#x2013; promoting inclusive governance systems: During the UN General Assembly in March 2021, the UN Special Rapporteur on the Right to Food showed his support for and presented the position of the CSM (Civil Society and Indigenous Peoples&#x2019; Mechanism for relations with the CFS) on the undemocratic process and content of the UN Food Systems Summit (UNFSS), and the priority it gives to corporate interests rather than the rights and needs of civil society actors. The CSM, in which also FGG is involved and through which it actively advocates for policy support for agroecology, argued that &#x2018;The UNFSS is taking the place of the democratic multilateral system, including the CFS and the Rome Based Agencies for the governance of food yet without recognising their leading role, and without upholding the rights and responsibilities of States, the rights of peoples and instead giving a leading role to the corporate sector&#x2019;. Extensive FGG advocacy contributed to the outcome that at its 49th plenary session in October 2021 the Committee on World Food Security (CFS) did not agree to implement UNFSS outcomes. The FAO Council&apos;s 168th Session in November/December 2021 &#x2018;noted that the Summit did not have a negotiated outcome&#x2019; and did not welcome a follow-up to the process but stressed the need to maintain existing UN structures.   

For strand 11 &#x2013; cross-cutting civic space: Six Ugandan environmental and human rights defenders who were arrested in October 2021 have eventually been released without charges thanks to a call for action to mobilise international pressure promoted by FGG and French CSOs through the Internationalist Solidarity System of one of the FGG members. The petition for the release of the environmental and human rights defenders was signed by 208 organisations, including many FGG partners, and FGG partners sent letters to Ugandan embassies in Europe, Africa and Latin America.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">In 2022, FGG will contribute to 43 actions in support to better NGO and/or labour/trade union legislation, policies, by-laws and codes of conduct that improve civil society space. For SCS9, FGG counts the targets/results on its 5x indicator: # key actors who support and/or promote FGG policy/practice recommendations that aim to contribute to expanding/defending civic space.  

We observe that civic space has been shrinking for years, a development that has been worsened by the pandemic. Many governments prioritise the interests of private sector actors over human rights; and too often (violently) repress civil society actors and environmental and human rights defenders speaking out against environmental and human rights violations.   

In response to this injustice, FGG members and partners put considerable efforts into supporting (indigenous) EHRDs on the front lines, doing everything in their power to enable them to do their work safely. This work will continue in 2022, amongst others through the Internationalist Solidarity System. In urgent cases, FGG will provide legal, medical, psychological and relocation support via emergency funds, including Urgent Appeal funds and &#x2018;small-grants for urgent action&#x2019;. FGG members will show solidarity with frontline communities and labour activists on specific cases of corporate abuse and impunity. FGG partners and members will collectively raise awareness about the dangers faced by EHRDs and the need to defend the rights of these communities. Specific attention will be given to strengthening knowledge of digital security and the safety of women EHRDs. We will also give special attention to supporting indigenous peoples movements. We will support IPLCs defending their ancestral lands by organising paralegal trainings to enable them to read investment contracts and trainings on safety and security and we will help them to build a movement, e.g. by improving strategic communications, strengthening their communication infrastructure to increase connectivity between partners, and by facilitating linkages with law groups to increase IPLC&#x2019;s access to legal services. Where possible we will also provide support in addressing basic mental health and psychosocial support needs of both IPLCs and staff who are on the frontlines. By holding &#x2018;menoken&#x2019;, we will provide inclusive spaces for young IPLCs, persons with different abilities, young women, and other groups to nurture a next generation of IPLC leaders and rights defenders.   

Examples of support from key actors that we seek to defend or expand civic space include: 
- Government actors in Indonesia and Philippines recognise and uphold indigenous peoples rights, support spaces for dialogues, and allow for IPLCs to voice their issues and needs. 
- Policymakers from Kenya increase their support for the promotion of accountability and upholding of human rights principles by the state through the promotion of strengthened application of safeguards to protect human and women&#x2019;s rights defenders. This will allow (W)EHRDs and CSOs to be included in democratic decision-making platforms. 
- At FMO, as a result of the dialogues between FMO and CSOs first steps are taken towards a different theory of change, moving away from trickle down assumptions and investing in powers that be towards being more transparent, taking a role that addresses concerns of partners in cases, and integrating our concerns in policy reviews.  
- Government actors will support FGG recommendations on improving the Digital Markets Act, which we expect to contribute to defending civic space by reducing the control and influence of Big Tech platforms. 
- A policymaker from India will support our policy recommendation for the expansion of input spaces and mechanisms for civil society actors into governance spaces for the digital economy.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">For SCS 4, the Ministry counts the number of advocacy initiatives carried out by CSOs, for, by or with their membership/constituency. FGG&#x2019;s third indicator largely corresponds to this indicator: FGG counts the number of civil society actors that have engaged in lobbying and advocacy work, using their strengthened capacities. As such, FGG&#x2019;s indicator is stricter, counting CSOs that have carried out at least one and possibly many advocacy initiatives, and only if they have used strengthened capacities, i.e. not just any CSO engaging in lobby and advocacy. In 2021, in the FGG programme, 274 civil society actors have engaged in lobbying and advocacy work, based on capacities strengthened through the FGG programme.  

Examples of such advocacy initiatives include: 
For strand 1 &#x2013; trade and investment agreements:  Two CSOs in Tunisia and Indonesia deepened their understanding and analysis of the digital trade chapters in their respective country&#x2019;s proposed FTAs with the EU and incorporated this in their advocacy against the FTAs. FGG supported their analysis with technical expertise.  

For strand 2 &#x2013; climate and environmental policy: After joint strategising and knowledge exchange within FGG, a Kenyan CSO network in Kitui was able to open discussions with the County Government. The network requested the implementation of the County Climate Fund, which the County Government agreed to do. The government also agreed to decentralise the fund, and initiated pilots in six local wards. Finally, after the discussion with the FGG-supported CSO network, the government agreed to develop a Climate Change policy, and asked FGG partners to take a lead role in drafting a County Climate Change Policy to help them better manage climate justice interventions. This is particularly important because Kitui is among the areas in Kenya most affected by climate change and has been dealing with droughts and famine over the past two years. This has affected poor communities in particular, as well as families dependent on livestock-raising and subsistence farming.  

For strand 3 &#x2013; public financial institutions: In 2021, FGG continued to raise awareness about the Sendou project in Senegal, co-funded by FMO and the African Development Bank (AfDB). The Sendou coal power station is located right next to the fishing village of Bargny. The project has caused water pollution and a loss of income for the more than 1,000 women who live off the drying and packaging of fish. Three partners from Senegal used their strengthened knowledge of networking and access to decision-making spaces to meet with MPs, and to organise outreach activities to urge FMO and the AfDB to remediate the harm done. In doing so they paid specific attention to gender justice by including sex-disaggregated impact studies. As a result of the awareness-raising efforts in 2021 a Senegalese MP visited the Sendou project, showing a specific interest in the impacts of the project on women.   

For strand 4 &#x2013; tenure rights: The Swedish Ambassador for Oceans, executive director of the Blue Action Fund, and officials from SwedBio (a branch of SIDA which provides funding on oceans and fisheries) discussed the impacts of ocean grabbing, ocean economy and Marine Protected Areas (MPA) with small-scale fishers&#x2019; organisations. It was the first time these officials had discussed these issues with these organisations. As a result of the meeting, those involved became aware of FGG&#x2019;s lobbying efforts on the Blue Action Fund, and of small-scale fishers&#x2019; concerns about MPAs and other policy initiatives supported by the Fund.   

For strand 5 &#x2013; agroecology: Bangladeshi farmers&#x2019; groups (including young and marginalised farmers and women-only groups) strengthened their lobbying and advocacy capacity through workshops. More specifically, these workshops taught these groups about engaging in dialogues and negotiating with local government officials to support agroecological practices via government policies, regulations, and funding mechanisms. Women and young people received additional training to further develop and strengthen their lobbying and advocacy messages to address their specific needs and realities, in order to promote solutions that take account of gender and intergenerational inequalities. As a result of the capacity-strengthening, representatives from local farmers&#x2019; groups and Paani Committees were able to engage in quarterly meetings with local government authorities to build and maintain a constructive dialogue, in order to attract government support for agroecology.   

For strand 6 &#x2013; rules for business and corporate conduct, cross-sectoral: Two FGG partners lobbied the Guatemalan delegation in Geneva and were invited for a meeting after they shared their gendered recommendations to improve the text of the UN Binding Treaty and to integrate women&#x2019;s and indigenous rights. This advocacy was a result of joint strategy meetings, together with other Guatemalan CSOs, which improved their knowledge of the draft text of the Binding Treaty and how this should be improved. Together they drafted gendered recommendations, which they subsequently used in their lobbying and advocacy.   

For strand 7 &#x2013; rules for business and corporate conduct, extractives: Five Colombian and international trade unions strengthened their research, lobbying and advocacy capacities through developing the report &#x2018;Responsible disengagement from coal as part of a just transition&#x2019;; and one FGG member gained greater knowledge and a better understanding through its collaboration with these unions. This contributed to the robustness of the report, which helped the unions in their advocacy concerning coal-mining companies and to put pressure on them to take responsibility for their workers. The report also takes account of gender issues and calls for deeper analysis of the implications of mine closure on women and indigenous peoples.  

For strand 8 &#x2013; rules for business and corporate conduct, garment sector: Throughout 2021, FGG members provided access to and analysis of data on supply chains. This information helped several partners to identify brands and retailers buying from factories where violations of labour rights had been detected. As a result, these partners were able to highlight the relevant brands and retailers in Urgent Appeal cases.  

For strand 9 &#x2013; rules for business and corporate conduct, tech sector: With expert support and inputs from FGG, the Alliance for Sustainable and Holistic Agriculture (ASHA) developed a response in June 2021 to the Government of India&apos;s Ministry of Agriculture, Cooperation and Farmer Welfare on their Consultation Paper on India Digital System of Agriculture.   

For strand 10 &#x2013; promoting inclusive governance systems: Together with FGG and other partners, an East African regional organisation, a Ugandan CSO, and a global network of public services unions with members in various countries, developed and published a Global Public Services Manifesto. Gender equality is integral to the analysis throughout the manifesto. Gender equality in the leadership, management, delivery and financing of gender-transformative public services is a central feature of the manifesto. These organisations are using the manifesto in their campaigns and lobbying of their local governments to prevent the privatisation of public services.   
For strand 11 &#x2013; cross-cutting civic space: Owing to the COVID-19 pandemic, many discussions and decision-making spaces have now moved to online platforms. To ensure they are able to participate in these discussions and processes, three groups of indigenous peoples and local communities in the Philippines strengthened their capacity to communicate more effectively using digital tools and the internet. With ready access to the internet and other methods of communication, indigenous communities are now able to provide more timely responses to and correspondence with local and national government agencies, especially on issues of land grabbing and government projects that did not go through the FPIC process. They were also able to prepare a resolution which they sent to the national government requesting clarification of information circulating about the impending regulations on vaccination specifically aimed at them, and could restrict their rights.</narrative>

For strand 10 &#x2013; promoting inclusive governance systems: Together with FGG and other partners, an East African regional organisation, a Ugandan CSO, and a global network of public services unions with members in various countries, developed and published a Global Public Services Manifesto. Gender equality is integral to the analysis throughout the manifesto. Gender equality in the leadership, management, delivery and financing of gender-transformative public services is a central feature of the manifesto. These organisations are using the manifesto in their campaigns and lobbying of their local governments to prevent the privatisation of public services.   
For strand 11 &#x2013; cross-cutting civic space: Owing to the COVID-19 pandemic, many discussions and decision-making spaces have now moved to online platforms. To ensure they are able to participate in these discussions and processes, three groups of indigenous peoples and local communities in the Philippines strengthened their capacity to communicate more effectively using digital tools and the internet. With ready access to the internet and other methods of communication, indigenous communities are now able to provide more timely responses to and correspondence with local and national government agencies, especially on issues of land grabbing and government projects that did not go through the FPIC process. They were also able to prepare a resolution which they sent to the national government requesting clarification of information circulating about the impending regulations on vaccination specifically aimed at them, and could restrict their rights.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">Through its SCS indicator 2, the Ministry considers the number of laws and policies that are blocked, adopted, or improved as a result of CSO engagement. FGG counts these through its &#x2018;6SCS2&#x2019; indicator, for which it considers the &#x2018;policy change part&#x2019; of its generic indicator 6, in which policy and practice change results are combined. More specifically, FGG considers the number of laws, policies and norms/attitudes, blocked, adopted, improved for sustainable and inclusive development. In 2021, FGG contributed to 43 changes in policy.

Examples of such successful policy change include:
For strand 1 &#x2013; trade and investment agreements: The government of an Asian upper-middle-income country (UMIC) imposed conditions allowing only imports of clean and homogeneous plastic waste in order to ensure that all imported plastic is recyclable and not hazardous, as a result of years of FGG advocacy for more regulation to stop the trade in dirty plastic waste. 

For strand 2 &#x2013; climate and environmental policy: The Ugandan Ministry of Water and Environment incorporated comments from Ugandan CSOs, supported by FGG, into the final country&#x2019;s climate change adaption plan and Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) to climate change. It adopted a clear roadmap for phasing out fossil fuels and recommitted to promoting clean energy in Uganda, such as solar and wind.

For strand 3 &#x2013; public financial institutions: The Asian Development Bank&#x2019;s new policy adopted in October 2021 rules out any finance for coal projects. FGG members and Asian partners have for many years been campaigning against investments in coal projects. 

For strand 4 &#x2013; tenure rights:  The National Government in South Africa approved a new National Freshwater (Inland) Wild Capture Fisheries&#x2019; Policy. The policy represents an important tool for small-scale fishers to defend their rights, and provides recognition for informal fishers who currently face harassment and criminalisation. It is the first time a fisheries policy has defined any kinds of fishing rights for informal subsistence fishers (previously they issued only recreational licenses), so this was a first recognition of the inland subsistence fisheries sector. Small-scale fishers engaged in many advocacy efforts aiming to shape the policy and push for its adoption, which strengthened the alliances between fishers and environmental groups and their relationship with the Ministry of Environment, Forestry and Fisheries; the Fisheries Department, and FAO representatives who participated in meetings. FGG partners participated in the process of developing the policy. Allied organisations participated in meetings and workshops, strengthening and consolidating advocacy for human rights-based fisheries policies, including the Inland Fisheries Policy. Analysis co-developed with FGG was used in the advocacy process.

For strand 6 &#x2013; rules for business and corporate conduct, cross-sectoral: The Ministry of Gender, Labour and Social Development, together with the Uganda Human Rights Commission, approved and launched the first National Action Plan on Business and Human Rights. This s is an important five-year plan designed to protect citizens against investors&#x2019; increasing abuse of human rights. FGG contributed to this process through the Uganda Consortium on Corporate Accountability (UCCA), a platform bringing together several CSOs that jointly advocated for the plan&#x2019;s development. An FGG partner took part in various strategising and advocacy sessions organised by the Consortium, both within civil society and with the Ministry.

For strand 7 &#x2013; rules for business and corporate conduct, extractives: Three Dutch investors (pension funds) announced in 2021 that they disinvested from fossil fuel producers. In the framework of the Eerlijke Geldwijzer (EGW), in September and October 2021 FGG coordinated the publication of two studies on the energy portfolios of investors, &apos;Climate change commitments of financial institutions active in the Netherlands&apos; and &apos;Fossil fuel versus renewable financing by financial institutions active in the Netherlands&apos;, revealing that at the end of 2020,  88% or 34 billion euros of investment by Dutch banks, insurance companies and pension funds in the energy sector were still in fossil fuels. The studies include an update of EGW&apos;s energy investment studies from 2010, 2015 and 2018. One FGG member is involved in the EGW to improve the investment policies of the financial sector in line with the demands from partners around the world. FGG advocates at the Dutch and EU government levels lobbying for the legal obligation for financial institutions to report on their climate impact, and to align their portfolios with the Paris Climate Agreement 1.5&#xB0;C goal. 

For strand 8 &#x2013; rules for business and corporate conduct, garment sector: After intense lobby and advocacy efforts by a broad alliance of CSOs, including FGG, a new International Accord for Health and Safety in the Textile and Garment Industry was finally announced on the 25 August 2021. This Accord was a continuation of the unique Bangladesh Accord, which expired in August 2021. On 1 September the new Accord took effect, with 77 signatories. By the end of the year, this had increased to 155. An important feature of the new Accord is that it is international and will be expanded to at least one other country in the next two years. In the months leading up to this development FGG undertook various campaigning activities aimed at harnessing public and political support for a new Accord, including contributing to a report by the Accord witness signatories; intensively engaging with the Dutch signatories and other relevant stakeholders such as MSIs, academics and investors, before the deadline for extension of the Accord; profiling 12 brands on outstanding issues, while stressing the need to continue Accord&#x2019;s work; and (social) media work resulting in news items (radio, television and the press). To gain political support FGG engaged with policy-makers at the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Embassy in Bangladesh and several Dutch politicians. In response to parliamentary questions, the Dutch Minister for Foreign Trade and Development Cooperation, Sigrid Kaag, underlined the importance of the components of the Accord that have been key to its success (legally binding nature, accountability of brands) and also stressed the importance of using the lessons learned in other producing countries, which was a strong signal to brands to reach a renewed agreement with the unions. FGG was also part of a network that engaged with Members of the European Parliament (MEPs), harnessing their support for a new Accord. This resulted in a cross-party group of European legislators to offer public support for efforts to extend and expand the Bangladesh Accord: in a joint letter to garment brands, 62 MEPs highlighted that &#x2018;now is not the time to back away from the great work you and trade unions did together&#x2019;. 

For strand 9 &#x2013; rules for business and corporate conduct, tech sector: Meta (formerly Facebook) made a U-turn on a critical change to its data privacy policy regarding WhatsApp, which in effect would have given Facebook unparalleled control over users&#x2019; data and compromised the privacy of millions who use the app. FGG was part of a global campaign, Save WhatsApp, which worked with civil society and raised public awareness on the issue.

For strand 10 &#x2013; promoting inclusive governance systems: In 2021, the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs launched the &#x2018;Reversing the Flow&#x2019; programme, focused on increasing communities&#x2019; water security and resilience, supporting them to adapt to climate change. Key to this programme is the fact that it is led by local communities, a feature that was strongly informed by FGG recommendations on the programme structure and goals: FGG advocacy for more inclusive programming and small grants funding to grassroots organisations contributed to a programme that supports local CSOs to shift power to grassroots organisations within the context of landscape management, and focuses on the accessibility of Dutch funding for grassroots organisations. 

For strand 11 &#x2013; cross-cutting civic space: FGG lobbied the RSPO Board to ensure independence of the RSPO Complaints Panel. The RSPO Board adopted our proposal to reposition the RSPO Complaints Desk, which now no longer resides under the Assurance Department but is under the CEO&#x2019;s direct line managed. This will help guarantee a strict division of tasks within the RSPO, whereby the Complaints Desk and the Secretariat units responsible for the domain of certification are separated &#x2013; thereby also creating more guarantees for the confidentiality of whistle-blowers and (women) environmental and human rights defenders.</narrative>

      <comment>
       <narrative xml:lang="EN">For SCS3, the Ministry counts instances in which CSOs have set the agenda, influenced the debate and/or created space to engage. FGG uses two indicators that each cover part of this indicator and move slightly beyond: for FGG indicator 4, FGG counts the number of key actors who put FGG recommendations on their agendas, e.g. by proactively organising meetings, initiating debates, and covering these recommendations in media; for FGG indicator 5, FGG counts the number of key actors who support and/or promote FGG&#x2019;s recommendations. Both indicators require key actors to have adopted a proactive attitude in order to be counted; while indicator 4 shows actors&#x2019; willingness to discuss a particular recommendation, indicator 5 shows their actual support for it. In 2021, 183 key actors put FGG recommendations on their agendas and 176 supported or promoted them, totalling a count of 360 on SCS3.  

Examples of such successful agenda-setting and generating support include: 
For strand 1 &#x2013; trade and investment agreements: In a Just Transition, Bilateral Investment Treaties (BITs) and the Energy Charter Treaty (ECT) would not hamper governments&#x2019; ability to regulate in the public interest. Unfortunately, most BITs and the ECT contain an Investor-to-State Dispute Settlement (ISDS) mechanism that do just that: they grant investors the right to sue governments that make policies that have a negative effect on the interests of foreign investors. In 2021 several East African FGG partners and FGG members mutually strengthened their knowledge on BITs and on the ECT, strategised together and jointly advocated against harmful (ISDS) clauses in several East African BITs and against their countries accessing the ECT. FGG partners from Tanzania and Uganda organised a virtual workshop to strengthen their knowledge on harmful clauses included in BITs. Partners then used their strengthened knowledge to lobby and advocate for stopping and/or renegotiating current BITs. In Tanzania, FGG partners shared recommendations on BITs that are about to expire with trade policy advisors to the Tanzanian President. In December 2021 these advisors committed to reviewing current BITs signed by Tanzania, to assess whether they need to be stopped or renegotiated. Partners from Tanzania and Uganda organised a workshop and advised policy-makers in Burundi to stop current BITs with harmful ISDS clauses. During the workshop the policy-makers from Burundi made a commitment to review all current BITs for the possibility of ceasing or renegotiating the treaties. In Tanzania partners also held several meetings with the Ministry of Energy on the potential risks to the energy transition of entering the ECT.   At the European level, FGG members&#x2019; advocacy on the role of the ECT in blocking a Just Energy Transition led to an ECT modernization process at the level of EU member states and the ECT secretariat during 2021, of which the result will be published in June 2022.  

For strand 2 &#x2013; climate and environmental policy: Two government parties (from Bolivia and Chile) expressed their support for six different text recommendations that FGG and the CBD Alliance put forward at the third meeting on the Convention on Biological Diversity&#x2019;s (CBD) Open-ended Working Group on the Post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework. The recommendations were aimed at improving the framework with respect to agriculture, agricultural ecosystems, agricultural biodiversity and soil health needs, the vital importance of IPLC&apos;s rights and tenure systems as well as the need to end perverse incentives and subsidies for industrial agriculture that facilitate the direct and indirect causes of biodiversity loss including soils. Furthermore, the CBD Alliance, in which FGG is active, recommended the establishment of &#x2018;[government] regulations for all businesses, trade and investment, prohibiting impacts that pass the limits of planetary boundaries, or affect ecosystem functions and human health or abuse human rights, ensuring full transparency of business impacts, addressing conflicts of interest, ensuring liability and redress, and penalising infractions and the provision of false information about ecological and human rights impacts or the benefits of products&#x2019;.  

For strand 3 &#x2013; public financial institutions: During the 2021 UN Conference of the Parties (COP) in Glasgow, the Dutch government committed to stopping all fossil-fuel subsidies before the end of 2022, including those channelled through Export Credit Agencies. The FGG Alliance has been advocating for this for years, and intensified its work in 2021 in preparation for the COP, through an integral campaign building upon the momentum on climate change. Notably, the contribution of FGG and its partner Oil Change International to the eventual success of the Netherlands committing to the &#x2018;Glasgow Statement&#x2019; was recognised by media and politicians.  

For strand 4 &#x2013; tenure rights: In 2021, FGG partners managed to bring their work to the attention of various government officials and convinced them to express their support for indigenous peoples&#x2019; land rights. A farmers&#x2019; union in Mukomuko Regency in Bengkulu, Indonesia developed their land-parcel maps and land-management plan, and prepared a policy brief on the Land Redistribution of Agrarian Reform Objects, as evidence to support their efforts to reclaim their cultivated land through the country&#x2019;s agrarian reform programme. The farmers submitted these documents to the Ministry of Agrarian Affairs and Spatial Planning/National Land Agency. The Governor of Bengkulu issued a letter to the Regent of Mukomuko recommending to immediately establish an Agrarian Reform Task Force in Mukomuko district; and to immediately resolve the land-use rights conflict of between the farmers and a palm-oil company.  

For strand 5 &#x2013; agroecology: The UN Special Envoy to the UNFSS Agnes Kalibata called for wider support for agroecology and small-scale farmers, and greater recognition of indigenous knowledge. This represented a significant shift in her rhetoric/discourse between her pre-summit and summit communications. The legitimacy of the Summit was severely undermined by civil society mobilisations throughout 2021, with media attention documenting criticisms and concerns. Outrage regarding the summit and how it was organised energised a counter movement in which FGG members and partners were actively involved, including a boycott of the official summit and a counter-summit held in July before the pre-summit; meetings with the UN Special Rapporteur on the Right to Food and a subsequent strong statement from them; statements; strategy meetings; a critical letter from academics; withdrawal of support by the expert body IPES-Food; discussion with the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs about the summit; op-eds and articles in the mainstream media including outlets NRC and The Guardian.  

For strand 6 &#x2013; rules for business and corporate conduct, cross-sectoral: The new Dutch government&#x2019;s coalition agreement includes the commitment to develop national due diligence legislation, after the previous Minister for Foreign Trade and Development Cooperation published progressive building blocks for such legislation, and the Minister committed to developing such legislation at the national level. The FGG Alliance contributed to this result, which has yet to materialise, through extensive campaigning and lobbying with MVO Platform (in which five of the eight FGG members are active) and other CSOs, generating public pressure and organising a petition which was handed over to Parliament with more than 40,000 signatures.  

For strand 7 &#x2013; rules for business and corporate conduct, extractives: FGG worked with Peruvian indigenous leaders to convince the Dutch National Contact Point for the OECD Guidelines to investigate the complaint against PlusPetrol, a multinational oil company headquartered in Amsterdam via a mailbox company. Jointly they put together a solid complaint, supported by strong evidence, making use of FGG&#x2019;s knowledge about what elements the NCPs are supposed to consider in deciding on admissibility. Through a strategic campaign, including a video, media engagement and a visit by the indigenous leaders to the Netherlands to present their case and speak to Dutch legislators, FGG managed to convince the NCP to investigate the complaint. This decision gives indigenous communities in the oil fields in the Peruvian Amazon a means to seek remediation from PlusPetrol for the tainted soil and waterways that have harmed the communities&#x2019; health and way of life. For the first time, the Dutch NCP has declared admissible a complaint that not only addresses the behaviour of multinationals with regard to the environment and human rights, but also using the Dutch system for avoiding taxes.  

For strand 8 &#x2013; rules for business and corporate conduct, garment sector: Over the year, FGG campaigned heavily for the establishment of a binding agreement with protections for workers&#x2019; right to organise and bargain collectively, that will fill the wage gap experienced by millions of workers during the pandemic, and create a Severance Guarantee Fund to ensure that garment workers receive their legally mandated severance. In March, FGG launched its #PayYourWorkers and #RespectLabourRights coalition and website with a week of global action. By the end of the year, more than 250 CSOs had endorsed the campaign worldwide, three brands and one bank (ASN) explicitly supported the campaign, and over a dozen brands committed to ensuring their workers are paid in full during the pandemic.  

For strand 9 &#x2013; rules for business and corporate conduct, tech sector: In October 2021, the State Government of Karnataka, in southern India, announced the State Open Data Policy framework without any public consultation. FGG, with other CSOs, raised concerns about the policy in an op-ed piece &#x2013; the lack of public consultation on the framework and the issue of anonymisation providing an insufficient safeguard for citizens&#x2019; privacy in data-sharing arrangements. The State Government of Karnataka agreed to revisit its Open Data Policy framework in November 2021. FGG&#x2019;s op-ed1 was cited by the state&#x2019;s Additional Chief Secretary e-Governance to allay civil society concerns about Big Tech capture of public datasets.  

For strand 10 &#x2013; promoting inclusive governance systems: In 2021, the Dutch government&#x2019;s task force, which leads the organisation of the UN Water Conference in 2023, formally consulted Both ENDS on three occasions, enabling Both ENDS to share recommendations on how to organise the process and the conference itself in an inclusive manner and to ensure the meaningful participation of civil society, particularly women and young people.  

For strand 11 &#x2013; cross-cutting civic space: In 2021, five MPs in Uganda committed to voting for the passage of the Human Rights Defenders Bill after FGG organised a meeting with MPs and provided training on the essence of the Bill, which will help protect civic space and the freedoms of human rights defenders across the country.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">For SCS3, the Ministry counts instances in which CSOs have set the agenda, influenced the debate and/or created space to engage. FGG uses two indicators that each cover part of this indicator and move slightly beyond: for FGG indicator 4, FGG counts the number of key actors who put FGG recommendations on their agendas, e.g. by proactively organising meetings, initiating debates, and covering these recommendations in media; for FGG indicator 5, FGG counts the number of key actors who support and/or promote FGG&#x2019;s recommendations. Both indicators require key actors to have adopted a proactive attitude in order to be counted; while indicator 4 shows actors&#x2019; willingness to discuss a particular recommendation, indicator 5 shows their actual support for it. In 2021, 183 key actors put FGG recommendations on their agendas and 176 supported or promoted them, totalling a count of 360 on SCS3.  

Examples of such successful agenda-setting and generating support include: 
For strand 1 &#x2013; trade and investment agreements: In a Just Transition, Bilateral Investment Treaties (BITs) and the Energy Charter Treaty (ECT) would not hamper governments&#x2019; ability to regulate in the public interest. Unfortunately, most BITs and the ECT contain an Investor-to-State Dispute Settlement (ISDS) mechanism that do just that: they grant investors the right to sue governments that make policies that have a negative effect on the interests of foreign investors. In 2021 several East African FGG partners and FGG members mutually strengthened their knowledge on BITs and on the ECT, strategised together and jointly advocated against harmful (ISDS) clauses in several East African BITs and against their countries accessing the ECT. FGG partners from Tanzania and Uganda organised a virtual workshop to strengthen their knowledge on harmful clauses included in BITs. Partners then used their strengthened knowledge to lobby and advocate for stopping and/or renegotiating current BITs. In Tanzania, FGG partners shared recommendations on BITs that are about to expire with trade policy advisors to the Tanzanian President. In December 2021 these advisors committed to reviewing current BITs signed by Tanzania, to assess whether they need to be stopped or renegotiated. Partners from Tanzania and Uganda organised a workshop and advised policy-makers in Burundi to stop current BITs with harmful ISDS clauses. During the workshop the policy-makers from Burundi made a commitment to review all current BITs for the possibility of ceasing or renegotiating the treaties. In Tanzania partners also held several meetings with the Ministry of Energy on the potential risks to the energy transition of entering the ECT.   At the European level, FGG members&#x2019; advocacy on the role of the ECT in blocking a Just Energy Transition led to an ECT modernization process at the level of EU member states and the ECT secretariat during 2021, of which the result will be published in June 2022.  

For strand 2 &#x2013; climate and environmental policy: Two government parties (from Bolivia and Chile) expressed their support for six different text recommendations that FGG and the CBD Alliance put forward at the third meeting on the Convention on Biological Diversity&#x2019;s (CBD) Open-ended Working Group on the Post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework. The recommendations were aimed at improving the framework with respect to agriculture, agricultural ecosystems, agricultural biodiversity and soil health needs, the vital importance of IPLC&apos;s rights and tenure systems as well as the need to end perverse incentives and subsidies for industrial agriculture that facilitate the direct and indirect causes of biodiversity loss including soils. Furthermore, the CBD Alliance, in which FGG is active, recommended the establishment of &#x2018;[government] regulations for all businesses, trade and investment, prohibiting impacts that pass the limits of planetary boundaries, or affect ecosystem functions and human health or abuse human rights, ensuring full transparency of business impacts, addressing conflicts of interest, ensuring liability and redress, and penalising infractions and the provision of false information about ecological and human rights impacts or the benefits of products&#x2019;.  

For strand 3 &#x2013; public financial institutions: During the 2021 UN Conference of the Parties (COP) in Glasgow, the Dutch government committed to stopping all fossil-fuel subsidies before the end of 2022, including those channelled through Export Credit Agencies. The FGG Alliance has been advocating for this for years, and intensified its work in 2021 in preparation for the COP, through an integral campaign building upon the momentum on climate change. Notably, the contribution of FGG and its partner Oil Change International to the eventual success of the Netherlands committing to the &#x2018;Glasgow Statement&#x2019; was recognised by media and politicians.  

For strand 4 &#x2013; tenure rights: In 2021, FGG partners managed to bring their work to the attention of various government officials and convinced them to express their support for indigenous peoples&#x2019; land rights. A farmers&#x2019; union in Mukomuko Regency in Bengkulu, Indonesia developed their land-parcel maps and land-management plan, and prepared a policy brief on the Land Redistribution of Agrarian Reform Objects, as evidence to support their efforts to reclaim their cultivated land through the country&#x2019;s agrarian reform programme. The farmers submitted these documents to the Ministry of Agrarian Affairs and Spatial Planning/National Land Agency. The Governor of Bengkulu issued a letter to the Regent of Mukomuko recommending to immediately establish an Agrarian Reform Task Force in Mukomuko district; and to immediately resolve the land-use rights conflict of between the farmers and a palm-oil company.  

For strand 5 &#x2013; agroecology: The UN Special Envoy to the UNFSS Agnes Kalibata called for wider support for agroecology and small-scale farmers, and greater recognition of indigenous knowledge. This represented a significant shift in her rhetoric/discourse between her pre-summit and summit communications. The legitimacy of the Summit was severely undermined by civil society mobilisations throughout 2021, with media attention documenting criticisms and concerns. Outrage regarding the summit and how it was organised energised a counter movement in which FGG members and partners were actively involved, including a boycott of the official summit and a counter-summit held in July before the pre-summit; meetings with the UN Special Rapporteur on the Right to Food and a subsequent strong statement from them; statements; strategy meetings; a critical letter from academics; withdrawal of support by the expert body IPES-Food; discussion with the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs about the summit; op-eds and articles in the mainstream media including outlets NRC and The Guardian.  

For strand 6 &#x2013; rules for business and corporate conduct, cross-sectoral: The new Dutch government&#x2019;s coalition agreement includes the commitment to develop national due diligence legislation, after the previous Minister for Foreign Trade and Development Cooperation published progressive building blocks for such legislation, and the Minister committed to developing such legislation at the national level.
