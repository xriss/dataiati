   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Fair, Green and Global Alliance (FGG) aims to increase the power and decision-making influence of organised, mobilised and informed civil society, especially women, to advance fair and green trade and value chains. FGG believes that poverty, inequality and exclusion are caused by power asymmetries. We see the unprecedented power of capital over people and planet as the primary obstacle impeding realisation of fair and green trade and value chains. The FGG programme focuses on recalibrating power within the global architecture of trade and value chains by amplifying the voices of targeted rights-holders &#x2013;  small producers and traders, workers, fishers, rural and Indigenous peoples, religious and ethnic minorities, and migrants, especially the women and youth among them &#x2013; who are practising, claiming or defending human rights and fair and green economic practices, and/or whose rights are being ignored, threatened or violated by corporations and/or governments. We aim to transform social relations so that these rights-holders&#x2019; voices are heard and heeded. FGG&#x2019;s eight members (ActionAid, Both ENDS, Clean Clothes Campaign, IT for Change, Milieudefensie/Friends of the Earth International/Friends of the Earth Europe, Samdhana Institute, SOMO and the Transnational Institute) cooperate with some 1000+ partners and allies in our many worldwide networks to strengthen collective capacities to advance a common vision of fair and green trade and value chains.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">In FGG&#x2019;s indicator framework, the indicator linked to SCS1 and SCS2 groups both policy and practice change together in the same indicator (i.e. per result area C, D, E, F # instances in which key actors adopt and/or implement). FGG policy/practice recommendations. However, in order to still be able to link to both the SCS1 and SCS2 indicator we collect disaggregated data on policy and practice change respectively. For SCS1 we measure instances in which key actors change their practices advancing fair and green value chains. 

In 2022, the FGG Alliance&#x2019;s work aims to contribute to 65 changes in practices for sustainable and inclusive development. This work takes place under the umbrella of four result areas, aimed at improved government policies (result area C), corporate regulation by governmental institutions (result area D), corporate conduct (result area E) and policy space and funding for transformative practices (result area F).

Result Area C
When it comes to governmental policies, the practice change FGG aims for is often focused on the implementation of international policies by national and local governments and both in the global North and South as well as by international organisations. FGG&#x2019;s plans for achieving practice changes regarding international land-related policy frameworks such as the Voluntary Guidelines on the Governance of Tenure (VGGTs) and Free Prior and Informed Consent (FPIC) are a good example of this. Various FGG members, including ActionAid, Both ENDS, Samdhana and TNI will engage in work aimed at the implementation of (elements of) the VGGTs and FPIC in national or international tenure policy frameworks. As a result of FGG lobby towards various governments, including Bangladesh, Guatemala, India, Indonesia, Kenya, Malaysia, the Philippines and Uganda, we expect amongst others Kenyan government bodies at various levels to implement FPIC and the VGGTs to expand civic space and protect human and women&#x2019;s rights, including in the review of the National Land Policy. In addition we expect (district) governments in Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines to recognise and implement elements of the VGGTs (e.g. by issuing ordinances), leading to increased protection of communal and individual land rights, especially those of indigenous peoples. Finally, we expect civil society recommendations on the integration of the VGGTs to be incorporated in the UNCCD policy advice to combat desertification.

Result Area D
For the practice changes of governments regulating private sector actors ensuring respect for human and environmental rights in public financial flows is one of the key focuses. For example, in 2022, FGG members aim to push export credit agencies (ECA), such as ADSB, to improve their practices to ensure that human rights, the climate and the environment are protected in the projects they finance. This means amongst others to actualise the Dutch government&#x2019;s commitment to stop all direct public finance for fossil fuel projects abroad by the end of 2022. Both ENDS and Milieudefensie/FoEI together with amongst others partners in Mozambique, Uganda, Togo, and Ghana will continue to advocate for the recommendations of these partners on stopping ECA support for fossil fuels to be heard and actually implemented in practice. In addition, in the Mozambique LNG project, we also aim for ADSB, the AfdB and the Dutch embassy to verify whether Total and Van Oord implement the OECD guidelines for multinational enterprises. On top of divestment from fossil fuels and solid human rights due diligence, we also expect our advocacy with partners towards ADSB to lead to the implementation of a communication protocol on how they involve local communities, including women and youth, in their decision making processes. We aim to achieve these changes in practice through connecting our partners, exchanging information, jointly strategising and advocating, e.g. by raising awareness about ECA supported fossil fuel projects in Mozambique through social media.  

Result Area E
In FGG&#x2019;s indicator framework, practice change is not always necessarily preceded by policy change. One of the key practice changes that FGG aims for related to corporate conduct is obtaining remedy and/or other compensation for people and communities negatively affected by corporate misconduct, i.e. who have been subjected to rights violations by corporations. In 2022, FGG members including ActionAid, Both ENDS, and Clean Clothes Campaign will continue to pursue corporate accountability in grievance cases where the rights of people or communities have been violated by corporations, through complaint mechanisms, urgent appeal cases or strategic litigation. ActionAid and partners in Bangladesh, Guatemala, Kenya, and Uganda will continue to strengthen the capacities of communities affected by land grabs and displacement linked to large scale investments, to be able to understand land rights, and to be able to advocate for these rights to be respected and obtain remedy from corporations where injustice has been done. In cases where land rights have been violated, ActionAid and partners will provide legal aid and pursue Public Interest Litigation trajectories, amongst other things. ActionAid aims for mining and natural stones firms and other private actors in Kenya, Zimbabwe and Uganda, to improve their compensation for communities after land grabbing and respect the rights, including the right to freedom of expression, of (E)HRDs who challenge these land grabs. In addition, Both ENDS and partners will lobby for and expect to achieve stronger compliance, stricter sanctions and remedy by RSPO members through RSPO related grievance and conflict resolution mechanisms. Clean Clothes Campaign will engage in a number of Urgent Appeal cases, regarding wage theft, severance pay, factory closures, and freedom of association of garment workers. We expect brands and suppliers to provide remedy in 5 such cases. For example, in Myanmar, we aim for Myo Aye and/or other political prisoners to be released from prison through active lobby by CCC towards brands, the Dutch Embassy, and MSIs. 

Result Area F
For the practice changes related to transformative practices, FGG measures the instances in which key actors have taken concrete steps showing that they have increased policy space and funding for transformative practices (i.e. systemic alternatives/FGG solutions). One of the changes in practice that we aim for in 2022 is increased policy space and funding for agroecology. Agroecology &#x2013; applying ecological principles to agricultural systems &#x2013; is one of the key alternatives that FGG (AA, BE, MD/FoEI, Samdhana, and TNI) promotes as a sustainable alternative to large scale industrial agriculture. We see this as a way to combat the pressing challenges to which industrial agriculture contributes, such as climate change, biodiversity loss and land degradation, the effects of which are mostly felt in the Global South. Agroecology promotion will be a key element of just agriculture &amp; food transitions, of a feminist economy and of climate justice. The agendas for inclusive land governance and transition towards inclusive and sustainable local food systems as well as climate resilience for communities and women are highly intertwined. Agroecology is an inherently feminist alternative as it explicitly relates to female autonomy and the construction of spaces of equal participation between men and women. While much of FGG&#x2019;s work on agroecology will be on the level of agenda setting, in some cases we already expect key actors to change their practices in 2022. We aim for 4 instances in which county governments in Kenya, change their practices by increasing funding and promoting resilience building initiatives such as agroecology.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">FGG&#x2019;s indicator framework groups SCS1 and SCS2 together in one indicator measuring both policy and practice change. We do collect disaggregated data on policy and practice change respectively, in order to still be able to link to both SCS 1 and 2. So, for SCS2 we measure instances of key actors adopting or blocking policy changes in line with FGG recommendations to advance fair and green value chains. 
In 2022, the FGG Alliance&#x2019;s work under the umbrella of four result areas, aimed at improved government policies (result area C), corporate regulation by government institutions (result area D), corporate conduct (result area E) and policy space and funding for transformative practices (result area F) aims to contribute to 44  policy changes (i.e. laws, policies being blocked, adopted or improved) for sustainable and inclusive development.

Result Area C
A large part of FGG&#x2019;s work on government policies is aimed at policy change related to trade and investment agreements. In 2022 FGG will continue to advocate for democratic inclusive trade agreements which favour public over private interests and prioritise the demands of rights holders. An example of such policy change that we aim for is halting the expansion of the Energy Charter Treaty (ECT). The ECT is an investment agreement which poses a serious threat to a just energy transition as its ISDS mechanism provides foreign investors in the energy sector broad powers to sue states over government actions that promote a transition to renewable energy sources. In 2022 FGG will continue to raise awareness among governments and civil society to  ultimately stop the expansion of the ECT to various LLMICs. FGG partners and members will organise workshops and produce publications to strengthen the knowledge of and argumentation against the ECT amongst MPs, governments and media in key ECT accession countries such as Bangladesh, Burundi, Kenya, Morocco, Nigeria, Tanzania, and Uganda.

Result Area D
One of the key areas of work within the FGG programme is advocating for mandatory human rights and environmental due diligence at various levels, including at the UN, EU, national and sectoral level.  Because voluntary initiatives based on guiding principles have so far failed to bring about structural changes, FGG considers it essential to have such mandatory due diligence to assure that companies protect and respect human rights and the environment. 
Both the European Commission and various national governments are currently developing (draft) laws around mHREDD. In 2022, together with communities in the Global South who would strongly feel the consequences of such a law, FGG will advocate towards the EC and member states to make sure that the EC&#x2019;s final mHREDD law covers all companies and the full supply chain, includes strong provisions on liability for failure to practice due diligence and for harm caused and provides access to courts for victims. This FGG work will include contributing to the knowledge, networks and advocacy capacity of communities and partners, and publishing research on the role of EU companies in violations of environmental and human rights in the Global South. At national level, FGG will monitor the implementation of the mHREDD laws already in place (France, Germany) and be involved in the development process of those yet to be adopted (Spain, Netherlands). While the Social and Economic council of the Netherlands (SER) advises to wait for EU legislation, FGG will show the new Dutch government the need for a strong national mHREDD law to ensure a high standard at the EU level. Such a new mHREDD law needs to integrate a gender perspective, and therefore FGG will advocate with MVO Platform, WO=MEN and Southern partners for gender-responsive national due diligence legislation.

Result Area E
FGG aims to increase the general public&#x2019;s and policymakers&#x2019; understanding of the true costs of garments. This could help to mobilise them to call for binding agreements for garment brands, to protect workers&apos; rights, for example the right to a living wage. 2019 research showed that 108 garment brands paid wages that were on average two to five times less than the amount a worker and her family would need to live with dignity. FGG will undertake further research and campaigning to raise awareness about this reality, including by showing how brands extract value by leading money to the top holding and away from the other end of the value chain, and how brands prevent meaningful reform. FGG will continue case work on the impacts on workers while also engaging in in-depth research on business models and how these models reinforce power and inequality. This FGG work should contribute to two garment brands improving their policy, methodology (such as the use of credible benchmarks such as AFWA and EFW) and/or conduct on living wages.

Result Area F
While global food production has increased significantly, inappropriate distribution and lack of support to smallholder food farmers in LLMICs continues to undermine food sovereignty and the right to food. In response to this reality, FGG supports alternative approaches towards food production by advocating for policies and funding streams to support their upscaling and replication.

In 2022, FGG will continue its support both to local initiatives and networks organised around food security, and to global food sovereignty movements to develop proposals on how to define the future of food systems from the perspective of food sovereignty and agroecology. Also in 2022 we aim for a situation in which social movements&apos; vision on agroecology is increasingly seen as the pathway toward just and sustainable food systems by decision-makers, including at the FAO and Committee on World Food Security (CFS) processes. We will advocate for the latter to adopt civil society recommendations on issues related to the promotion of food sovereignty and agroecology, will push the CFS to ensure democratic global governance on food security and nutrition.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">Contributing to the ability of CSOs to create space for CSO demands and positions is key to the FGG programme. For this SCS indicator, FGG measures how many times key actors proactively put an FGG recommendation on their agenda and how many times they actively support and promote an FGG recommendation. In 2022, we aim for 327 times in which FGG manages to set the agenda and gain the support of key actors by influencing the debate and creating space to engage. 

In 2022, FGG will continue to strengthen civil society actors&#x2019; capacity on, mobilise civil society, and jointly advocate for a strong UN Binding Treaty: an international legally binding instrument that forces transnational corporations to respect human and environmental rights. Together with Southern partners, FGG members will lobby for improvements to the 2021 draft, with particular emphasis on regulating Big Tech and - via the Feminist for Binding Treaty coalition - for a truly Feminist Binding Treaty. 

In 2022, the 8th session of negotiations for the Binding Treaty will take place at the UN. With support of FGG members, FGG partners from amongst others Argentina, Bangladesh, Bolivia, Brazil, Cameroon, Guatemala, Indonesia, Kenya, Mozambique, Namibia, Peru, the Philippines, South Africa, Uganda, and Zimbabwe, will lobby towards their national governments for a Feminist UN Treaty. Through strategic campaigning and advocacy we aim to increase support for the Treaty among key states and their representatives. At the same time, FGG will support communities to collect evidence of human rights abuses by companies, e.g. in Guatemala, Kenya and Uganda, to convince national governments of the need for a Binding Treaty. Simultaneously, FGG partners and members will continue to encourage parliamentarians and local authorities to join the Global Inter-Parliamentarian Network (GIN) in support of the UN Binding Treaty. In the Netherlands, FGG members will engage with politicians as well as the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Development Cooperation to ensure a strong Dutch push towards a progressive EU negotiation mandate for the UN Binding Treaty&#x2019;s 8th session in October 2022.

Moreover, digital trade and e-commerce chapters that lay down the rules for the digital economy as a whole, are currently under negotiation within various FTAs and the WTO. The rules in digital trade chapters can transfer the ownership and control of vital data resources to the hands of large transnational corporations and their parent companies, deeply impacting human rights for workers, women and other economic actors implicated within them. Sound digital trade chapters are needed to ensure that governments are able to regulate in the public interest, ensuring labour standards and rights, enforcing adequate corporate governance, and apply taxation and revenues. In 2022, FGG partners and members will continue to build their knowledge on the impacts of digital trade and e-commerce chapters in FTAs. We will also offer knowledge strengthening to policymakers, negotiators and government actors from the Global South who seek new tools to fully understand the digital economy and want to strengthen their ability to negotiate on digital trade. In our advocacy towards such agenda-setting and momentum-building, we will pay particular attention to gender and e-commerce, including through research into the role of women in digital value chains and the impact digitalisation has on their livelihoods.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">In 2022, 288 advocacy initiatives will be carried out by CSOs, for, by, or with their membership/constituency. The numbers show what FGG aims for through its programme: strengthening the voices of civil society organisation in the global South by strengthening their lobby and advocacy. So, for this specific SCS indicator, FGG measures how many targeted civil society actors lobby and advocate for improved policies and practices in trade and value chains and advance fair and green practices based on capacities mutually developed. 

In 2022, FGG partners from the global South, often jointly with FGG members, will carry out advocacy initiatives against the increasing corporate capture of multilateral policy spaces and multistakeholderism. The inclusion of the corporate sector in spaces of global governance constitutes a great risk, as it allows corporations to set the agenda for and dominate UN Institutions and initiatives for their own benefit, rather than the public&#x2019;s interest. FGG partners and members will engage in mutual capacity development to strengthen their knowledge and network of CSO allies related to this issue by organising workshops and webinars, develop a joint analysis and advocacy strategies. Key advocacy efforts will be directed at UN spaces and the G77 to promote our analysis of key systemic features especially related to food systems, health, the environment, and tech. Through our advocacy we aim to drastically curb the influence of the private sector in these crucial policy spaces and to reclaim the role of states in political decision-making, guaranteeing participation of CSOs rather than the private sector, and strengthening democracy. 
Another key focus of FGG&#x2019;s advocacy initiatives will be around addressing the climate crisis. In 2022, FGG will continue to support global climate justice movements, especially youth-led climate movements. Partners and members will lobby and advocate based on their mutually strengthened capacities, such as increased knowledge and advocacy capacity on issues related to the critically needed energy transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources, the IPCC reports and UNFCCC, as well as climate justice demands. FGG partners supported by FGG members will campaign against fossil fuel expansion, irresponsible disengagement of fossil fuel companies and false solutions to the climate crisis, such as carbon markets and so-called nature-based solutions. At the same time we will promote real solutions featuring food sovereignty, biodiversity, economic justice and community-controlled renewable energy, as well as advocate for divestment, alternative energy policies, climate litigation, increased climate finance that accurately reflects the damage done by donor countries. Our advocacy will target national governments both in the global North and South, the UNFCCC, and major fossil fuel companies. Especially, the UNFCCC COP presents an important opportunity to lobby for climate justice. FGG members will support partners to participate at the COP, making sure that Southern voices are heard. Partners and members will jointly analyse IPCC reports to inform advocacy strategies to jointly further climate justice demands.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">In 2022, FGG will contribute to 444 CSOs in LLUMICs increasing their capacities to effectively lobby and advocate. For this indicator FGG counts all civil society actors, including CBOs, communities, and networks, with whom we engage in mutual capacity development (i.e. we our direct partners/and or country offices as well as the partners of our direct partners and/or country offices in LLUMICs). Mutual capacity development is the essence of FGG&#x2019;s way of working aimed at collaborating with partners to strengthening each others capacities needed to effectively lobby and advocate (incl. knowledge, constituency and network building, access to decision makers, advocacy skills, leveraging pressure points and ability to act freely and safely). It is a  process  in  which  all  civil  society  actors,  regardless  of  their country of origin, participate as equal partners. FGG partners and members  combine  their  complementary  roles  and  expertise  to achieve their joint goals.

FGG has long been raising awareness around the impact of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). This massive Chinese Foreign Direct Investment initiative, has caused harmful environmental, social and economic impacts, according to social movements, affected communities and non-governmental organisations across the globe. In 2022, FGG will strengthening its lobby and advocacy capacities in relation to the BRI. FGG partners from LLUMICs and members will further develop our analysis of and knowledge on the role of Chinese investments under the BRI, in particular in relation to the energy transition. Based on this joint analysis, we will jointly develop our advocacy positions and strategies for our advocacy towards national governments in host countries of Chinese investments and the CBD for improved environmental governance in relation to BRI projects as well as the need for investment agreements to be subjected to the same standards and rules as trade agreements. We will also strategically and financially support our partners to increase their capacity to monitor the development of a special investment protection mechanisms that is expected to govern BRI investments. 

One of the key issues that has been central in the FGG programme is the promotion of fair and green trade and investment agreements. In 2022, FGG partners and members will continue to engage in mutual capacity development to strengthen our lobby and advocacy aimed at making current harmful trade and investment agreements fairer and greener. FGG partners and members will increase their knowledge and understanding of ISDS and other harmful clauses in trade and investment agreements, such as the EU FTAs with Indonesia, Tunisia, Mercosur, and Mexico respectively, under negotiation in 2022. We will also build a global movement around the interface between trade and climate and strengthen the knowledge and advocacy capacity of partners around what these FTAs should contain instead, such as sustainability chapters that protect human rights and the environment. Specific attention will go to EU-Mercosur, as Latin American countries are subjected to most ISDS lawsuits. FGG partners and members will work on strengthening the knowledge of the EU-Mercosur FTA, and ISDS mechanisms among CSOs, by monitoring and documenting existing and new cases in Latin America and augmentation for legal changes to prevent the implementation of ISDS. FGG members will support FGG partners in conducting research on impact of the EU-Mercosur agreement on climate, forests, food and human rights &#x2013; including specific gender related impacts.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">This SCS indicator is linked to FGG&#x2019;s (local) ownership indicator o. This is a qualitative process indicator where we provide a qualitative reflection on the extent to which local groups are involved in the design and implementation of the FGG programme. 

Notably, FGG goes beyond local ownership and rather facilitates local leadership. Also in 2022, the FGG programme will primarily be built upon the expressed needs of our partner organisations and the CBOs and communities we work with and/or on the challenges and opportunities they have identified. Our approach is to facilitate for people affected by social injustice to organise and advocate for their rights themselves. More specifically, we aim to maintain and enhance local ownership and representation by:
1. Having partners shape our joint agenda. One of the key ways in which we will ensure sound representation of our partners and local groups is by continuing to let plans and agendas be driven by the issues and needs they identify. Path-breaking work on new proposals for tenure emerged out of work on the ground with grassroots movements in Myanmar; dispossession in oceans &#x2013; and specific research questions related to energy and aquaculture &#x2013; have been identified in conversation with small-scale fisher movements; and TNI&#x2019;s cross-sectoral and transformative understanding of just transition has been collectively developed with partners in Africa, Asia, and South America. With the ECT work, to give another example, several people from CSOs in Africa participated in an online course in 2021 and then approached TNI to work on ECT expansion with them. They decided this was important enough to take up as a campaign. TNI had meetings with them and jointly decided on joint work for 2022. 
2. Building upon years of working together. ActionAid, for example, will work in Bangladesh, Guatemala, Kenya, Uganda and Zimbabwe, where they have been working together with partners and communities for several years now. They will continue supporting communities affected by large scale investments (in mining, agribusiness, energy projects) to advocate for their rights and for remedy in cases where these rights have been violated. ActionAid has supported the setting up of 90 Community Land Rights groups in Bangladesh over the past years, which turned out to be a highly successful strategy to engage vulnerable communities affected by large scale energy infrastructure projects and support them to take centre stage in advocating for their rights. ActionAid will continue to implement a similar strategy in Kenya and Uganda, where they have supported community and women&#x2019;s groups on land rights and supported community and women-led advocacy for land and other rights.
3. Engaging in mutual capacity development. By learning together and strengthening each other&#x2019;s capacities, FGG members, their partners and the communities they work with are best able to exert their influence and effectively advocate for change. In FoEI&apos;s regional Sustainability Schools (in Africa and Latin America) capacities to effectively collaborate between the national and local levels, and facilitate and stimulate interlocal networking for instance, are strengthened. ActionAid will facilitate trainings for communities in Guatemala to improve these communities&#x2019; capacities to enhance mobilisation and participation in for instance (inter)national decision-making spaces.
4. Advocating together, and facilitating people&#x2019;s access to decision-making processes. Advocating together is key to the FGG programme. From CCC&#x2019;s Urgent Appeal cases and the strategic cases of their #PayYourWorkers &#x2013; #RespectLabourRights campaign to Samdhana&#x2019;s efforts together with IPLCs, for the latter to be able to claim their rights. In their advocacy, Both ENDS will continue to aim to bring their partners themselves into the room as much as possible. When this is not possible, it will be Both ENDS&#x2019; number one priority to convey the perspectives of their partners as well as possible in these decision-making spaces. Similarly, ActionAid will collaborate with their partners to shed light on local cases in research publications as well as in lobby meetings with local, national or international decision or policymakers, in which partners will participate directly. 
5. Continuous reflection: To make it possible for partners and local groups to take ownership and leadership in joint efforts, we consider it important to adapt the conditions of our collaboration to their changing realities. Samdhana, for example, is flexible in responding to needs of its partners by adapting to changing realities in the communities - these changing needs often signal a need for Samdhana to continue reflecting on its interventions and find more appropriate ways of working with communities given the changing context.
6. Taking care of the practical conditions for collaboration: Open and in-depth collaboration shouldn&#x2019;t be bothered by practical issues related to for instance financial matters or administrative requirements. Therefore, to facilitate for people to be fully on board in our programme, SOMO for example will engage in more systematic project management support and improve their internal sub-granting processes and provide more financial certainty to partners.
7. Expanding our collaborations: FGG aims to enhance representation of partners and local groups in their work by on the one hand deepening existing collaboration &#x2013; primarily through the above six strategies; and on the other hand expanding our programme to also include other partners and groups. In 2022, Both ENDS aims to start collaborating with two new partners in India and Mexico on EU FTAs.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">In 2022, FGG will contribute to 43 actions in support to better NGO and/or labour/trade union legislation, policies, by-laws and codes of conduct that improve civil society space
For SCS9, FGG counts the targets/results on its 5x indicator: # key actors who support and/or promote FGG policy/practice recommendations that aim to contribute to expanding/defending civic space.

We observe that civic space has been shrinking for years, a development that has been worsened by the pandemic. Many governments prioritise the interests of private sector actors over human rights; and too often (violently) repress civil society actors and environmental and human rights defenders speaking out against environmental and human rights violations. 

In response to this injustice, FGG members and partners put considerable efforts into supporting (indigenous) EHRDs on the front lines, doing everything in their power to enable them to do their work safely. This work will continue in 2022, amongst others through the Internationalist Solidarity System. In urgent cases, FGG will provide legal, medical, psychological and relocation support via emergency funds, including Urgent Appeal funds and &#x2018;small-grants for urgent action&#x2019;. FGG members will show solidarity with frontline communities and labour activists on specific cases of corporate abuse and impunity. FGG partners and members will collectively raise awareness about the dangers faced by EHRDs and the need to defend the rights of these communities. Specific attention will be given to strengthening knowledge of digital security and the safety of women EHRDs. We will also give special attention to supporting indigenous peoples movements. We will support IPLCs defending their ancestral lands by organising paralegal trainings to enable them to read investment contracts and trainings on safety and security and we will help them to build a movement, e.g. by improving strategic communications, strengthening their communication infrastructure to increase connectivity between partners, and by facilitating linkages with law groups to increase IPLC&#x2019;s access to legal services. Where possible we will also provide support in addressing basic mental health and psychosocial support needs of both IPLCs and staff who are on the frontlines. By holding &#x2018;menoken&#x2019;, we will provide inclusive spaces for young IPLCs, persons with different abilities, young women, and other groups to nurture a next generation of IPLC leaders and rights defenders. 

Examples of support from key actors that we seek to defend or expand civic space include:
- Government actors in Indonesia and Philippines recognise and uphold indigenous peoples rights, support spaces for dialogues, and allow for IPLCs to voice their issues and needs.
- Policymakers from Kenya increase their support for the promotion of accountability and upholding of human rights principles by the state through the promotion of strengthened application of safeguards to protect human and women&#x2019;s rights defenders. This will allow (W)EHRDs and CSOs to be included in democratic decision-making platforms.
- At FMO, as a result of the dialogues between FMO and CSOs first steps are taken towards a different theory of change, moving away from trickle down assumptions and investing in powers that be towards being more transparent, taking a role that addresses concerns of partners in cases, and integrating our concerns in policy reviews. 
- Government actors will support FGG recommendations on improving the Digital Markets Act, which we expect to contribute to defending civic space by reducing the control and influence of Big Tech platforms.
- A policymaker from India will support our policy recommendation for the expansion of input spaces and mechanisms for civil society actors into governance spaces for the digital economy.</narrative>
