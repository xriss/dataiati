abilities. In addition to physical barriers, such as challenging routes may prevent people with disabilities from access to legitimate services. For those circumstances the disabled children are less attending the school than others. The project?s goal is 
to bring people with disabilities at the center of social development by promoting their human rights. The project aims to empower people with disabilities not only to demand their rights, but also to increase the awareness of the rights of disabled people
. In addition, the project seeks to influence political decision-makers, in order to the disabled people&apos;s rights be noted and the laws to be implemented. The project trains the members of the community and disability activists about human rights, particul
