   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project supports indigenous peoples&#x2019; organisations or other CSOs working with local communities in five countries (Democratic Republic of Congo, Ghana, Kenya, Nepal and Tanzania) in implementing a participatory assessment on the resilience of indigen
ous peoples&#x2019; and local communities&#x2019; biocultural approaches and biodiversity conservation as well as restoration initiatives. In addition, capacity-building events will be organised on the participatory assessment methodology developed by the CCRI. The 
Ugandan NAPE will provide technical support to the actors implementing the assessments, and organise meetings for the new leaders of the communities, which have participated in the CCRI previously in order to support them in implementing the agreed recomme
ndations. The preliminary findings of the at least 15 assessments to be implemented will be documented in five national reports. An advocacy campaign will be implemented during the UN Biodiversity convention&#x2019;s Conference of the Parties in December 2016 i
n Mexico in order to disseminate the CCRI findings. The main findings of the assessments will also be disseminated within the involved communities and to the broader public through for instance social media, leaflets and radio programmes. The project aims 
at promoting more effective and appropriate forms of legal, political, technical, financial and other support that can address the most important internal and external threats to the resilience of community conservation. There is increasing scientific and 
political acknowledgement of the significance of indigenous peoples&#x2019; and local communities&#x2019; conservation and restoration initiatives to the protection of biodiversity and climate change mitigation as well as resilience. The initiatives face, however, b
oth external and internal threats, and there is lack of sufficient analysis on the support needed by the communities. Resilience assessments carried out by the communities enable presenting their own alternatives to strengthening the resilience. Project be
neficiaries include indigenous peoples and local communities implementing collective biodiversity protection and restoration initiatives. During the project 100 community representatives trained on the participatory assessment methodology are expected to r
each 7 500 people in 15 communities, in which the assessments will be implemented. Gender equality and women&#x2019;s participation will be paid particular attention to during the assessment processes.</narrative>
