   <narrative xml:lang="EN">&quot;The project &quot;&quot;We protect children, do you? - Promoting Child Rights and Protecting Children from the Worst Forms of Child Labour in Cambodia&quot;&quot; focuses on the prevention of child labor and the protection of children involved in the worst forms of child lab
or, in particular, children engaged in domestic work, brick factories and the entertainment industry. According to the recent statistics, there are 1,4 million working children in Cambodia. Within the most dangerous forms of labor, the working conditions a
re extremely damaging to health. Thousands of children lack opportunities for education because of being forced to work. This results to a cycle of illiteracy and poverty. In Cambodia, the society doesn?t recognize the need to protect children from exploit
ation and significant gaps do exist in official child protection structures, which makes it important for NGOs to contribute in this field.The project opposes child labor exploitation by developing groups and networks in different community sectors to moni
tor, investigate and refer to child rights (CR) violations. Wider audience is reached through activities that disseminate information on CR and on how to correctly respond to violations. The project also aims to contribute to the prevention of CR violation
s in Cambodia and to the protection and rehabilitation of victims of the violations.The project is located in both rural and urban areas in Phnom Penh and its surroundings and the provinces of Kandal, Koh Kong, Preah Sihanouk and Siem Reap.The first projec
t phase has been successful in establishing local level Child Protection Groups (PG), especially Child PGs in the target communities. The public awareness and debate about Child Rights and risks of the Child Labour is also increasing. This continuation pha
se of the project (2014-2015) will be dedicated especially to strengthening the existing Child Protection Groups as part of the local level civil societies. To ensure their continuation as independent actors, the number of members in the PGs will be increa
sed, child and youth PG members&apos; participation and capacity to advocate with peers strenghtened and networking and links to other local level actors  reinforced. Child and youth participation in local level decision making structures (commune/Sangkat meeti
ngs) will also be strenghtened, to increase the child and youth perspective in the decision making.&quot;</narrative>
