   <narrative xml:lang="EN">F.a: Strengthening women?s autonomy in Macaya</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The situation of women is fragile in Haiti. The power imbalance between men and women is significantly broad, and women are both socially and economically vulnerable. The project aims at increasing the autonomy of women in rural Haitian communities through
 strengthening their economic opportunities and participation in decision-making. This kind of empowerment requires building women?s basic capacities such as literacy, organisational and leadership skills as well as their awareness on human rights, particu
larly women?s rights and sexual and reproductive rights. Simultaneously, their economic and livelihoods skills are strengthened, in order to both increase their revenues and strengthen the valorisation of their work and role in the communities.The overall 
objective of the project is to empower women in Macaya by strengthening their decision-making capacities and improving their socio-economic conditions.Expected results:1. Women have the capacity to effectively participate in decision making ? Functional li
teracy and consciousness-raising ? Strengthening the social dynamics and female leadership (community development, networking, cohesion, identifying new initiatives) ? Advocacy on women?s rights ? Awareness-raising in reproductive health, Human Rights, Gen
der and citizenship 2. Women?s entrepreneurial initiatives contribute to their full empowerment? Development of entrepreneurial initiatives ? Skills training ? Support and capacity building to women&apos;s groups engaged in entrepreneurial activities ? Training
 and awareness-raising on environmental protection and rational use of natural resources? Training of project staff Rights-holders /beneficiaries: The project beneficiaries consist of women living in rural Haitian communities. The total female population i
n the intervention area is roughly 1,800. Most of the women in the project area have no basic education and are illiterate. Their vulnerability and poverty is linked to not having access to resources and basic services (education, health, food, justice etc
.). They undertake small trade activities (selling matches, sweets etc.), and production and sales of agricultural products (garden produce and spices). FCA?s direct partner at national level is the Lutheran World Federation/Department of World Service (LW
F/DWS) Haiti. LWF/DWS supports FCA in project monitoring activities and in strengthening the local implementing partner, Fondation de Nouvelle Grand Anse (FNGA).</narrative>
