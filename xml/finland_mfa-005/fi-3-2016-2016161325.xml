   <narrative xml:lang="EN">F.a: Yemen: Enhancing Inclusiveness of Peace-making Efforts in Yemen</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Three years into the political transition, Yemen spiralled into a complex, multi-layered conflict that has brought the political process to a complete halt and created a humanitarian crisis of unprecedented scale. The ongoing conflict has both exacerbated 
the pre-existing political tensions and created new lines of division that permeate all levels of the society. A lack of platforms for inclusive dialogue on critical issues for Yemen?s long-term peace and stability has left space for deepening rifts betwee
n the various Yemeni factions and increased the possibility of external actors to capitalise on these divisions. The absence of common platforms and its negative repercussions are manifest both at the national and local level. At the national level, there 
is in effect no broader discussion or information on solutions that would be acceptable to all key Yemeni groups. Recognising that exclusion of any key group from the political process undermines the sustainability of the process and the ultimate solutions
, the project provides a platform for groups from across the political spectrum to engage in dialogue on critical issues for Yemen?s long-term security and stability and supports the development of joint recommendations feeding into the search for solution
s in the formal process. The ability to engage actors from across the political divides at all levels of the society makes CMI well placed to provide relevant support for the broader peace-making efforts. In the extremely polarized political environment of
 Yemen, there are few actors that enjoy the trust of all sides of the conflict and would thus be capable of bringing all key groups together to search for mutually acceptable solutions to the most critical conflict issues. Building on these strengths, the 
project is designed to provide an informal, inclusive support track for any national-level political process. The project seeks to support Yemeni peace-making efforts through inclusive dialogue on critical issues for Yemen?s long-term peace and stability. 
It aims to create communication channels and channels for exchange enhanced between stakeholders from across conflict divides, reduce level of tensions between stakeholders from different political and armed groups, and develop inclusive, mutually acceptab
le solutions to critical national issues.</narrative>
