   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Children?s Rights in Crisis Situations is a global education project of the Guides and Scouts of Finland (GSF). It will cover the big national Scout events during 2015 and 2016. The project will be executed in cooperation between GSF Plan Finland and Finni
sh Red Cross. The objective of this project is to increase the knowledge of UN?s Convention on the Rights of the Child. The activities touch topics such as how the convention is implemented and what is the role of NGOs and young people in crises and in pea
ce building. The project also aims at increasing the understanding and empathy towards refugees. The culmination of the project will be the Scout camp Roihu with 15 000 expected participants. It will be held at Evo Hameenlinna in July 2016. A day long prog
ram package covers children?s rights in crisis situations. Most of the under-aged participants of the camp will take part in this program. Activities will be planned and carried out in cooperation with Plan Finland. During the camp we will have several oth
er activities connected to the children?s rights in crisis situations. We will organize a seminar and a ?Global Development Village? where other relevant NGOs will be invited to organize activities connected to the topic. To the Guides and Scouts over 15 y
ears of age we will provide possibility to take part in a conflict simulation organized in cooperation with Finnish Red Cross. Additionally in 2015 and 2016 we will organize workshops during the big events of the Guides and Scouts of Finland. The feedback 
from these workshops will be used when planning for the activities for the Roihu camp. The aim of the workshops is to inspire people to use global education activities in their local level weekly Scouting activities. To enable the local groups to address t
he topic of children?s rights we will distribute tips on how to conduct these global education activities. All the global education resources used during the project including activity tips will be available on the website of the Guides and Scouts of Finla
nd. Local groups and other interested youth groups or global educators can download and use them freely.</narrative>
