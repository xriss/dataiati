   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The 18-month research project started recently, and already in a few months started producing outputs and some important results. A study on pension system development, bargaining indicators development, position paper about the mine giant Rio Tinto&apos;s prof
its not benefiting citizens, start-up of the research about the so-called mega projects, i.e. large investments in natural resource extraction and their influence on the labour market. The project aims at improving these aspects by bringing further through
 solid information basis and analytical capacity through research.Despite being a national centre, OTM-CS traditionally has been focusing on the so called ?bread and butter issues?. Union movement is for most people unknown, irrelevant or having image of o
ld fashioned, hierarchic and ineffective, only going through annual minimum salary negotiations and nothing more. One of the consequences of this approach is the weak visibility of the Mozambican trade unions in their interventions to defend workers? inter
ests.A visible and proactive national centre will be respected by the social partners and the general public. New dynamics in the union movement is also expected to attract more members, especially young workers and women, and thereby strengthen the negoti
ation and policy intervention capacity, as well as financial self-sustainability of the unions.It benefits global and national unions, e.g. IndustriALL project 2356. After the pilot phase, there are high hopes that other research topics will be useful both
 for Mozambican union movement and SASK, other SSOs and GUFs, employers and the general public in Mozambique. Additionally, it is worth to mention that the project is also a good source of information for the international labour movement, especially in Fi
nland as the document ?Current Dynamics of Labor Market and challenges of the Trade Union Movement in Mozambique? has been translated into English and Finnish.The project is implemented by the OTM-CS people, specifically by the research unit coordinator an
d the finance manager. They are supervised by the secretary for labour relations and legal affairs. The regional coordinator of SASK for Southern Africa takes care of the regular monitoring.</narrative>
