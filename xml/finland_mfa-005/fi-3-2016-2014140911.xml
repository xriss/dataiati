   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Balkans Policy Research Group (BPRG) is a non-profit non-governmental think tank researching and developing policy recommendations on peacebuilding and state building issues in South-eastern Europe. The founding staff are veterans of Crisis Group?s Bal
kans and Kosovo projects. Webpage: http://balkansgroup.org/. The organisations? staff is highly experienced (adequate qualifications) the objectives of the project and activities areclear beneficiaries well defined and the expected results are realistic an
d concrete. Kosovo has made a considerable progress in setting up its institutions negotiating the integration of the North but still after six years of its independence Kosovo?s sovereignty and democratic government remain fragile and dependant on interna
tional support. The four Northern municipalities are in transit from Serbian to the Kosovo system largely against the population? preferences. The new elected leadership in these municipalities have little popular legitimacy and no experience with the Koso
vo system. Their effectiveness in addressing these needs helping people to exercise their rights their ability to provide effective governance are the keys to securing stability justice and development in the North. In order to address the above mentioned 
problems BPRG will conduct a research in order to identify best ways for smooth and prosperous transition establishment and empowering of local institutions and enhance services for the citizens. The organization will also develop practical policies that a
ddress the weaknesses of local institutions. Beneficiaries: Specifically- the population in the Northern municipalities and whole Kosovo populationThe overall objective is to identify and remove the most salient obstacles or weaknesses in two broad areas,a
) State-building: Strengthen state institutions increase service-delivery quality to citizens and enhance citizens? rights and access to services and rights. Identify obstacles weaknesses that prevent and promote policies that help strengthen the state ins
titutions increase quality of government services human rights and citizens? access to services. b) Peace-building institutional and human capacity building: Effective use of local governance by the local communities particularly in the Serb areas. Address
 challenges and promote rights and effective governance in the northern Kosovo.</narrative>
