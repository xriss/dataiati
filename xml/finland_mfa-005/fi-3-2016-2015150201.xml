   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Development cooperation week project by student unions</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Each year a theme week on development cooperation will be organised in eight student unions around Finland. Each student union organises independently its theme week program which may include for instance workshops lectures excursions exhibitions movie nig
hts and debates. The project complements the tuition offered by the university by providing new points of view (e.g. how one can participate in implementing development cooperation) and by bringing development cooperation closer to the students daily lives
 by providing them with experiences and activities.During both project years there will be a campaign in the social media. The campaign aims at approaching such students which the project has not reached before due to geographical location for instance. Ba
sed on the know-how of the social media coordinator which will be hired for the project and experiences from the first project year the coordinator will compile a manual on how to inform students about development cooperation in social media. Social medial
 reaches plenty of students and offers and interactive channel where people can discuss about the theme.In order to implement the project there will be a steering group where coordinators from different student unions can share their experiences and ideas.
 This peer support is very important for the student unions without long development cooperation traditions. Moreover in the steering group meetings the local coordinators will be instructed by SYL?s development cooperation coordinators on how to plan impl
ement and monitor the local development cooperation week. The experiences from previous years will help in making the arrangements. The most popular events have been the ones where students can concretely do and experience different things or to hear lectu
res by top experts. This is why the focus of the planning of the theme weeks is especially on these kinds of events.The project aims at activating Finnish students to consider development issues in their daily lives and at bringing up young people?s points
 of view because the development issues influence also their future.</narrative>
