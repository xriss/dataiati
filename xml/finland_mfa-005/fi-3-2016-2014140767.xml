  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The treaty-based International Criminal Court (ICC) and Trust Fund for Victims (TFV) were established by the Rome Statute that entered into force in 2002. The TFV provides support to victims of crimes falling under the jurisdiction of the ICC as well as th
eir families. These crimes include genocide crimes against humanity and war crimes. The TFV fulfills two mandates: it implements reparations ordered by the ICC and provides assistance to victims and their families. Its activities are ongoing and funded wit
h voluntary contributions received mainly from states. Through its assistance mandate the TFV finances its partner organizations which implement self-help projects at the local level. The projects are informed i.a. by the following cross-cutting themes: su
pport the advancement of women&apos;s human rights increase the participation of women and incorporating gender perspectives and the impact of sexual and gender-based violence (SGBV) restore dignity and promote peace building as well as support the rights of ch
ildren affected by armed conflict. The countries where the TFV provides assistance currently include Uganda and the Democratic Republic of Congo. Further the TFV has plans to expand to some other ICC situation countries as well. The practical means of assi
stance include i.a. physical rehabilitation psychological rehabilitation and material support. The objective is to help victims and their families to overcome the harm resulting from the ICC crimes as well as to help them lead a dignified life and to contr
ibute towards reconciliation and peace-building. The target beneficiaries include SGBV victims widows/widowers former child soldiers/abducted youth orphans and vulnerable children physical and mental trauma victims as well as family and other victims. Proj
ects funded by the TFV contribute to individual rehabilitation and community reconciliation. According to the TFV in total approximately 100 000 victims have benefitted directly from the TFV&apos;s assistance. The TFV receives voluntary contributions from sever
al states Sweden the UK Germany the Netherlands and Finland being the most important donors. Finland is also one of the most consistent supporters. The contribution of Finland in 2016 (200 000 euros) will be used to the TFV&apos;s assistance mandate programmes
