   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In Cambodia 65 % of the population is under age of 30 and therefore youth empowerment is an imperative. While youth is dynamic resource, there is little representation of young people in decision-making process. Robust youth participation is perhaps the st
rongest mechanism to enable their potential contribute to the development of their community. By building capacity among Cambodian youth, Cambodia Changemaker Network (CNN) is empowering the next generation of leaders and agents of change.Objectives:? To e
nhance space and opportunities for youth to be actively involved in the society and policy making process ? To increase knowledge, skills and awareness of youth on human rights, education and peaceExpected Result: ? Youth have enhanced knowledge and capaci
ty to constructively engage in advocacy actions? Youth have increased opportunity and spaces to express their voices on their concerned issues? Strengthened youth organisation and networkingRights-holders/beneficiaries:Cambodia Changemaker Network has iden
tified the core to establish the network in 2014. During 2015 this group has been growing to more than 100 members with diverse background including high school students, university students, monks, disabled, and staff from different NGOs and public sector
. Many of them are from Phnom Penh city, and some smaller numbers are from provinces including Kom Pong Spue, Bonteay Meanchey, Kompong Cham, Siem Reap, Battam Bong, Kandal, and Prey Veng. Implementing partner: Khmer Youth Association (KYA) was a hosting p
artner for Cambodia Changemaker Network (CNN) in 2015, but for 2016 CNN members have agreed to have FCA as the hosting partner. FCA is able to provide effective administration and other technical support to the network as needed.</narrative>
