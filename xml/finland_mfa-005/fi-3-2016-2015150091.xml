   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In the project Zambia Business and Disability Network the capacity of Zambia Federation of Employers (ZFE) is strengthened in supporting its member companies/employers so that they establish inclusive workplace policies which in practice would in turn lead
 to the increased employment of persons with disabilities. In order to enhance employability of persons with disability it is inevitable to build capacities of both the supply and demand sides of the labour market. In order to address this ZFE will focus o
n strengthening the skills and confidence of its network of companies/employers by making them become more aware of disability issues and develop inclusive workplace policies. In addition an identified employment agent is educated in preparing and developi
ng skills and confidence of persons with disability to improve their employability. ILO will provide technical support as well as business case experiences from the ILO Global Business and Disability Network and other countries they have been building busi
ness disability networks.People with disabilities are deeply disadvantaged in the labour market in Zambia due to their lack of access to relevant education as well as the nature of the workplace or employers&apos; perceptions of disability among other issues. I
f applying the World Health Organization&apos;s estimate of 15 per cent prevalence of disability worldwide there could be two million persons with disabilities in Zambia. The Zambia Business and Disability Network is a one and half year project with a budget of
 93000 euros supporting 30 companies/employers in Zambia. The project is expected to facilitate at least 60 persons with disability to access meaningful employment. The Zambia Business and Disability Network aims at raising awareness among employers about 
the positive relationship between the inclusion of people with disabilities in the workplace and business success.The project objectives/outcomes are: 1) strengthening ZFE&apos;s capacity to provide technical advisory services to their members on disability inc
lusion in the workplace, 2) enhancing the sharing of knowledge and best practices among private sector employers, 3) creating a core group to spearhead the formulation and ownership of the Zambia Business and Disability Network, 4) promoting the employment
 of persons with disability.</narrative>
