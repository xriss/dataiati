   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Improving food security and sanitation in Mali prefecture the Republic of Guinea</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In Mali prefecture originally cattle breeder communities are forced increasingly to get their livelihood and nutriment from other sources. It has been discovered that staple food is lacking proteins and knowledge of balanced diet is inadequate. The main so
urces of protein are carbohydrate rich cereals e.g. rice fonio and millet. Growing of proper protein containing plants beans and peas is very little. However beans and peas can be successfully growth in the region also during the rainy season. Due to the l
ow production volume there are very limited quantities of beans available at the market hence the high prince. Instead of using the beans as part of their nutrition the farmers are tempted to sell their yields after the high market price. In the villages o
f the project region there are only a few toilets available. The common practice for villagers is open defecation which enables the spread of fecal-orally transmitted deceases. The sanitation and hygiene education and trainings for the village dwellers wil
l improve their knowledge of prevention the fecal-orally transmitted deceases. Separating dry toilets will improve the hygiene level in the area. In addition urine and feces can be utilized as a fertilizer. This project is focused on improvement of food se
curity and hygiene level especially women and children. The use and growing of protein rich plants e.g. beans and Pigeon pea is enhanced. By increased production part of the yield may sell at the market. Trainings of growing protein rich plants nutrition a
nd cooking are essential parts of the project. Beneficiaries are additionally trained to grow living fences especially planting cutting established multipurpose species like Gliricidia. The living fences prevent the damages caused by free- grazing livestoc
k. Planting and utilization of cash crop plants like Liberian coffee and fruit trees will enhanced. These plants are effective carbon binders and prevent erosion create income and produce nutrition for the people in the region. In the project the practices
 and results will be documented and derived French-speaking databank will be available online.</narrative>
