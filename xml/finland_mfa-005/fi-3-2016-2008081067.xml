   <narrative xml:lang="EN">During this last project phase the work to strengthen two newly established textile sector federations continues. Federations will capacitate each other through close cooperation, and will maximize the representation power, and will be better able to deman
d effective implementation of the labour laws. Home Based Workers Federation (PHBWF) promotes systematically gender equality important to women within labour movement. In a longer run this work will increase the number of women being selected in leadership
 positions in trade unions. Key activities will be recruitment, merging new unions, training program, research on supply chains and a campaign on social security.The fundamental problem is the weak enforcement of labour laws and lacking respect of worker
&#x2019;s rights at the work places. To be better able to influence these problems at national level trade unions must seek every opportunity to cooperate closely and unite. This project facilitates the cooperation and unification of two newly established texti
le sector federations through direct recruitment program, by merging new textile unions into the fold of federations, by implementing a training program and a campaign on social security. Work conditions are further improved through establishment of OHS co
mmittees and by training of OHS trainers.This project mobilizes thousands of textile workers in factories and those who are home based, and raise their awareness on labour rights. Direct recruitment activities will grow the memberships of both federations 
by 10000 new members. At least ten independent textile unions will be merged into the federations, bringing some 10000 new members into federation cadres. This will lead to increased negotiation power, and this will enhance at least 3000 workers being able
 to register with social security system, and receive some old age benefits. In Punjab province a Brake-through will be achieved when the government will approve policies on home based workers. OHS committees will be established in both federations, and OH
S trainers will be trained.The project will benefit generally textile sector workers, and in particular those who are home based workers. Also both federations will benefit due to increased membership and more trained officials (activists, leaders OHS trai
ners). Project coordination will be done by LEF and main implementing organisations will be home based workers&#x2019; federation (PHBWF) and textile federation (TPGWF) and LEF.</narrative>
