   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project improves the education level of Haitian women and young people and their possibilities to find employment and get a living for their children and families. In Haiti, illiteracy is common especially among women and it makes it very difficult for
 them to find employment and participate fully in the society. Young people often lack possibilities to study and get an occupation to employ and gain a living. Through the project, literacy training is offered to women.Objective is to make 1 200 women (an
d men) literate through reading groups supported with the project funding. In addition, the project strengthens women?s network RENAFANM and its self-sufficiency so that it can serve a way for women to participate in the society and offer activities and se
rvices to young people and women. Project?s reading groups will be on-going until the end of 2017 as planned.Basic vocational training is offered to young people in the project. A new vocational training centre has been built after the 2010 earthquake in H
aiti and the constructions of the centre have finally been finished at the end of 2015. After that the project partners have been focusing on creating the study material, training teachers, purchasing of materials and finishing the centre. Sewing, baking a
nd cooking courses have been ongoing from November 2016 onwards.According to the original objective of the project the courses should have been ongoing already on 2015. This would have provided a nice base for the centres self-funding as the SASK?s support
 will be decreasing in 2017. Due to challenging operating environment and unstable situation in the society the building of the vocational training centre and its operations has been delayed, and the partner has not been able to create a base for the centr
e?s self-funding in this time.The project budget will be increased in 2017 so that the vocational training centre?s first spring semester (January to July 2017) will be completed properly and the centre?s second fall semester (September to December 2017) c
an be properly started. Objective is that the partner is able to increase its self-funding as well as find new funding sources. If this is found difficult the project will be continued until July 2018 with additional support, in order to finish the second 
year of the school?s operations.The project is implemented by womens? network RENAFANM (Rezo Nasyonal Fanm) and a training and research center CPB (Centre Petion Bolivar).</narrative>
