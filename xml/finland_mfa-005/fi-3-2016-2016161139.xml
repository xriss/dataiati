   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Burundi experienced a brutal civil war which displaced more than a half million people. After a cease-fire about 600 000 refugees returned. Upon their return young people were excluded from education due to different education systems and different languag
es. Hunger is also a major problem in Burundi because of the land issues, as the conflict has destabilized food production. The farmers in Burundi lack access to new farming methods for increasing the food production. Especially young people, who have retu
rned to their home country after the war, have difficulties in finding vocational education, employment and reintegration into the society because of language problems and poverty. Supporting the families&#x2019; development towards financial independence and e
quipping churches&#x2019; capacity to address the social problems in their communities is a sustainable solution in improvement of societal wellbeing in the country. Farmers and families are trained and assisted in food production and animal husbandry, and envi
ronmental protection. Food security and climate change policies have been ratified and put into practice through church partner&apos;s trained staff. Youth centres offer youth activities and vocational training. Fida partners with la Communaute des Eglises de P
entecote au Burundi (CEPBU, The Community of Pentecostal Churches in Burundi).The project contributes to a sustainable impact to the wellbeing of communities, families and young people in Burundi through a just, safe and caring church. The purpose is empow
ered families and church relevantly addressing the needs of youth, and improving the food security for 600 families of Giharo and Bukemba by 2016. The youth social interventions (youth centres) will give thousands of youth a safe place to learn and develop
 their life and vocational skills. As a result, the well being of youth will be improved &#x2013; whereby thousands of young people will be able to face challenges of employment in formal and informal sectors. The beneficiaries include children, youth, their fa
milies, farmers, and the whole communities through a long-term impact, when youth employment will be increased and food production improved. The churches also benefit by gaining recognized positive social influence in their communities.</narrative>
