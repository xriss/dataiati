ach other in their profession as teachers of rural primary schools. The 90 qualified teachers will work mainly in the districts of the Manica Province and that will impact on 11.000 primary school pupils yearly who will receive a more child centered educat
ion.The EPF students will receive training on the following main topics: child-centered education annual teaching and lesson plans active learning time management preparation of a lesson life skills in primary education early reading and writing skills bil

eaching practice in the second year of the training course.The project aims at the improvement of the quality of primary school education and creation of pupil friendly environment n primary schools. In the long term perspective the performance of children
 at school will improve especially in terms of early reading and writing skills the dropout rates will decrease and completion rates from grade to grade will increase. The children will enter the adult life equipped with more skills than their parents. A p
