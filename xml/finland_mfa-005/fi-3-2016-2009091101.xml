  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The decision to exit from DRC by the end of 2015 was made in September 2015. The exiting from DRC is due to significant budget cuts resulting from reduced MFA funding for FCA?s development and humanitarian work in 2016. It is foreseen that most FCA funded 
and implemented programme work will end by the end of 2015, with the exception of the MFA funded humanitarian operation continuing in Masisi until the end of March 2016. The exit process has been negotiated with FCA stakeholders in Goma, such as the United
 Nations organisations and Government partners at provincial level, as well as with all partners during October 2015. Based on these discussions all local partners have developed and submitted their exit plans to FCA. The plans focus on supporting the sust
ainability of the on-going projects and initiatives in the long term. In 2015, FCA will support the partners in particular with the efforts to introduce the projects to new donor organisations. Preliminary discussions have been held with a number of INGOs.
 Additional capacity building is also provided during the second half of 2015. The main objective:In January and February 2016, FCA will maintain a small support staff in Goma, North Kivu to ensure an effective and full exit, including finalisation of 2015
 office audit and partner audits, as well as preparing an annual report for 2015 and assuring that all administrative and financial processes are respected and the closing down will be done in a responsible manner.  Expected results:Successful finalisation
 of all FCA supported projects and where possible, the hand-over to new donors in DRC. This includes the final office and project audits, final reporting and ensure full respect of all administrative, contractual and human resource processes.</narrative>
