 pre-trial detention and torture in custody are common, as well as the impunity of the authorities. Poverty of the accused, as well as the lack of capacity of the judicial system, corruption and inefficiency, make more difficult or prevent the investigatio
n, the use of defenders and witnesses court cases, the keeping the pretrial detention time limited, as well as keeping the appeal process operational. The conditions of prisoners and detainees are poor, even life-threatening. The project aims to strengthen
 the knowledge of the prisoners and the prison authorities of the judicial and penal system, as well as the capacity of the prison authorities to deal with complaints, provides information for the prisoners about progress of the legal process and to inform
