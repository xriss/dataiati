   <narrative xml:lang="EN">School enrolment of girls&#x2019; in Liberia has increased in recent years due to government&#x2019;s free and basic education scheme, but many barriers continue to affect girls&#x2019; access to education. Many have missed out on basic education and are now over-age for
 the formal schooling system. Vocational training offers a second change for them to acquire skills that help in finding employment or starting own business as at the same time the demand for technical skills is in increase in Liberia.The main objective of
 the project is to provide girls and young women an opportunity to acquire technical, vocational and entrepreneurship skills in order to increase their prospects for employment or self-employment in the formal or informal sectors after graduation. On-the-j
ob training and mentoring are used to ensure that graduates are prepared for the job market. The quality of training is developed through capacity building of vocational training institutions.  Expected results:Partnerships with Technical and Vocational Tr
aining and Education (TVET) institutions to support the enrolment of girls developed to create enabling learning environment for girls, Targeted, advanced TVET-courses are responding to the needs of employers and job markets; Capacity of staff in the TVET-
institutions IS built through training in pedagogical methods including gender-responsive pedagogy so that girls&#x2019; needs are addressed; Girls graduating from TVET-institutions linked with private and public sector entities to provide employment opportunit
ies or support entrepreneurship; Gender issues in TVET addressed by educational authorities as a result of advocacy work.Right-holders/beneficiariesGirls and young women in urban and peri-urban communities.Implementing partner:Forum for African Women Educa
