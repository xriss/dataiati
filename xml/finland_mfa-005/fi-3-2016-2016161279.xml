   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The two-year project includes publishing of two theme issues of Wacana magazine (community forest legislation and the political ecology of water), and training of new generation activists, especially regarding the grassroot advocacy. In the beginning of th
e 2000?s, INSIST organised the so-called Involvement activist training, which turned out very popular. Also many present actors of Siemenpuu supported groups participated. This project would be sequel of Involvement, which would mainly engage young activis
ts from within INSIST members, but also from other Siemenpuu supported institutions. Both issues of Wacana would be published both in Indonesian and in English. The volume is about 1000 issues each. The activist training includes workshops, field work and 
evaluations. The Wacana publication and the activist training have partly joint themes. The authors and teachers are wellknown actors of older generation. INSIST (Indonesian Society For Social Transformation) is a forum of 16 Indonesian organisations. INSI
STPress was founded in 1998, and in 2006 it was registered as an independent publishing company. INSIST and INSISTPress are located in Yogyakarta, Java, but the 16 member organisations are located around Indonesia. . INSISTPress aims to develop new ideas, 
alternative thinking and critical discourse in society through the spread of books, policy paper, journals, and other materials. The name of the magazine published by INSISTPress is Jurnal Wacana. It has been published since 1999. http://www.insist.or.id</narrative>
