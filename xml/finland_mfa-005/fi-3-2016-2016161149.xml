   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Awerial County in Lakes State in South Sudan has hosted IDPs for many years and has become a safe place for people fleeing conflict in the neighbouring states and counties. Over the years, Awerial County has benefited from life saving humanitarian interven
tions. However, the area is now moving towards early recovery. Although many IDPs have been hosted in IDP camps, there are those that have been hosted by the host community. This project has special focus on this group. The sharing culture of the community
 has led to many households stretching their meagre resources to support IDPs. The livelihood project is aimed at ensuring that gains made during previous humanitarian projects in the area are consolidated by building upon skills gained in livelihood activ
ities namely farming, fishing and milk processing.The overall project objective is to promote communities&#x2019; recovery and development by enhancing livelihood options basing on their way of life. Specific objectives is to strengthen the community&#x2019;s capaci
ty to protect, restore and develop their livelihoods in a sustainable way.Expected results:&#x2022; The capacity of communities to combat poverty through inclusive and sustainable livelihoods development is improved.&#x2022; The resilience of communities to withstan
d shocks through provision of communal productive assets is strengthened.Right-holders/ beneficiaries: The local community consisting of subsistence farmers, pastoralists, and fishermen. There will be a special focus to include women as much as possible as
 a means of ensuring that they benefit from these forms of livelihood in an equitable manner.The project will co-operate also with duty-bearers, such as local traditional and religious leaders and government officials, in order to achieve sustainability. T
he project is FCA self-implemented.</narrative>
