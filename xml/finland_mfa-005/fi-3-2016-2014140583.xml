   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Inclusive democracy and youth participation in the politics in Tunisia will be strengthened through the Tunisian School of Politics which aims at enhancing political youth&apos;s capacity and constructive, policy oriented engagement in politics. The project is 
implemented by the Centre des Etudes Mediterraneennes et Internationales (CEMI) and is supported by Demo Finland and the Netherlands Institute for Multiparty Democracy (NIMD). The programme aims to create space for multiparty dialogue by bringing together 
political actors and facilitating dialogue. To achieve this a permanent high-level Multi-Party Democracy Platform was created in 2016. The strategic planning and policy formulation work of the parties will be strengthened. Also alumni of the school is targ
eted with tailor-made capacity building sessions. Furthermore, the political actors involved will be equipped with the necessary skills and knowledge to formulate, defend and lobby for policy alternatives by tailor-made alumni trainings focused on specific
 skills and knowledge, programme formulation and peer exchanges. There are also gender classes addressing issues of gender equality in politics and policies. Regional activities involve a seminar bringing together MP?s, academia + CSO representatives from 
Tunisia, Algeria, Morocco, Libya and Egypt. TSoP targets young people already active in political parties and consists of courses that provide youth politicians with increased knowledge of multiparty politics and democratic practices. Also the political pa
rties in Tunisia are the direct target group. Final beneficiaries are the people of Tunisia through improved democracy and governance. When youth and women politicians have the necessary means to advance issues important to young Tunisians in politics it i
s anticipated that youth and gender issues will gain a more central place in Tunisian politics and that awareness among young people and women in the democratic system and political parties will be enhanced. This is expected to lead to increased youth and 
women?s participation in politics. Outcomes of the project 2016-2020:1. Safe space for dialogue between all relevant political actors2. Political actors voice and monitor citizen&apos;s interests3. Improved capacity of local partners4. Increased interest in con
sulting, collaborating, harmonizing, being responsive and a sense of trust and mutual understanding among and btw political and civic actors</narrative>
