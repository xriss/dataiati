d Development (ECD) . Although the achievements of the first phase are important changing of entrenched habits and inherited behavior i a slow process. The continuation of the project is aims to ensure sustainability of the results and to expand the impact
 of the project including 200 new beneficiary families in the process.Essential themes of the project are the monitoring of health during pregnancy after-care and nursing support as well as ECD and prevention of domestic violence. These themes are studied 
by women and teenage mothers men and grandmothers. The project will be implemented through small groups of women with the help of an existing and trained network of peer promoters. 20 pre-existing groups will be assisted and new beneficiaries will get supp
ort to set up their own groups which in addition to the project themes practice organization and social skills. All groups are encouraged to act autonomously and continue after the end of the project.An aim of the project is to increase the knowledge of ch
ildren&apos;s growth and development and to provide parents and caregivers with practical tools to promote new educational methods in everyday life. Beneficiaries learn to identify and understand the different stages of child development and to search for non-v
iolent alternatives in challenging situations. A new theme is domestic violence prevention and a non-violent upbringing of children. Violence prevention means tearing down structures that are hampering the development of children and well-being of the fami
ly. In addition 6 therapy groups will be set up for women and girls victims of violence or sexual violence. The groups are assisted by voluntary psychology students under the responsibility of a psychologist. The members of the groups will strengthen their
 self-esteem and a positive self-image. Also men may set up their own peer groups for the processing of violent experiences.</narrative>
