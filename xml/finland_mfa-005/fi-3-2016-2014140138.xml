   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project aims to strengthen FCA?s partner organisations? capacity and level of participation in global human rights processes and involvement in global advocacy work. The main objective is to encourage and increase the capacity of FCA?s partner organisa
tions to participate in international human right processes such as the UN Universal Periodic Review (UPR), reviews on UN HR Treaties or regional HR Treaty mechanisms of the countries under review, or in other global advocacy processes relevant to FCA stra
tegic themes such as the Agenda 2030 and Sustainable Development Goals through partner networks and global alliances. Expected results:The partner organisations capacity to take actively part in the stakeholder meetings, hearings and collection of data as 
part of civil society?s contributions to the preparatory processes for UPR reviews and other HR mechanisms of the given country has been increased, is effectively utilised and recognised by the actors involved. The UPR review consist of three key documents
: a national report, a compilation of report gathered by OHCHR and a summary of the stakeholders? submissions (CSOs, NGOs, academia), prepared by OHCHR. Also other global advocacy results based on FCA global strategic advocacy objectives can be counted as 
results in the project if utilised the resources of the project (e.g. training, capacity building activities, sharing of information). 1. Right-holders/ beneficiaries: a) Civil society and the stakeholders they represent, the people the partner organisatio
n is working with, and on global advocacy: all people.b) Duty-bearers: The duty-bearers include especially the authorities at different governance levels responsible of the issues being raised and advocated for in global processes.Implementing partner:This
 is a global project and will have a few partners, e.g. Lutheran World Federation (LWF) and local partners in programme countries that have potentiality to increase their capacity and participate in global HR processes, such as the UPR review and CEDAW. In
 2016, FCA?s programme countries under UPR review are Somalia, South Sudan and Uganda. Follow up countries for UPR include Nepal, Myanmar, Haiti and for CEDAW, Liberia</narrative>
