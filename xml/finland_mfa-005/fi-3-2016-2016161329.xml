   <narrative xml:lang="EN">F.a: Promoting human rights by strengthening Human Resource Management at the coffee producing organizations</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Coffee picking requires seasonal manual labour. Small producers take care of the work mostly within the family, but also hire quite a lot of seasonal workers during the peak season. Small producer organisations have limited capacity to assist smallholders 
in dealing with seasonal hired labour. Experience and understanding to support members in this area is often lacking as is the training of staff assigned to this task. However, human resource management support from producer organizations to their members 
may not only benefit workers but also result in efficiencies and positive effects on quality and productivity. The goal of the new pilot project is to promote well-being of workers in coffee farms. The project&#x2019;s purpose is to strengthen the coffee-produc
ing cooperatives&#x2019; human resources skills. This will be done through organisational development of producer organizations instead of a normative approach through the imposition of more Standard requirements for producers. The project clarifies cooperative
s&#x2019; human resource management roles by training cooperative leaders and updating manuals and cooperatives&#x2019; internal work regulations. Cooperatives&#x2019; capacities to handle information tools on manpower will be improved by training cooperative leaders and
 improving HRM software. The project will also improve workers&#x2019; occupational health and safety by supporting the formation of occupational health and safety committees, and training the formed committees on health and safety issues. The project will deve
lop a model of compensation and benefits for both permanent and seasonal workers. The project offers human resource management solutions tailored to the resources and capacities normally available for small producer organizations. Producer organizations th
at recruit and manage post-harvest workers will offer human resource management as a service to their members. The project includes 12 coffee cooperatives with more than 16.000 members. Project final beneficiaries are 350 executives and administrative staf
f, 400 full-time employees and 1300 seasonal workers. The project is implemented by Peruvian network of small Fairtrade producers, CNCJ-Peru. http://comerciojusto.pe/</narrative>
