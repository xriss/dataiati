  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Complex conflict dynamics have kept Central African Republic (CAR) in recurrent cycles of violence and undermined an already fractured social fabric. Within a dysfunctional educational sector, teaching methodologies are outdated while non-formal systems of
 governance such as traditional and religious leaders tend to dominate. Supporting the mainstreaming of education for sustainable peace through both formal and non-formal channels are therefore essential to enhancing conflict prevention, resolution and com
munities capacities and a sense of being able to positively contribute to social cohesion.The main aim is to have selected communities, especially religious actors and youth, exposed to formal and non-formal learning opportunities to enhance their capaciti
es to recover from, reconcile and prevent violent conflict and relevant ministries have enhanced tools and capacities to build a peace infrastructure and engage with existing mechanisms.Expected results:? Education for sustainable peace and new pedagogical
 methodologies are mainstreamed into the national curriculum towards a conflict sensitive approach to education. ? Religious and traditional actors, and new community mobilisers collaboratively contribute to reconciliation and conflict prevention ? Governm
ent representatives and international actors collaboratively engage in community-level peace mechanisms towards the implementation of the Bangui Forum Recommendations and the Plan de TransitionRight-holders/ beneficiaries:At the community level, the projec
t aspires to target youth in public schools and their communities (Parent-Teacher Associations). While much of the technical support and projects will take place in Bangui, developed tools and modules will be mainstreamed to the general public through the 
national curricula while other pilot projects will be targeting communities in the South Western region of Sangha Mbaere and other Provinces capitals.Duty-bearers:At the national level, Ministry officials from the Reconciliation and Education Ministry as w
ell as influential religious and traditional leaders will also be targeted by the projects through the provided technical support and enhanced opportunities to exchange and learn. Implementing partner:AEGIS Trust, The Catholic Organisation for Relief and D
evelopment Aid (CORDAID). FCA is an implementing Partner of UNICEF under the Global Partnership for Education 2 (GPE 2).</narrative>
