   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Health Information Systems (HIS) are becoming part of the Tanzanian health care thus advancing good governance and transparency in health care system functionalities. The challenge is that there is not enough ICT and HIS skills knowledge and experience in 
health care service providers. This project supports both health care personnel in taking HIS into use and HIS service providers in assessing developing and maintaining HISs based on open source software at sustainable cost. The objective of the project is
 also to support creation of local business by training ICT and HIS key-users and HIS deployment and maintenance entrepreneurs. Target groups of the project are third sector actors (ELCT ALMC TOHS Itete Ilembula) and the actors which will spread the skills
 wider in the ecosystem after the project has ended (APHFTA CSSC UDSM NM-AIST) e.g. by education and research. Project improves HIS buyers? skills in Tanzanian health care and its collaborators? skills in taking HIS into use and in evaluating developing an
d maintaining HIS. Both ICT and health professionals? expertise will be utilized in developing these HIS competences. Trainings will be based on the development needs identified by the Tanzanian collaborators. Finnish actors do not have ready-made solution
s but they will offer their experiences and expertise to support development of the solutions by hands-on-doing and collaborative learning. Collaborator Workshops will be organized yearly either in Tanzania or in Finland to review the progress of the proje
ct and to update the plans together in more detail for the coming year. It also gives an opportunity to get familiar with the health care in the other country as well as to share experiences about the use of the HIS successes and challenges.Use of HISs mak
es it possible for the Tanzanian Ministry of Health to have reliable information about the health system performance epidemiology of diseases and health outcomes and about the status of health care services and their delivery in different parts of the coun
try. This information provides a basis for the future decision making in further development of the health care system.</narrative>
