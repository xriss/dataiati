  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Good Samaritan Program (GSP) is a pan-African program by the United Bible Societies. It is implemented in over 20 countries in Africa and coordinated by HIV service. Bible Society of Cote d&apos;Ivoire (BSCI) has the main responsibility in the grass root level 
implementation.The overall objective of the project is to contribute to the reduction of the spread of HIV and stigmatization of people infected and affected. Project aims to involve church partners and communities to HIV work. In the core of the GSP are h
uman rights: PLHA as well as their families deserve to be treated equally with other members of the society. Rights based and gender sensitive approach is directly linked with Christian values. GSP is contributing to the Cote d?Ivoire national policies whe
re reducing the stigma of PLHA and avoid new infections are the prioritiesGood Samaritan program will not intervene directly in the sector of health care but use partnership and guide people in need to the suitable aid providers. However through communicat
ion advocacy and disseminating adequate health information GSP has means to change opinions and contribute to the common goals defined by UNAIDSGSP trainings are based on multimedia package which includes booklets videos and flipcharts for trainees and man

 (FU) home visits and Take Charge (TC).Like during the 1st and 2nd project phase GSP targets churches local congregations and communities. However for the 3rd phase of the project BSCI has special focus on two topics:- To integrate deaf to the project - To
 focus on the families to prevent parent to child transmission and to reduce the infections among couplesGSP staff has witnessed the lack of correct information about HIV among deaf communities. Deaf audiences can be heavily affected by HIV but often left 
out from development projects. GSP?s aim is to integrate deaf to the project by cooperation with deaf schools and organizations with specifically designed materials. Fidida will provide external consultation in FinlandBecause of the high infection rates am
