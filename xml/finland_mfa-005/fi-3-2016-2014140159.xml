   <narrative xml:lang="EN">IndustriALL has implemented a cooperation project in mining sector in Latin America together with the support from Finnish and Swedish Unions (SASK and Union 2 Union and both countries? Metal workers? unions) during 2014-2016. In the focus of the Finnish s
upport has been the establishment of a union networks into two multinational mining companies. Target companies have been Glencore and Anglo American. Cooperation has been successful and the joint strategic planning, experience changing and campaigning has
 increased.Due to ?bridging year? in SASK as well as in Union 2 Union, IndustriALL has suggested ?bridging year? for the project too. During the ?bridging year? both trade unions support organisations plan their future development cooperation programme for
 the next years. The core elements of support to the union networks continue the same, only the other target multinational will be BHP Billiton instead of Anglo American. Anglo American is widely withdrawing its operations from Latin America so focusing to
 it will not be strategically profitable anymore. Due to SASK?s geographical focusing SASK?s support will be mainly channelled to Colombia during the ?bridging year?.Mining sector is very important sector both as an employer and for the export in Latin Ame
rica. In the mining sector the workers work in extremely dangerous conditions, there are number of shortcomings in the OHS, and the regulation in the sector is in its infancy. Majority of the employers in the sector are multinational companies who get tax 
reliefs from their country of operations and the profits are going to the investors. Therefore, the cross-border union cooperation is important. The drop in the mining industry?s raw material prices in in recent years have put pressure both to the companie
s and the workers. The objective is that the union network supports its members to increase the rate of organisation by 10 %, the quality of collective bargaining agreements improves due to information and agreement sharing, damages to the workers caused b
y the shut downs of mines are minimised, and through joint activities the visibility of ILO?s convention no. 176 (OHS in mines) and its ratification is increased.</narrative>
