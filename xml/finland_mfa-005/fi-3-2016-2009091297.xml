  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project aims to empower scheduled caste and adivasi women workers focusing especially on younger generation and improve their livelihoods in their traditional occupations (small farming and animal husbandry). Different kinds of agricultural and animal 
husbandry trainings will be organised in order to increase the productivity of these activities while promoting environmentally sustainable methods to deal with the consequences of global warming (drought). A tools + equipment library will be set up to hel
p small farmers to get access to new tools and equipment at a nominal price and decrease their workload. In addition to this managerial trainings and trainings related to alternative employment opportunities such as stitching and food processing will be pr
ovided to women.To get a better understanding on younger generation&apos;s livelihood related needs and aspirations workshops will be organized where young women get information about different training options and new technologies and methods available. During
 the previous project three child care centers were started. Continued support will be provided to these child care centers to help women improve their livelihoods and provide children with better readiness to start school.Besides improving the livelihoods
 of women living in rural areas the objective of this project is also to make women more aware of their basic rights and the importance of their work not only for their families but also to the national economy. Capacity building trainings increase women&apos;s
 latitude and self-reliance so that they can raise their voice take a stand on their living and start demanding their rights (to different kinds of benefits for instance). SEWA has adopted an integrated and human rights based approach which seeks to influe
nce the local authorities and establish linkages with existing government schemes and development programs. In this project this aspect is most visible in lobbying for child care centers in order to get them adopted by the state.</narrative>
