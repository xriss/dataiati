   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project contributes to the development problem of the exclusion of the Roma youth in the mainstream society as there are wide inequality gaps still existing. Specific objective of the project is to improve the access of Roma youth to education employme
nt and active citizenship.The project?s principal outcomes are 1) Civil Society Organisations (CSO) have strengthened capacity to support the Roma youth 2) Roma youth have acquired information and skills needed to exercise their citizenship and minority ri
ghts 3) Roma youth have achieved education and/or professional skills. The most central activities include applying and developing new participatory community training methods in CSOs, strengthening linkages of CSO with authorities and businesses to provid
e opportunities for Roma youth, training of Roma youth, organising Youth Camps for Roma and non-Roma youth, providing educational opportunities for Roma youth, and advocating for the rights of Roma girls to education and employment. The project aims at the
 strengthening of civil society in Kosovo notably the capacity of Roma CSOs. It challenges private and public sectors in Kosovo to provide more educational and employment opportunities for Roma youth. As such ?Societies have become more democratic and bett
er-functioning? is the priority area of Finland&apos;s development policy to which the project contributes. Alarming share of Roma youth notably girls has been left out from secondary level education and employment and remained vulnerable. The project addresses
 their human rights and well-being by empowering them to become subjects of their own development and the society as a whole. As such it aims to reduce inequality and promote gender equality. Project respects climate sustainability too.The project will be 
carried out by the Helsinki Deaconess Institute the main organization working with Roma migrants in Finland and the Voices of Roma Ashkali and Egyptians (VoRAE) who has a general mandate to improve the lives of Roma communities in Kosovo. The principal ben
eficiaries are vulnerable groups of Roma youth between the ages of 15-22 years old with special reference to Roma girls.</narrative>
