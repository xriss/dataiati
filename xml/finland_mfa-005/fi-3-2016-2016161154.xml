   <narrative xml:lang="EN">F.a: Organizing and Advocacy for Decent Work for Domestic Workers</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Indonesian domestic workers? organising and leadership skills and advocacy work towards ratification of ILO convention no. 189 through training is supported in the project. Activities are focused in Jakarta and Yogyakarta where the local partner has alread
y a member base. The training focuses on domestic workers? basic rights, equality issues, promotion of organising, collective bargaining skills and advocacy work. A tailored organising campaign is carried out in the communities because reaching out to the 
domestic workers is very challenging. In addition, in 2016, a baseline about Indonesian migrant domestic workers? in neighbouring countries is carried out so that the International Domestic Workers? Federation (IDWF) can make plans to promote their status.
In Indonesia, the situation of domestic workers is very difficult ? Indonesia has not ratified ILO?s convention no. 189 nor does the national legislation support, acknowledge or either protect the domestic workers. It has been estimated that there are more
 than 10 million workers in the sector in Indonesia and more than 6 million Indonesian migrant domestic workers. Supporting their basic rights and organising begins with vert basic issues.Increasing organising rate (approximately 200 new members per year /
 20 %) among domestic workers in the two target areas is an expected result of the project. Also approx. 20 women in national level and approx. 60 women in local level are expected to gain practical tools for organising and advocacy work from the trainings
 as a result of the project. The project is also expected to bring visibility to the rights of domestic workers in Indonesia. Beneficiaries are local domestic workers? trade unions and their members in the project?s target areas.Project partner is the Inte
rnational Domestic Workers? Federation IDWF and its Indonesian member union JALAPRT which is the federation of local domestic workers? unions.</narrative>
