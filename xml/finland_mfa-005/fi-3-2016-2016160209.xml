ousehold scale;3) To design model for renewable energy system that is suited with urban housing typology in Vietnam; proposing two types of model including solar PV system for urban town house and wind energy system for houses on the Red River side4) To co
nstruct and monitor a complete solar PV system tailored for a typical tube-house for middle-class urban households of Hanoi;5) To strengthen partnership between the two countries: exchange knowledge research training design network and future business idea
s between Finland and Vietnam in this topic?Expected Results: 1) To create a sustainable energy community through research design and practice and social impacts2) To initiate new research and innovation collaborations between academic design and business 
groups between two nations in the area of sustainable energy3) To encourage these collaborations to work with civil society and individuals to support the exchange of research innovation and technology expertise and the translation of research knowledge in
to tangible benefits4) To establish local hub for Finland-Vietnam country activity in a particular area of sustainable energy transferring knowledge in green design and sustainable use of resources and consumption5) To contribute alternative solutions for 
renewable energy at the household scale in urban of Hanoi. Our design for a wind-solar system could potentially produce 50% of the total household electricity consumption. The system is also expected to meet certain design requirements such as high reliabi
lity ease of transportation and low maintenance no impact on the environment.6) To promote green economy through small-scale renewable energy solutions ??Activities:1) Research survey design networking and managing the project organized by IHS2)?Sustainabl

ing sustainable urban energy knowledge and experience from Finland to Vietnam. To exchange knowledge research training network and create background for future ideas between Finland and Vietnam in this topic.3) To design model for renewable energy system t
