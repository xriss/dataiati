  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Tunandoto is Swahili and means &#x2018;We have a dream&#x2019;. Tanzanian children in Tanga and Mwanza dream about a childhood that will equip them for life in which they can become all that they can be. In order to reach their full potential they desire a childhood
 free from exclusion, malnourishment, poverty, abuse, neglect, physical and intellectual boundaries, rape and various other challenges. The only way to reach that dream is to give them a chance by involving them and allowing them to participate and become 
agents of change in community development. FPCT and Fida have had community interventions with Youth with Disabilities Community Programme (YDCP) in Tanga. The programme was started in 2004 in order to address disability challenges and continues to support
 children with disabilities as well as act as a flagship initiative for disability issues in Tanzania and all over East Africa. Another development intervention of FPCT is in Mwanza where together with Fida they have a long history of working with orphans 
and vulnerable children (OVC). There has been a transition from supporting one individual child into meeting the needs of the entire community through community-based approach. Work in Mwanza has been recognized nationally for its impact on children&#x2019;s em
powerment and issues of improved food security in Mwanza region. The programme purpose is to have communities actively involved in the holistic development of children in Tanga and Mwanza. The programme consists of 3 components. Component 1 in Tanga, Compo
nent 2 in Mwanza and Component 3 for Horizontal learning. The horizontal learning component is a peer-to-peer learning initiative. Under this programme local governments and communities from Tanga and Mwanza connect with each other to identify, share, and 
replicate the very best practices in order to experience positive transformation in communities. This programme is directly contributing to the realisation of children&#x2019;s full-potential in Tanzania by involving the communities to help children access thei
r participation rights, protection rights and survival and development rights as mandated by the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC). The desired long-term impact is that the human rights violations against children will decrease i
n Tanga and Mwanza.</narrative>
