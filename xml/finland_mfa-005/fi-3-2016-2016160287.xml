   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The expected results of the OECD/UNDP joint Programme Tax Inspectors without Borders are 1) Tax administrations in developing countries are strengthened and 2) Knowledge on strategies to build the capacities of tax administrations in developing countries i
s generated and shared. The joint Programme between OECD and UNDP intends to send 100 tax inspectors to developing countries to carry out tax inspections together with their local counterparts (learning by doing). Strengthened tax administrations will supp
ort more efficient and fair tax collection and increase government revenues in particular its capability to mobilize domestic resources in line with target 17.1 of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The programme is targeted to LDC-countries in part
icular in Africa and to some countries in Asia and South America.The secretariat for the Programme that started on 1.4.2016 operates within OECD in Paris as a clearing house that will match the needs of the developing countries and the expertise that can b
e made available. The total budget of the Programme for 2016-2019 is 107 million USD of which the share of UNDP is 77 million USD. The UNDP share will cover the fees and travel costs of the experts as well as direct costs incurred by the Programme as well 
and general management support costs.The launch of the Programme was preceded by a pilot run by the OECD Tax and Development programme which proved that the joint inspections of large companies involving more experienced tax inspectors were the most effect
ive way of strengthening the taxation capacity in the developing countries. Examples of the results of the pilot programme include the doubling the tax revenue in Kenya in a year increase of tax revenue in Vietnam by 40 million USD and almost tripled tax r
evenue in Zambia.Finland will support the UNDP share of the Programme with a grant of 800000 euros for years 2016-2017.</narrative>
