   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The objective of South Sudan&apos;s water and sanitation program is to promote the right of South Sudanese to have an access to clean water and sanitation in four target cities. The project will improve the population&apos;s health status the societal position of wo
men and children local people&apos;s participation in the sector as well as the development and construction of the state and public services in a sustainable way. The project will initially focus on urban water management support. The support may later be exte
nded to cover water and sanitation sector development in rural areas. The project will reduce urban environmental problems.South Sudan is one of the world&apos;s least developed countries. For example the majority of the population is illiterate and maternal mo
rtality is the highest in the world. The country&apos;s basic infrastructure deficits are high. Lack of clean water and sanitation deficiencies pose serious health and environmental problems. Only 34% of the urban population has access to potable water system. 
Women and children are responsible for collecting water. Collecting takes significant amount of women&apos;s time and also hinders children&apos;s attendance to school. Water pipes are in short supply and waste water management is difficult. Lack of clean water in c
ities causes water-borne diseases such as cholera and diarrhea. In particular small children get sick easily. Water sanitation and hygiene (WASH) sector are one of the top priorities that Government of South Sudan has defined for itself. The project is par
t of the EU joint programming which is based on the Government of South Sudan Development Plan and aid strategy. Finland has delegated the responsibility of monitoring and managing of the project to Germany. Germany has been appointed by the EU member coun
tries as one of the leading donors in the water and sanitation sector.</narrative>
