   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Community-based Natural Resources Management (CBNRM) is a development approach that supports natural resource conservation. More conservation-minded people will define CBNRM as a natural resources conservation approach that brings along income and employme
nt. One could also argue that conservation of natural resources and sustainable use of these resources for the benefit of the community are two sides of the same coin. The community is more inclined to conserve natural resources if is able to realize benef
its accruing form such an activity. The wise use of these resources is a precondition for sustained development. CBNRM rests on the recognition that local communities must have direct control over the utilization and benefits of natural resources - wildlif
e forests water resources - in order to value them in a sustainable manner. CBNRM is both a conservation and rural development strategy involving community mobilization and organization institutional development comprehensive training enterprise developmen
t and monitoring of the natural resource base. It therefore aims for local stakeholder participation in the planning development management and policy making for a community as a whole.In the recent past the issue of community participation has been emphas
ized in the Kenyan constitution and subsequent legislations and these present opportunities for engagement to further promote CBNRM nationally and at county level. To optimize on the opportunities there is need to look at some core areas that support the p
articipation of citizens through robust advocacy mechanisms. They include but are not limited to: Citizen Awareness institutional strengthening and capacity building planning implementation monitoring + evaluation feedback + reporting mechanisms financial 
resource mobilization and Citizen Engagement Forums. There is therefore need for practitioners and local institutions to have a common understanding of the current opportunities understand inherent institutional weaknesses and form a strong advocacy coalit
ion to tap into the few existing opportunitiesThis project therefore hopes to bring together CBNRM practitioners from different sectors (forestry and water) to share common principles and approaches informed by experiences and to ensure that their voice in
forms the County integrated development strategies and plans.</narrative>
