  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project strengthens the organizational development of Colombian Trade Union Center CUT so that it can efficiently support its member unions and the trade union movement in general, and influence labor market issues at national level. Colombian trade un
ion movement is fragmented which makes collective bargaining and organizing workers difficult. Women&apos;s and young workers&apos; participation in trade union activities is still lower than men&apos;s and CUT&apos;s organizational capacity has deficiencies. The project aims
 at supporting and strengthening CUT as a trade union center according to the strategic plan approved in its 2014 Congress. As result of the project, the affiliation in CUT and its member unions increases, women and young people participate more actively i
n the trade union activities, sectorial trade union structures get stronger and CUT&apos;s communication improves, which in turn supports organizing efforts. Project contributes to strengthening existing sector unions and progressing towards sectorial organizat
ion structure in other sectors, increasing membership in unions and trade union central CUT by 10 % during the next three years, improvement of CUT&apos;s communication, increasing participation of women and young people in trade union activities and improving 
their access to decision-making bodies in the unions. Project&apos;s beneficiaries are workers organized in trade unions in the eight target sectors and the trade union central CUT. The project is implemented by Colombian trade union central Central Unitaria de
 Trabajadores de Colombia (CUT). CUT was established in 1986 and SASK has cooperated with CUT many years through projects.</narrative>
