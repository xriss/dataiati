   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Community managed ecological sanitation and waste management project for Livingstone Zambia</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Project aims to improve poor sanitation and waste management situation in Livingstone Zambia. The local partner is an NGO named Livingstone Green Iniative (LGI). Overall objective is to establish community managed ecological dry toilet (DT) sanitation as a
n alternative for the conventional sanitation approaches in water+sanitation and solid waste management.Poverty levels in the high-density urban areas of Livingstone are high. Most households have no regular source of income and they have no access to prop
er water+sanitation facilities which result in spreading of diseases and many other social environmental and econ problems. Cross-cutting issues:a) Human rights: the project activities focus on the least privileged communities in Livingstone, it provides t
hem with a conducive environment and a source of income from which they can provide for their basic needs.b) Gender equality: The majority of workers at the vegetable markets in Livingstone are women. They form the main beneficiaries of the composting of m
arket waste and establishment of tree nurseries. Both women and men participate and benefit from DT and glass components of the project. Improving WASH in schools benefits especially girls.c) Climate proofing: Dry toilets are flood and drought proof and th
us adapted to climate change and variability as well as reduce the risk of disasters such as groundwater contamination and disease epidemics.Institutional arrangements:The project will make use of existing community structures such as Market Committees and
 Area Development Committees which are part of the Local Authority (City Council) and Zambia Environmental Agency (ZEMA) Zambia Development Agency (ZDA) and Forestry Department. Local schools and vocational training centres and local leaders are involved. 
Beneficiaries:Market women and the youth for the composting and less privileged households for the dry toilet component. Glass recycling will create employment for males and females of all ages. School children+vulnerable youth are involved in WASH and DT-
training.Key activities. 1. Sensitization education and trainings of WASH+Dry toilets (incl. building) in all levels2. Establishment of DTs in urban and peri-urban areas which have no water and sewerage system3. Composting of organic waste at vegetable mar
kets and establishment of tree nurseries 4. Glass recycling for production of building materials, to be done by small business enterprises of community members</narrative>
