   <narrative xml:lang="EN">&quot;&quot;&quot;Jikalahari is an umbrella of environmental non-governmental organizations founded in 2002. The mission of the organization is to work for protecting the remaining forests of Riau, and that the local communities would benefit of the forest resources. The
 goals of this joint project is to encourage policy changes, to support the participation of the civil society in stopping deforestation, to promote and to monitor the implementation of forest-related legislation, to promote participation and rights of loc
al and indigenous communities in management and protection of natural resources and to promote efficient and sustainable landscape level management in peatland areas. The total project areas cover over 50 % of Sumatran peatland, which in turn equals to abo
ut 20 % of all the peatlands in Indonesia. Also a mountaineous forest area, the Rimba corridor, is included in the project. High species biodiversity is typical for these project ecosystems. All project areas possess high levels of biodiversity and act as 
massive carbon sinks. They are also important for water conservation, transportation, and providing livelihoods. The area is threatened by logging, deforestation and drainage of peatlands due to pulp and oil palm plantations. Together with the Jikalahari h
ead office, the project will be carried out by four other NGOs: Mitra Insani, Elang, Hakiki and Jaringan Masyarakat Gambut Riau (JMGR), and the Riau Corruption Trial (RCT). Main methods are workshops and trainings, compiling reports and evaluations, advoca
cy and campaigning, along with monitoring implementation of the legislation. Beneficiaries of the project include 29 communities around the Riau province. Target groups include also local government, state government officials, big forest companies and Jik
alahari member organizations and international partners. The project will contribute to reduction of the the country?s carbon emissions that are caused by deforestation, as well as facilitate forest management by communitites and promote the rights of indi
genous groups. Law enforcement is expected to prevent committing forest crimes. Local communities are also expected to become better aware of area protection and conservation. In addition, Jikalahari?s capacity as a network of campaigning and advocacy to s
ave Riau?s forests will be improved. Experiences from this project can be utilized for similar struggles in other areas. http://jikalahari.or.id/&quot;&quot;&quot;</narrative>
