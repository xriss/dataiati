  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project aims to increase area of rehabilitated mangrove ecosystems through participatory planning and mapping procesess and developing community livelihoods as an alternative source of income for communities who depend on mangrove forests. Community a
wareness through village facilitation and organisation will also be promoted through field facilitators at the village level. Law enforcement will be endorsed through serial discussions with local authorities (local government) and mass media campaigning. 
The target area, Tanjung Panjang Nature Reserve, is a conservation area of 3000 ha is located in Pohuwato District in North Sulawesi. The area is dominated by various species of mangroves and several endemic and migrant birds. The mangrove ecosystem in the
 reserve, however, is at highly critical condition due to the conversion of mangoves to fish and shrimp ponds by outsiders. Lack of awareness of the local communities and lack of law enforcement have made the situation uncontrolled. The expected results of
 the project include 10 000 mangrove sapling planted which provide more habitat for fishes and other marine biota. Two fishermen and/or women groups are supported in livelihood activities, marketing and silvo-fishery, as well as data and information is col
lected that can be used for the development of village and district level policies on mangrove management. Two silvo-fishery model plots will be established for demonstrating sustainable fisheries. Data and information will be brought to a broader public t
hrough mass media (national newspapers, magazines and TV) and social media. JAPESDA also plans to write book on the experience (not included in this project). JAPESDA would collaborate with other actors that work for mangrove conservation in Indonesia thro
ugh a network that is being supported by Siemenpuu and facilitated by Forest Watch Indonesia (Siemenpuu project 15019AAS). https://japesda.wordpress.com</narrative>
