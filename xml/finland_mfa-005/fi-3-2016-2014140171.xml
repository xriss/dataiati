   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project will train current and new members in basic rights, labour legislation and negotiation skills and target 2 000 new members annually, in addition to industrial establishments around the capital city area of Mozambique, also in the growth regions
 of central and northern parts of the country. Basic rights awareness, legislation knowledge and improved negotiation skills strengthen the union?s ability to effectively represent its members? interests and negotiate better working conditions, including s
alaries and occupational health and safety conditions. The union becomes increasingly representative, visible and effective. The project benefits immediately around twenty thousand food and beverage industry workers and in future even more. The current num
ber of members is around 11 000, the potentail currently around 20 000, and because the new development of the sector is at its early stages through new investments, the number of workers is estimated to multiply in the coming years.The project partner is 
the food industry workers? union SINTIAB of Mozambique, the biggest and most representative union of the country organizing food and beverage industry, whose membership consists of workers of mills and other grain processing establishments, dairies, food-c
anning factories, cooking oil crushing plants and beverage industries. Other unions in food sector are the smaller specialized unions SINTIA (sugar), SINTIC (cashew nuts) and SINTMAP (fishing and fish processing), with which there have been discussions abo
ut possible mergers, in order to build one large food industry organization. To speed up the closer cooperation between the food sectors, the smaller unions may be invited to attend some SINTIAB activities.</narrative>
