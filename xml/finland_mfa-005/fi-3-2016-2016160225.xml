  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Iraq has a multitude of challenges for which it needs appropriate long-term support by the international community. Security situation is challenging because of ISIL but also because of tensions between ethnic and religious groups. The national reconciliat
ion process has advanced slowly.The economic situation is very difficult and the need for humanitarian assistance has almost doubled within one year with estimated 10 million people being in need of assistance. Internally Displaced People (IDPs) amount to 
almost 33 million and the Kurdistan autonomous region is hosting more than 250.000 refugees from Syria.The Funding Facility for Immediate Stabilization (FFIS) by UNDP Iraq aims to support the Government of Iraq to address the immediate stabilization and re
covery needs in newly accessible areas which allows for the sustainable return of internally displaced persons and refugees. Currently the Fund is active in the governorates of Salah al-Din Ninewah Anbar and Diyala.The contributions to the FFIS amount to r
oughly 82 MUSD by the end of June 2016. The Finnish funding granted in May 2016 was 1 MEUR and an additional pledge of 3 MEUR was made in July. The fund is established for the time being until the end of 2018.The fund finances and implements projects in fo
ur windows: 1) Public Works and Light Infrastructure Rehabilitation, 2) Support to jump-starting of livelihoods and jobs creation, 3) Capacity Building in managing the stabilization efforts for local government officials, 4) Community Reconciliation projec
ts. Women and youth are very well represented as beneficiaries: special emphasis lies on women&apos;s economic empowerment and livelihoods. Support to the FFIS is in line with the Finnish policy on Women Peace + Security (1325). Finland is part of the Steering 
Committee of the FFIS in Baghdad. Finland aims at protecting women&apos;s rights and non-discrimination in the activities of the fund.The FFIS fund works in close cooperation with the Prime Minister&apos;s Office governors security forces local communities and civil
 society organizations and is an integral part of Government&apos;s overall stabilization efforts.The Fund operates in very high risk environment where the fighting has just ended. Due to the difficult domestic situation the political risks are also high. Howev
er the risk management systems of UNDP are adequate and thus the risks can be justified. Especially as non-action would constitute an even higher risk.</narrative>
