   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The conflict in Syria on its sixth year has developed into the largest humanitarian catastrophe of our time and a massive regional development crisis. The conflict spreads the radicalism and has facilitated ISIL become a global threat. The Syrian conflict 
has its direct consequences to the security in Europe including Finland.Access to school and jobs has been found the main drivers for the survival of the refugees and keeping up their hope for the better. Equally lack thereof is behind the decision for man
y to immigrate to Europe.At the London Syria Conference of 4th February 2016 the neighbouring countries of Syria and the donor governments agreed upon i.e. the access to school for all the children and opening of the labor market for Syrian refugees and cr
eating 11 million new jobs. The employability of women is much harder than of men also in Jordan which however has opened its? labor market. Especially the livelihoods sector has been seriously underfunded.The vast majority of the Syrian refugees (roughly 
85 %) lives in host-communities rather than on the refugee camps. It?s essential that aid activities are also targeted to these often already poor societies and their local vulnerable in this case in Jordan on areas bordering Syria. UN Women?s Eid-bi-Eid (
Hand in hand) project?s goal is that the women and their communities ? both Jordanian and refugee - are supported to be resilient to external shock through targeted livelihoods protection and leadership engagement. The project aims to advance women?s emplo
yment by 1) advocating for legislative changes, 2) providing cash-for-work opportunities in refugee camps and targeted vocation training and job matching on host-communities, 3) increase women?s protection and access to justice by training judiciary, and 4
) providing training and leadership coaching to women.Finland has financed the previous phase of the project on 2014-2016 (05 MEUR). The project managed to provide 172 women with regular cash-for-work at Za?atari camp and help match 82 Jordanian women to p
ermanent jobs in surrounding host-communities. Protection services and leadership training has been provided. The MFA has been satisfied with the cooperation and the results of the previous phase. UN Women is the largest cash-for-work -provider for women i
n Jordan and one of the three priority UN partner agencies (along with UNICEF and UNFPA).</narrative>
