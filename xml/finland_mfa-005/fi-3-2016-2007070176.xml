   <narrative xml:lang="EN">We propose continuing the project in 2017 in order to better ensure the sustainability of the project and the continued use of the DPO building by disabled organizations. The DPO building (purchased with Finnish MFA funding) that currently houses the proje
ct office and also several local Disabled People?s Organizations (DPOs) is used for most project training events and meetings. It was purchased in 2009 and has been a crucial component of the current project. It is also central to the sustainability plans 
of this project: the project plans that PwDs (People with Disabilities) in Arkhangai province would be able to continue to use the building for many years after the project has ended. To this end the project team has met with the governor of Arkhangai prov
ince to discuss plans to transfer the ownership of the building to the local authorities once the project has ended. Discussions have been promising and a preliminary plan has been agreed according to which ownership will be transferred to the local author
ities following the completion of the project and they will pay the utility costs of the building after this date. Unfortunately past experience shows that in Mongolia such agreements may not be honoured. This is a particular danger right now since there w
ill be local elections in the summer of 2016 and it is possible that whoever is elected to power will not honour this agreement. Continuing the project in 2017 is in these circumstances a good option since it allows project staff extra time to search for a
 sustainable solution to the upkeep of the DPO building should the current agreement not be honoured.Carrying on the project in 2017 also gives us the chance to further strengthen the capacity of the local DPO Committee and work together with local authori
ties once more to ensure that the good work carried out by this project over the last roughly 10 years can be continued sustainably in the future.The budget for 2016 is significantly smaller than for 2015 since the focus is shifting now entirely to working
 on the issue of sustainability.</narrative>
