   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project will have the overall objective to alleviate poverty in Myanmar through maximising the role of women in rural development. This will be achieved through the facilitation of the formation of Women Groups (WGs) that are able to mobilise resources
 to support village development works, and by increasing their capacity to have increased participation in village level decision making processes. The WGs will also be supported in networking with government, village and township authorities, by taking tr
aining in leadership, networking, and proposal writing skills. Secondly the project will focus on empowering women to obtain improved and sustainable socio-economic livelihoods.Based on the assessment done in the project area&#x2019;s women groups following the
 pilot phase, it was evident that women members understand the importance of the group and how the savings and credit scheme can support to improve their livelihoods. The groups want more intensive facilitation and support in the areas of management, book 
keeping, entrepreneurship skills, linking with other actors - basically to connect to markets and legalising the women&#x2019;s groups. Expected results are:&#x2022; Women&#x2019;s Groups are able to mobilise resources to support village development works and have increa
sed participation in village level decision-making process.&#x2022; Women increase skills and knowledge in village development decisions-making and activities.&#x2022; Improved and sustainable socio-economic livelihoods. This is done through activities as support in
