   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The programme works for the improvement of the quality of life of community members, especially vulnerable children I Nabuyoga area, East Uganda. The current focus is on the promotion of livelihoods and education. Although 91% of children start primary edu
cation, many of them drop out and only less than thrid of pupils ending the 6th grade achieve needed literacy and numeracy skills. Diseases like malaria and HIV and AIDS are prevalent. Many problems and challenges are linked to weak economic and livelihood
s opportunities. Currently farmers are mobilizing themselves to work as groups and unions, and youth and women receive vocational training and support. Farmers are trained in effective ans sustainable farming methods, food storaging and marketing. Educatio
n and health services are promoted by community action. Community people receive information about their public rights in the local Dhopadhola language in order to understand and to claim for their rights. 112 health volunteers and 60 &#x2018;model mothers&#x2019; t
rain other community people on nutrition and on the prevention of malaria and HIV. Several church leaders are involved in awareness raising on HIV and AIDS. Through community action, school lunch meals have been ensured in all schools in the area. Communit
y action has also resulted in better access of health services and this work is continuing. The community action groups also act as &#x2018;watch dogs&#x2019; for whom children dare to report issues like people trying to steal school lunch fees. Newspapers are provi
ded for schools in order to boost children&#x2019;s reading habits and skills. The programme benefits 15.000 people in 37 villages. During the year 2016 the programme will undergo an evaluation. The results will be used to re-design the programme.The main partn
er is World Vision Uganda that runs the implementation and accounts for the use of funding.</narrative>
