   <narrative xml:lang="EN">F.a: Strengthening DRR, livelihoods and human rights in rural Haitian communities</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Haiti is a country highly affected by natural disasters. Throughout its history, it has suffered from cyclones, hurricanes, tropical storms, torrential rains, floods and earthquakes. These have had a severely negative impact on the livelihoods of the popul
ation, and they have exacerbated the fragile state and its poor communities. The project aims at decreasing the vulnerability of Haitian communities to natural disasters and increasing their resilience through work with right-holders and local and national
 level authorities. A central component of the project is strengthening local civil society organisations and CBOs so that they are able to engage as active subjects in the development of their society, and be able to influence policies and thus hold autho
rities accountable.The main objective:The overall objective of the project is to strengthen the resilience of Haitian communities through the implementation of priority actions on disaster risk reduction (DRR), strengthening of local level livelihoods, and
 increasing the communities awareness of their rights. 1. Expected results:? Community members are better prepared to face natural disasters commonly expected in Haiti, and able to respond to and recover from them effectively. ? Communities have developed 
their socio-economical livelihoods via eco-friendly initiatives. ? Communities and local organisations acknowledge their rights and are empowered to advocate and fight for them, and participate actively in decision-making processes to build a stronger civi
l society. ? LWF/DWS Haiti has improved the quality of its work, increased its visibility and understanding of its country programme, and enhanced its partner relations and fundraising efforts.Right-holders/beneficiaries: The project beneficiaries consist 
of people living in vulnerable Haitian communities, local civil society organisations and CBOs. The total estimated number of beneficiaries in the three regions is 35,263 people.Implementing partner: The Lutheran World Federation/Department of World Servic
e (LWF/DWS) Haiti. At department level, the project activities are implemented by LWF?s three local partners: In Macaya, Fondation de Nouvelle Grand Anse (FNGA), in Foret de Pins, Reseau pour la Sauvegarde de Foret des Pins (RSFP) and in Les Palmes, Reseau
 des Organisations pour le Developpement des Palmes (RODEP).</narrative>
