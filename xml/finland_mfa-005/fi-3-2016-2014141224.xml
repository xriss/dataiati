  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project consists of advocacy towards the national authorities in order for the areas where indigenous peoples live in voluntary isolation in the Peruvian Amazon Region to be declared as indigenous peoples? territories. This will result in guaranteeing 
these peoples? rights as well as protecting the forests within the territories. In addition to the advocacy work, information will be collected on the territories to meet the requirements of an initial review, and communication work will be carried out als
o on international level. AIDESEP has worked hard on this theme recently. Now it wants to guarantee that the attention received by the theme leads to the government of Peru establishing the necessary decrees to form the indigenous territories within the ar
ea in question.AIDESEP was registered in 1985 as an NGO representing the indigenous peoples of the Peruvian Amazon Region. It aims to consolidate the indigenous territories both physically and legally as the basis for sustainable human development. It prom
otes a model where human development is tied to indigenous peoples? ancestral norms, and which the state applies as its development policy towards the indigenous peoples, granting autonomy to them. It also wants to establish an indigenous economy based on 
technology compatible with the environment and natural resources.AIDESEP does active advocacy work both on national and international level in favour of indigenous peoples? land and other rights. It currently coordinates the Amazon Basin indigenous peoples
? network, COICA. It collaborates with several Peruvian ministries in social, legal and environmental issues. Almost all the Peruvian Amazon Region indigenous peoples form part of AIDESEP.www.aidesep.org.pe</narrative>
