  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Wajir Women For Peace (WWFP) started its peace building actions in the ?90s. The formation of the organization was driven by demand for peace and security for the people of Wajir District. At the time of formation of WWFP the district was aflame with deadl
y clan wars. The effects of the violent fights were wearing down hard on women and children in terms of death maiming loss of livelihoods and the resultant animosity.Despite comprising 60% of the population women in Wajir County remain underrepresented in 
all positions of leadership. Since Kenya gained independence in 1963 Wajir County currently made up of 6 constituencies and 30 wards has never had a woman elected in parliament or in the local government. Few ever dare to venture into politics and those wh
o try face serious cultural social religious economic marital and family barriers in their quest for political leadership. Many women are also hindered by their illiteracy and lack of exposure. It therefore remains an uphill task for women to vie for polit
ical leadership in the County.Despite the Constitution of Kenya providing a platform for women empowerment the Somali women face challenges from the enforcement of retrogressive cultural practices among others the practice of FGM/C and denial of education 
to the girl-child. This state of affairs is perpetuated by the elders and household heads (Male) who view culture as the constitution of managing women. Thus Somali culture which is patriarchal lock out women from assuming leadership positions and inhibit 
their access to justice and human rights. The proposed project intends to identify the hurdles women face when participating in general elections with a view of eliminating them. Women will also be empowered to participate fully in County government leader
shipProject specific objectives,?Communities and particularly women mobilized empowered and supported to participate effectively in the electoral process in 2017 ?Ethnic dialogue and reconciliation activities preventing violence including gender based in t
he pre and post election period promoted by the end of the project ?Promoting appropriate access to justice and human rights among women and girls especially in the eradication of female genital cut through advocacy</narrative>
