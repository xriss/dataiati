   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The owners of Sera Helsinki Anna Kokkonen and Hanna Puharinen are longtime friends who studied at Aalto University together and graduated as Master of Science in engineering in 2007. In addition to studies they share a passion for interior decoration and d
esign. 2010 Anna moved to Africa with her family. From Ethiopia Anna found a carpet factory where women handicraft beautiful woolen carpets. We want to make these carpets available to all Finns. Our carpets combine Scandinavian vision and design with Ethio
pian handicraft traditions: https://serahelsinki.com. The carpet factory benefits from the project as the Ethiopian business market has grown small and similar factories have been closed. Our aim is to get 52 new employees to the factory. At the beginning 
of our cooperation the factory employed only 8 weavers. Since then the number of employees has been doubled. At the moment the factory employes 16 weavers and 13 thread makers. For us in Sera Helsinki it is important to preserve the handicraft traditions w
hich have existed for centuries. Our aim is to provide vocational education for 10 women as weavers and 20 women as thread makers during the project. Our aim is to improve the living standards and socioeconomic status of the women in the society. We have d
esigned a bonus system for the factory through which the weavers and thread makers have the possibility to double their monthly income. This has already improved the input of the employees to their work. We want to teach the women to understand their value
 as employees. We are working on to improve the women&apos;s wellbeing and health ? the development is monitored yearly using a questionnaire. The factory&apos;s capacity to produce thread does not meet the requirements. Due to this reason we are purchasing woollen 
thread from the Ethiopian countryside where it is produced in private households. These households will also benefit from our project as we&apos;ll be able to improve their livelihood. With our current capacity we can produce VAT free sales worth 11535? per mon
th and with full capacity of 48 weavers our monthly sales would be 34425?.</narrative>
