  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Negotiations are intensified especially in Chinese construction companies. OHS and basic rights trainers? training makes the work more effective and attracts new members. Campaigns for ratification of C94 and C167 and influencing legislation reforms start.
 The unions operate in rather difficult environments, because compliance with laws is inadequate and negotiation power and leverage of unions fairly weak. It is difficult to organize and represent interests of especially seasonal and informal workforce. In
tensified interest representation, campaigning and cooperation have an impact on spread of working conditions that guarantee decent work, reasonable living standards and security. BWI affiliates in the project countries improve working conditions in infras
tructure projects through negotiations, social dialogue, and campaigning and other interest representation. Growth in visibility and activism of unions brings thousands of new members who are provided with education and interest representation services. Un
ions learn to effectively campaign for ratification of conventions and reforms in laws as well as compliance with standards. Beneficiaries are construction and wood workers in the project countries, officials, leaders, shop stewards and OHS representatives
 responsible for negotiations, education and campaigns, and current and new members and youth and women activists. Building and Wood Workers? International is the international federation of construction and wood workers? unions that with this project supp
orts its affiliates in three countries. Currently these unions have slightly over 100 000 members, but in the growth sector membership could be double or triple. BWI coordinates and manages the project from the Geneva head office and Johannesburg Africa an
d Middle East office, and additionally each country has a nominated focal point that ensures the work flow at local level.</narrative>
