   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The aim is to strengthen public sector trade union in Namibia so that it can effectively respond and confront the violations of workers&apos; rights in public sector that result from the neoliberal policies implemented by Namibian government. Besides that, the 
project aims at improving the capacity of union&apos;s shop stewards to solve workers&apos; problems at work place level. Restructuring of public services and neoliberal policies of the government have accelerated the weakening of working conditions in the public se
ctor through contract agency labor and out-sourcing. Public workers&apos; union NAPWU has not been able to influence enough these processes. The capacity of union&apos;s shop stewards to defend workers in work places is low, which also weakens the credibility of the
 union. The project strengthens the public workers? trade union and its capacity to advocate and influence quality public services and defense of workers. As result of the project, 60 shop stewards are trained, union membership increases by 5 %, an increas
ing number of workers&apos; problems are solved in the work place level by shop stewards, the union has conducted a research on public restructuring and its impact on workers, and has developed a proposal and strategy on alternative models to guarantee quality 
public services and decent work for workers. The project benefits public sector workers in Namibia and the members of public workers union NAPWU. The project is implemented by public workers union NAPWU together with global public workers Federation PSI. T
he same partners implemented the planning phase of this project in 2014.</narrative>
