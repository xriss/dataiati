  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Poor access to education including skills training is one of the biggest development challenges in Sierra Leone. Only around 43% of the adult population  (over 15 years) are literate (male 55%, female 33%). Girls? school drop-out is significant for example
 due to parents? lack of funds and cultural practices such as early marriage. The districts of Koinadugu and Bombali suffer from lack of education and livelihood opportunities, and women and girls are often discriminated against with regards to access to a
nd control over productive assets, employment, skills and education.The main objective of the project is to increase the economic and social well-being of vulnerable girls and women in Makeni and Kabala towns and surroundings by providing skills training t
o often vulnerable women and girls who have had limited access to education and often have poor literacy skills. Training is offered in vocational skills that are relevant in the employment market and can also lead to self-employment and small business opp
ortunities. Expected results:120 girls and young women in skills training centres in Kabala and Makeni are provided with training in dressmaking, weaving, textile dyeing, catering and hospitality trades and agriculture. Entrepreneurial/business skills deve
lopment, on-the-job training/internships with external outlets and production learning opportunities at the centres will lead to employment or self-employment of graduates. New vocational skills together with improved life and literacy skills contribute to
 graduates holistic empowerment, increased self-confidence and reduced vulnerability.Right-holders/ beneficiaries:Rural and urban girls and young womenImplementing partner:Forum for African Women Educationalists (FAWE Sierra Leone)</narrative>
