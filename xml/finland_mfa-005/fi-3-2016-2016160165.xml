   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project purpose is to improve working conditions in India by providing increased opportunities for the workers in India&apos;s export industry sector to negotiate over terms and conditions of their employment. Project aims to achieve results by influencing 
working conditions through both advocacy targeting companies in Europe and through grass roots worker trainings and dialogue. Pressure to improve working conditions is generated both from above and below. The joint project between Finnwatch and Cividep wil
l map operations in India of Finnish companies and of companies that have operations in Finland producing information on their production units and suppliers. This information will be used for cases studies in three different industrial sectors. The resear
ch will be conducted in cooperation with an Indian NGO Cividep. The results of the study will be published in Finland and in Europe and companies will be encouraged to become involved in the improvement of working conditions together with the employees of 
the investigated factories/farms and local associations. The project partner Cividep will organise training sessions for the employees and will support local trade unions and NGOs at the grass roots level. As a result of the project activities 600 employee
s will receive training in labour rights, three factories/farms will have a trade union or democratically elected workers&apos; committee, 100 European companies will receive additional information on labour rights in India, 10 companies will be offered tailore
d materials for taking into account human rights in their supply chains/operations in India, and 10 million European consumers will be more familiar with the origins of the products they purchase and the related human rights risks. The awareness of consume
rs companies and employees on labour rights will increase as a result of project activities. This will contribute towards a decrease in human rights violations in India&apos;s export industry, companies will increasingly conduct their own human rights risk asse
ssments, and employees and organisations representing them will have increased opportunities to negotiate for better working conditions.</narrative>
