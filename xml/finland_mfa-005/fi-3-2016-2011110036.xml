   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Somalia has been ranked as the worst country to be a mother by the brittish aid group Save the Children in 2015. It is based on the statistical information of maternal health child mortality education and women&apos;s income in Somalia. According to the report 
1 out of 18 women eventually die of a maternal cause and 1 child in 7 does not reach their fifth birthday. Somalia continues to struggle with political unstabilitya long-running armed conflict and a humanitarian crisis of 1.3 million internally displaced p
eople. Due to Somalia&apos;s malfunctioning government and lack of education NGO&apos;s role in providing health care services is crucial. This project is a continuation to African Care&apos;s current Maternity Clinic and Training project in Afgoye Somalia. The project p
rovides healthcare services for pregnant women and their children and training for midwives traditional birth attendants (TBAs) and community health workers (CHWs) in Baidoa Garoowe and Hargeysa. The project has been very successful with around 15 000 outp
atients treated and more than 1000 babies delivered annually. In addition every year 65 TBAs and CHWs have received training. In the new phase the support for sexual violence victims will be further developed and training monitoring and lobbying will be in
tensified.The project&apos;s objectives are very much in line with the cross-cutting themes of the Finnish development policy and several of the objectives of UN&apos;s Agenda 2030 in reducing gender inequality strengthening women&apos;s and girls&apos; rights and possibiliti
es advancing the realization of human rights and securing good health and well-being for everyone. By providing better maternal and sexual health for women women are better equipped to take part in society.The direct beneficiaries of the project are the wo
men living in the Afgoye area who have the possibility to deliver in a safe environment with the help of trained personel as well as the TBA&apos;s and CHW&apos;s who receive training and the women and children treated by them. Indirectly the whole surrounding commu
nity will benefit of the information spread by midwives health workers and patients.</narrative>
