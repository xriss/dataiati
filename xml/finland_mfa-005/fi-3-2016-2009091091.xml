  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The capacity of local partners to plan and implement and effectively and efficiently projects is a critical condition for achievement FCA?s programme objectives and having development impacts. Capacity building supports partner?s operational capacity and h
elps organisations to become active civil society actors and opinion leaders that can work with rights-holders and duty-bearers and promote and advocate issues such as right to education, land rights, human rights and gender equality and women?s empowermen
t, and thereby contribute to sustainable social development.The objective of the capacity building project is that implementing partners in Liberia and Sierra Leone are able to deliver effective quality projects to pursue development objectives set togethe
r with FCA. Additional objective is that partners become more independent and rely less on FCA?s support in implementation. Furthermore, the aim is to improve partners? access to local resources for their operations and thereby increase their organisationa
l sustainability.  Expected results:Capacity building will result in improved quality and impact of partner?s work. Methods for capacity building include mentoring by FCA staff, workshops organised by FCA and if necessary, provision of support to partners 
for attending trainings organised by other actors and institutions. Training is organised on topics such participatory approached, gender, conflict sensitivity, project cycle management, budgeting, and financial management and reporting. Local partners are
 also supported to build up efficient organisational structure with well-functioning board, management team and field staff. In addition to joint workshops, cross-fertilisation among partners within and between programme countries is facilitated through ex
change visits.Right-holders/ beneficiaries:Local partner organisations of FCA and their staffImplementing partner:FCA</narrative>
