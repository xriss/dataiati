  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">It has been widely recognized that women have the potential to be the engine of economic and development progress. The Gudri Entrepreneurship Training for Women ?project?s main objective is to tackle the gender inequalities faced by the target group on a s
ocial and economic and level in their societies. The project will capacitate 300 underprivileged women and adolescent girls (16+) from 6 slum districts to become self-earning empowered women with sufficient skills and capacity to manage their own micro-bus
inesses. The women are offered a one year training consisting of several different training modules: skills training (Gudri-handicraft techniques) entrepreneurship and sustainable income leadership capacity building on economic empowerment and human rights
, basic education. The training enables the women to start their income generating micro-projects with experts supporting them in the process. The Gudri-project will establish ?a social enterprise? based on a self-owned co-operative model which will be run
 by the women themselves with support of experts. This ensures their ownership and management of the enterprise. The participants will be forming groups consisting of 20-25 women and a mentor. The co-operatives are offered set-up grants (micro loans) that 
will enable them to become self-reliant. Support is offered to the women on a regular basis also after the training. Experts will facilitate the workshops with additional support of volunteers. The beneficiaries are from the most disadvantaged communities 
of Jaipur city. They are from the lowest caste or untouchables, illiterate, alienated from society, living under poverty line, lacking regular income, lacking house or sufficient food and water supply. Background study on the target communities was done in
 2013. The project will build on lessons learned from the pilot project of two womens&apos; groups that started in 2012.The training modules and methods have been formed and improved together with the beneficiaries based on their capacity gaps and needs. Positi
ve impacts can be seen in the pilot communities in Jaipur. The women have seen improvement in their status within the community both socially and economically as their voices are being heard and they are able to earn a living which has raised their familie
s? standard of living. The women have also invested in the education of their children.</narrative>
