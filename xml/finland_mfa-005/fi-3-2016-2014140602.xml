   <narrative xml:lang="EN">F.a: South Sudan: Strengthening the Role of South Sudan Political Institutions in Conflict Resolution</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In August 2015 the South Sudan leadership signed the Agreement on the Resolution of the Conflict in South Sudan (ARC) following 20 months of mediation led by the Intergovernmental Authority for Development (IGAD) and supported by the international communit
y. The Agreement is aimed at ending the crisis that erupted in December 2013, which has left South Sudan in dire economic and humanitarian condition. The ARC has come as a result of protracted high-level negotiations in Addis Ababa. Inclusive political dia
logue, spearheaded by South Sudan leadership, will be required towards facilitating buy-in and ownership, as well as a balanced and considerate implementation of the peace agreement. Sustainable peace in South Sudan should be nationally owned, and implemen
ted through an inclusive and representative political framework. A Transitional Government of National Unity (TGoNU) principally based on a power-sharing agreement risks entrenching historical and war-time divisions if issues related to failing leadership 
are not addressed. An inclusive and strong political framework should constrains the political debate to the political arena. Leadership in South Sudan must transition from being a conflict actor to playing a key role in addressing conflict factors, includ
ing stabilizing the economy, delivery of services, infrastructure, inclusive governance and managing regional and international interests in South Sudan. This will contribute to creating an enabling environment for the implementation of the ARC through re-
aligning political interests with existing gaps in governance structures. By integrating multiple tracks of dialogue with a lens towards informing transformational leadership and inclusive efforts towards peace, CMI?s South Sudan portfolio in 2016 aims to 
address the lack of resilient institutions that frames the political debate. Within the framework of this project efforts will be geared towards coalition-building between and within political leadership including political parties, parliament and other go
vernment institutions, with an emphasis on providing opportunity and support to engage meaningfully with marginalized groups in a way that demonstrates the practical possibility and real value of such efforts.</narrative>
