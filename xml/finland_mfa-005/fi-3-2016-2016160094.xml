   <narrative xml:lang="EN">To inform key stakeholders about the extent and dynamics of FGM practices among women above 18 years old for awareness raising and call for collective remedies based on baseline study recommendations. Advocate for law reforms and enforcement against FGM pr
actices by building the capacity of legal personnel and justice systems to deliver effective services in combating and handling cases of FGM. Strengthen the capacity of girls women and community in the selected Districts to report FGM related actions. To s
trengthen community based institutions to carry out policy and law advocacy on elimination of FGM practices. The presence of the law as it stands today criminalizes FGM for girls below the age of 18 and remains silent for women above the age of 18 who are 
forced to undergo the practice. A number of efforts have been undertaken by LHRC in collaboration with other CSOs to advocate for amendment of the law on FGM to criminalize FGM despite the age so as to be in conformity with the international principles on 
equality and fighting all forms of violence against women however there have been no research data to support the existence of cases of women above the age of 18 who are victims of FGM. Hence this project will significantly use the findings to advocate for
 reforms of the law on FGM. In addition there is poor enforcement of the existing laws in addressing FGM there have been lack of political will as on fighting against FGM hence creating a loophole for those who wish to maintain the practice. The developmen
tal impact of this project will be women girls and children enjoy secured life that is free from FGM threats. Outcomes include, strengthened legal and social protection of women and girls in Tanzania Baseline study conducted to inform key stakeholders abou
t the extent and dynamics of FGM practices among women above 18 years old. Beneficiaries of this project include indigenous women who have undergone through FGM practice female political activists and other political women who are useful for influencing po
licy change. At local level the primary beneficiaries are rural women and girls. secondary beneficiaries are CBOs police forces and judicial system circumcisers teachers and raditional healers.</narrative>
