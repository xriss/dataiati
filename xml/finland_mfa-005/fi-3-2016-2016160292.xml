   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project combines poverty reduction efforts of farmers? organizations in three countries: Ethiopia Tanzania and Nepal. In Ethiopia and Nepal the projects deal with forestry and in Tanzania horticulture. Increasing the market power of farmers by stronger
 farmers? organizations usually cooperatives has the potential to increase the income of the rural poor. Capacity building of the organizations the staff and the members is at the core of this development.The organizations and farmers are provided with ski
lls and technology to produce a good quality and environmentally sustainable product market linkages (national and international) to be able to sell the product management capacity to cope with the finances and other issues in the organizations and ways to
 add value to the product where applicable (improved quality decreased post-harvest losses grading etc.) all in order to benefit the organizations and farmers and their families. These matters can be sustainably realized with support from the project.The p
roject is designed to encourage women to take part in all the activities of which some are specifically planned for poor marginalized women. At the core of the project is positive influence on food security and sustainable use of natural resources specific
ally forests. The project will prevent further forest loss by planting more trees and using the current stock sustainably and agroforestry has the potential to provide additional income and food to men and women smallholders. More leverage is sought by col
laborating with other development actors. The project approach has potential to bring about sustainable economic development as well as increased productivity higher yields and diversification of activities leading to increased food security and trade.FFD 
has a strong background in agricultural forestry and cooperative development. Furthermore the project is based on a twinning principle where a peer-to-peer relationship is formed between the actor in the developing country and a Finnish expert organization
 with technical know-how in relevant field.</narrative>
