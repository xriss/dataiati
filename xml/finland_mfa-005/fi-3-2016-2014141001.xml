   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Programme on Promoting Sustainable Development - Capacity building for developing countries and dialogue between Finland and South Centre</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The South Centre is the inter-governmental think tank set up by the developing countries? governments in 1995 .This programme reflects the desire for higher and stronger cooperation between Finland and the South Centre with the aim of promoting sustainable
 development globally and in developing countries. Through earlier cooperation the South Center has e.g. helped enable developing countries to be more actively engaged in a proactive manner in the UNFCCC and Rio+20 negotiations. One of the major areas of f
ocus by the South Centre in implementing the project was on the process for designing the Green Climate Fund within the UNFCCC. The Centre supported negotiators of several developing countries to put forward concrete proposals.Although the Programme?s main
 component is capacity building for developing countries there will also be a complementary component of organizing dialogue meetings between South Centre and the Government of Finland, this ?North-South dialogue? may also expand in due course to include o
ther institutions and countries. Under the capacity building component the South Center will among others assist developing countries in their elaboration of national climate change action plans and programmes and assist developing countries to prepare for
 sustainable development related negotiations inlcuding by preparing analytical papers and organising workshops. Sustainable development is chosen as the main theme of this Programme because sustainable development is now a high and even over-riding priori
ty in the international agenda. Within this main theme both parts of the Programme will address three sub-themes that are linked to sustainable development: climate change Rio+20 sustainable development follow up and the post 2015 agenda and the social age
nda.The Programme will cover a period of three years. The Budget for the Programme will be 700000 euro per year for the period of three years (from spring 2014 to spring 2017). The contribution by Finland is part of the multiple sources of financing for th
e South Centre during this period with many contributions also coming from the developing countries themselves.</narrative>
