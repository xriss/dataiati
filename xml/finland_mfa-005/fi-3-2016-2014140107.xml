  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Haiti is one of the most vulnerable countries in the world to the effects of climate change. There is a lack of knowledge on the causes and consequences of climate change at all levels. The project supports local level projects that combine awareness-raisi
ng and sensitisation of CBOs and communities on climate change, to the support of sustainable livelihoods options. Work is accompanied by advocacy activities at the national level towards the duty-bearers responsible for planning and implementing climate p
olicies that benefit and protect the Haitian population. The overall objective of the project is to strengthen the resilience of farmers and communities affected by food insecurity, through the implementation of priority actions on climate change adaptatio
n to enhance local food production systems.Expected results:? Awareness of local populations, organisations and authorities has been increased on climate change and food security.? Stronger Haitian CSOs engage themselves in advocacy and participate in the 
development and implementation of the Government?s plans and policies on Agricultural Adaptation (PANA), Climate Resilience (PNRC) and Food Security (PNSAN).? Stronger Civil Society Platform on Climate Change (PSC-CC) participates in the diffusion of polic
ies, mapping of interventions on Climate Change in Haiti, and advocacy activities at national level with the parliament, political parties, CSOs and universities. ? Local people?s resilience has been improved by enhancing production systems, strengthening 
the technical capacity of small farmers, and dissemination of best practices and relevant information. ? Strengthened organisational and technical capacities of local partners of community projects.Right-holders/beneficiaries:The target beneficiary groups
