  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project wants to strengthen the capacity of tribal communities in Chhattisgarh State, to deal with their issues around Land, Water and Forest, to as such strengthen their livelyhoods and claim their basic rights, especially in the context of the govern
ments industrial corridor effort around the Rawaghat mountain area.  Towards this objective, during the previous project phase supported by Siemenpuu 40 villages received knowledge and training regarding Individual and Community Forest Rights. Individual f
orest rights claims were made for all the 40 villages. The target group selected then for the interventions carried out under the new project are 26 neighbouring villages (and their CBO?s and mutual help groups) to the villages which received support in th
e previous phase, and which are as such also threatened by the government?s industrial and railway initiatives and in need to be protected from displacements. In addition also 14 of the previously supported villages have been identified to be in need of co
ntinued support with regards to their claims. As the interventions previously carried out were evaluated as having been succesfull, the components also this time include the empowerment of mutual help groups and CBOs, training on various para-legal aspects
 related to the making of the Community Forest Right claims, the fostering of tribal culture and the facilitating of networking and linking up with different partners and departments.  An additional element is now around the theme of NFTP, which are planne
d to be mapped and their trade and value addition further developed according to prevailing guidelines. Towards this latter objective a cooperative or federation of the mutual help groups will be set up. Disha aims at sustainable village communities based 
on democracy and justice. Though participatory capacity building, advocacy and networking it promotes sustainable community management of natural resources. It is supporting the communities&apos; protection of their environment and makes Adivasis, Dalits and ot
her marginalised groups more aware of their rights. www.dishacg.org</narrative>
