   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Kimira Oluch Irrigation Scheme Food Security Project</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Kimira and Oluch Irrigation schemes are located in Rachuonyo North and Homa Bay districts. Both areas are classified as semi-arid and at the time of the establishment of the irrigation schemes, farmers residing here faced frequent crop failures resulting in food insecurity. To address the latter problem, the Government of Kenya funded a project known as Kimira-Oluch Smallholder Farm Improvement Project. The latter project established the irrigation infrastructure with the objective of boosting land productivity to substantially increase incomes for about 3,000 households within the irrigation scheme. Despite the establishment of the irrigation infrastructure, the farmers are still food ensure. This is because the farmers&#x2019; organizations lack the systems, technical skills, and market linkages to promote their members&#x2019; interests. Furthermore, the farmers do not have enough incomes and food supply to meet their daily needs due to low savings and limited production of both horticulture and staple foods. 

To effectively coordinate production and marketing activities within the irrigation schemes, LWR facilitated the formation and registration Kimira Oluch Farmers Development Group with leadership from both Irrigation Water Users Associations in Homa Bay County. The project that targets 3000 smallholder farmers will be implemented in partnership with Kimira and Oluch Farmers Development Group (KOFDEG). 

GOAL: Small holder farmers in Kimira and Oluch are food secure
Outcome 1: Targeted farmers in Kimira and Oluch irrigation scheme receive quality and sustainable services.

Outcome 2: Targeted farmers in Kimira and Oluch increase incomes and food supply at the household level.</narrative>
