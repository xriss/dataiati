    <narrative xml:lang="EN">Hungary is a strong ally in coalition operations, as demonstrated by its contribution of troops to North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) missions. U.S.~assistance to Hungary contributes to regional stability and helps maintain strong political support in Hungary for coalition operations, including a willingness to provide personnel, equipment, and other resources for such operations. U.S.~assistance will promote the continued development of a flexible, sustainable, and interoperable Hungarian military capable of meeting NATO commitments. U.S. assistance will advance defense reform, build capacity, and strengthen partnerships in the region to more effectively counter Russian aggression and other emerging threats.</narrative>
