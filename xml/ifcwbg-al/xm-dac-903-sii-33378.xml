   <narrative xml:lang="EN">As part of liberalization of the power sector efforts of the Government of Albania (GoA), four operational hydroelectric power plants, namely Uleza, Shkopeti, Bistrica I, and Bistrica II (together the HEPPs), located in Albania with a total installed capacity of 76.5 MW were privatized through an international competitive bid in December 2012. Kurum International Sh. A (Kurum International or the Company) won the bid by offering a total amount of EUR 109.5 million. In January 2013, the Albanian Council of Ministers adopted the decision regarding the award of the privatization of the HEPPs to Kurum International and in February 2013 the Albanian Parliament ratified the share sale agreements related to the hydro assets. In order to support the Albanian power market liberalization efforts IFC envisages financing (i) the acquisition of the HEPPs; and (ii) the estimated EUR 10 million rehabilitation investment of these power plants (the Project).  Through this Project, Kurum International contemplates reducing its electricity purchase costs, which is a significant production cost item for the Company, and to secure reliable electricity sourcing in order to continue its operations without major disruptions.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Project&apos;&apos;s development impact is as follows:   (i) In line with the World Bank Group strategy, supporting power sector reform by increasing the share of private sector in Albania&apos;&apos;s overall electricity generation;   (ii) Sending a strong signal demonstrating the WBG&apos;&apos;s continued support to the market and to the GoA&apos;&apos;s ongoing efforts to liberalize the power market and promote private sector participation;   (iii) Facilitating the move towards the creation of a regional energy market in South Eastern Europe;  (iv) Attracting regional players to the Albanian market and supporting south-south investments by financing Kurum Holding&apos;&apos;s initiative in Albania. Through the above, the Project is expected to positively impact the fiscal and macroeconomic stability of Albania through increased foreign direct investment related to the payment of the privatization amount;  (v) Climate change mitigation (increased clean energy generation by improving efficiencies); and  (vi) Helping Turkish banks invest overseas under IFC B loan umbrella and thus supporting these banks&apos;&apos; entry to new markets in the region.</narrative>
