    <narrative xml:lang="EN">U.S. bilateral foreign assistance to Algeria is designed to strengthen Algeria&apos;s capability to combat terrorism and crime and build institutions in a rule of law framework that can further contribute to the security and stability of the nation and the region. Regional and centrally managed assistance aims to strengthen Algeria&apos;s business climate by assisting Algerian government efforts to modernize trade, fiscal, and monetary policies, and strengthen civil society. The Algerian government has made significant advancements in its struggle against terrorism but still faces considerable security issues along its borders with Libya, Tunisia, Niger, and northern Mali, requiring increased deployment of border security assets. U.S.-funded programs have helped the government build capacity to thwart ongoing threats to Algerian and Western interests. Ongoing security risks continue to plague the mountainous areas to the east of Algiers (Kabylie region and eastern wilayas) and in the expansive Saharan desert regions of the south and southeast. For example, terrorist groups exploit non-secure areas along the border to engage in illegal activities including illicit trafficking. These ongoing threats highlight the need for further progress towards improved border security, weapons counter-proliferation cooperation, and information sharing among the North African states. Modest bilateral foreign assistance bolsters Algeria&apos;s capacity to counter al-Qa&apos;ida in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM), Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL)-affiliate Jund al-Khalifa, and other terrorist groups and hostile actors in the region. In addition to bilateral assistance, Algeria also benefits from regional programs under the Trans-Sahara Counterterrorism Partnership (TSCTP), the Middle East Partnership Initiative (MEPI), and Global Counterterrorism Forum (GCTF) expert seminars, workshops, and training. Taken together, these efforts help achieve the United States&apos; overarching assistance goals for Algeria.</narrative>
