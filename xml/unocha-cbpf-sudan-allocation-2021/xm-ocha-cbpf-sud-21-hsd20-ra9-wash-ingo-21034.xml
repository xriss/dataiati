   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Sortony IDP camp which has since been very slowly recovery from the ended Darfur conflict and the yearly flush floods has of recent been experiencing attacks following the official withdrawal of UNAMID (The African Union - United Nations Hybrid Mission in Darfur) on 8 April 2021, tensions returned between Government forces against Sudan Liberation Army/Abdul Wahid (SLA/AW) reportedly over the control of the UNAMID base in Sortony. On 15 July armed clashes erupted in Sortony between the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) led by Sadiq Al Fuka, former SLA/AW adherent and now a signatory with Government of Sudan (GoS).

On 14th June 2021, SLA/AW entered the Sortony IDP gathering and arrested 8 Sadiq Al Fuka elements following reports of cattle rustling by Sadiq&#x2019;s group.  Following this arrest, some of Al Fuka&#x2019;s group fled to Kobe SAF base, 5 kms west of the IDP gathering site.  The SLA/AW elements positioned themselves inside and at the peripheries of the gathering site claiming to own the land as well as being there to protect the IDPs. It is reported that Sadiq returned to the gathering site, leading to increased tensions which further escalated into armed clashes between his group and SLA/AW adherents on 15th July 2021. Heavy artillery was reportedly used and as a result, some IDPs fled to the surrounding mountains, while others went to Kaguro (22 kms east of Sortony) and Bulle (17kms south of Sortony) in Central Darfur. Access to Kobe, the main water point was also blocked. Several casualties were reported among the IDPs, mostly elderly and disabled persons as well as small children.

SAF led by Al Sadiq Al Fuka took control of Sortony on 18 July, although attacks and fighting have continued, including shooting on 25 July in Sortony gathering site and an ambush on his forces on 26 July.  Heavy clashes have also taken place between rival SLA-AW rival commanders both in North and Central Darfur.
The clashes in Sortony led to mass displacement, deaths and injuries caused by shooting, shelling, and burning of villages by clashing armed actors, the control of the area by SAF/Al Fuka has been associated with severe protection concerns including SGBV, abductions, arbitrary detainment and forced recruitment. Furthermore, there has been widespread looting and destruction of service infrastructure, including clinics, schools and water schemes as well as humanitarian agency offices and warehouses.  Due to lack of humanitarian access caused by the insecurity, and de-registration of some National NGOs (NNGOs), extremely limited humanitarian assistance has been provided since the armed clashes began, and needs are escalating. The restoration of peace and security by the government forces has made the displaced persons to start returning to the IDP camp.
The project seeks to respond to the current WASH needs in Sortony for the 31, 893 returned IDPs through rehabilitation of the looted/spoilt WASH facilities, construction of a new water yard, sanitation improvement in the IDP community and institutions and hygiene observance in the both the IDP community and institutions</narrative>
