  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">CRS has been at the forefront of efforts to address urgent health, nutrition, and WASH needs among highly vulnerable populations of Central Darfur since 2004. CRS was among the first agencies to establish operations in Jebel Marra as these communities became accessible, sometimes after more than a decade of isolation, in both government- and armed group-held areas. These areas have continued to face high need and impacts of conflict, such as conflict in November 2021 that displaced 500 households. Thanks to the ongoing support of U.S. Agency for International Development&#x2019;s (USAID) Bureau of Humanitarian Assistance (BHA), CRS has through Moafa I and Moafa II rehabilitated and equipped health facilities (HF), sanitation infrastructures, and waste disposal systems, as well as trained and equipped line ministry staff, local management committees, and community resource persons. Recently, smaller remote villages of Daya in North Jebel Marra have become accessible for humanitarian intervention, while emergency and development needs of the population continue to strain current government and civil society resources. CRS, while already operational in Daya Primary Health Clinic (PHC), will seek to expand the integrated Health and Nutrition programming into the ten small remote Daya villages. Daya PHC is situated in Daya village with the total estimated 10 villages, with a total catchment population of 45,000 individuals. 

CRS seeks to provide an integrated mobile clinic delivering health and nutrition services to each village twice per month, targeting those remote and vulnerable communities previously unable to reach the Day PHC. CRS will also establish a referral vehicle for the transportation of cases to the larger health care facility in the area. In addition, CRS seeks to complement the ongoing BHA funded work in Daya PHC with the construction of nutrition rooms and a waiting area, and the rehabilitation of OTP/TSFP shelter and the fencing for the safety and protection of patients. CRS will also work to procure the health facility with EPI standard refrigeration and solar panels, especially for the Delivery Room of the Reproductive Health Department. CRS will also conduct quarterly mass MUAC screenings and provide treatment and referral for identified cases of severe and moderate acute malnutrition (SAM and MAM, respectively), including medically complicated cases. Nutrition programming will also include the development and training of Grandmother Support Groups (GMSGs) and Mother Support Groups (MSGs), and Mother MUAC members. 

In 2020, CRS initiated the establishment of integrated mobile health clinics to reach the particularly hard to reach communities within the catchment areas of Saga Dir, Aborojadil and Rokero. Similar to Daya villages, distance and rough terrain make it very difficult for communities to reach appropriate care. Outreach clinics will target ten villages in the coverage area of the facilities, visiting each village twice per month and providing health, nutrition, and hygiene promotion education medical consultations and treatment referral of emergency cases provision of ANC and PNC and referral for skilled attendance at delivery. CRS will also provide the management of acute malnutrition through the mobile clinics in remote areas where HFs do not exist. Outreach will be done using a rented vehicle and a team of Ministry of Health seconded staff. The role of the mobile clinics will supplement the Daya static CRS-run facility.</narrative>
