Then a community orientation amp consultation will be done to encourage the target amp discuss with them the benefits and the importance of shelter construction. The grant will be distributed in presence of CMC (for the HCs) amp COR (for the SSR), who will monitor the shelter construction progress in the target locations. After cash distribution, JASMAR staff will conduct post-distribution monitoring on a weekly basis using many suitable tools (FGD, meetings with beneficiaries in addition to direct observation during ODM visits).
