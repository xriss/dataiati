   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Livelihood Based Emergency Response Project in the aftermath of the main clashes in West Darfur State of Genena, Sirba  Kreinik Localities,</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In the previous two years, West Darfur witnessed a series of violent inter-communal conflicts and violence with casualties and displacements as result, mainly between pastoralists and farmers.  Mid-January 2021, major violence broke out, leading to the displacement of over 100,000 people who took refuge in Geneina town or crossed the border into Chad.  While dialogue between the rival parties has been fostered since, occasional clashes still erupt, such as recently, on June 30th, 2021 in several villages in Sirba and Kreneik localities, resulting in casualties, injured people, and destruction of livelihoods. This RfE intervention provides urgent support in the aftermath of the main clashes in January 2021, and in a continued unstable context witnessing sporadic violent outbreaks. The project will contribute to maintaining a level of stability in this precarious situation by providing agricultural support, including for livestock. The last year of conflict in West-Darfur has reduced the resilience of the communities considerably, with tools, seeds, livestock, food stocks, and fodder destroyed or depleted. Vaccination programs did not take place and crop cultivation has been interrupted. Ideally, vaccinations take place in November and the second winter harvest season is a valuable source of income. The objective of this project is to provide timely life-saving and emergency food security and livelihood support to conflict-affected and flood-affected people in Geneina, Sirba, and Kerenik Localities of West Darfur State. Through agricultural support to enhance the food security and resilience among agro-pastoral communities in a precarious context while addressing one of the drivers of conflict that is the perceived disenfranchising of pastoralists of external support to these communities the project will also contribute to creating a context where IDPs can return to their areas of origin. 
This project targets 42,000 affected people in the three target localities including 8,400 IDPs 12,600 returnees and 21,000 host communities/nomads (9,660 men 10,080 women 10,920 boys and 11,340 girls) with the following FSL emergency activities:
Support to farmers:
	Distribution of assorted improved and early maturing seeds and tools packages for 3000 needy farming HHs and Training of Trainers (ToT) on Good Agricultural Practices (GAP) to 300 farmers 
Support to agro-pastoralists
	Goats restocking to 200 pastoralist and agro-pastoral HHs who have lost their livestock assets together with emergency animal feeding and extension training 
	Rehabilitate Abu-Naeima multipurpose Hafir and fix fence with barbed wire to support livestock watering in the area for 3000 people 
	Support the treatment of 50,000 animals belonging to vulnerable 2000 pastoral and agro-pastoral HH through voucher-based veterinary drugs system and Community Animals Health Workers (CAHWs)
	Support government-led livestock vaccination campaigns against prioritized diseases to 200,000 animals belonging to 4000 affected IDPs and nomads HHs 
Community interventions
	Carry out rapid market survey and support 4 women/girls IGA groups with training and start-up kits (capacity building on agro-food processing e.g. milk processing, perfume making, etc.)
	Provide logistical support to 6 community committees to support patrol and farm protection during the agricultural season 
	Refresher and voucher training for 20 CAHWs and 10 government animal health experts and replenishment of CAHWs kits
	Conduct 10 GBV awareness creation events/sessions through IEC/BCC materials and community radio GBV key messages will also be mainstreamed across the project activities to reach a minimum of 1500 women and girls 
Gender mainstreaming and inclusion of women and girls among other vulnerable groups will be prioritized (50% women participation in the different interventions) female-headed HHs will be targeted with farming inputs IGAs and goats restocking activities</narrative>
