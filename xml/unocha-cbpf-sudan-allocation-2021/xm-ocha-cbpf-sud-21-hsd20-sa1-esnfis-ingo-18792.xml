   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Emergency Shelter and NFI distribution for IDPs, Returnees and host communities in Beliel, As Salam, Damso, Kateila and Tulus Localities, South Darfur.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Several factors are increasing population displacements and new population movements in South Darfur, resulting in thousands losing shelter, belongings and even their lives. These factors include continued tribal fighting in South Darfur, particularly in the Jebel Marra area, and in neighboring states frequent fire outbreaks in various internally displaced person (IDP) camps and flooding, especially in the Kalma IDP camp, Damso, Kateila, and IDP gathering areas. The newly displaced require lifesaving assistance including emergency shelter and non-food items (ES/NFI). IDPs, both new and old, in camps and in host communities, also require ES/NFI replenishment. 

Alight, in cooperation with UNHCR field offices, proposes to identify, verify, distribute and replenish lifesaving ES/NFIs assistance to 1,000 households (HH) reaching up to 12,000 people in South Darfur The number target female heads of households to capture more vulnerable people (Women, children and elder people) from polygamous marriage . To ensure gender and diversity equity, ALIGHT will identify households headed by women in the affected region for assistance. Prior to any distribution, all needs will be assessed and verified, and special attention will be given to the participation and unique needs of women, girls, boys, older people, unaccompanied children, and people with special needs (PWSNs).
 
PWDs inclusion
PWDs in such forced displacements and in vulnerable communities face multiple and compounding forms of discrimination including on the basis of disability and other intersecting diversity factors that may lead to situations of exclusion. Alight will apply the Inclusion approach in project design, implementation and service delivery, while bringing together perspectives, needs, priorities, capacities, contributions of PWDs at the center of programming and protection. Key considerations will be made for Extremely Vulnerable Households (EVHs) that are unable to support themselves with out specialized care arrangements e.g.   Chronically Ill persons of concern, persons with severe disability be it physical or mental, Older persons of concern, even Children at Risk with disabilities etc, who may experience particular protection risks and inequality. Alight will ensure the PWDs are given the opportunity to enjoy their rights on an equal footing with others, and are able to participate fully in leadership and making of decisions that affect their lives and the lives of their family members and communities. Alight will promote protection of PWDs against all forms of discrimination while ensuring equitable access to ES/NFIs. Alight will also employ  the Age, Gender, Diversity Mainstreaming and Community Based approaches for the success of ES/NFIs project.
Alight will raise awareness of the rights of persons with disabilities, among staff, partners and communities for the this project, ensure persons with disabilities are represented in community leadership structures and other
community based protection mechanisms, disaggregate all data by disability status in order to make it possible to monitor access and inclusion, maintain feedback mechanisms which are accessible and capable of monitoring and responding to concerns of persons with disabilities. 
Alight will advocate for attention to the rights of persons with disabilities in interagency forums and coordination mechanisms as well as advocating for the inclusion of PWDs in national policies and Programmes. 

In regard to PSEA
Alight will ensure the targeted population is protected against SEA while ensuring adherence to PSEA amp Community Based Complaints Mechanisms SoPs. Alight will conduct targeted community awareness campaigns on PSEA and complaints mechanism in light with the  ES/NFI project , link the complaint mechanism to assistance services, train project staffs and stakeholders, on PSEA, the complaints mechanism, reporting procedures and core principles of support to victims of SEA.</narrative>
