   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Multisectoral emergency response to the conflict and displacement in the Eastern Corridor - South Kordofan</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">From June 2021, there was a significant deterioration of security in parts of South Kordofan, especially in and near Kologi within Gedir locality related to renewed intercommunal conflict, primarily between the Dar Ali/Hawazma tribe nomadic people against the Kawahla, Kenana and Logan tribes, resulting in loss of lives, injuries and displacement of people to Abu Jubeiha, Rashaad and Ghadeer localities as well as other neighboring localities controlled by non-state actors. Another round of conflict erupted on 02 December in western Abu Jubeiha, and initial estimates from an interagency assessment suggest approximately 40,000 additional individuals have been displaced, including secondary displacement. 

Conflict led to burning of villages looting of food, assets and other belongings and mass displacement. Displaced communities need a critical and immediate humanitarian response. Some of them had their belonging looted, continue to live without appropriate shelter, and are sharing the existing basic services with the host community thus burdening the existing services above capacity. The displacements happened at the onset of rainy season depriving them with an opportunity to farm, which may impact food security and livelihoods, with negative effects on nutritional status, and which could contribute to harmful coping mechanisms. This project aims to meet the most critical shelter-NFI, health, and protection needs of the conflict-affected population. 

Through direct experience of violence, loss, displacement and the disruption of social structures, many children will be in mental distress. Furthermore, loss of livelihoods, assets and property, can contribute towards the adoption of negative coping strategies which place vulnerable individuals at heightened risk of harm and exploitation. Enhancement of psychosocial status will be catered for by establishing community safe spaces to provide psychosocial assistance including through recreational activities, life-skills and vocational training, appropriate to children and youth. SC will capacitate community-based structures on child protection aspects to monitor community protection risks, and undertake community awareness to strengthen protection risk prevention and response, and will strengthen the capacity of protection actors to deliver appropriate and safe specialised child protection services through training. SC will support 2 health facilities in the area receiving displaced population (Tayba in Abu Jubeiha locality and Tajmala in Rashad locality) to continue to provide the minimum basic package of primary health care services despite the increased caseload. These services include outpatient consultation and treatment of common morbidities, basic laboratory services, vaccination/immunization for infants and pregnant women, antenatal and postnatal care treatment and referral for SGBV cases referral for emergency including obstetric cases to secondary level care and health education/promotion. SC will procure essential medicines, medical consumables and supplies, support health workers and will also undertake minor rehabilitation of the waiting areas, so that it is appropriate to meet the needs of the larger catchment population. SC will also support health promotion, including on COVID-19, to encourage behaviours which reduce disease transmission, and encourage health-seeking behavior. Save the Children (SC) will support families without appropriate shelter and NFI items through distribution of essential NFI kits and shelter life-saving shelter to displaced households. This will be preceded by a thorough assessment of NFI and Shelter needs including registration and verification for NFIs and shelter beneficiaries, and pre and post distribution monitoring. SC will also conduct a training program on fire prevention and response and broader disaster preparedness and provide technical guidance for effective shelter delivery.</narrative>
