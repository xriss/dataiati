  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">IAS is proposing an integrated WASH, GBV and Education support project targeting vulnerable IDPs, Returnees, Refugees and Host Communities in Al Radoum, Alsunta and Kateila localities of South Darfur State, Sudan. The broad objective of the project is to provide emergency relief and save lives through provision of sufficient clean water, sanitation facilities and awareness, reduction in waterborne diseases, increase access to GBV protection services, increase GBV awareness, provide dignity kits to refugee women and girls and improve access to quality education to boys and girls including children with disabilities, for vulnerable communities affected by conflict and economic hardships. The specific objectives of the project are
	Access to quality education and safe learning spaces with adequate WASH facilities for boys and girls, and for disabled children
	Ensuring the safety, health and dignity of women and girls by provision of quality multi-sectoral GBV response services to women and girls with a survivor-centered approach and GBV risk mitigation measures
	Provision of sufficient clean water, sanitation facilities, hygiene awareness, and reduction in waterborne diseases. 

A total of 55617 individuals will be reached by the integrated project as follows 4346 (7%) IDPs, 42797 (75%) vulnerable Host Community members, 7876 (14%) Returnees and 1913 (4%) Refugees. 

All the three targeted localities are ranked under HNO severity scoring of 4 and 5 for WASH, GBV and Education in South Darfur state. IAS and its local partner RDO are familiar with all the three targeted localities and are part of an ongoing 2020 SHF Consortium intervention with World Vision as the lead agency, implementing WASH activities in 5 localities of South Darfur. IAS is also implementing, UNICEF funded Education in Emergencies projects in 3 localities of South Darfur, UNHCR funded WASH and Peace Building projects in 5 another localities of South Darfur. The proposed SHF WASH, GBV and Education interventions will complement the existing IAS interventions and target localities without current assistance but in need. 

Targeted communities and their key leaders have been engaged in previous Needs Assessments carried out by IAS in January 2021, and they participated in selection of priority projects and specific villages to be targeted. Government line ministries participated in these community consultations and assessments, ensuring that prioritized projects and targeted villages complement existing Government technical strategies designed to address the needs. Community Response Mechanisms (CRMs) will be put in place to ensure continued consultation of affected population in decision making, and feedback on the impact of the projects. During project public gatherings and trainings organized and implemented by IAS, its local partner and Government ministry staff, beneficiaries will be informed and educated about their right to participate in projects identification, design, implementation and feedback of impact through use of CRM channels. IAS and its local partner will also educate project beneficiaries, local leaders and Government stakeholders on the commitment by IAS in Prevention of Sexual Exploitation and Abuse (PSEA) so as to empower them in preventing and reporting sexual exploitation and abuse. Programme staff will attend PSEA refresher trainings and will be constantly reminded of their duty in PSEA and their expected conduct as they carry out project activities.
Rehabilitation of existing basic services and infrastructure such as existing boreholes, water yards and wells, will be prioritized over new construction in order to reduce costs, reduce time required for construction and increase coverage. Existing community coping mechanisms that are not harmful will be enhanced and strengthened so as not to disturb community livelihoods systems and resilience to shocks, but allow diversification within the target communities.</narrative>
