   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project has been designed based on identified needs in the target areas and the proposed activities will address the immediate needs of the targeted  community in  South amp East Jebel Mara area timely and in an integrated manner focusing on reducing mortalities and morbidities associated with poor basic services. CARE will also build the targeted communities&apos; capacity through various training, coaching, and awareness-raising activities throughout the project period to enhance their resilience to recurrent shocks and become self-reliant, along with improving their access to essential services. 
Through this project, CARE proposes integrated health, nutrition, WASH, protection and FSL services to provide a package of basic services to the targeted community in order to improve multiple basic needs of the community members. Under Health services, the project aims to enhance  the existing system and provide at least the minimum basis service package which includes, but not limited to curative outpatient consultation services for diagnosis and treatment of common illnesses, basic laboratory investigations, immunization, Integrated Management of Childhood Illness (IMCI), sexually transmitted infection (STI) management, antenatal care, clean and safe deliveries, postpartum care, mother and child health, gender-based violence (GBV) and emergency referrals for complicated cases to secondary health facilities. Under Nutrition services, the project will provide high-quality curative and preventative nutrition services to vulnerable and malnourished U5 children and pregnant and lactating women in East and South Jabal Mara based on the CMAM protocol. WASH interventions are the crucial basic service for communities in Jebel Marra.  Through WASH services, CARE will work with community especially women to improve the access to safe drinking water, hygiene and sanitation services.  Due to deteriorated economic situation and increasing food insecurity across the country compounded by the COVID-19 pandemic, CARE will provide support to improve the Food security and Livelihoods situation of the community. The project will support the poorest and the most vulnerable families and individuals to improve their income by supporting them with agricultural inputs, Income Generation Activities (IGA&#x2019;s)  The gender and mainstreaming plans will bring in vital strategic actions in the planning and implementation process across the project aspects. The role and needs of women and men, girls and boys, the disabled and elderly will be analyzed using vulnerability analysis tools on an ongoing basis with the communities and partners to ensure increased inclusion and reduced exclusion errors.  Gender-responsive actions will be incorporated into the project training materials, the community leaders and Sudan Liberation Army(SLA) authority will be key players in addressing change to social norms and practices .Furthermore, protection, including protection from sexual harassment, exploitation, and abuse (PHSEA), will be mainstreamed in the project. Key implementing staff will receive protection and PHSEA training and develop action plans to mainstream them throughout the project period These stakeholders will be supported through learning circles to build their capacity and knowledge to facilitate the change process and advocate for the rights of at-risk population groups. The SHF funding will be key to fill critical gaps, including rehabilitation of WASH and health facilities, in addition to addressing the key protection issues which is not part of the current funding.</narrative>
