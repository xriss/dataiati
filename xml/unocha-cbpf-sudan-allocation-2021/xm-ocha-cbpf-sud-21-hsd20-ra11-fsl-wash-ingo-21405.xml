  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The general humanitarian situation in Sudan has worsened with humanitarian partners estimating that about 13.4 million people (29% of the population) will need humanitarian assistance throughout 2021. This is 4.1 million people more compared to 2020 and an increase of 44 percent in the year (HNO 2021). In North Darfur alone, 506,962 vulnerable residents and 419,125 internally displaced persons live in life-threatening conditions in addition to 880,069 vulnerable residents, 50,813 returnees, 487,136 internally displaced persons of which 31,893 are internally displaced persons in Sortony IDP camp whose survival is sustained through external assistance. The main drivers of vulnerability include economic crisis exacerbated by COVID-19 preventive measures, protracted internal displacement due to militia conflicts/clashes within themselves and also with government forces that are yet to be resolved. Women, girls, and the elderly form the large majority of those most vulnerable and heavily affected.

ajor food security and livelihoods (FSL) gaps are reported in Al Malha and Al Koma localities due to poor rainfall in terms of distribution and frequency compared to 2021, dry spells, plant pest diseases, poor pasture and livestock diseases. survey results showed that most of the natural ponds, Wadies and Hafirs in the surveyed localities are having less amount of water than usually do. This means much pressure by livestock on water yards, hand pumps and shallow wells (competing with humans) earlier than usual (starting from February onwards).  Prices of grains have also increased significantly and due to difficult economic situation, most households are unable to access enough food for their families. Livestock production in form of milk is also reported to be low due to poor and unevenly distributed pasture. The overall health of the livestock is reported to be poor to medium due to diseases. 

Limited livelihood opportunities, distribution of milking/dairy goats together with animal feed and mineral salt lick, in addition, to support to income generating activities will contribute significantly towards improvement in food security and nutrition. Distribution of donkey carts will help households to ferry water from long distances as well as fetching firewood and hay for their livestock. Animal health services through provision of drugs for treatment, equipment and training of communities on delivery of basic animal health services will help improve livestock conditions. In addition, there is need to protect and rehabilitate pasture by constructing firebreak lines and broad casting of pasture seeds. Immediate life-saving food aid is required to address severe food shortages among vulnerable households living in Al Malha and Al Koma.

The proposed project seeks to intervene in the areas of FSL and WASH to be implemented in Malha are will target a total of 4500 HHS (27,000 beneficiaries) for FSL and 3000 HHS (18000 beneficiaries)for WASH to directly benefit from activities linked thematically to the FAO assessment findings on crop production and productivity improvement, Animal production and productivity improvement and hydro-dependent agricultural practices while targeting IDP, Returnees, the most vulnerable resident farmer, agro-pastoralists, pastoralist including nomads as well as vulnerable host communities members affected by drought in Al-Malha Locality.</narrative>
