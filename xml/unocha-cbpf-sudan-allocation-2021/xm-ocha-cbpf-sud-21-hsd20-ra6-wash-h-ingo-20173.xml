   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Emergency flood response in White Nile state</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">As reported in the latest OCHA Flash Flood update (# 14), heavy rains and flash flooding have been reported in 14 out of 18 states across Sudan. As of 23 September, over 303,000 people have been affected with over 14,800 homes destroyed and 45,300 homes damaged. The affected states include Aj Jazirah, Blue Nile, Gedaref, Kassala, Khartoum, North Kordofan, Northern, River Nile, Sennar, South Darfur, South Kordofan, West Darfur, West Kordofan, and White Nile. The most affected states are White Nile (97,600 people), Gedaref (56,000 people), Aj Jazirah (54,570 people), River Nile (39,400 people), and Sennar (17,400 people). An unconfirmed number of public infrastructure and farmlands have also been affected.

Over 97,000 people have been affected by heavy rains and flooding in White Nile State since July 2021. This includes 36,000 South Sudanese refugees in Alagaya refugee camp and over 64,000 people from the host community in Guli and Aj Jabalain localities. Some 40,000 people were reportedly affected in Aj Jabalain locality, including host communities in 53 villages. Food security and livelihood (FSL) partners are providing food assistance targeting 40,000 people affected by floods in White Nile State. During the reporting period, about 25,000 people were reached with one-month food rations in Aj Jabalain locality. About 2,000 families in Al Gana refugee camp received shelter/non-food item (S/NFI) assistance. Many families affected by floods are taking refuge in schools, public facilities, and open spaces. Cluster partners plan to reach 4,900 flood-affected families with S/NFI assistance using available stocks in the state. However, partners reported a shortage of tents and shelter NFIs in Guli and Aj Jabalain locality.

The State Ministry of Health (SMoH) has reported 10 suspected cases of Jaundice in Aj Jabalain locality. Samples have been collected for laboratory investigations and water quality monitoring activities have started in flood-affected localities. Partners have reported insufficient hygiene and sanitation facilities and increasing practice of open defecation, which increased the risks of disease outbreaks.

In response to this emergency situation, Mercy Corps plans to provide Emergency Shelter amp NFIs and WASH assistance to the flood affected populations. The proposed intervention aims to support the 2021 Sudan Emergency Response Preparedness (ERP) Plan strategic objective one &quot;Provide water, food and non-food items, health, shelter and protection services within two weeks of a sudden onset emergency&quot;. The activities outlined in this proposal also aim to support SHF&apos;s 2021 Floods Response Plan.</narrative>
