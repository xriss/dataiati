  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In August and September 2013, floods hit several areas of the country, washing away crops, homes, and property. This was followed by the premature end of precipitation, which resulted in the drying of crops, particularly cereals, before they could mature. As a result, the Nigerien Ministry of Agriculture projected a deficit of 343,566 MT for this year&#x2019;s harvest , with 7,506,790 people (46.9% of the population) expected to be suffering from food insecurity by April 2014. Of these, 1,211,352 will be severely food insecure. By November 2013, 44% of households were already implementing crisis coping strategies.

In order to address these ongoing needs, CRS Niger launched a project called Working In Niger for Disaster Immunity (WINDI, which also signifies &quot;household&quot; in Zarma) in December 2013 with funds from UNDP, Caritas Australia, CAFOD, and CRS private funds. The departments of Tillab&#xE9;ri, Ouallam, and T&#xE9;ra in Tillab&#xE9;ri Region were targeted due to their long history of food insecurity (statistics reveal that Ouallam has experienced agricultural production deficits every year for the past thirteen years, while Tillab&#xE9;ri has experienced food deficits for ten of the past thirteen years). 

Priority I of WINDI is to ensure immediate food and nutritional security for vulnerable households through Cash-for-Work, food vouchers, and targeted free food distributions. Priority II is to reinforce productive capacities and resilience through vouchers for seeds, post-harvest management, off-season agricultural inputs, and small ruminants, as well as the provision of Moringa seedlings.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">WINDI began by targeting 900 vulnerable households in Ouallam in a small ruminants and market garden project to restore households&#x2019; assets that were lost in flooding and had not benefited from OFDA&#x2019;s Bonbatu activities, with these activities ending in March 2014. 

Another 300 households are implementing land recovery activities along with activities to reduce risk to flooding in a CFW program for three months, from March to May, intended to give families cash with which to pay back their loans and meet basic needs, rather than selling their harvested food. 

CRS Niger&#x2019;s continued presence in more villages is requested by the Ouallam authorities, including the prefet and local representatives from various ministries (agriculture, environment, livestock, etc.)</narrative>
