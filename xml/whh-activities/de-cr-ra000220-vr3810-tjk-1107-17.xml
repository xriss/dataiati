   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Strengthening the preparedness of local communities/authorities for natural disasters, esp. flooding in the Zeravshan valley/Tajikistan in summer 2017</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">- The negative impact of currently forecasted flooding/mudflows for the local population (human tools/destroyed infrastructure) will substantially be decreased and the resilience of the population towards disasters will be strengthened in the longer term. - The strengthened capacities of the local authorities and the better interaction between the local authorities and the local population will reduce the economic and human loss in the long term and can be copied to other areas at risk in the Zerafshan valley.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Tajikistan is prone to natural disasters, e.g. floods, earthquakes, landslides, mudflows, avalanches, droughts, and heavy snowfalls. Its mountainous terrain, coupled with the specific geological and hydrological conditions, translates into a high degrees of vulnerability towards climate change. At the same time, Tajikistan&#x2018;s deteriorating infrastructure has increased the population&#x2018;s vulnerability to extreme weather events and seismic risks. With most assets, including irrigation channels, river embankments, roads, bridges, and dams, built in the Soviet era, infrastructure maintenance remains weak due to limited financial resources and lack of knowledge by the government. Existing mudflow drainage systems along the villages are destroyed or slatted over the years, which when rapidly filled increase the risk of human casualties and physical damages. The costs of foreseen mudflows can be assessed much higher than for social and physical preparedness measures. With clear evidence of increased risk, combined with existing vulnerabilities in the most remote regions of Tajikistan, the Start Network voted in support of activating the Fund in anticipation of flooding and landslides.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The pre-selected villages have been chosen upon strong request from the zonal CoES as there already smaller mudflows appeared. In total, the project will cover app. 2000 households with nearly 10.000 people. The whole community in the pre-selected high risk villages will benefit through the envisaged project activities like protecting infrastructure, capacity building including drills/simulation exercises, maintenance of EWSs etc. The beneficiaries are calculated on the basis of number of households with five members.</narrative>
