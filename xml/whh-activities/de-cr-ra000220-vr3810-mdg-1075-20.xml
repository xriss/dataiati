   <narrative xml:lang="EN">A tropical depression had brought heavy rain to the northwest and eastern parts of Madagascar for a period of seven days from the 19th to 23rd January, 2020. For the Alaotra region the rains continued until the 29th January, 2020. As a result of the flooding, a number of water sources, mainly wells, have been contaminated. Many of the impacted households, particularly economically vulnerable households, are already deprived of basic foods due to lack of accessibility and availability. Should an emergency intervention not be carried out, the risk from diseases and food insecurity are highly likely. In fact, WHH through this project will support vulnerable communities to enable them to meet their basic needs.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">WHH will target vulnerable households: - Households dependent on a daily income resource - Households deprived of their usual income resource - Households with low or insignificant food stocks - Households with problems of access to basic food for a fairly long period of time due to the lack of availability of labour as a main source of income. - Households affected by and affected by the flooding - Households that take longer to bounce back from the shock. The calculation of the number of beneficiaries is based on the results of studies on the Household Economy Analyses carried out in the area of this investment zone in 2018. At the end of this study, the proportion of socio-economic classes is distributed as follows: - The category of very poor covers 25% of the households in the zone. - The poor class category covers 38% of the households in the area. - The middle class category covers 23% of the households in the area. - The category for the wealthy class covers 14% of households in the area. As mentioned in the previous explanation, the beneficiaries of the project will be the economically vulnerable categories of households including the very poor and poor classes. For the target areas, the response will be focused on the six most impacted communes in Amparafaravola district. This gives us a total number of 1116 households i.e. 5580 persons with an average size of 5 persons per household.</narrative>
