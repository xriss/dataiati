   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Objective of the early actions are the minimization of drought impacts on the most vulnerable households. Early actions identified to mitigate the impending impact of drought on food security are unconditional cash transfers to the targeted population. These early emergency measures are fit to protect the food and nutrition security of the most vulnerable households. In order to keep families above the survival threshold and reduce the adoption of negative copying strategies, the uncodnidtional cash transfers will provide food aid and protection of goods to avoid further deterioration of livelihoods.

The approach will focus on using a shock-appropriate approach to increase capacity and synergize resources, ensure the integration of different activities in medium time to address the underlying vulnerabilities and risks, by mobilizing and raising awareness of communities (nutrition, hygiene-COVID) and effective coordination at different levels between institutions (local and central), communities and other actors with ongoing programs.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The expected crop loss and increased food insecurity are expected to mainly affect the region&apos;s most vulnerable group of people, who will suffer a significant loss of income from work and a protected loss of food for self-supply.

Based on the HEA result, households in the very poor socio-economic category will be covered by this project (analysis carried out in 2018-2019) whose number is estimated at 1496 households with a size of 5 people per household (Source LIAS HEA MG 7 2018-2019).</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project outlined is the first early action intervention implemented in the course of the Forecast-based Action Programme due to a trigger of the drought monitoring and trigger model.The model detected a drouth during a plant-critical growing phase which is expected to result in increased food insecurity of most vulnerable households. As a result, an early warning was issued.

In line with the previously developed Early Action Protocol, most appropriate early actions are unconditional cash transfers. These shall mitigate the impacts of the imminend food insecurity of the targeted population. The transfers will be provided in 6 installments, the 1st distributions are expected to begin before the harvest (mid may) and end before the welding period when food insecurity is expected to peak.</narrative>
