   <narrative xml:lang="EN">1. All households because they will have access to improved extension services as a ripple effect.
2. The Community Based Trainers will benefit, as they will be capacitated to provide extension services as a business and benefit from a regular source of income.
        3. Farmers on a nationwide scale will also benefit from improvements in extension systems e.g. they will be able to be reached through cost effective extension approaches such Podcasts.
       4.  The private sector players will benefit from the development of an improved extension system, which they can use with farmers whom they support in both open and closed market systems.
       5. Private Sector Players will also be indirect beneficiaries because of improved investments in Agriculture Inputs by Smallholder Farmers and thus increased business.
       6. Improvements in Productivity will also benefit the private sector because of better supply of quality products.
      7.  Consumers within the districts and beyond will also benefit from the availability of safer food and healthier food as farmers become more aware of food safety and nutrition.
      8.  The Ministries of Agriculture; Nutrition and Health will benefit from evidence generation that can be used to implement effective policies and improve agricultural productivity at a national level</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Productivity in the smallholder farming sector of Zimbabwe varies between districts but is generally described as low because of biophysical and socio, economic challenges. Biophysical challenges include unreliable rainfall patterns, low soil fertility and pest and  prevalence. Socio-economic challenges include input access, poor physical infrastructure, labour shortages, credit unavailability, poor extension services and lack of access to output markets. Concerning extension, the public services are severely constraint by a lack of resources (95% of the current budget for Agriculture covers salaries). By addressing these key challenges the Extension and Training for Rural Agriculture (EXTRA) Project will achieve improved food and nutrition security among smallholder farming households and their communities. The project will deliver this by supporting women and men farmers so that they have improved farming practices, better linkages to markets and a more nutritious diet.</narrative>
