People neither have access to safe drinking water nor clean water for personal hygiene and cooking. Spread of water-borne diseases like typhoid fever is of very high risk. There is low use of household water treatment. The food sold in their areas is likely to contain typhoid bacteria. Sewage leaks occur and may be contaminating boreholes, Solid waste is not being collected and has formed dumps in open spaces. Typhoid in high density suburbs likely to spread further to other areas. Provision of NFI, namely soap and aqua tabs for three months arc the prinrary need. Furthermore, sensitizing and awareness rising of the population together with hygiene training is essential at this point; this includes mobilization, orientation and training of community health volunteers for response as well as provision of IEC material.</narrative>
