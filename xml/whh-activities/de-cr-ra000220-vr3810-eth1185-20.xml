   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The primary objective of the proposed action is to support extremely deprived and vulnerable flood  1220 IDP families through provision of emergency shelter and WASH solutions. Although all community members have been affected by the flood, it is mainly under five children, PLW, female/child headed households and elderly/disabled who are the most vulnerable to shocks and stresses. WHH and APDA  have  paid careful attention whilst designing the action to the different risks, needs, priorities of these groups. The action takes into consideration the vulnerability of these groups whose daily life is predominately focused on or around their shelters and WASH NFIs. Consequentially, these groups also the one  face bigger protection risks associated with not having a dignified and safe living space.</narrative>
