   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project company is Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; Concessionnaire de lA&#xE9;roport (SCA or the company), a special purpose company that holds a 45-year concession (from 1995) from the Royal Government of Cambodia (RGC) to operate the Phnom Penh International Airport (PPIA) at Phnom Penh, the Siem Reap International Airport (SRIA) at Siem Reap, and the Sihanoukville Airport (SIA) at Sihanoukville. PPIA serves as the main gateway to Cambodia while SRIA mainly caters to the tourist traffic visiting the various Angkor temples located in the nearby Angkor Archeological Park, a UNESCO World Heritage site.   Sihanoukville was established in the 1950s and forms together with Phnom Penh and Siem Reap one of the destinations that has been identified by the RGC as cornerstones for the countrys short-term tourism development. The Sihanoukville airport, located 15 km from the city center, was built in the 1960&apos;s and remains a small airport with limited facilities. The concession for the development and operation of Sihanoukville Airport was awarded in March 2006 by the RGC to the company.  SIA reopened in January 2007.

The proposed project consists of: 

- the mandatory capital investments required under the concession for SIA for 2006 and 2007; 
- the terminal capacity increase at SRIA to provide service to the increasing passenger growth; and 
- the capital investments required at SIA in 2008-10, should traffic at the airport increase in accordance with the companys projections.

This would be IFCs second investment in SCA. In June 2004, IFC provided a $10 million loan to SCA to support capital expenditures at PPIA and SRIA.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project will have a significant development impact on the Cambodian economy.  The RGC is aggressively promoting tourism, especially in the Angkor temple complex near Siem Reap and the coastline near Sihanoukville.  Tourism has the potential to become one of the most important sectors of the economy.  Expansion and modernization of the airports infrastructure is viewed as critical to the RGCs coordinated efforts to grow the tourism industry as the airports are an essential component of the infrastructure required to support international tourism to Cambodia.  In this context, the proposed project would expand the international airports of SIA and SRIA and help the country develop the value of its unique cultural assets of Angkor temples and its coastline.  The project will also raise operating efficiency and service levels at SRIA and SIA by adjusting airside and landside capacity to expected passenger traffic, and help SCA meet performance standards established under the Concession Agreement. Finally, the projects success will encourage foreign investments and further private sector participation in infrastructure projects in Cambodia and privatization of airports in East Asia in general.</narrative>
