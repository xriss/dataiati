  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Uganda&#x2019;s country program will be delivered through 3 pathways; Pathway A on Indigenous Peoples and
Local Communities (which seeks to protect them against large developments and build their capacity
to question and demand for their rights), Pathway B on Drivers of deforestation and forest degradation
(that seeks to halt exploitation, infrastructure development and expansion of agro-commodities that are considered main drivers of deforestation and forest degradation) and Pathway C on Civic Spaces (that seeks to use environment and human rights defenders to open engagement spaces for positive engagement).
The specific problems that will be addressed by the program include:
Challenges to indigenous communities resulting from (a) the lack of power and opportunities to govern and
manage their landscape, limited involvement in 
decision making processes and (b) emerging pressure on their land and forests through external drivers.</narrative>
