   <narrative xml:lang="EN">1. The Guarayos Indigenous organization (COPNAG) supports the participation of Guarayan communities in decision-making about land and natural resources: It is necessary to work with community-level political representative organizations (Centrales Ind&#xED;genas), women organizations (CEMIG), and youth organizations at the community and territorial level, and productive organizations based in the territory, to develop a vision of the governance of the territory and its development model. This must be managed and executed by COPNAG with the support of CEMIG. 2. All internal and external stakeholders in the Guarayos province know, recognize and respect the territorial limits of the Guarayos Indigenous Territory and apply its regulations on resource use. It is necessary to generate agreements on the use of land and resources in the indigenous territory between their owners and neighbours (peasants and private agricultural properties/companies) in order to preserve its character as indigenous territory and its development potential for future generations of the Guarayos people. For this, the necessary efforts will be made so the neighbours of the territory know and respect the limits and internal regulations on resource use. At the same time, we will work with the authorities to invest in culturally adequate development plans for the territory (municipalities and governors) and to enforce agreements on land and natural resource use established between the COPNAG, migrant farmers, the agro-industry, the organizations of cattle breeders and the Mennonites. 3. Government agencies, the private sector, the financial sector and communities adopt inclusive and responsible practices and policies, so that Guarayan families can earn income in sustainable and climate-smart ways: It is necessary to work on innovative business models that make the Guarayan population more resilient. Existing relationships between companies and communities tend to be uneven, and it is therefore necessary to develop new approaches that balance the relationships between the suppliers of forest resources and other actors in the value chain. Also, innovative finance mechanisms should encourage communities to engage in the restoration of deforested and degraded lands. 71 &#x2022; Government entities implement innovative policies in inclusive business models and finance between the private sector and communities. &#x2022; Forestry companies and financial service providers implement and develop innovations in inclusive business models and finance. &#x2022; Financial incentives are being developed for restoration of degraded land and forest in the indigenous territory. 4. The Plurinational State of Bolivia implements effective policies that favor the sustainable and resilient management of the Guarayos Indigenous Territory: In its National Determined Contribution (NDC), Bolivia needs to commit to fulfil a series of ambitious goals related to the integral and sustainable management of land and forests, to achieve mitigation and adaptation goals, while also benefitting the overall environment and local people. The landscape approach represents an opportunity to show the important role that indigenous territories can play in complying with the NDCs</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The landscape of the Guarayos Indigenous Territory (GIT) is located to the northwest of the department of Santa Cruz, within the province of Guarayos, and overlaps with the municipalities of El Puente, Ascensi&#xF3;n de Guarayos and Urubich&#xE1;. The landscape is located within the Blanco River basin. According to data from the National Institute of Statistics (up to the year 2012), Guarayos province has 50,131 inhabitants. The area is vulnerable to projected changes of the local climate, such as the increase in annual average temperatures and a reduction of annual precipitation. This will result in an extension of the dry season and a higher probability of droughts, increasing the risk of forest fires. The rate of deforestation has been increasing, due to expansion of large-scale sorghum, soybean, and cattle farms. These large-scale &#x2018;agro-industrial&#x2019; producers have access to technology and financing to face climate variability. Small-scale producers of corn and other products on which local food security depends, are more vulnerable to climate change. Education levels are not optimal, access to financing is low and differentiated, living conditions are poor, and there is a lack of public investments in disaster prevention. We envision Guarayos as a model for a well-governed climate-smart indigenous territory with national government recognition. The model is identified as a main strategy in Bolivia&#xB4;s NDC. Indigenous leaders govern the territory in an inclusive, transparent and democratic manner in close collaboration with municipalities, governors and national government institutions. Integrated land and forest management practices, that combine traditional Guarayo values, knowledge and beliefs with scientific knowhow, allow for sustainable food production and income generation. Men, women and young people actively participate in the decision-making processes, and opportunities exist for the pursuit of their own vision of development considering cultural, gender and generational points of view. Inclusive and transparent business relations between indigenous communities and forest companies have been developed based on trust and just prices. Local people participate in the development and application of territorial land- and forest-use planning and monitoring, and the development of regulations to limit the possibility to convert forested lands for other purposes than small-scale climate smart agriculture.</narrative>
