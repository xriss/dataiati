   <narrative xml:lang="EN">GLA - Bolivian Chiqu&#xED;tania region</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Partners in the program focus on forests in the Chiquitan&#xED;a region, located in eastern Bolivia, a transition area between the Amazone and the Chaco. The forested area here is influenced by different local, national and international factors. Agro-industrial production of soy and sorghum, as well as livestock production represent the main drivers of deforestation in the region. Mining, although very concentrated, represents another pressure, as it transforms the landscape completely. The Bolivian State has a predominantly agricultural vision of development, as expressed in the proposed land use and agricultural plans for the coming years. Indigenous communities have an important role to play in the management of the remaining forest in the region, as 80% of forests in Bolivia, amongst others in the Chiquitan&#xED;a region, is managed by indigenous groups. The role of autonomous municipal governments in the formulation of local public policies is still weak, although they have the authority to do so. Key actors in the program are therefore actors that manage or use natural resources directly and the authorities responsible for the regulation of their use.</narrative>

  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The overall objective of the program is to contribute to the integrated, sustainable and inclusive management of forests, in particular in the Gran Chiquitan&#xED;a region. This would be possible if technological innovations are applied, management and coordination is improved and legislation is harmonized and implemented. In the first place, local private sector will need to adopt technological innovations for sustainable and integrated forest management. At the same time, national government and municipalities need to comply with the new law on the restitution of forests and other newly developed legislations derived from the new constitution. This law regulates the food production and requires deforestation to be compensated. Partners start from the premise that informed consumers demand products from sustainable forest and land management. Therefore, partners will communicate to consumers on the contribution of agro-ecology, certified products and environmental functions of the forests to safety and food sovereignty. At the same time the concept of &#x201C;Sistemas de vida&#x201D; needs to be improved. This concept is a holistic vision of the territory and nature in line with Bolivian own definition of nature and Mother Earth. For this relevant stakeholders will be organizationally strengthened through access to reliable information and coordination with other actors. Finally, the Gran Chiquitan&#xED;a can conserve their valuable ecosystems and at the same time provide the Bolivian people with income, health and welfare, if legislation is effectively implemented and harmonized. Civil society will advocate for compliance of existing legislation among national legislative and judicial authorities and local authorities, the urban population and indigenous communities. They will also contribute to international networks and regional processes.</narrative>

      <narrative xml:lang="EN">The current forest regime requires the adjustment of the forestry law (Law 1700) to incorporate the indigenous / peasant actors and the new vision of integral management of forested landscapes of the national government. The ABT and the Forest Directorate are currently trying to develop new legislation to increase and promote community forest management. However, the appropriate management tools must be constructed with active participation and from an indigenous / peasant perspective. This requires the ABT to be open to dialogue and partnership with indigenous and peasant communities. So far, there is resistance to open dialogue and modification of legislation continues to focus on large-scale private sector forest management.</narrative>
