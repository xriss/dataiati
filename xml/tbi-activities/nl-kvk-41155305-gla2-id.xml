  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">We envision that the forest in Indonesia is maintained at the current extent and cover, and that it contributes
to Indonesia&#x2019;s commitments on climate change mitigation and adaptation. Government and private sector, including financiers, commit to zero- deforestation and sustainability principles, whereas IPLCs who dwell in forested landscapes sustainably govern and responsibly manage forest areas, sustain local livelihoods and are resilient to climate change impacts. In a broader scope, citizens, including (W)EHRDs, are rights literate, enjoy human and women&#x2019;s rights, and safely participate in a social movement within a democratic manner. GLA2 Indonesia aims to contribute to that vision, and to do so we set up the following goals for the country programme. By 2025, we aim that:
1. IPLCs in the four landscapes have sovereign control over their lands and natural resources, and conduct
ecologically and socially responsible livelihoods.
2. Government and private sector operating in the four landscapes formalise the halting of new licences in forest and peatlands and rightfully implement 
environmental and social standards for the existing
plantations/concessions, including respect to labour and human rights. At the same time, Indonesian
banks apply sustainable financial principles and standards to their investment for agro-commodity and
extractive industries.
3. (W)EHRDs in Indonesia freely express their opinions, safely participate in public affairs, and are rightfully protected by the laws while the National Commission on Human Rights provides support through the (W)EHRDs special task force and policy instrument.</narrative>
