   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The program will focus on the sustainable and inclusive management of forests to mitigate and adapt to climate change, respect human rights and safeguard the livelihoods of local communities and indigenous peoples. A recent study on land 
 anagement by program partner CEPED, concluded that in order to secure land rights, guarantee sustainable lifestyles and conserve biodiversity, the interventions should focus on pursuing a decentralized, customary-based land management approach, and reconciling legal recognition for traditional and cultural rights of IPLCs. To this end, three main axes have been elaborated, namely:
(A) Governance and land management by IPLCs, through the recognition, application and improvement of civil and political rights; (B) Deforestation and the concerns of Congolese citizens are taken into account
by all actors in the agri-food, mining and energy sectors; and (C) Respect for human rights and the
safe participation in social movements through an informed civil society and by supporting environmental
human rights as well as women&#x2019;s rights defenders. These three Pathways have cross-cutting themes,
bringing different perspectives to land-related conflicts, gender mainstreaming with the consideration of Sexual Gender Based Violence (SGBV), and the promotion of youth for environmental protection.</narrative>
