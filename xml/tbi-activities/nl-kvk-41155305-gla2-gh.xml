  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Green Livelihood Alliance Ghana is a partnership among Tropenbos Ghana, A Rocha Ghana and
Friends of the Earth Ghana (FoE Gh) that was formed 5 years ago. It aims to continue to mobilize Local
Community (LC) and Civil Society campaigns, capacity strengthening, and advocacy based on empirical evidence to create a social movement that defends forests and biodiversity, and supports communities to protect their environmental rights that reduce the drivers of deforestation. The program will campaign for climate justice, execute non-violent direct actions and participate in Ghanaian, regional and international movements that implement dialogue and dissent strategies towards local communities, public and private actors. We will achieve this by mobilising people and bringing together the knowledge needed to address complex governance issues for climate-smart landscapes through a landscape approach involving local communities, private, public and civil society actors. The forested landscapes in Ghana selected for the GLA 2021 &#x2013; 2025 intervention are the Atewa Forest Landscape in the Eastern Region and the Juaboso-Bia Sefwi- iawso Forest Landscape in the Western North Region.</narrative>
