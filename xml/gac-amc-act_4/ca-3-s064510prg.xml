     <narrative xml:lang="EN">Key results achieved between July 2009 and March 31st 2013.   Peru: In Huari, Peru, as well as in the surrounding area of Lima, Peru, agricultural production improved, increasing revenues for 439 people (including 239 women), following the introduction of new organic agricultural and animal husbandry practices. 23 irrigation systems were installed and adapted to the context of the Andes, allowing 32 households to water their crops during dry spells, thus improving yields. Newly acquired entrepreneurial skills were used by 25 women for marketing their cheese, and by 15 women who designed marketing plans. Cheese production improved for 25 women producers, increasing from one cheese to 24 on a weekly basis. Improvements in quality also doubled sales (from an average price of 7 soles to 12 soles), increasing the weekly average income to $24. 16 cheese factories are running and 9 are being built (transformation sector micro-businesses) to the benefit of 25 households. 53 vegetable gardens were created, to the benefit of 53 households, producing a variety of vegetables. Nutrition was improved for 53 households through the introduction of 10 varieties of vegetable and foods in people&#x2019;s diet, and through sustained awareness about good dietary habits. A women&#x2019;s textile association was created, adopting ecological practices to dye wool that improved product quality and sales. 48 producers now hold national ecological certification that improved their products&#x2019; quality and marketing potential. Awareness on good hygiene and nutrition, as well as on appropriate garbage disposal, following the distribution of nutrition guides and workshops, reached 73 women and more than 550 elementary school and high school students. 62 organic and non-organic garbage dumps were created or improved. 58 hectares of improved pastures were sowed to the benefit of 200 households. Cows that graze from improved pastures generally generate 4 litres of milk daily, rather than 2 litres per day for a cow that grazes in basic pastures. 39 cows were inseminated to the benefit of 26 households. Inseminated cows can produce up to 8 litres per day over 4 years and can be sold at twice the current value for cows.   Nicaragua: A network of 17 local organizations located on the Island of Ometepe followed a two year process to adopt an official gender equality policy with an action plan for its implementation in all sectors of activities across the network. Four partners strengthened their capacities to reach out to youth through a new agricultural training program for Integrated Organic Farm Management, which lead to 50 environmental protection undertakings and increased productivity, through the installation of 118 new infrastructure, healthier nutrition by introducing 30 new types of crops that are seldom used by beneficiaries as food resources. 32 teachers and agronomists built on their knowledge and skills through learning methodologies that involve participation, group dynamics and experimentation. 326 youth (48% young women) benefit from mentoring in learning and experimenting with new agricultural techniques and concepts including organic agriculture, seeds, soil health, ecological animal husbandry, rural diagnostic, farm planning, calculation and measures, ecological tree nurseries, food chain and food security.   Honduras : Four partners strengthened their capacities to applied participative methodologies similar to the Machete Verde one. 847 farming households adopted new agricultural practices, such as soil conservation, production diversification, pest management, natural pesticide application and crop management, which helped 67 communities reach nutritional independence. Environmental restoration through the integration of five environmental practices adopted by the 847 households, including soil conservation, reducing the use of chemicals in crops, the installation of live and dead barriers, levelled curbs, minimise ploughing, introduction of organic fertilizer, reduced controlled burning practices, crop rotation and association. 170 promoters (men and women) strengthened their capacities to use new agricultural techniques in 67 communities of the Choluteca area. One local NGO and regional women network strengthened their capacities in leadership and institutional strengthening at the regional level. (AMDV: 326 women; Regional Women Network of Choluteca: 450 women). 22 irrigation systems were installed to benefit 277 households in 20 communities. 6 associations and networks strengthened their presence and management capacities in different municipal activities, namely the AMDV women&#x2019;s association and the Caritas social and religious women&#x2019;s group, as well as the Regional Women Network.   Mali: 6,400 participants from 32 villages, 4 municipalities and 3 regions (Mopti, S&#xE9;gou and Sikasso) acquired development funding (approximately $13,000 CAN per village). Rotating access to development funds allowed 3,200 community members, mostly men, to buy agricultural inputs, such as working cattle, machinery, seeds, phyto-sanitary products, thus reducing the harvest season to 2 months, compared to the 6 to 7 months that was required before. Access to rotating development funds also allowed 3,200 participants, mostly women, to engage in income generating activities, such as vegetable farming or small commercial ventures, thus increasing their daily average income from 0.25 cents to $2. The skills development and transfer process was consolidated with the partner AMPJ for local development through the mobilisation of 1,200 participants in implementing the federation of 6 community villages, and income generating activities such as vegetable farming and commercial ventures, with 600 women villagers.   Haiti: 12 farmer associations&#x2019; economic growth micro-project management skills were strengthened through composting activities. More than 2,000 farmers (men and women) generate additional income for their families, through the sales of part of their extra vegetables and plants from their gardens and tree nurseries. 10 collective compost pits were implemented and produced 160 tons of compost. 42 members of the women&#x2019;s association Fanm leve kanpe started a microcredit activity in Macary, through the profits made from their tree nursery. 2,129 families directly benefited (12,834 persons indirectly benefitted, an average of 6 persons per families) in 25 communities of Marigot, by adopting hygiene and sanitation best practices. 12 soil conservation and reforestation micro-projects were designed by farmer associations, including the implementation of 16 m3 dry stone thresholds, 159 meters of tiers and 62 meters of canal contours. Water and sanitation efforts included building 1,148 pits and 524 latrines to benefit 2,129 households. Hygiene principles and best practices training was given to 500 persons (236 women and 264 men). Agro-sylvo-pastoral techniques were improved through promotion campaigns and 132 promoters (80 men and 52 women) who were trained in the use of Djakour Payizan . 19 teachers (men and women) from three environmental and Djakout Payizan schools were trained. 26 experimental gardens were implemented, one for each association, for the application of newly acquired skills and knowledge. 29 farmer associations were mobilized to participate in 10 training sessions for a total of 290 training sessions. 20 associations received technical support during 50 practical training sessions in which 784 members participated (446 women and 338 men). 36 farmer association leaders were trained in project monitoring techniques (31 men and 5 women). 7 of the 22 Djakout Payizan modules were reviewed with 250 participants from 10 communities, who received theoretical training and practical training over 4 months.</narrative>
