   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The 2nd phase of the police cooperation in Albania seeks to help build mutual trust and partnership between police and communities with the ultimate goal  to create safe neighbourhoods. In order to achieve this the programme will facilitate a number of behavioural changes necessary for a strong Community Policing approach. These include shifts in behaviour for individual officers , shifts in institutional behaviour  within and across Community safety  and security providers  and shifts in behaviour within  the communities. The contribution will be implemented  over a four years period  as a follow up of a first phase, and will be assigned to a consultant  to be selected through an open tender. The implementation will be steered on  strategic level from the Programme Steering Committee which will bring together the Ministry of Interior of Albania (MoI), the Albanian State Police (ASP), other relevant line ministries , civil society and Sida, through the Swedish Embassy.</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">The 2021 has been the first of the two years extension granted to the intervention, following the positive evaluation in early 2020. The core of the activities has concentrated under Pillar I, Support for the implementation of the community policing philosophy in Albania through a major focus on implementing in practice the concept of the Police Zone and the new job descriptions for the CPOs and General Patrol Officers . Based on the results of the pilot in Elbasan, the ASP has extended the practice in all remaining Local Police Directorates (LPD) in batches, aiming to complete in June 2022. What is already being achieved is: the CPOs are better focused on their core tasks and have more time to devote in building relationships with the community, while the general patrol police officers carry out more tasks than before, especially those requiring quick interventions.

The improvements of the working procedures have been accompanied with material support for the ASP. The project delivered 4 drones for Elbasan LPD as a support for territory control activities in order to disburden police officers from the duty of foot patrolling and improve their time management in the territory control activities. The information received can be used for fight against drug cultivation, environmental crime and illegal immigration. The programme team has worked to reinforce the improvements for making them an integral part of the daily routine in all commissariats.

The Traffic Police have been equipped with speed radars, tablets and printers for the patrols aiming to have fines  generated electronically, and persons and vehicles checked  in real time, with the view to adapt the existing  Case Management System at ASP for mobile use. These particular results will serve to make the work of Traffic Police more transparent and freer from corruption.

The programme has completed the full reconstruction of the of Belsh Police Station, changing drastically the working conditions for the police officers and improving also the reception of citizens and the room for pre-detention.

In the framework of the Pillar II, after providing support  to the Ministry of Interior and the ASP in drafting the Intersectoral Strategy for Safety in the Community 2021  2026, the programme has assisted its implementation process during 2021 and has cooperated with the Agency for the Support of Local Government Authorities to elaborate the legal framework for  improving  the functioning of the Local Council on Public Safety (LCPS). Due to the electoral campaign and other priorities, not many developments were registered in this regard. However, one of the Grant Scheme projects is supporting the set up and functioning of LCPS in 5 different municipalities.

In the domestic violence pillar, the project carried a quality review of the risk assessment reports completed by the police officers in Elbasan and Kukes LPDs to revise the training curricula for 9 LPDs. The training has started in autumn 2021. In addition, some awareness raising activities were organized in Elbasan and in Berat, using the minivan donated by the project.

The fifth round of the Grant Scheme was launched in February 2021, and 11 contracts with NGOs operating in the municipalities Tirana, Korca, Elbasan, Kukes and Gjirokaster were signed in May. All of them have been implemented through the year and sixth round of Grants was prepared and launched by the end of 2021. 

The fifth round has included: 3 projects aiming at supporting efforts for DV awareness and establishing and consolidation the local referral mechanisms; 5 projects aiming at supporting the establishment and capacity building of Local Councils of Public Safety; 3 projects aiming at consolidating partnerships between the ASP and local communities and schools two  of them aiming at awareness raising on road trafficking rules among youngsters.





From the last Conclusions on Performance the implementation of this contribution has been well on track. The programme has delivered on all its three main pillars and the Grants scheme. It has been also well responding to newly emerging needs and situation like the Earthquake that hit Albania on November 2019, especially in the areas of Thumana and Durr&#xEB;s and the recent and ongoing COVID-19 Pandemic. Both these events have affected somehow the work of the programme but without causing any substantial delay until now. On the other side, the programme has demonstrated remarkable ability to adapt to the changing circumstances by coming up with adequate response in the affected areas and within its approved scope. The dialogue with the Embassy about this has been regular. The programme has worked more closely with the two selected target Regional Police Directorates/TRPDs (Kuk&#xEB;s and Elbasan) and has suggested a new more effective structure for the TRPDS for responding to the local communities&apos; needs on safety and security. The programme has contributed also to the elaboration of a new job description for Community Policing Officers, general patrol and command and control officers to be piloted in Elbasan. Standard Operating Procedures for the Sector of Strategic Analysis, Planning, Evaluation, Monitoring and Reporting elaborated from the programme, was approved from the ASP General Director. In addition, an assessment of the current working procedures for Community Policing Officers has been completed, resulting in the acceptation of the need for a Standard Operating Procedures. Through the intervention there have been trained 555 Community Policing Officers all over Albania. The sustainability of the training was achieved by using the sessions to select the content to be included in the main curricula of the Albanian Safety Academy, in order to become part of the regular training of the police officers.A number of awareness workshops took place 2019 in Shkoder, Korca, Vlora, Fier, Elbasan, Kukes, Diber, Lezha, with the participation of the representative of the ASP HQ. The programme continued to support the awareness raising campaigns organized by the ASP in 169 schools all over Albania including the use of Facebook. These activities were very much appreciated by the local communities and local authorities with two Community Police Officers from Lezha Commissariat being rewarded from the municipality with Certificates of Appreciation for the work performed in schools. The programme has assessed the current status about equipment and premises in Elbasan and drafted an investment plan and published a customized leaflet for the Community Policing Officers.The programme has carried out Police Satisfaction Surveys and Local Safety Measurement System in Elbasan and Kukes regions whose results have been discussed with the ASP.The intervention has contributed to the improvement of the infrastructure in selected commissariats and regional police directorates including recently the reception hall of Tropoja Commissariat and the old detention premises which were reconstructed with a combined support from the local business community. The programme supported the establishment of a prevention room in Kukes to be used for meeting and sharing with the public different presentations and awareness raising events. Posters on bullying, drug abuse, road traffic rules, community policing and domestic violence were printed to be posted in this room and in other commissariats.Through the Grant Scheme the programme recently established three Local Councils of Public Safety in different municipalities (Peqin, Vlora, Selenica). Preparations have started in the municipalities of Kor&#xE7;a and Lezha, where first meetings were organized with the Kukes municipality being the next target for 2020.The project continued to support the activities of the Multidisciplinary Technical Teams on Domestic Violence in three municipalities (Gramsh, Belsh and Kukes), while support the revitalization of the mechanism in Peqin and Librazhd. These activities were combined with the campaign of 16 days against violence against women, implemented in 6 municipalities in November  December. A training for 42 police officers in Kukes on the amendments of the law against domestic violence and the new form of risk assessment was also delivered. In Elbasan LPD the premises for the Interview Unit for Minors and Victims of Domestic Violence were renovated and refurbished. This is the first set of equipment of this type and special software installed in Albania, enforcing the provisions of the Code for Criminal Justice for Children, allowing recording of the victims interview in the presence of defence lawyers and prosecutors. This was done in close cooperation with the other Swedish funded programme on Juvenile Justice which is a cooperation between Albanian and Swedish authorities. Several grant project initiatives are also contributing among others to combat DV. The grants component is providing funds to local civil society organizations for developing and strengthening partnerships and cooperation between police and communities, schools, and NGOs. In parallel to the activities carried out in the frame of Round 3 of the Grant Scheme, the project issued the 4th call for applications, covering Tirana, Kuk&#xEB;s and Berat regions. 16 out of 17 grants of Round 2 completed the activities during the reporting period. All grants of Round 3 were being implemented following the timelines and plan of activities. For the 4th Round, there were received 26 applications in total.  The general conclusion is that the intervention has been contributing to the work of Albanian State Police in all the programme pillars and with tangible results. The financial reports provide an accurate update of the budget expenditures situation and the plan for the next invoices. Since payments of invoices is done on monthly basis, there is a solid budget follow up and monitoring from both the implementing consultant and the Embassy. The risk level has not changed, and an evaluation of the programme is going on, with the draft report expected within May.</narrative>
