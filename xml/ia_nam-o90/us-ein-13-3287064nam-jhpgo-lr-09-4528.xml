   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Early in the project, MCHIP supported and worked with the Reproductive Health Technical Committee to revise the service delivery guidelines and standards for family planning.  Additionally, in collaboration with the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare, MCHIP developed a family planning training course for providers.  Using this course, MCHIP trained 25 national trainers in the first year of the project and conducted step-down trainings for providers at the county level in 14 counties as well as provided supportive supervision to the trainers.  

MCHIP is involved in a number of innovative community level family planning distribution approaches that include: distributing condoms and information in beauty salon and barber shop workers to spread the word about family planning; training peer providers in the markets to provide family planning counseling as well as certain methods, including refills of birth control pills and condoms as well as referrals to the hospital, and working with Muslims United for Progress, a Muslim organization, which worked with MCHIP to adapt healthy timing and spacing messages from the Qur&#x2019;an to the Liberian context and conduct workshops to create awareness. 

MCHIP also collaborated with the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare to launch a pilot initiative to integrate family planning and immunization services in selected health facilities in Bong and Lofa counties.  In this initiative, women bringing their children in for routine vaccinations were also given key family planning messages and if interested were referred to a family planning provider that day.  

MCHIP is also implementing a postpartum hemorrhage prevention project using misoprostol using facility and community-distribution approach in two districts in Grand Bassa county, Liberia.

Additionally, MCHIP is doing work in newborn health.  They developed the Newborn Situational Analysis (SITAN) and a review of Liberia&#x2019;s readiness to implement and scale-up newborn health interventions.  They also trained 23 national trainers on Kangaroo Mother Care (including doctors, nurses, tutors and reproductive health supervisors).  MCHIP introduced chlorhexidine for cord care to Liberia and it will not be included on the country&#x2019;s essential medicines list.  Finally, MCHIP supported the MOHSW in designing and printing counseling cards and booklets for the Home-Based Maternal Newborn Health Care Training Manual.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Liberia&#x2019;s long civil war left its health care service delivery system fragmented, severely damaged and heavily dependent on donor funds. The conflict also crippled the capacity of the system to provide adequate health services for its people, leading to a serious decline in health indicators and access to care.  To combat some of these issues, in 2009, USAID Liberia requested the assistance of the Maternal and Child Health Integrated Program (or MCHIP) to address the dire situation in the country related to the provision of family planning services.  Since then, MCHIP Liberia has been providing support to the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare in Liberia to help operationalize the national family planning and reproductive health strategy.  MCHIP has become involved in a number of different areas including family planning and immunization integration, prevention of postpartum hemorrhage using misoprostol and neonatal health.</narrative>
