   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Institutional strengthening for women&#x2019;s political and socio-economic rights Advocacy in eSwatini.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Since 2012, WLSA has been receiving institutional support from CAFOD as well as support to implement advocacy projects aimed at transforming power relations towards promoting women&#x2019;s participation in decision making processes as key to progressive realization of women&#x2019;s rights. Despite the long-standing strategy to cultivate women&#x2019;s participation in decision making, statistics of women in power remained almost stagnant for the past 2 elections; only two (2) women were voted into parliament in the 2018 elections out of 59 constituencies (3%), 48 women were elected for Bucopho&#x2019;s  335 seats (14%) and 8 Women for Indvuna Yenkhundla&#x2019;s  59 constituencies (13%). This has shown little improvement compared to the 2013 elections as only 1 woman was voted into parliament out of 55 constituencies, the Indvuna Yenkhundla was 14% and Bucopho was at 14%. It was important to acknowledge failure for any intended successor interventions, hence WLSA through the support from CAFOD conducted an after-action review of WLSA&#x2018;s advocacy strategy, to look at challenges, what has worked and what can be improved based on the previous interventions. This process contributed to the new advocacy strategy that WLSA has conducted which was also supported by CAFOD, whose overall Goal is &#x201C;a transformed society that recognizes and promotes women&#x2019;s political and socio-economic rights, resulting in 50% participating in decision making from community to national level by year 2023&#x201D;</narrative>
