  <description>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project seeks to ensure greater and more meaningful participation of women, girls and youth in the politics and governance of the country. This will be achieved through empowering citizens to actively participate in local and national decision making processes, strengthening local mechanisms of human rights monitoring and reporting as well as enhancing the capacities of traditional leaders and elected representatives to fulfil their mandates in a democratic way.

The project will contribute to three programme outcomes, which are;
(1) Citizens, in particular women and other marginalised groups claim their rights and meaningfully participate in civic processes - This will be achieved through provision of paralegal support to women and girls; simplifying, translating and disseminating the Bill of Rights in the Constitution; community-based targeted civic education; Convening forums to discuss human rights issues and create a common agenda. 

(2) Traditional leaders and elected representatives understand human rights standards and are able to exercise their duties accordingly - this will include training of traditional/elected leaders on HR and women&#x2019;s legal rights, sensitising traditional leaders on the Women&#x2019;s Charter; targeted meetings with traditional and elected leaders; and facilitating interface forums between communities and traditional and elected leaders

(3) CSOs are able to use evidence based human rights monitoring data to advocate for the fulfilment of national/international human rights commitments - This will be achieved through setting up and implementing a community based human rights monitoring system; parliamentary observation and monitoring; producing and disseminating monthly, quarterly and annual reports on HR, production of a CSO Shadow Report on HR; participation in sessions of human rights treaty monitoring bodies; convening a National Human Rights Forum;  and Coordinating and disseminating information/learning via CAFOD networks.</narrative>
