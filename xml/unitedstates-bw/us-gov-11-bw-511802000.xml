    <narrative xml:lang="EN">Botswana is one of the United States&apos; strongest allies in Africa and offers a powerful model to the region and world of a stable, democratic African nation. However, while attempting to meet the pressing need to diversify its diamond-dependent economy, Botswana continues to struggle to address one of the world&apos;s highest rates of income inequality and the second highest HIV prevalence rate in the world. U.S. assistance supports management of the HIV/AIDS epidemic, including the epidemic&apos;s broader impact on women and vulnerable citizens. U.S. assistance also seeks to build a more robust military-to-military partnership with Botswana while encouraging its support for regional security.</narrative>
