   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In order for the lobby and advocacy strategy to work, European Journalism Centre believes there is also a strong necessity to develop an international program. On the one hand, lobby and advocacy efforts are immensely effective when and if international (diplomatic and media) pressure is applied to persuade government and authorities to improve and change their behavior and enabling environment. This is especially true in the area of safety. On the other hand, global networks of peer organizations can leverage learning, research and development efforts by other actors. Coordination can also foster collective attention to issues and especially help and improve harmonization of intervention efforts and aid effectiveness.</narrative>

     <narrative xml:lang="EN">Provide the Dutch MoFA with information on violations and threats to journalist&apos;s safety for the Universal Periodic Review. + Advocate that they take this into account in their overall policy-making. 2017: EJC attended the UN Plan of Action on the Safety of Journalists consultation at Unesco in Geneva on 29 June along with a representative from Project Syndicate&apos;s Press Released press freedom global editorial series. The convening provided an open platform for dialogue on press freedom organisations&apos; recommendations to the UN Plan. Takeaways included a growing consensus among many UN member states on the need to support journalist safety and end impunity. Priorities were discussed ranging from inclusion of online harassment of journalists &#xAD;especially female&#xAD; in the UN Plan to the explosive growth of the journalist prison population: currently the largest ever recorded. The underreported nature - &apos;awareness&apos;/coverage - in the media itself of press freedom issues provides numerous opportunities for the &quot;Press Released&quot; series to coordinate with press freedom stakeholders on visibility and awareness campaigns at the global level. The consultative mechanism is important because it allows specific press freedom violation cases (e.g. Bolivia, Zimbabwe) that are often overshadowed by major violations (Mexico, Turkey, Venezuala) to receive a wider hearing.</narrative>

     <narrative xml:lang="EN">The European Journalism Centre launched &#x201C;Press Released&#x201D;, in January 2017, a new platform and commentary series established in partnership with non-profit editorial service Project Syndicate to stimulate debate and heightened awareness around the global challenges confronting media and journalists. The series, available to Project Syndicate&#x2019;s 500+ member media outlets for publication, showcases material produced by some of the organisation&#x2019;s most prolific contributors specialised in the media field. The series will also feature commentary by economic, political and cultural thought leaders to illustrate media&#x2019;s impacts across all spheres of society. &#x201C;Press Released&#x201D; addresses the growing threats to independent media and journalist safety across the globe. From &#x2018;fake news&#x2019; and digital security to self-censorship and outdated business models, &#x201C;Press Released&#x201D; seeks to immerse and engage readers in the latest issues raging around the media and the consequences for civil society and good governance. The first editorial outputs within the reporting period January-March included contributions on issues impacting media by Peter Singer, Francis Fukuyama, Sergei Guriev, Tony Karon, Chris Patten and Aleksander Dardeli. During April-June two columns were published, by Sasahi Tharoor and Steven Rosenbaum. During July-September four columns were published by Hannah Storm, Maria Xynou, Anya Schiffrin and Nina Ognianova. During Oct-Dec 5 columns were published by Jago Russell &amp; Christophe Deloire, Tara Susman-Pena, Kent Harrington, Kelly Born and FPU director, Leon Willems (his column was published in over 31 publications in 27 countries). 2018: Q1 During January-March 9 columns were published by Bajinder Pal Singh, Alexandra Borchardt (2), Rapha&#xEB;l Hadas-Lebel, George Soros, Courtney C. Radsch, Marius Dragomir, Shashi Tharoor and Robert Skidelsky. Each column is tracked for publication and measured for audience engagement and further impacts. Increased efforts are made to place editorials in media outlets within Strategic Partnership target countries. During April-June six columns were published by Anya Schiffrin, Leon Willems, Nanjala Nyabola, Gulnoza Said, Christophe Deloire and Teldah Mawarire. &#x2028;In Accra on May 2-3, EJC/Project Syndicate had a joint panel at UNESCO&#x2019;s World Press Freedom Day celebration. The panel was an opportunity to explore the myriad challenges the media faces today in a new and unique way. We did this by organising a panel that was quite different: we invited speakers from outside of media/press freedom advocacy circles, bringing together experts from other fields, such as development, economics, science, and the arts, who exemplify how press freedom intersects all segments of society. These panelists spoke to how press freedom and the free flow of information is needed for a functioning - and flourishing &#x2013; society. Panellists: &#xA0;Nina L. Khrushcheva, Carl Manlan, Nanjala Nyabola, Dorothy Nyambi, Binyavanga Wainaina. Moderator: Mark Nelson from the Center for International Media Assistance (CIMA). Q3: During July-September four columns were published by Kelly Born, Hannah Storm, Alexandra Borchardt and Shirin Ebadi &amp; Christophe Deloire. Q4: During October-December seven columns were published by: Leon Willems, Joseph S. Nye, Daoud Kuttab (2), Alexandra Borchardt, Hannah Storm and Robert Mahoney. 2019: Q1 During January-March seven columns were published by: Nina Khrushcheva, Shayera Dark, Matthew, Andrew &amp; Paul Caruana Galizia, Madeleine de Cock Burning &amp; Miguel Maduro, Prue Clarke, Alexandra Borchardt and Hannah Storm. Q2: During April-June four columns were published by: Josh Friedman, Marius Dragomir, Wu&#x2019;er Kaixi &amp; Christophe Deloire, Leon Willems. Q3: During July-September four columns were published by: Alexandra Borchardt (2), Karen Kornbluh &amp; Ellen P. Goodman and Adewunmi Emoruwa. Q4: During October-December five columns were published by: Peter Cunliffe-Jones, Laura Zommer, Noko Makgato &amp; Will Moy, Mark Nelson, Alexandra Borchardt, and Diane Foley. 2020 Q1: During January-March three columns were published by Leon Willems, Lydia Khalil and Aryeh Neier. Q2: During April-June seven columns were published by L&#xE1;zl&#xF3; Bruszt, Mellissa Fung, Jan-Werner Mueller, Hannah Storm, Philip N. Howard, Courtney C. Radsch and Mark Stephens.
Q3: During July-September four columns were published by Anya Schiffrin, Laura Wotton &amp; Agnes Binagwaho, Sava Tati&#x107; and Adam Hug.</narrative>
