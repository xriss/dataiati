   <narrative xml:lang="EN">CONTEXT ANALYSIS: Zimbabwe has seen the biggest political change in nearly four decades, with longtime ruler Robert Mugabe resigning on November 21 after his own party, ZANU-PF started proceedings to impeach him while the military took over control of the country and placed him under house arrest in a de facto coup. Emmerson Mnangagwa, Mugabe&#x2019;s long-time aide who he had dismissed as his deputy on November 6, was nominated to take over as party and government leader, to complete his term of office and stand the ruling party&#x2019;s candidate in the elections in 2018. Mugabe&#x2019;s fall was preceded by increased levels of political unrest, which escalated since April 2016, after a video by a local pastor went viral and sparked a chain reaction across the country. In just a short time, massive civil unrest displayed online grew into a national movement offline, the so-called #ThisFlag movement. By July that year, movement leaders managed to successfully organise a national shutdown, followed by other peaceful protests across the country. The government responded by retaliating with violence. Journalists and other civil society activists run high risks of being arrested without charges or physically assaulted. Protests were banned, although the High Court proclaimed the protests legal and constitutional. The new president has promised a raft of changes since he took office, including a return to the rule of law and respect for property rights as well as constitutionally allowed human rights. The president is under pressure from civic society, would-be investors and opposition parties to implement political and economic reforms as the country is due to hold elections by July 2018 in the first big test of his legitimacy. Under Mugabe, Zimbabwe was among the world&#x2019;s most censored countries with a raft of laws to muzzle or restrict the few independent media that existed. Even then, they often were physically attacked, jailed and faced persistent harassment. According to the Media Institute for Southern Africa (Misa), between 2017 and 2017, there have been 32 instances in which journalists had been assaulted or harassed while doing their jobs. The new president has so far not exhibited extremist behaviour and has sought to engage with the media and the public via interviews with mainly international media, and social media. He has promised to respect democratic rights but has hardly mentioned human rights or media rights. One can only hope that those rights will include media freedom and that the government will remove laws that have been used a free media environment. He has done nothing yet, however, to remove or reduce the plenty mechanisms for controlling the media in Zimbabwe that were put in place by Mugabe. These mechanisms include the new Ministry of Information Communication Technology and Cyber Security as well as the country&#x2019;s so-called &#x201C;access to information&#x201D; law, which includes the powerful Media and Information Commission regulatory body. Zimbabwe is classified as a low-income country; ranked 155 out of 188 countries in the Human Development Index. PROBLEM ANALYSIS: Zimbabwe&apos;s press freedom declined and is currently ranked 162nd and as &apos;not free&apos; in the 2016 Freedom of the Press Index. Although freedom of expression and press freedom are protected in the 2013 constitution, in practice these rights are curbed and stifled by the Access to Information and Protection of Privacy Act (AIPPA) and the Public Order and Security Act (POSA). Under POSA, public demonstrations and protests are effectively illegal. AIPPA stifles freedom of expression and criminalises defamation and libel. The Majority of Zimbabwe&apos;s media is owned or controlled by the state. Zimbabwe&apos;s media landscape and sector remains highly polarised. Print media sector is the most developed sector, yet very small, with few independent players who have difficulty securing readers outside of the 2 main cities (Harare and Bulawayo). Its radio and television sector is predominantly state-owned despite some newcomers in the radio sector. Due to this situation, there are no truly independent local and licensed radio or TV stations. Those that can be called independent, including EJC&apos;s The Source, depend largely on donor funding, which has been declining since 2013. Journalism education is of poor quality and lacks necessary equipment. Journalism graduates lack both theoretical as well as practical knowledge. It is very common for a TV journalism graduate not to have used a camera during his/her study. However, with internet spreading, mainly through mobile telephones, new opportunities for improving the quality of journalism and increasing/strengthening freedom of expression have developed. Professionalism is poorly developed. Independent media are continually under threat of being arrested. Salaries are low and brown envelope journalism widespread. Mainstream media hardly report on any developments outside of the country&#x2019;s capital and they also largely ignore women as an audience, not addressing issues that are important to them. Gender&#x2013;based violence and gender-based discrimination is rampant in the country, but little effort is made by media outlets to shed light on the growing gender divide. There are very few influential female journalists. Recent developments are the licensing of several community radio stations, which are all aligned to the state. The announcement of the digitisation process, which has been delayed, comes with high expectations. It remains to be seen how and if this will change the current state of affairs. Gender is an underdeveloped segment in the sector. Apart from the women&apos;s glossy Jewel, there are virtually no women-centered and gender balanced content. Her Zimbabwe is still there, but its activity has been minimal.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">EJC and FPU have both been active in Zimbabwe in recent years through MFSII funding. EJC collaborated with the Thomson Reuters Foundation since 2011 to establish The Source. Key accomplishments include: launching and initiating an independent financial and business news service and nation-wide stringer network; providing technical consulting on designing the operational model and IT infrastructure, training, recruitment and mentoring of business journalists and stringers; distribution of stories into national media; and providing legal support and indemnity insurance.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">STRATEGY L&amp;A FPU/EJC: Through its partnerships with The Source and MCZ will support lobby and advocacy activities on the restrictive media environment and increasing government accountability, access to information and open data, and citizen engagement in media platforms. In order to be successful, an additional partner(s) needs to be identified in the area of monitoring media freedom, freedom of expression and reporter safety. The media partners will cooperate closely with civil society groups to promote women empowerment in the country. STRATEGY FOR CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT FOR L&amp;A EJC/FPU: Capacity development for lobby and advocacy of partners will focus on the following key themes: Strengthen capacity of partners to further expand content and open new platforms for syndicated news and advocacy commentary, launch an Investigative Bureau and sections focused on women- produced content and female audiences; Support and improve journalists&#x2019; role as civil society watchdogs by increasing their capacity to produce high-quality, ethical, data-driven investigative, financial and accountability reports and strengthen their capacity on safety &amp; Internet security issues and use of secure whistle blower platforms; Support the ability of partners and their networks to effectively monitor press freedom/content quality/safety issues as part of their overall lobbying efforts directed toward appropriate government agencies and officials; Strengthen capacity of partners to interact and strategically integrate into pan-African media networks and to engage with local civil society advocacy partners such as Zimbabwe Editors Forum, Media Monitoring Project, Media Commission; Develop digital tools, training and media literacy activities in order increase overall citizen engagement in media, with particular focus on increasing the participation of women and youth; Provide citizen journalism training in order to equip journalists and (citizen) journalists with needed skills and tools to provide uncensored information and news throughout Zimbabwe. GENDER EQUALITY will be approached through two kinds of interventions: Increasing awareness among the boundary partner of the necessity of instituting gender policies and exploration of a developing a formal gender policy in order to ensure that current hiring practices, communications and all in-house materials/resources reflect gender sensitivity; Gender mainstreaming will be reflected in The Source content production on all levels: gender of reporters/stringers, sources of information and topics on gender will be emphasised and monitored. Specific safety/security situation of female journalist will be focused on. SAFETY ASPECTS will be approached through three kinds of interventions: Safety and security measures (physical and cyber) will be mainstreamed into internal policies as well as staff capacity building training materials; Safety/security matters will be internally monitored regularly and reported to a domestic and international audience; Safety/Security resources will be produced and utilised by all The Source staff.</narrative>

It is expected to provide an end-to-end news production, curation and distribution platform as well as live blogging of events in real time. 2017: The Source is in the process of hiring a full time IT/visibility officer as part of The Source&apos;s relaunch of its website, content management system, news production/curation/distribution platform and live blog guided by technical expertise from SourceFabric. On-going discussions with news agency for utilisation of The Source content at the pan-African level. The Source advanced towards launching Super Desk, a content management system, which allows The Source to manage and co-ordinate its workflow better, linking core staff at head office in Harare with correspondents across Zimbabwe. A MoU was signed between The Source African News Agency (ANA), which will distribute the Source&apos;s content free of charge for 6 months. The Source is in the process of recruiting a Digital Manager, who will co-ordinate the news agency&apos;s digital products and platforms. Superdesk, a customised content management system designed specifically for The Source, officially launched in June which allows Source editorial staff to manage and increase the quality/quantity of content output across various digital platforms. Superdesk is a key tool of the Source&#x2019;s overall strategy to increase audience as well as content offerings for potential subscribers. There is an increased uptake of The Source content, most notably by two privately owned weeklies: The Zimbabwe Independent and The Standard. The Superdesk newsroom management system is up and running utilised currently and&#xA0;exclusively by the&#xA0;editor-in-chief. Plans to bring expert in October to help retrain staff on content management system usage. Google analytics shows that the number of unique visitors to The Source website has increased three-fold between April and September this year to 75,000 page views. The story pick-ups in the print media are too numerous to count. The Source hired a Digital Products Programmer who will be responsible for selling subscriptions to media outlets and who will perform regular maintenance on Superdesk.</narrative>

In the first quarter of 2017, MCZ started to make arrangements in order to implement the strategic plan. In Q1 staff for content production and visual editing has been recruited. In Q2 the new team members for content production and visual editing started and are getting into the workflow that was developed with the help of the trainer that also conducted the training in Q1. The same trainer also provides distance mentoring and reviews content produced. This year MCZ focusses on strengthening its quality and distribution. Opportunities to generate an income through other means are minimal to none, due to the very poor state of local economy. A state which is not foreseen to change any time soon, it can only worsen. Despite having a strategic plan, opportunities to generate an income through other means are minimal to none, due to the very poor state of local economy.

For example, an application for GIZ has been granted in January. Q2: Funding opportunities have been on the decline and are very few. Funders increasingly are pulling away and those that are there do not see media as a priority. Funders have increasingly come to focus on food security and accountability. Further to this, the shrinking funds are largely channelled through a local basket fund managed by DIA in an initiative called TRACE, of which only few know how to access these. Funding opportunities have been on the decline and are very few. Media is not a real priority as opposed to food aid, the upcoming elections and accountability. Nevertheless, a partnership with GIZ was established.</narrative>

     <narrative xml:lang="EN">A small group of 10 citizen journalists, consisting of 6 alumni and 4 new people, has been trained in Q1 to form the nucleus of an MZC stringer network that will produce content regularly. They have started to produce reports. Next to this a smaller group of students will be trained in Q3 from which only the best ones will be offered to string for MCZ. Other trainings to NGO&apos;s will be done on request of when an opportunity to do so arises.&#xA0; A follow up training took place in Q2 of a small group of 10 citizen journalists, consisting of 6 alumni and 4 new people. After the first training held in Q1 a content planner and video editor were added to the local MCZ team. The training was both a form of induction for the two new team members as well as for the contributors to get acquainted and establish a working routine. By end of Q2 MCZ started to have a more stable production routine, is delivering 3 reports a week at set days and times. A majority of the reports are on issues related to the current economic hardship and ways of survival by ordinary citizens. In addition, reports have been produced attempting to tackle the confusion around the biometric voter registration system, as well as elections and role of youth. In Q3 a training in Public Social Accountability Monitoring took place for a small group of MCZ alumni and contributors, as part of the overall capacity building plan for 2017. It is the third capacity building training of this year. The overall objective was to introduce them to social monitoring concepts and practices and how to do this through citizen journalism. The effect of this has been reflected in more consistent production flow, and a focus on stories about social issues. By Q4 a large number of trained contributors no longer produced for MCZ as a many of them actually found employment with other media or pursued careers as freelancers for other outlets thanks to their training provided by this project, which is a positive outcome overall. However, this positive outcome is on the one hand negatively impacting the achievement of the strategic goals as set out in the strategic plan for 2017-2018, which become more difficult to realise as trained capacity goes away.</narrative>

    <description>
     <narrative xml:lang="EN">MCZ already collaborates with 4 local universities through which young students are trained in citizen journalism using mobile phones. The new strategy foresees this partnership with universities to continue and the establishment of a winter and/or summer school to be hosted at and by one of the participating universities. New universities will be added per request. Winter school is planned for quarter 3. This remains the same in Q3. As indicated in earlier reports, the partnership with universities continues, which in July of 2017 materialised in MCZ holding the inaugural Winterschool, consisting of a 5-day training, held at the Midlands State University (MSU) whereby a total of 14 students (of which 8 are female) were instructed in the basics of mobile journalism. They are currently undergoing their mentorship. Reports produced during the mentorship and that are thought to be of a sufficient journalistic quality, are posted on the project&apos;s social media. This remains the same in Q4. However, the production level of this year&#x15B; student group was nevertheless lower than expected. Out of the 14 students trained, only four successfully completed the requisite 8 stories by the end of the extended mentoring period. 112 stories in total were the expected output. However, in the period under review, the students had produced only 65. The general under-performance of students was attributable to several factors including: the fact that the work students had to produce for the project sometimes conflicted with their classes and assignments. Out of the 65 stories produced by students, a total of 23 stories have been published and broadcast. From the lecturers&#x2019; feedback there are indications that the Universities recognise MCZ as a competent complimentary training institution.</narrative>

Majority of CSOs have indicated that distribution poses certain risks, and are reluctant. There is one media organisation that reacted positively, yet the details still need to be worked out. Q4: Where distribution by CSOs is concerned, the situation remains unchanged. CSOs feel this could pose a risk and are reluctant to do so, even though they are positive towards work of MCZ. But other initiatives do take place where MCZ interacts and works together with other CSOs. Such as a social media and roundtable discussion hosted by the Swedish Embassy in October, on the opportunities and challenges for using social media as a vehicle for civil society networking, activism and civic engagement. MCZ also participated and made a presentation at the ZACRAS radio symposium held in November, on the subject of alternative publishing platforms in a digitally complex environment.</narrative>

Implementation of five-day business and financial news capacity building workshop for 15 The Source staff and correspondents. The workshop included sessions dedicated to reporting on gender, ethics, utilising innovative online tools and resources and local sources of data. This workshop took place in Harare on 06-10 February 2017. The Source senior staff continued to be trained on Superdesk, the new content management system. In May senior Source staff participated in five days of pre-launch content management system training for Superdesk, In May senior Source staff participated in consultations for &#x2018;Sourcebot&#x2019;, a new interactive newsbot designed to reach The Source&#x2019;s audience via FB messenger. Production of the Sourcebot has moved from planning to actual coding of the software. The bot front end is being finished up (i.e. everything the users will interact with menus, quick responses, making sense of user questions etc.) then work starts on the building the corpus of articles that will be surfaced by Sourcebot. We expect the bot to go live by end of 2017. Preparations for workshop on Data Driven Journalism skills building and practical reportage outputs utilising data for publication for The Source staff and correspondents. In November The Source held an advanced Data and Financial Reporting Workshop with 16 staff members and stringers. There is an increased appreciation of data in stories, mainly from staff who now produce data tables to back up their stories but the problem remains with stringers. The use of Superdesk newsroom management system is now universal. In October staff was retrained and the new Digital Products Programmer was brought up to speed. Work continues on Sourcebot. The experimental bot is available. The Source Editor-In-Chief was part of the participants at the Bloomberg African Media Innovators programme held in Accra, Ghana from November 12-14, 2017. The conference provided an insight on how some African media houses are innovating to stay ahead of the curve.</narrative>

In the period under review, MCZ started to experiment with offline focus group discussions intended mainly to understand expectations, how content is being received and also for research purposes for one of the MCZ story products - The Big Question. MCZ on its social platforms poses the question of the day or a talking point informed by developments in the country, and audiences do engage with the issues mainly because of the pertinent and timely nature. MCZ posts call to actions after each video and or other content posted and attempts to create dialogue with its audience. However, though there is some development, it is also still a challenge, as the predominant platform is Facebook. Q4: overall MCZ story performance was very good with a total of 9,572 minutes of footage viewed and 11,200 total views in October and November on Facebook alone.</narrative>

At the same time giving such communities also a voice through the MCZ website.

     <narrative xml:lang="EN">There are over 300 stories posted on the MCZ Facebook, website and youtube. In addition, MCZ attempts to harvest the stories that have led to social change through The Stories to Learn methodology, which was introduced by FPU. Via this method the first stories of impact of MCZ&apos;s distributed content were obtained. It is planned that this methodology will be regularly used in the future. This methodology has unveiled examples of stories that have had impact on the local level, whereby local authorities picked up a few of the stories in which MCZ&#x2019;s citizen journalists addressed specific social problems. Based on these items the authorities made the necessary adjustments to solve the addressed problem. In Q2 10 stories were produced and published. Following the strategic planning in 2016 it was agreed that MCZ should next to training also venture into production. The operational stem is to publish at least three stories per week, which mean in one quarter, a total of at least 30 original stories are to be produced. What gets published is only what has been deemed to meet journalistic quality criteria. MCZ has been introduced to the methodology of Stories to Learn in 2016, which was well received. But it remains to be seen how the methodology will be incorporated by MCZ as a way also to find stories of social impact. On average MCZ produces 12 stories per month. Most are on social issues. In the period under review MCZ lost a few contributors, due to which some of the production slowed down. But once a new group was trained, the pace was regained. In Q4 25 stories were produced. Most are on social issues. A story on homosexuality in Bulawayo even went viral and had over 7.000 views.</narrative>
