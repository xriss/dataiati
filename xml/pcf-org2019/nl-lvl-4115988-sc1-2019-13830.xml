   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In the traditional Vietnamese worldview, people should live in harmony with nature. At the same time, however, they must make use of natural resources to provide for their day-to-day survival. Nature was also seen as a constant threat to human survival, with the frequent occurrence of floods, typhoons, droughts and other natural calamities. Due to growing population pressure and recent rapid economic growth, environmental problems have increased significantly in recent decades. The extent to which the public is concerned about environmental problems is not known, however, although there seems to be a general assumption that most people have little knowledge about matters relating to the environment. After a millennium under Chinese occupation, Vietnam has inevitably adopted a significant portion of Chinese cultural traits into its local life. This could manifest in many forms, at many levels and occasions, from festive Lunar New Year shenanigans to more sombre realities like sexism and an overwhelming emphasis on academic achievement. Five Elements Theory is a Chinese philosophy used to describe interactions and relationships between things. The five elements &#x2014; wood, fire, earth, metal, and water &#x2014; are believed to be the fundamental elements of everything in the universe between which interactions occur. Five Elements Theory first appeared during the Spring and Autumn Period (770&#x2013;476 BC). It became widespread: mostly used in Chinese medicine, philosophy, fengshui, fortune-telling, and martial arts.</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Prince Claus Fund strongly believes that &apos;people develop themselves&apos;, as once stated by Prince Claus himself. The Fund facilitates such personal and organisational development by supporting activities that contribute to the professional development of individuals in the cultural sector, e.g. through increasing exposure and visibility towards new audiences, by facilitating exchanges for talent development and funding training courses (e.g. on first aid to cultural heritage after emergencies). The fund also supports the development of cultural organisations, in particular through the Network Partnership Programme that allows organisations from different contexts to learn from each other. Furthermore, the Fund aims to contribute to the overall knowledge base on Culture and Development, e.g. through M&amp;E and research.</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project creates and shares &apos;Alternative Narratives&apos;, which is one of the 3 overall outcome areas of the Prince Claus Fund, as also explained in the Theory of Change. Alternative narratives (AN) are stories, explanations, histories, spaces that provide an alternative to the dominant discourses and / or that are threatened by disappearance. Alternative narratives must be heard or seen to have significance. They take different forms, which include literature, oral history, visual arts, theatre, music, cultural heritage, i.e. artistic expressions in all disciplines. The safe spaces to make and experience AN are also included. Given its overall aim of more inclusive societies, the Fund supports AN that are relevant within context and foster inclusive societies.</narrative>
