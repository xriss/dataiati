   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Abrir Monte is a project proposed by the young artist Maria Rojas Arias. It aims to establish a laboratory for ten young artists with research and archive-based practises who will explore the history of the armed conflict in Colombia through their audiovisual work. The result of the lab will be presented in a publication and in an exhibition that will take place in Museum of Art of Tolima, Colombia.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Colombian armed conflict lasted from the mid-1960s until a peace agreement was signed between the government and the rebel forces of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) was signed in 2016. The country is now undergoing post-conflict transition. 

Tolima and the neighbouring department of Cauca were among the areas ruled and controlled by the guerrilla movement FARC during the conflict. A study in 2017 conducted by Observatory of Democracy of the Universidad de los Andes declared the post-conflict transition in these regions to have been relatively smooth and orderly. However the peace process is unstable and the role of memory in the transition has been complex. This project aims to challenge the official written history of the armed conflict in Colombia through creative practices with the archive.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">_++Outputs: ++_

&#xB7; 1 Laboratory, a space that will serve for research and collective creation, for 10 young artists

&#xB7; 1 polyphonic audio-visual essay &#x2013; collective work by the 10 artists, with three public screenings.

&#xB7; 1 exhibition in which the materials are presented

&#xB7; 1 book (400 copies) on the laboratory

_++Outcomes:++_

&#xB7; The official written history of the armed conflict in Colombian region that has been presented as a &#x201C;pillar&#x201D; of existence to the younger generations questioned and reinvented.

&#xB7; Images created and produced that reveal stories related to the history of the armed conflict in Colombia that have remained on the margins of the official discourse.

&#xB7; Replications of this more innovative way of working with archival materials - when thinking of the archive as an organism that is constantly alive.

_++Impact:++_

&#xB7; Awareness is created of the one-sidedness of official written history (by providing multiple voices to narrate histories when working with archive material).

&#xB7; The true historical record of the conflict preserved in the archives is passed on to the next generation.</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Prince Claus Fund strongly believes that &apos;people develop themselves&apos;, as once stated by Prince Claus himself. The Fund facilitates such personal and organisational development by supporting activities that contribute to the professional development of individuals in the cultural sector, e.g. through increasing exposure and visibility towards new audiences, by facilitating exchanges for talent development and funding training courses (e.g. on first aid to cultural heritage after emergencies). The fund also supports the development of cultural organisations, in particular through the Network Partnership Programme that allows organisations from different contexts to learn from each other. Furthermore, the Fund aims to contribute to the overall knowledge base on Culture and Development, e.g. through M&amp;E and research.</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project creates and shares &apos;Alternative Narratives&apos;, which is one of the 3 overall outcome areas of the Prince Claus Fund, as also explained in the Theory of Change. Alternative narratives (AN) are stories, explanations, histories, spaces that provide an alternative to the dominant discourses and / or that are threatened by disappearance. Alternative narratives must be heard or seen to have significance. They take different forms, which include literature, oral history, visual arts, theatre, music, cultural heritage, i.e. artistic expressions in all disciplines. The safe spaces to make and experience AN are also included. Given its overall aim of more inclusive societies, the Fund supports AN that are relevant within context and foster inclusive societies.</narrative>
