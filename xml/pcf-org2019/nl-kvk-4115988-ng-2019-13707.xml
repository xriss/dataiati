Through this issue, a related Instagram account, events, talks and a workshop, they aim to give a voice to Argentinian youth from different backgrounds, artists and writers, and give them a platform where they can share their experiences and views on gender and sexuality.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Since 1976 the Argentinian women&#x2019;s movement has had a clear agenda and serves as a role model for many LATAM countries. The &#x2018;regular&#x2019; Argentinian woman started getting involved in politics in the middle of the military dictatorship (between 1976 and 1983). A non-political group of women called &#x2018;The Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo&#x2019; took up the courage to go out on the streets wearing white scarves demanding their right: to know the truth about their disappeared sons. The scarf became a symbol in Argentina, and more than 15 years later the scarf is still being used in the feminist movement&#x2019;s quest for legal abortion.

Feminism in the Argentinian context is vibrant and intersectional, engaged with pushing back against neoliberal policies that are impacting women&#x2019;s health services as well as the macho ideals that contribute to a high level of violence against women. In 2015 the &#x2018;Ni Una Menos&#x2019; movement triggered many powerful organisations of women in Argentina. Since then, feminist journalism emerged and continues to be a popular means of promoting mobilization on gender rights. Considering the current political climate in Argentina and recent case of abortion-rights demonstrations in 2018, women&#x2019;s rights continue to be a subject of debate in the country.</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Prince Claus Fund strongly believes that &apos;people develop themselves&apos;, as once stated by Prince Claus himself. The Fund facilitates such personal and organisational development by supporting activities that contribute to the professional development of individuals in the cultural sector, e.g. through increasing exposure and visibility towards new audiences, by facilitating exchanges for talent development and funding training courses (e.g. on first aid to cultural heritage after emergencies). The fund also supports the development of cultural organisations, in particular through the Network Partnership Programme that allows organisations from different contexts to learn from each other. Furthermore, the Fund aims to contribute to the overall knowledge base on Culture and Development, e.g. through M&amp;E and research.</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project creates and shares &apos;Alternative Narratives&apos;, which is one of the 3 overall outcome areas of the Prince Claus Fund, as also explained in the Theory of Change. Alternative narratives (AN) are stories, explanations, histories, spaces that provide an alternative to the dominant discourses and / or that are threatened by disappearance. Alternative narratives must be heard or seen to have significance. They take different forms, which include literature, oral history, visual arts, theatre, music, cultural heritage, i.e. artistic expressions in all disciplines. The safe spaces to make and experience AN are also included. Given its overall aim of more inclusive societies, the Fund supports AN that are relevant within context and foster inclusive societies.</narrative>
