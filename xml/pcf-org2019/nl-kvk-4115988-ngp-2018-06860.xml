   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Escola Livre de Dan&#xE7;a da Mar&#xE9; (ELDM, Mar&#xE9; Free Dance School), located in favela da Mar&#xE9;, a socioeconomic vulnerable complex of 16 favelas in the municipality of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, offers free dance classes to the residents of the favela, combining artistic and socio-pedagogical actions around dance. They propose to invest in the next generation and in the future of the school by expanding their existing programme through 7 activities: 1) the training of young people to take leadership positions in school, 2) inviting national and international artists to create a choreography with their students, 3) workshops around diversity and gender issues, 4) French and English classes, 5) cultural tours outside the favela, 6) workshops on nutrition and health care and 7) music classes.</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Prince Claus Fund strongly believes that &apos;people develop themselves&apos;, as once stated by Prince Claus himself. The Fund facilitates such personal and organisational development by supporting activities that contribute to the professional development of individuals in the cultural sector, e.g. through increasing exposure and visibility towards new audiences, by facilitating exchanges for talent development and funding training courses (e.g. on first aid to cultural heritage after emergencies). The fund also supports the development of cultural organisations, in particular through the Network Partnership Programme that allows organisations from different contexts to learn from each other. Furthermore, the Fund aims to contribute to the overall knowledge base on Culture and Development, e.g. through M&amp;E and research.</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project creates and shares &apos;Alternative Narratives&apos;, which is one of the 3 overall outcome areas of the Prince Claus Fund, as also explained in the Theory of Change. Alternative narratives (AN) are stories, explanations, histories, spaces that provide an alternative to the dominant discourses and / or that are threatened by disappearance. Alternative narratives must be heard or seen to have significance. They take different forms, which include literature, oral history, visual arts, theatre, music, cultural heritage, i.e. artistic expressions in all disciplines. The safe spaces to make and experience AN are also included. Given its overall aim of more inclusive societies, the Fund supports AN that are relevant within context and foster inclusive societies.</narrative>
