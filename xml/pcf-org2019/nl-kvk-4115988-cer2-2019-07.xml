   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Buddhist country of Bhutan has undergone great changes in the last couple of years when adopting Western ways of modern life. At the same time, there are different initiatives to preserve the country&#x2019;s rich culture. In 2012, Bhutan nominated eight sites for the World Heritage List, among them the Wangduephodrang Dzong (fortress-monastery) which burnt down before a decision could be taken by UNESCO. Fire is a common threat to houses as well as cultural heritage buildings.

The Wangduechhoeling Palace in Bumthang, built in 1857, is a classic example of nineteenth-century Bhutanese architecture. The palace became the seat of national power in the early twentieth century until it lost this function in 1960. Since then, the palace has been neglected although it is still defined as one of the most important historical monuments in the country as it is considered to be the birthplace of Bhutan&#x2019;s monarchy. In 2015, the Bhutan Foundation started major restoration work for the Palace, in collaboration with the Royal Government of Bhutan and in close consultation with the local government in Bumthang, and the community members of Wangduechhoeling village. These measures are financially supported by WMF and the US Ambassadors Fund. The risk of fire is high as no fire and security system is in place in the Palace. After discussion with local experts, the applicant proposes to install a fire mitigation and firefighting system adapted to the needs on site.</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Prince Claus Fund strongly believes that &apos;people develop themselves&apos;, as once stated by Prince Claus himself. The Fund facilitates such personal and organisational development by supporting activities that contribute to the professional development of individuals in the cultural sector, e.g. through increasing exposure and visibility towards new audiences, by facilitating exchanges for talent development and funding training courses (e.g. on first aid to cultural heritage after emergencies). The fund also supports the development of cultural organisations, in particular through the Network Partnership Programme that allows organisations from different contexts to learn from each other. Furthermore, the Fund aims to contribute to the overall knowledge base on Culture and Development, e.g. through M&amp;E and research.</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project creates and shares &apos;Alternative Narratives&apos;, which is one of the 3 overall outcome areas of the Prince Claus Fund, as also explained in the Theory of Change. Alternative narratives (AN) are stories, explanations, histories, spaces that provide an alternative to the dominant discourses and / or that are threatened by disappearance. Alternative narratives must be heard or seen to have significance. They take different forms, which include literature, oral history, visual arts, theatre, music, cultural heritage, i.e. artistic expressions in all disciplines. The safe spaces to make and experience AN are also included. Given its overall aim of more inclusive societies, the Fund supports AN that are relevant within context and foster inclusive societies.</narrative>
