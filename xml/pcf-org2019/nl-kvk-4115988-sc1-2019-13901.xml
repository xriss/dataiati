   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Food security is problematic in South Africa, which relies on an industrialised and unequal farming and distribution system. Increasing temperatures and drought deepen this crisis, with monoculture intensifying soil infertility. The government prioritises big business models aiming for quick profit, and local knowledge of biodiversity and crops is lost. Especially inhabitants of cities have little access to other means of food production, and disadvantaged communities are most affected. Repurposing the Joubert Park greenhouse, Response-Ability builds a resilient community through artistic intervention, collective gardening and knowledge sharing. In the last years South Africa has had a considerable problem with drought and shortages of water.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Response-ability, a project by three young artists, intends to restore the colonial Joubert Park greenhouse and set up a communal gardening initiative with surrounding marginalised communities. The project will document local traditional knowledge of botany and re-imagine the space of the greenhouse to be relevant and welcoming for local communities. The artists will work with individuals, NGOs and other community initiatives. The aim of the project is to build a network for exchange, climate change resilience and food sovereignty, and aims to address issues of industrialisation, inequality and soil infertility.</narrative>

_++Outcomes++_

Knowledge on the use, conservation, and practices related to wild and cultivated plants is shared. Knowledge needed to climate change adaptation is captured. Evidence: Quantitative assessment of background and number of participants. Qualitative assessment through conversation and questionnaires. Visitor book.

Greenhouse will become a community center. Evidence: Record the increased number of visitors. Garden itself is photographed monthly as the growth and health of the plants is a means of measuring engagement. Whatsapp group to share local news, and information on planting and collaborations.

Resilience to climate change adaptation of the community is enhanced. Soil quality will be improved. Diversity of plants in the area will be increased by 30%. Evidence: Ask participants to stay in touch to follow the trail of where greenhouse garden plants and seeds go. End-of-year report of all achieved outcomes, survey across stakeholders and core participants.</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Prince Claus Fund strongly believes that &apos;people develop themselves&apos;, as once stated by Prince Claus himself. The Fund facilitates such personal and organisational development by supporting activities that contribute to the professional development of individuals in the cultural sector, e.g. through increasing exposure and visibility towards new audiences, by facilitating exchanges for talent development and funding training courses (e.g. on first aid to cultural heritage after emergencies). The fund also supports the development of cultural organisations, in particular through the Network Partnership Programme that allows organisations from different contexts to learn from each other. Furthermore, the Fund aims to contribute to the overall knowledge base on Culture and Development, e.g. through M&amp;E and research.</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project creates and shares &apos;Alternative Narratives&apos;, which is one of the 3 overall outcome areas of the Prince Claus Fund, as also explained in the Theory of Change. Alternative narratives (AN) are stories, explanations, histories, spaces that provide an alternative to the dominant discourses and / or that are threatened by disappearance. Alternative narratives must be heard or seen to have significance. They take different forms, which include literature, oral history, visual arts, theatre, music, cultural heritage, i.e. artistic expressions in all disciplines. The safe spaces to make and experience AN are also included. Given its overall aim of more inclusive societies, the Fund supports AN that are relevant within context and foster inclusive societies.</narrative>
