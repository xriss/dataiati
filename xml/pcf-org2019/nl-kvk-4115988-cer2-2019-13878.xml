   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The National Archives of Suriname, under the direction of Rita Tjien Fooh, initiates the development of emergency management and disaster preparedness plans and capacity of twenty heritage institutions in Suriname, including some of the most important archives, libraries, museums and sites of the country. Representatives of the government, the Civil Protection Service and the Red Cross are also participating in this effort. During a 5-day training a total 40-45 experts will learn basic response and salvage techniques, and will acquire an understanding in ways to minimize potential damage after disaster. The concrete outcome of the training will be a developed emergency management and disaster preparedness plan for each institution. Besides, the project will strengthen the cultural (first aid) network in the country. The network is monitored by the National Archives, and stimulated by annual follow-up meetings, check-ups and exercises.</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Prince Claus Fund strongly believes that &apos;people develop themselves&apos;, as once stated by Prince Claus himself. The Fund facilitates such personal and organisational development by supporting activities that contribute to the professional development of individuals in the cultural sector, e.g. through increasing exposure and visibility towards new audiences, by facilitating exchanges for talent development and funding training courses (e.g. on first aid to cultural heritage after emergencies). The fund also supports the development of cultural organisations, in particular through the Network Partnership Programme that allows organisations from different contexts to learn from each other. Furthermore, the Fund aims to contribute to the overall knowledge base on Culture and Development, e.g. through M&amp;E and research.</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project creates and shares &apos;Alternative Narratives&apos;, which is one of the 3 overall outcome areas of the Prince Claus Fund, as also explained in the Theory of Change. Alternative narratives (AN) are stories, explanations, histories, spaces that provide an alternative to the dominant discourses and / or that are threatened by disappearance. Alternative narratives must be heard or seen to have significance. They take different forms, which include literature, oral history, visual arts, theatre, music, cultural heritage, i.e. artistic expressions in all disciplines. The safe spaces to make and experience AN are also included. Given its overall aim of more inclusive societies, the Fund supports AN that are relevant within context and foster inclusive societies.</narrative>
