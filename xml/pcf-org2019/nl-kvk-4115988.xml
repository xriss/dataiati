  <description akvo:type="6" type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">History: The Kazakh government intended to develop a ski resort at Kok-Zhailau and engaged the Canadian company &#x201C;Ecosign&#x201D; to prepare the &#x201C;System Development Plan for the Alpine Ski Area of the City of Almaty&#x201D;. In spite of their negative advice for this location (the ski tracks were not suitable), the authorities insisted in pursuing this option, even competing for the 2020 Olympic village, which they lost, but still kept it on their agenda even though there were economic problems in the country. This lead to growing opposition of &#x2018;Green&#x2019; activists and concerned locals who began to &#x201C;make a wave&#x201D; and sound the alarm in the press, and (mainly) on social networks, and collected signatures for a petition against the resort. All the while, the project was subject of many revisions and political scandal and incompetence which led to broader opposition. Experts stated that the project does not take into account the many risks &#x2013; economic, social and environmental: the territory of the resort is located on a tectonic fault in a 9-10-point seismic zone; there is a high mudflow and avalanche danger here; cutting down trees will worsen the air condition in Almaty, which is already suffering from smog, etc. Besides that, the economic calculations were not made properly: As Vadim Boreiko writes: _&#x2018;It seems that the Kok-Zhailau valley was confused with Silicon Valley&#x2019;_. In spite of all the protests the project is still on the agenda. An important asset in the valley is the Sievers apple tree. They plan to cut down 880 trees including 400 Sievers apple trees and a total of 6000 trees for road construction.

Modern genetic studies have confirmed the thesis that the Sievers apple tree is the ancestor of most cultivated apple varieties, and their origin is the area of Semirechie (Almaty region). Sievers apple is interesting not only for its history. It grows on the slopes and in river valleys at an altitude of 1500-3000m above sea level, within a limited area from Tarbagatai to Western Tien Shan. It has a deep root system, resistant to diseases and low temperatures. With overall life expectancy up to 150 years, it begins to bear fruit at the age of 12. It blooms in April and May, with large white and pink flowers. Apples ripen in September: up to 5-10 tons can be harvested per hectare of apple forest. Unfortunately, over the past 150-200 years, the once huge apple forests of the Tien Shan have decreased by almost 95%. In their homeland, in the vicinity of Almaty, the Sievers apple tree can only be seen in the small, well-protected nature &#x201C;islands&#x201D;.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Olga Kisselev proposes a project of artistic, historical and biological research of the endangered Sievers apple trees and their fruit in Kazakhstan. An international scientific team working with high-tech technology, will create multimedia installations and conduct several master-classes for young contemporary artists from Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan, involving local students. Broad dissemination of the results should stimulate global discourse.</narrative>

&#xF09E;	New partnerships and new participants from other parts of the country and the world between art related associations, artists and cultural activists.

&#x200B;

Impact 

The applicants hope that in the long the project will influence on the change of thinking about the natural environment, and inspire the creation of a new innovative &#x201C;model of life&#x201D;, on collective &quot;conscience&quot; in relation to nature. They will also experiment with artistic biotechnology by bringing extinct species back to life, or of creating new species on the preexisting base of DNA. The ultimate goal would be the delisting of the Sievers apple tree from the Red Book and include it into the Green Book of IUCN and sustain biological diversity.

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Prince Claus Fund strongly believes that &apos;people develop themselves&apos;, as once stated by Prince Claus himself. The Fund facilitates such personal and organisational development by supporting activities that contribute to the professional development of individuals in the cultural sector, e.g. through increasing exposure and visibility towards new audiences, by facilitating exchanges for talent development and funding training courses (e.g. on first aid to cultural heritage after emergencies). The fund also supports the development of cultural organisations, in particular through the Network Partnership Programme that allows organisations from different contexts to learn from each other. Furthermore, the Fund aims to contribute to the overall knowledge base on Culture and Development, e.g. through M&amp;E and research.</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project creates and shares &apos;Alternative Narratives&apos;, which is one of the 3 overall outcome areas of the Prince Claus Fund, as also explained in the Theory of Change. Alternative narratives (AN) are stories, explanations, histories, spaces that provide an alternative to the dominant discourses and / or that are threatened by disappearance. Alternative narratives must be heard or seen to have significance. They take different forms, which include literature, oral history, visual arts, theatre, music, cultural heritage, i.e. artistic expressions in all disciplines. The safe spaces to make and experience AN are also included. Given its overall aim of more inclusive societies, the Fund supports AN that are relevant within context and foster inclusive societies.</narrative>
