   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Globally, Brazil is the 4th-largest producer of garbage, amounting to more than 11 million tonnes a year according to the WWF, only 1.28% of which is recycled. Especially in large cities, the enormous amounts of waste pose a threat to the environment and to public health. In Rio de Janeiro, garbage mostly ends up in landfills, and only a small part is recycled by formal recycling companies. In the favelas, there are barely any systems in place for waste disposal. Objetos em redes will raise awareness of the waste problem through performances in the streets of Rio, and through collaboration with NGOs these videos will reach &#x2018;ghetto and risk areas&#x2019;.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project, Objetos em redes by Os Dois Produ&#xE7;&#xF5;es Art&#xED;sticas, calls attention to the problem of plastic waste in Brazil. Os Dois will engage 8 art, dance and audio-visual students to educate them and stage dance performances about body-waste relations, in 5 marginalised areas of the city. The performances will incorporate waste materials as props, and are intended to inspire sustainability and recycling in local communities. Video recording of the performances will be shared with local NGOs to ensure sustainability of the ideas created and a wider reach.</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Prince Claus Fund strongly believes that &apos;people develop themselves&apos;, as once stated by Prince Claus himself. The Fund facilitates such personal and organisational development by supporting activities that contribute to the professional development of individuals in the cultural sector, e.g. through increasing exposure and visibility towards new audiences, by facilitating exchanges for talent development and funding training courses (e.g. on first aid to cultural heritage after emergencies). The fund also supports the development of cultural organisations, in particular through the Network Partnership Programme that allows organisations from different contexts to learn from each other. Furthermore, the Fund aims to contribute to the overall knowledge base on Culture and Development, e.g. through M&amp;E and research.</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project creates and shares &apos;Alternative Narratives&apos;, which is one of the 3 overall outcome areas of the Prince Claus Fund, as also explained in the Theory of Change. Alternative narratives (AN) are stories, explanations, histories, spaces that provide an alternative to the dominant discourses and / or that are threatened by disappearance. Alternative narratives must be heard or seen to have significance. They take different forms, which include literature, oral history, visual arts, theatre, music, cultural heritage, i.e. artistic expressions in all disciplines. The safe spaces to make and experience AN are also included. Given its overall aim of more inclusive societies, the Fund supports AN that are relevant within context and foster inclusive societies.</narrative>
