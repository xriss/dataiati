   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Cemeti &#x2013; Institute for Art and Society was founded in 1988 in Yogyakarta as Cemeti Art House, making it the oldest platform for contemporary art in Indonesia. At its core it is a platform for exchange, providing space for artists to develop and exhibit their work. In 2017 the founders stepped aside from the day to day running of the organisation to create space for a younger generation to take the lead. The first act of the new team was to change the name to its current form. This change highlights the new programmatic direction of the organisation that is starting to focus on artists and cultural practitioners working to address key social and political issues, and as the applicant states: &#x2018;the use of the word &#x2018;Institute&#x2019; builds on the idea of instituting as a collective social process in which we find forms for shared urgencies and ideologies&#x2019;.</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Prince Claus Fund strongly believes that &apos;people develop themselves&apos;, as once stated by Prince Claus himself. The Fund facilitates such personal and organisational development by supporting activities that contribute to the professional development of individuals in the cultural sector, e.g. through increasing exposure and visibility towards new audiences, by facilitating exchanges for talent development and funding training courses (e.g. on first aid to cultural heritage after emergencies). The fund also supports the development of cultural organisations, in particular through the Network Partnership Programme that allows organisations from different contexts to learn from each other. Furthermore, the Fund aims to contribute to the overall knowledge base on Culture and Development, e.g. through M&amp;E and research.</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project creates and shares &apos;Alternative Narratives&apos;, which is one of the 3 overall outcome areas of the Prince Claus Fund, as also explained in the Theory of Change. Alternative narratives (AN) are stories, explanations, histories, spaces that provide an alternative to the dominant discourses and / or that are threatened by disappearance. Alternative narratives must be heard or seen to have significance. They take different forms, which include literature, oral history, visual arts, theatre, music, cultural heritage, i.e. artistic expressions in all disciplines. The safe spaces to make and experience AN are also included. Given its overall aim of more inclusive societies, the Fund supports AN that are relevant within context and foster inclusive societies.</narrative>
