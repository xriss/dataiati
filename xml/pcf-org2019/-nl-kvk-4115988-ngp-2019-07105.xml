   <narrative xml:lang="EN">++Objectives Defined by the Partner++: 

- Participate in or anticipate the concentration of a growing business sector (ensuring the survival of hip-hop festivals from which collaborative synergies such as the urban platform). 

- Achieve a critical size that allows us to compete in a market. Acquire new market shares: geographical diversification in a territory of influence or a new territory (Assalamalekoum Discovery, Assalamalekoum Abroad).

- Appropriate a product or service innovation (Production label, advertising service, local and international consultation).

- Diversify our skills or activities (train our members and build human capital).

Regarding the financing, we are working to diversify our partners by remaining focused on the objectives that concern us, and above all, remain linked to our area of expertise, namely urban cultures focused on sustainable and human development. This allows us to gain even more funds in the relevance of our action-project.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Africulturban, founded in 2006 in Pikine, a suburb of Dakar, Senegal, builds on a culture of activism in the Senegalese hip-hop scene that started with Y&#x2019;en a Marre, who received the PCF award in 2015. Africulturban started with solidarity concerts to raise money for victims of flooding but soon established a solid base and developed their work. Now they focus on using alternative education and music to engage young people in society and community and work to promote the development and dissemination of urban culture through artistic events (festivals, education programmes, exchanges and more). The organisation was born out of a vision of creating sustainable and home-grown options for young people in the banlieues &#x2013; the sprawling suburbs where school drop-out and unemployment rates are high.

Since their inception they have worked closely with a large community of young people involved in the hip-hop scene in Senegal. The scene is prolific in the region, and in Senegal in particular, and has an ingrained social and political element to it. Flow Up, a festival organised by Africulturban to discover, produce, promote and disseminate young artists, had more than 1000 applications from hip-hop collectives for the last edition. Another of their main activities is the Urban Women Week, which is the first female hip-hop festival in West Africa. The project aims to strengthen the presence and capacity of women in the field of urban cultures through frameworks of expressions as well as professional training in leadership and entrepreneurial skills.</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Prince Claus Fund strongly believes that &apos;people develop themselves&apos;, as once stated by Prince Claus himself. The Fund facilitates such personal and organisational development by supporting activities that contribute to the professional development of individuals in the cultural sector, e.g. through increasing exposure and visibility towards new audiences, by facilitating exchanges for talent development and funding training courses (e.g. on first aid to cultural heritage after emergencies). The fund also supports the development of cultural organisations, in particular through the Network Partnership Programme that allows organisations from different contexts to learn from each other. Furthermore, the Fund aims to contribute to the overall knowledge base on Culture and Development, e.g. through M&amp;E and research.</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project creates and shares &apos;Alternative Narratives&apos;, which is one of the 3 overall outcome areas of the Prince Claus Fund, as also explained in the Theory of Change. Alternative narratives (AN) are stories, explanations, histories, spaces that provide an alternative to the dominant discourses and / or that are threatened by disappearance. Alternative narratives must be heard or seen to have significance. They take different forms, which include literature, oral history, visual arts, theatre, music, cultural heritage, i.e. artistic expressions in all disciplines. The safe spaces to make and experience AN are also included. Given its overall aim of more inclusive societies, the Fund supports AN that are relevant within context and foster inclusive societies.</narrative>
