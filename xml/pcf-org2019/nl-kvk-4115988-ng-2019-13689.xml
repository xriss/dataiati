   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The city of Medellin was one of the areas of Colombia most damaged by decades of armed conflict, and was regarded as &#x2018;the murder capital of the world&#x2019;. Since the peace agreement, the city has begun to emerge culturally, but the process is fragile and funding opportunities are rare. Books are typically much more expensive than in Europe. Literature is perceived as an inaccessible and elitist pursuit. However since Librer&#xED;a Mutante began operating (in an area of Medell&#xED;n otherwise known for drugs, crime and prostitution) it has been very clear that there is an audience of young people with a strong desire to get more involved with literature. As well as its publishing activities, the space has been selling second hand books at affordable prices, which has made a real difference for many people.</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Prince Claus Fund strongly believes that &apos;people develop themselves&apos;, as once stated by Prince Claus himself. The Fund facilitates such personal and organisational development by supporting activities that contribute to the professional development of individuals in the cultural sector, e.g. through increasing exposure and visibility towards new audiences, by facilitating exchanges for talent development and funding training courses (e.g. on first aid to cultural heritage after emergencies). The fund also supports the development of cultural organisations, in particular through the Network Partnership Programme that allows organisations from different contexts to learn from each other. Furthermore, the Fund aims to contribute to the overall knowledge base on Culture and Development, e.g. through M&amp;E and research.</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project creates and shares &apos;Alternative Narratives&apos;, which is one of the 3 overall outcome areas of the Prince Claus Fund, as also explained in the Theory of Change. Alternative narratives (AN) are stories, explanations, histories, spaces that provide an alternative to the dominant discourses and / or that are threatened by disappearance. Alternative narratives must be heard or seen to have significance. They take different forms, which include literature, oral history, visual arts, theatre, music, cultural heritage, i.e. artistic expressions in all disciplines. The safe spaces to make and experience AN are also included. Given its overall aim of more inclusive societies, the Fund supports AN that are relevant within context and foster inclusive societies.</narrative>
