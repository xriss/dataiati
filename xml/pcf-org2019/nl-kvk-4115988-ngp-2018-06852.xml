   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Art Group 705</narrative>
  </title>
  <description akvo:type="5" type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Art Group 705 was founded in Bishkek during the Tulip Revolution of 2005, when the oldest participants were 22 years old, and describe their mission as the integration of art into everyday life. The group&#x2019;s name is deliberately meaningless, reflecting their interest in the theatre of the absurd, as well as the Kafkaesque situation they feel they find themselves in. Art Group 705 began as a group of theatre performers, performing on the street as well as in abandoned spaces such as parks and factories. Since 2010, the group has been developing animations in response to the Second Kyrgyz Revolution, and has become more involved in the local art scene. Since 2014 the group has co-organised the April Fools&apos; Day, an artistic manifestation including artists from all over central Asia. Artists&#x2019; talks and discussions have become an important element in the activities of Group 705, and since 2016 they have expanded their field of interest to short film and children workshops. The group&#x2019;s additional activities include a series of children&#x2019;s workshops, and Olgon-Horhon, an annual festival of experimental cinema.</narrative>

   <description>
    <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Prince Claus Fund strongly believes that &apos;people develop themselves&apos;, as once stated by Prince Claus himself. The Fund facilitates such personal and organisational development by supporting activities that contribute to the professional development of individuals in the cultural sector, e.g. through increasing exposure and visibility towards new audiences, by facilitating exchanges for talent development and funding training courses (e.g. on first aid to cultural heritage after emergencies). The fund also supports the development of cultural organisations, in particular through the Network Partnership Programme that allows organisations from different contexts to learn from each other. Furthermore, the Fund aims to contribute to the overall knowledge base on Culture and Development, e.g. through M&amp;E and research.</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project creates and shares &apos;Alternative Narratives&apos;, which is one of the 3 overall outcome areas of the Prince Claus Fund, as also explained in the Theory of Change. Alternative narratives (AN) are stories, explanations, histories, spaces that provide an alternative to the dominant discourses and / or that are threatened by disappearance. Alternative narratives must be heard or seen to have significance. They take different forms, which include literature, oral history, visual arts, theatre, music, cultural heritage, i.e. artistic expressions in all disciplines. The safe spaces to make and experience AN are also included. Given its overall aim of more inclusive societies, the Fund supports AN that are relevant within context and foster inclusive societies.</narrative>
