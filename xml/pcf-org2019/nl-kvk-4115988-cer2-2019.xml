  <description akvo:type="8" type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">1. Supporting the development and implementation      of preventive measures to safeguard tangible cultural heritage that is      acutely threatened by either natural or man-made disaster in countries and      regions where preventive measures, owing to threatening political and      armed conflict or natural catastrophes, are urgently necessary or expected      to be necessary in coming years.
2. Supporting the adaption of lessons learned      from previous disasters for the implementation of preventive measures for      cultural heritage sites under threat of human induced or natural disaster.
3. The identification of stakeholders and the      strengthening of national, regional and local networks in the field of      emergency preparedness of cultural heritage in the target countries.

Stepping up the efforts of both Foundations&#x2019; in this field by raising awareness about the importance of emergency preparedness for cultural heritage, and illustrating how preventive concepts can safeguard heritage.</narrative>

  <description akvo:type="5" type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Prince Claus Fund and the Gerda Henkel Foundation issued an Open Call for proposals specifically aimed at Emergency Preparedness for Cultural Heritage under Threat. Cultural practitioners, institutions and local NGOs from Africa, Asia, Latin America, and the Caribbean were invited to present their practical ideas for measures to protect tangible cultural heritage against acute danger and irreversible loss. While natural and human-made threats to cultural heritage &#x2013; often induced by regional armed conflicts, deliberate destruction, and, more and more, the effects of global warming &#x2013; seem to increase in recent years, most organizations in the field concentrate on emergency response in case of acute danger or after disaster. International conferences often focus on post disaster relief. The question of how to foresee or even to prevent imminent crises, how to identify stakeholders in this very important field and how to adapt lessons learned from previous disaster seems &#x2013; from our point of view &#x2013; to be underrepresented. Thus, we meet an increasing interest of partners in the field who ask for solutions based on experiences made in a context of disaster. This call aims to support 7-12 projects focusing on the development and implementation of more preparatory measures for heritage buildings, collections, and sites to protect these in case a disaster occurs. We furthermore encourage organisations to enhance their emergency preparedness by implementing lessons learned during previous incidents. This joint call for applications aims to step up both our Foundations&#x2019; efforts in the field, raise awareness about its importance and illustrate how preventive concepts can safeguard heritage.</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">Alternative narratives (AN) are stories, explanations, histories, spaces that provide an alternative to the dominant discourses and / or that are threatened by disappearance. Alternative narratives must be heard or seen to have significance. They take different forms, which include literature, oral history, visual arts, theatre, music, cultural heritage, i.e. artistic expressions in all disciplines. The safe spaces to make and experience AN are also included. Given its overall aim of more inclusive societies, the Fund supports AN that are relevant within context and foster inclusive societies.</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">In short, the PCF aims for more inclusive societies in which culture thrives through 3 outcome areas: Alternative Narratives that matter (AN)*, Networks for Exchange (NfE)** and Growth of People and Organisations (GPO)***, it does so through providing short term and long term grants, awards and supporting / (co-) organizing activities. (Also see our Theory of Change and M&amp;E Framework.)

*Alternative narratives (AN) &#x2013; stories that lead to greater understanding; stories that are seldom heard, that differ from a dominant narrative, that reveal a more complex reality

**Networks of exchange (NfE) &#x2013; interchange among organisations and individuals that broaden horizons and open new possibilities

***Growth of individuals and organisations (GPO) &#x2013; activities that strengthen the confidence and competence of cultural practitioners</narrative>
