   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Conflictorium, founded in 2013 in Ahmedabad, India, is a participatory museum that addresses the theme of conflict. They focus on intersectional and interdisciplinary approaches to peace and conflict through art, audience and archives. In the past five years the team at Conflictorium have explored notions of identity through their interventions, touching on issues such as identity &amp; society, the politics of marginalisation, gender &amp; sexuality and body politics.

They have a strong track record with regard to culture, and have been strengthening this over the past years through their gallery space. The museum is housed in the Gool lodge, a 95 year old building, where the ground floor houses a permanent exhibition focussing on conflict in Gujarat and India in general. The exhibition is a mix of participatory exhibition spaces, archival audio material and documentation. The second floor has a gallery space used for temporary exhibitions. The building is located in Old-Ahmedabad, at a crossing where multiple communities intersect. The museum attracts audiences of all ages, but the programming is especially designed to attract young adults. The exhibitions have provided a platform for young, emerging artists.

The team at Conflictorium makes a big effort to attract audiences from around the city, as well as travelling to various places in the region. They are currently focussing effort on networking in order to be able to extend their impact beyond Gujarat.</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Prince Claus Fund strongly believes that &apos;people develop themselves&apos;, as once stated by Prince Claus himself. The Fund facilitates such personal and organisational development by supporting activities that contribute to the professional development of individuals in the cultural sector, e.g. through increasing exposure and visibility towards new audiences, by facilitating exchanges for talent development and funding training courses (e.g. on first aid to cultural heritage after emergencies). The fund also supports the development of cultural organisations, in particular through the Network Partnership Programme that allows organisations from different contexts to learn from each other. Furthermore, the Fund aims to contribute to the overall knowledge base on Culture and Development, e.g. through M&amp;E and research.</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project creates and shares &apos;Alternative Narratives&apos;, which is one of the 3 overall outcome areas of the Prince Claus Fund, as also explained in the Theory of Change. Alternative narratives (AN) are stories, explanations, histories, spaces that provide an alternative to the dominant discourses and / or that are threatened by disappearance. Alternative narratives must be heard or seen to have significance. They take different forms, which include literature, oral history, visual arts, theatre, music, cultural heritage, i.e. artistic expressions in all disciplines. The safe spaces to make and experience AN are also included. Given its overall aim of more inclusive societies, the Fund supports AN that are relevant within context and foster inclusive societies.</narrative>
