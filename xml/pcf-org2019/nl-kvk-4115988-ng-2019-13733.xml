  <description akvo:type="6" type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In 2019 El Salvador began a new phase in its history. Nayib Bukele, a pragmatic business man and leader of the centre-right GANA party was elected as the youngest president in its history (born1981) and installed a new government, representing a break in the long-running dominance of the two traditional parties in that country. The new president wants to reduce the number of young people joining El Salvador&apos;s notorious criminal gangs by bolstering education. He has also called for social programmes to prevent them from being recruited in the first place, and for social reinsertion programmes to prevent reoffending. The applicants are optimistic about this new beginning, seeing San Salvador being transformed, creating new infrastructure and rehabilitating the architectural heritage of its founding town: attracting, again, to a middle class that had left the Historical Centre after deterioration in the 80s by the Civil War, gang violence and earthquakes. They see this change in politics as an ideal scenario to openness to different perspectives. Emerging political movements with legal abortion and pro platforms with leaders of the LGBTQI community. The Art Museum of El Salvador opened its first permanent exhibition of contemporary art, bringing the traditional canon of the national art to new expressive languages such as video art, installation and performance. They write that this situation is unprecedented in their history and diverse communities are preparing and working to enter the arena of the great discussions and questions that try to establish a more representative and inclusive Salvadoran society.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">_Outputs_

A group of 12 to 16 young artists will have been professionally and intellectually trained. 

2 exhibitions will have been be held (one for each group) which will present the results of the works created.

A catalog documenting the process will be printed. It is meant for future reference and is to be  distributed free of charge to public libraries and universities, cultural centers and museums, various NGOs working in culture, etc. The edition of 1,000 copies of this publication will also serve as a token of appreciation for all partner institutions and as an incentive for young participants, 

A support network for these young artists will have been put in place through the resources of the gallery. 

it will be distributed free of charge from the gallery to public libraries and universities, specialized training in youth, cultural centers and museums, various NGOs working in culture, among others. The edition of 1,000 copies of this publication will serve as a token of appreciation for all partner institutions; Also, as an incentive for young participants,

_Outcomes_ 

The newly trained artists will be empowered and who have been given tools and a network to build further on their careers as artists and gender personalities. They will go back to their own communities where they can pass on this experience to others.

The interested public will be engaged in the project via the gallery and new media (they are well connected)

_Foreseeable Impact_

El Salvador has a very limited amount of art spaces. La Unica Galeria, will be is a much awaited addition to the landscape in El Salvador. (there are 4 art spaces- the MARTE museum, the cultural center of Spain, and two gallery spaces/work spaces showing street art and commercial art products)

In a changing atmosphere in El Salvador they are seizing the right moment to start this initiative which can lead to more understanding and tolerance.</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Prince Claus Fund strongly believes that &apos;people develop themselves&apos;, as once stated by Prince Claus himself. The Fund facilitates such personal and organisational development by supporting activities that contribute to the professional development of individuals in the cultural sector, e.g. through increasing exposure and visibility towards new audiences, by facilitating exchanges for talent development and funding training courses (e.g. on first aid to cultural heritage after emergencies). The fund also supports the development of cultural organisations, in particular through the Network Partnership Programme that allows organisations from different contexts to learn from each other. Furthermore, the Fund aims to contribute to the overall knowledge base on Culture and Development, e.g. through M&amp;E and research.</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project creates and shares &apos;Alternative Narratives&apos;, which is one of the 3 overall outcome areas of the Prince Claus Fund, as also explained in the Theory of Change. Alternative narratives (AN) are stories, explanations, histories, spaces that provide an alternative to the dominant discourses and / or that are threatened by disappearance. Alternative narratives must be heard or seen to have significance. They take different forms, which include literature, oral history, visual arts, theatre, music, cultural heritage, i.e. artistic expressions in all disciplines. The safe spaces to make and experience AN are also included. Given its overall aim of more inclusive societies, the Fund supports AN that are relevant within context and foster inclusive societies.</narrative>
