   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Since its establishment in 2010 in Pristina, Kosovo, the media organisation Kosovo 2.0 has been publishing and operating in three languages: Albanian, Serbian and English. The mission of the online platform is to reach out to communities in Kosovo and the region, in order to foster dialogue and offer a cross-regional platform for discussion. Over the course of the past eight years, Kosovo 2.0 has gathered an extensive network of contributors from Kosovo, the region and the world.

The platform functions as a space for young people to become active and engaged participants of their societies. Via Kosovo 2.0 online, these young people speak on issues of democratic development, such as good governance, political participation, human rights, anti-discrimination, media responsibility, art

as political commentary, and any other topic they deem important to raise awareness and public discussion on. The online content is produced by continuous contributions from readers, followers, and young writers. Kosovo 2.0 staff also produces editorial content. The combination of Kosovo 2.0 produced articles with those written by online bloggers, journalists and writers has contributed to the publishing of thought-provoking and engaging commentary and stories, as well as toward the online platform as a venue for open and genuine public debate. The majority of readers of the page are in the age group of 20 - 30.</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Prince Claus Fund strongly believes that &apos;people develop themselves&apos;, as once stated by Prince Claus himself. The Fund facilitates such personal and organisational development by supporting activities that contribute to the professional development of individuals in the cultural sector, e.g. through increasing exposure and visibility towards new audiences, by facilitating exchanges for talent development and funding training courses (e.g. on first aid to cultural heritage after emergencies). The fund also supports the development of cultural organisations, in particular through the Network Partnership Programme that allows organisations from different contexts to learn from each other. Furthermore, the Fund aims to contribute to the overall knowledge base on Culture and Development, e.g. through M&amp;E and research.</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project creates and shares &apos;Alternative Narratives&apos;, which is one of the 3 overall outcome areas of the Prince Claus Fund, as also explained in the Theory of Change. Alternative narratives (AN) are stories, explanations, histories, spaces that provide an alternative to the dominant discourses and / or that are threatened by disappearance. Alternative narratives must be heard or seen to have significance. They take different forms, which include literature, oral history, visual arts, theatre, music, cultural heritage, i.e. artistic expressions in all disciplines. The safe spaces to make and experience AN are also included. Given its overall aim of more inclusive societies, the Fund supports AN that are relevant within context and foster inclusive societies.</narrative>
