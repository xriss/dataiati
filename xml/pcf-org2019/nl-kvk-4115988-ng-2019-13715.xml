   <narrative xml:lang="EN">According to statistics from Amnesty, 82 young black men are killed each day. The new Minister of Justice and Public Safety, Sergio Moro, has proposed bill that exempts police officers from prosecution for killing people while on the job. Bolsanaro has also passed a law that allows police to use helicopters to target &amp; shoot &#x2018;suspicious&#x2019; people in Favelas. With this project Mauricio da Silva de Lima aims to preserve the history and memory of this group that is the biggest target of violence and prejudice in Brazil. The young black men that the project focussed on are marginalised and vilified, and he feels that they need a space where their life stories are recorded. With this he wants to be able to give them a collective voice to say: &#x2018;_we have a history, we exist and we resist. Staying alive is our resistance_&#x2019;.</narrative>

The project will create a virtual museum of video interviews with these boys coupled with a series of public interventions in the ruins of the houses destroyed by the government, which is trying to drive out poor populations from slum areas.</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Prince Claus Fund strongly believes that &apos;people develop themselves&apos;, as once stated by Prince Claus himself. The Fund facilitates such personal and organisational development by supporting activities that contribute to the professional development of individuals in the cultural sector, e.g. through increasing exposure and visibility towards new audiences, by facilitating exchanges for talent development and funding training courses (e.g. on first aid to cultural heritage after emergencies). The fund also supports the development of cultural organisations, in particular through the Network Partnership Programme that allows organisations from different contexts to learn from each other. Furthermore, the Fund aims to contribute to the overall knowledge base on Culture and Development, e.g. through M&amp;E and research.</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project creates and shares &apos;Alternative Narratives&apos;, which is one of the 3 overall outcome areas of the Prince Claus Fund, as also explained in the Theory of Change. Alternative narratives (AN) are stories, explanations, histories, spaces that provide an alternative to the dominant discourses and / or that are threatened by disappearance. Alternative narratives must be heard or seen to have significance. They take different forms, which include literature, oral history, visual arts, theatre, music, cultural heritage, i.e. artistic expressions in all disciplines. The safe spaces to make and experience AN are also included. Given its overall aim of more inclusive societies, the Fund supports AN that are relevant within context and foster inclusive societies.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">29-07-2020: The overall reach of the project was much larger than expected:

Virtual museum: 38.232 (expected: 5.000)
30 Video interviews: 16.452 (expected: 5.000)
Performance Act of Speech / Time Festival - Oi Futuro: 80 (expected: 0. This activity was added during the project&apos;s implementation, because it attracted the interest of the curators of festival TIME.)
Homem Bola - urban intervention: 500 (expected: 500)
Mural dos Meninos - urban intervention: 10.000 (expected: 10.000)
I&apos;ll trade a candy for a memory - urban intervention: 200 (expected: 50)
Family Photo - performative action: 36 (expected: 60).
Sarau dos Meninos - performative action: 52 (expected: 100). 

The final two activities had a lower reach than expected. Both activities were supposed to take place in the street, but were held at cultural centre Oca dos Curumins for safety reasons.</narrative>
