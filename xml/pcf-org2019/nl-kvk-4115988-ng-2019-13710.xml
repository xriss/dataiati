   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Guatemala has one of the highest rates of femicide. Especially during the Civil War, 1960-1996, state driven sexual crime has been at high stake and its legacy still continues in today&#x2019;s society. There are about 10,000 cases of reported rape per year, but the total number is likely much higher because of under-reporting due to social stigma. According to UN Women, the rate of impunity for femicide remains at around 98 percent and as Gabriela Torres - independent advisor - states, indigenous women like Mayan people suffer more from such social injustice and poverty and sexual harassment in public spaces.

Furthermore, the influence of media on political, social and economic life are undeniable and it has strong influence on establishing gender perspectives. The relationship between media and political parties was portrayed in 2015 by the report _Financiamiento de la Pol&#xED;tica en Guatemala_ (Financing of Politics in Guatemala) prepared by the _Comisi&#xF3;n Contra la Impunidad en Guatemala_ (Commission Against Corruption in Guatemala - CICIG). This report highlights the importance of media in molding public opinion. In different sections, the document emphasises that radio and television have had more weight than print and digital media.</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Prince Claus Fund strongly believes that &apos;people develop themselves&apos;, as once stated by Prince Claus himself. The Fund facilitates such personal and organisational development by supporting activities that contribute to the professional development of individuals in the cultural sector, e.g. through increasing exposure and visibility towards new audiences, by facilitating exchanges for talent development and funding training courses (e.g. on first aid to cultural heritage after emergencies). The fund also supports the development of cultural organisations, in particular through the Network Partnership Programme that allows organisations from different contexts to learn from each other. Furthermore, the Fund aims to contribute to the overall knowledge base on Culture and Development, e.g. through M&amp;E and research.</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project creates and shares &apos;Alternative Narratives&apos;, which is one of the 3 overall outcome areas of the Prince Claus Fund, as also explained in the Theory of Change. Alternative narratives (AN) are stories, explanations, histories, spaces that provide an alternative to the dominant discourses and / or that are threatened by disappearance. Alternative narratives must be heard or seen to have significance. They take different forms, which include literature, oral history, visual arts, theatre, music, cultural heritage, i.e. artistic expressions in all disciplines. The safe spaces to make and experience AN are also included. Given its overall aim of more inclusive societies, the Fund supports AN that are relevant within context and foster inclusive societies.</narrative>
