   <narrative xml:lang="EN">During this project the Alele Museum, Library and National Archives on Majuro, Marshall Islands, will clean, catalogue and digitize the documentary heritage collection of Joachim deBrum. The collection, located at the museum but in poor shape, is the heirloom of a successful and influential indigenous family, containing over ca. 10.000 documents on life and business on the Marshall Islands and the wider region from the 1880s until the mid-1930s. There are very little documents available on the history of the Marshall Islands. The collection is one of its kind, and can be considered an invaluable, unique historical and cultural resource. However, the deBrum papers have been inaccessible for years due to their fragile condition and remote location, and have never been researched before. Also, they are facing ever-present threats: the hot and humid climate of the Island, frequent natural disasters and a rising sea-level as a consequence of global warming and climate change. Through this project the Alele Museum, in close collaboration with the family owners, will largely increase the accessibility of the collection and ensures the future (digital) preservation.</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Prince Claus Fund strongly believes that &apos;people develop themselves&apos;, as once stated by Prince Claus himself. The Fund facilitates such personal and organisational development by supporting activities that contribute to the professional development of individuals in the cultural sector, e.g. through increasing exposure and visibility towards new audiences, by facilitating exchanges for talent development and funding training courses (e.g. on first aid to cultural heritage after emergencies). The fund also supports the development of cultural organisations, in particular through the Network Partnership Programme that allows organisations from different contexts to learn from each other. Furthermore, the Fund aims to contribute to the overall knowledge base on Culture and Development, e.g. through M&amp;E and research.</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project creates and shares &apos;Alternative Narratives&apos;, which is one of the 3 overall outcome areas of the Prince Claus Fund, as also explained in the Theory of Change. Alternative narratives (AN) are stories, explanations, histories, spaces that provide an alternative to the dominant discourses and / or that are threatened by disappearance. Alternative narratives must be heard or seen to have significance. They take different forms, which include literature, oral history, visual arts, theatre, music, cultural heritage, i.e. artistic expressions in all disciplines. The safe spaces to make and experience AN are also included. Given its overall aim of more inclusive societies, the Fund supports AN that are relevant within context and foster inclusive societies.</narrative>
