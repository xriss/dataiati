   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The community of Nuqu&#xED; and surrounding villages are mostly Afro-Colombian or Indigenous, and amongst the most marginalised and vulnerable in Colombia. The government has planned the construction of a mega-port, which threatens the livelihood of locals as well as the biodiversity of the place. The necessity of the port is contested, and speculated to benefit only corrupt politicians. Part of the Nuqu&#xED; alliance of c.a. 20 organisations resisting the port, M&#xE1;s Arte m&#xE1;s Acci&#xF3;n&#x2019;s proposal focuses on community-building, protecting local autonomy and raising local and global awareness of the imposed construction of the port.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project is an art &amp; activist project against the development of a mega-port, M&#xE1;s Arte m&#xE1;s Acci&#xF3;n will host three residencies with the communities of the village Nuqu&#xED; about local music, gastronomy and biodiversity. The project advocates for the autonomy of the communities both more generally politically as well as specifically over the area&#x2019;s biodiversity. With this project the applicants aim to promote an alternative to the capitalist ideology of growth, based on environmentally sustainable Indigenous values. The results of this multi-faceted project will be presented in an interdisciplinary festival.</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Prince Claus Fund strongly believes that &apos;people develop themselves&apos;, as once stated by Prince Claus himself. The Fund facilitates such personal and organisational development by supporting activities that contribute to the professional development of individuals in the cultural sector, e.g. through increasing exposure and visibility towards new audiences, by facilitating exchanges for talent development and funding training courses (e.g. on first aid to cultural heritage after emergencies). The fund also supports the development of cultural organisations, in particular through the Network Partnership Programme that allows organisations from different contexts to learn from each other. Furthermore, the Fund aims to contribute to the overall knowledge base on Culture and Development, e.g. through M&amp;E and research.</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project creates and shares &apos;Alternative Narratives&apos;, which is one of the 3 overall outcome areas of the Prince Claus Fund, as also explained in the Theory of Change. Alternative narratives (AN) are stories, explanations, histories, spaces that provide an alternative to the dominant discourses and / or that are threatened by disappearance. Alternative narratives must be heard or seen to have significance. They take different forms, which include literature, oral history, visual arts, theatre, music, cultural heritage, i.e. artistic expressions in all disciplines. The safe spaces to make and experience AN are also included. Given its overall aim of more inclusive societies, the Fund supports AN that are relevant within context and foster inclusive societies.</narrative>
