   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Nest Collective is a Nairobi-based multidisciplinary collective founded in 2012 with the aim of exploring troubling modern identities, particularly LGBT+ identities, re-imagining the past and inhabiting mythical African futures. Major projects have included the web series Tuko Macho (2016) and the anthology book Stories of Our Lives: Queer Kenyan Narratives (2015). The majority of the collective&#x2019;s members and audience are in the age range of 18 &#x2013; 35 (reflecting the demographics of the country, 65% of which is under 35).</narrative>

For their music project, Sweet and Sawa and their club nights to become sustainable

&#x200B;

Expected outputs

&#x200B;

The expected output of this first phase of the project, as agreed in the proposal, are based around artist development. The most significant output, accordingly, is the development of the team&#x2019;s skillset in preparation for the activities that will follow in the later phases of the project. 

The first EP of the project has also been recorded, but has yet to be mixed/mastered. 

&#x200B;

Expected outcomes

&#x200B;

The outcome area of this phase of the project is the organizational growth of the partner &#x2013; creating the capacity for the music activities of the rest of the project.

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Prince Claus Fund strongly believes that &apos;people develop themselves&apos;, as once stated by Prince Claus himself. The Fund facilitates such personal and organisational development by supporting activities that contribute to the professional development of individuals in the cultural sector, e.g. through increasing exposure and visibility towards new audiences, by facilitating exchanges for talent development and funding training courses (e.g. on first aid to cultural heritage after emergencies). The fund also supports the development of cultural organisations, in particular through the Network Partnership Programme that allows organisations from different contexts to learn from each other. Furthermore, the Fund aims to contribute to the overall knowledge base on Culture and Development, e.g. through M&amp;E and research.</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project creates and shares &apos;Alternative Narratives&apos;, which is one of the 3 overall outcome areas of the Prince Claus Fund, as also explained in the Theory of Change. Alternative narratives (AN) are stories, explanations, histories, spaces that provide an alternative to the dominant discourses and / or that are threatened by disappearance. Alternative narratives must be heard or seen to have significance. They take different forms, which include literature, oral history, visual arts, theatre, music, cultural heritage, i.e. artistic expressions in all disciplines. The safe spaces to make and experience AN are also included. Given its overall aim of more inclusive societies, the Fund supports AN that are relevant within context and foster inclusive societies.</narrative>
