   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Mexican society can be said to be largely characterized by racism towards indigenous people, sexism, gender discrimination towards women and the LGBTTTI community and individuals, as well as classism. Cultural networks and individuals are not exempt from this kind of violence and unfortunately often reproduce it. The #MeToo movement in Mexico is a case in point, it erupted last March and has visibilized numerous cases of sexual harassment by famous writers, artists, filmmakers and musicians associated to the creative community in Mexico. 

The project aims to experiment with modes of socialisation and collective construction of knowledge. With the proposed program BWEPS wants to question identity not as natural and unchangeable, but as a social formation.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">&#x2018;Artificial selection&#x2019;, a project by Bikini Wax EPS (BWEPS), an independent contemporary art space in Mexico City offers an alternative space for study, discussion and creative collective production where young artists are able to question identity not as natural and unchangeable, but as a social formation. 

The project involves the collective production of 3 large immersive installations that question race, gender and class (showcased in the BWEPS building over the course of 12 months), 3 workshops, study circles and contributions to their Youtube Channel. The work will be developed in research laboratories and will be part of BWEPS&#x2019; public, open and free programming, thereby involving the selected contributors, the constant study circles and the audience of the art space.</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Prince Claus Fund strongly believes that &apos;people develop themselves&apos;, as once stated by Prince Claus himself. The Fund facilitates such personal and organisational development by supporting activities that contribute to the professional development of individuals in the cultural sector, e.g. through increasing exposure and visibility towards new audiences, by facilitating exchanges for talent development and funding training courses (e.g. on first aid to cultural heritage after emergencies). The fund also supports the development of cultural organisations, in particular through the Network Partnership Programme that allows organisations from different contexts to learn from each other. Furthermore, the Fund aims to contribute to the overall knowledge base on Culture and Development, e.g. through M&amp;E and research.</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project creates and shares &apos;Alternative Narratives&apos;, which is one of the 3 overall outcome areas of the Prince Claus Fund, as also explained in the Theory of Change. Alternative narratives (AN) are stories, explanations, histories, spaces that provide an alternative to the dominant discourses and / or that are threatened by disappearance. Alternative narratives must be heard or seen to have significance. They take different forms, which include literature, oral history, visual arts, theatre, music, cultural heritage, i.e. artistic expressions in all disciplines. The safe spaces to make and experience AN are also included. Given its overall aim of more inclusive societies, the Fund supports AN that are relevant within context and foster inclusive societies.</narrative>
