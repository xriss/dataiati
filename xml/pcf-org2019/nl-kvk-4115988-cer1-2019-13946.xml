   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Zanzibar institute of Archival Records (ZIAR) and Zanzibar Comorian Trust (ZCT) along with Mr. Scott Reese have proposed to preserve the collection of manuscripts and printed material of the Maalim Idris Library. 

Maalim Idris was a prominent Zanzibari religious leader, a teacher, a writer and a scholar, who worked for the preservation of Islamic heritage and hence had a huge impact on the local Zanzibari community. His collection is a culmination of many historical libraries collected by him over the course of 50 years, which consists of scholarly libraries from the local Zanzibari families and books and other material from his own Mosque in Zanzibar Stone Town, making the collection unique and valuable. 

The organization aims to conserve the manuscripts and the printed material and safely store those into boxes. For this method, locals will be trained in a 15 days&#x2019; workshop by conservator Michaelle Biddle. The collection currently is in danger of getting damaged due to pests, humidity, and it also has the problem of water damage in the rainy season. The activities proposed will be focussed on the stabilization and treatment of the material and then storing the material in safe boxes away from light and humidity. 

These activities will be covered in around 40 weeks and in four phases. Two archivists from ZIAR and six trainees from ZIAR and ZCT are involved in the project. The concrete outcome of the project will be the preservation of the manuscripts, books and other printed material from the Maalim Idris Library collection in Zanzibar by making the collections available to the general public in the archives. This project will contribute to the preservation of this valuable archival heritage, by the formation of a strong team of experts in Zanzibar.</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Prince Claus Fund strongly believes that &apos;people develop themselves&apos;, as once stated by Prince Claus himself. The Fund facilitates such personal and organisational development by supporting activities that contribute to the professional development of individuals in the cultural sector, e.g. through increasing exposure and visibility towards new audiences, by facilitating exchanges for talent development and funding training courses (e.g. on first aid to cultural heritage after emergencies). The fund also supports the development of cultural organisations, in particular through the Network Partnership Programme that allows organisations from different contexts to learn from each other. Furthermore, the Fund aims to contribute to the overall knowledge base on Culture and Development, e.g. through M&amp;E and research.</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project creates and shares &apos;Alternative Narratives&apos;, which is one of the 3 overall outcome areas of the Prince Claus Fund, as also explained in the Theory of Change. Alternative narratives (AN) are stories, explanations, histories, spaces that provide an alternative to the dominant discourses and / or that are threatened by disappearance. Alternative narratives must be heard or seen to have significance. They take different forms, which include literature, oral history, visual arts, theatre, music, cultural heritage, i.e. artistic expressions in all disciplines. The safe spaces to make and experience AN are also included. Given its overall aim of more inclusive societies, the Fund supports AN that are relevant within context and foster inclusive societies.</narrative>
