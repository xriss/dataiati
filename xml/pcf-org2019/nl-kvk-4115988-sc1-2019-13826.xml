  <description akvo:type="5" type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In the light of Change is a photo-documentary project by young photographer Elwely Vall intended to show how climate change has affected the people of Mauritania. He will engage closely with the communities, invest time with families in their homes and on the streets, explore their relationship to their environment and to nature thus revealing their struggle to live through the present situation. To this purpose he intends to cover the Brakena region, ASSABA region, Tagent, and the Western and Eastern Basin in Mauritania.</narrative>

&#xF09E; Promoting the Photo and the stories of the project globally by social media: Instagram and Facebook, Tedx thus shining more light on Mauritania in the context of climate change from the inside.

&#xF09E; Because Mauritania is not well known globally, the project might raise attention to the country, which, besides the current desertification problem also still witnesses a wide practice of (modern day) slavery in the country.

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The most obvious effects of climate change on the land ecosystem in Mauritania is desertification and its consequences. The loss of biodiversity is predicted to have serious impacts on livelihoods and economic development. Three-quarters of the Mauritanian territory is covered by Saharan desert, and the remaining one quarter is a Sahelian zone. Mauritania is therefore one of the countries that are most vulnerable to the effects of climate change and desertification.</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Prince Claus Fund strongly believes that &apos;people develop themselves&apos;, as once stated by Prince Claus himself. The Fund facilitates such personal and organisational development by supporting activities that contribute to the professional development of individuals in the cultural sector, e.g. through increasing exposure and visibility towards new audiences, by facilitating exchanges for talent development and funding training courses (e.g. on first aid to cultural heritage after emergencies). The fund also supports the development of cultural organisations, in particular through the Network Partnership Programme that allows organisations from different contexts to learn from each other. Furthermore, the Fund aims to contribute to the overall knowledge base on Culture and Development, e.g. through M&amp;E and research.</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project creates and shares &apos;Alternative Narratives&apos;, which is one of the 3 overall outcome areas of the Prince Claus Fund, as also explained in the Theory of Change. Alternative narratives (AN) are stories, explanations, histories, spaces that provide an alternative to the dominant discourses and / or that are threatened by disappearance. Alternative narratives must be heard or seen to have significance. They take different forms, which include literature, oral history, visual arts, theatre, music, cultural heritage, i.e. artistic expressions in all disciplines. The safe spaces to make and experience AN are also included. Given its overall aim of more inclusive societies, the Fund supports AN that are relevant within context and foster inclusive societies.</narrative>
