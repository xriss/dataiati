  <description akvo:type="6" type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Together with several other Latin American countries, Paraguay has experienced in the past couple of years a conservative turn, which &#x2013; as far as digital rights of the population are concerned &#x2013; has materialized in attempts to promote laws expanding governmental control over personal information and over digital spaces (mass surveillance, 5-year mandatory data storage for ISPs, etc.). At the same time, laws regulating and protecting personal data on social networks are lacking, this exposing users to unwanted data collection. However, many people &#x2013; especially young people &#x2013; heavily rely on the web as a space to explore alternatives to an grievous reality and to express their (digital) identity. 

In such a context, where the risk is concrete that the government exerts forms of surveillance, while also disseminating misleading information, TEDIC has been a pioneering organization in the production of work related to Digital Rights, Technology, Gender, and Open culture. Since 2017, they have been hosting Hackerfem, an annual open gathering and safe space for exchange for women from different sectors focusing on the use and appropriation of technologies. On the same year they also created the web platform Cyborg Feministas (which aims at building a more democratic Internet by developing and sharing information, research, and tools for a web that is more inclusive of all minorities in its design and development. The proposed project constitutes a further development of this web platform, as it would apply the same principles and goals to the creation of a physical exhibition.</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Prince Claus Fund strongly believes that &apos;people develop themselves&apos;, as once stated by Prince Claus himself. The Fund facilitates such personal and organisational development by supporting activities that contribute to the professional development of individuals in the cultural sector, e.g. through increasing exposure and visibility towards new audiences, by facilitating exchanges for talent development and funding training courses (e.g. on first aid to cultural heritage after emergencies). The fund also supports the development of cultural organisations, in particular through the Network Partnership Programme that allows organisations from different contexts to learn from each other. Furthermore, the Fund aims to contribute to the overall knowledge base on Culture and Development, e.g. through M&amp;E and research.</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project creates and shares &apos;Alternative Narratives&apos;, which is one of the 3 overall outcome areas of the Prince Claus Fund, as also explained in the Theory of Change. Alternative narratives (AN) are stories, explanations, histories, spaces that provide an alternative to the dominant discourses and / or that are threatened by disappearance. Alternative narratives must be heard or seen to have significance. They take different forms, which include literature, oral history, visual arts, theatre, music, cultural heritage, i.e. artistic expressions in all disciplines. The safe spaces to make and experience AN are also included. Given its overall aim of more inclusive societies, the Fund supports AN that are relevant within context and foster inclusive societies.</narrative>
