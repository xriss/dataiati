   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Ramooz Foundation, based in Sanaa, Yemen, together with the National Library of Yemen, will count, catalogue and digitize the Library&#x2019;s collection of ca. 30.000 Arts and Culture Magazines, dating back to the 1960s. This more contemporary heritage collection is currently under threat because of potential damage caused by the ongoing conflict situation in the country, and the poor conditions in which they are now kept. During this project, the staff of the National Library will be trained in scanning and digitization. Also, a website and database are developed to make the scanned documents available for the wider audience. This is particularly relevant, as the publication of these cultural magazines has stopped because of the conflict situation, and there is very little accessibility to this kind of information. Ramooz will also actively try to generate attention for this project and the collection through two organized seminars and talks, and a social media campaign. The project is contributing to the increase of accessibility of this historically and culturally relevant collection, and to the continuity of the availability of information on the arts and culture scene in Yemen.</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Prince Claus Fund strongly believes that &apos;people develop themselves&apos;, as once stated by Prince Claus himself. The Fund facilitates such personal and organisational development by supporting activities that contribute to the professional development of individuals in the cultural sector, e.g. through increasing exposure and visibility towards new audiences, by facilitating exchanges for talent development and funding training courses (e.g. on first aid to cultural heritage after emergencies). The fund also supports the development of cultural organisations, in particular through the Network Partnership Programme that allows organisations from different contexts to learn from each other. Furthermore, the Fund aims to contribute to the overall knowledge base on Culture and Development, e.g. through M&amp;E and research.</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project creates and shares &apos;Alternative Narratives&apos;, which is one of the 3 overall outcome areas of the Prince Claus Fund, as also explained in the Theory of Change. Alternative narratives (AN) are stories, explanations, histories, spaces that provide an alternative to the dominant discourses and / or that are threatened by disappearance. Alternative narratives must be heard or seen to have significance. They take different forms, which include literature, oral history, visual arts, theatre, music, cultural heritage, i.e. artistic expressions in all disciplines. The safe spaces to make and experience AN are also included. Given its overall aim of more inclusive societies, the Fund supports AN that are relevant within context and foster inclusive societies.</narrative>
