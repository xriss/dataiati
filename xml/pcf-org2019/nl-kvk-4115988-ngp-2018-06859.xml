   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Platohedro is a conceptual, creative, collaborative platform or alternative art school. It offers art and technology as an alternative to the violence in the city of Medellin for at-risk youth. It has developed a pedagogical method based on artistic creation and experimentation, and the permanent investigation of free culture and self-learning. In the next 3 years Platohedro proposes 6 activities, all developed by and for the (young) participants. These activities are part of their existing curriculum. With the NextGen grant they wish to bring these activities to a higher level and add new aspects to them.

These activities feed into each other, based on the concept of self-learning.</narrative>

- Offer a safe space and opportunities for (at-risk) youth in Medellin to express and develop themselves freely through arts and culture, addressing gender and violence related issues.
- Invest in the younger staff members of Platohedro, preparing them for more leading, management positions.
- Offer meaningful international exchanges with relevant cultural practitioners for the young participants of the activities (who are living in a rather closed, self-referenced city).
- Develop and strengthen the entrepreneurial, artistic projects of the participants of the activities into sustainable initiatives.
- Invest in improved programs and processes (in content, supplies, infrastructure and sustainability), replicable methodologies, and a digital platform for youth initiatives (for visibility and encouraging exchanges).

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Prince Claus Fund strongly believes that &apos;people develop themselves&apos;, as once stated by Prince Claus himself. The Fund facilitates such personal and organisational development by supporting activities that contribute to the professional development of individuals in the cultural sector, e.g. through increasing exposure and visibility towards new audiences, by facilitating exchanges for talent development and funding training courses (e.g. on first aid to cultural heritage after emergencies). The fund also supports the development of cultural organisations, in particular through the Network Partnership Programme that allows organisations from different contexts to learn from each other. Furthermore, the Fund aims to contribute to the overall knowledge base on Culture and Development, e.g. through M&amp;E and research.</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project creates and shares &apos;Alternative Narratives&apos;, which is one of the 3 overall outcome areas of the Prince Claus Fund, as also explained in the Theory of Change. Alternative narratives (AN) are stories, explanations, histories, spaces that provide an alternative to the dominant discourses and / or that are threatened by disappearance. Alternative narratives must be heard or seen to have significance. They take different forms, which include literature, oral history, visual arts, theatre, music, cultural heritage, i.e. artistic expressions in all disciplines. The safe spaces to make and experience AN are also included. Given its overall aim of more inclusive societies, the Fund supports AN that are relevant within context and foster inclusive societies.</narrative>
