   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In this project Laboratorio de Investigaci&#xF3;n en Resonanci y Expresi&#xF3;n de la Naturaleza will build a mobile platform with high-quality audio equipment to be able to create sound art performances in public spaces across Mexico. They will design and produce four sound landscapes with recordings from the archive they have been building since the 1990&#x2019;s. The public interventions will include performances by the Laboratorio team that accompany the sound productions. The project also includes the creation of a manifesto and printed publication about their work. Through the above Laboratorio aim to create awareness amongst the public about the detrimental and irreversible effects of climate change and human interference on the biodiversity and natural heritage of the country. The project is intentionally in a mobile form, so that they can take their outside the walls of art spaces and institutions and reach a wider audience.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Mexico is one of the countries with the highest level of biodiversity, however deforestation, overexploitation, the destruction of ecosystems, invasive species and climate change are causing a rapid loss of biodiversity in the country. In a study by the Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources in 2011 it was estimated that almost 30% of the country has lost its natural ecosystems. It is expected that climate change will accelerate this loss and lead to irreparable damage of the countries biodiversity. With this project Laboratorio de Investigaci&#xF3;n en Resonanci y Expresi&#xF3;n de la Naturaleza aim to generate awareness and appreciation of the importance of biodiversity and ecosystems, encouraging people to be interested in and knowledgeable about how to care for the environment.</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Prince Claus Fund strongly believes that &apos;people develop themselves&apos;, as once stated by Prince Claus himself. The Fund facilitates such personal and organisational development by supporting activities that contribute to the professional development of individuals in the cultural sector, e.g. through increasing exposure and visibility towards new audiences, by facilitating exchanges for talent development and funding training courses (e.g. on first aid to cultural heritage after emergencies). The fund also supports the development of cultural organisations, in particular through the Network Partnership Programme that allows organisations from different contexts to learn from each other. Furthermore, the Fund aims to contribute to the overall knowledge base on Culture and Development, e.g. through M&amp;E and research.</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project creates and shares &apos;Alternative Narratives&apos;, which is one of the 3 overall outcome areas of the Prince Claus Fund, as also explained in the Theory of Change. Alternative narratives (AN) are stories, explanations, histories, spaces that provide an alternative to the dominant discourses and / or that are threatened by disappearance. Alternative narratives must be heard or seen to have significance. They take different forms, which include literature, oral history, visual arts, theatre, music, cultural heritage, i.e. artistic expressions in all disciplines. The safe spaces to make and experience AN are also included. Given its overall aim of more inclusive societies, the Fund supports AN that are relevant within context and foster inclusive societies.</narrative>
