   <narrative xml:lang="EN">32&#xB0; East | Ugandan Arts Trust was founded in Kampala in 2012 as an independent art space, the mission of 32&#xB0; East is to support the creation and exploration of contemporary arts in Uganda. The organisation has a strong track record in the arts and culture sector in Uganda, it is the only space that has at its core an intent to allow artists the space to experiment with more conceptual forms of art. In 2012 they co-organised the contemporary art biennale KLA ART for the first time, in 2014 they took on sole responsibility for the festival. 32&#xB0; East has a strong network of artists, practitioners and organisations &#x2013; in Uganda, throughout the continent, as well as internationally. They also focus on public outreach, especially through KLA ART, and try to engage the Ugandan general public with the arts and social issues through their programming. The organisation is run by a team of Ugandan women under the age of 30, and whilst the founders were European, they handed over the organisation to local leadership in 2015. This year&#x2019;s festival has just taken place, and by all accounts from the external advisors it was a success. The organisation is well regarded, both locally and internationally. They have experience in managing a wide variety of activities, with a small team, and as such there is trust in their absorption capacity, management and team.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Through the Network Partnership programme 32&#xB0; East proposes a series of new activities named the Labs. This three year programme will focus on alternative ways of learning, process and production &#x2013; with a focus on public art. The Labs consist of a series of intensive seminars, residencies, commissioned work and a publication all rooted in peer learning, international exchange and social practice. The Labs are designed as a three year in depth run-up to KLA ART 2020. In 2019 the programme will begin with a series of workshops on topics designed to explore social practice but with an emphasis on practical skills such as concept development, research, documentation and critique. The methodology will be designed through an open call for pedagogies, and 32&#xB0; East hopes to be able to activate the network in this phase by having them contribute ideas on how to develop a curriculum focused on skills development through public art practice. The workshops will be open to artists, curators and creative producers &#x2013; both from the local context and from 32&#xB0; East&#x2019;s international network.</narrative>

   <description>
    <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Prince Claus Fund strongly believes that &apos;people develop themselves&apos;, as once stated by Prince Claus himself. The Fund facilitates such personal and organisational development by supporting activities that contribute to the professional development of individuals in the cultural sector, e.g. through increasing exposure and visibility towards new audiences, by facilitating exchanges for talent development and funding training courses (e.g. on first aid to cultural heritage after emergencies). The fund also supports the development of cultural organisations, in particular through the Network Partnership Programme that allows organisations from different contexts to learn from each other. Furthermore, the Fund aims to contribute to the overall knowledge base on Culture and Development, e.g. through M&amp;E and research.</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project creates and shares &apos;Alternative Narratives&apos;, which is one of the 3 overall outcome areas of the Prince Claus Fund, as also explained in the Theory of Change. Alternative narratives (AN) are stories, explanations, histories, spaces that provide an alternative to the dominant discourses and / or that are threatened by disappearance. Alternative narratives must be heard or seen to have significance. They take different forms, which include literature, oral history, visual arts, theatre, music, cultural heritage, i.e. artistic expressions in all disciplines. The safe spaces to make and experience AN are also included. Given its overall aim of more inclusive societies, the Fund supports AN that are relevant within context and foster inclusive societies.</narrative>
