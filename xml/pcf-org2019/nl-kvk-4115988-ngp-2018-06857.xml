   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Magamba plans to use the NextGen Partnership to expand on its current activities and benefit young people in various interconnected ways, all of which fall under the Umbrella of their proposed project _Safe To Create_. This project aims to build networks between creative safe spaces, foster new ways of the thinking and incubate alternative narratives. The programme, to be primarily carried out through the existing infrastructure of the Moto Republik and Shoko Festival initiatives, would focus on creating exchanges between young creatives on the continent while developing platforms that encourage free expression that challenge dominant societal norms and narratives. The main activities of this project will include annual creative residencies and artist tours within the Southern African region, artist incubation and production through creative labs, the expansion and formalization of a network of cultural spaces in the region and the creation of a tool or publication for the sharing of best practice between spaces, as well as a series of workshops and trainings.</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Prince Claus Fund strongly believes that &apos;people develop themselves&apos;, as once stated by Prince Claus himself. The Fund facilitates such personal and organisational development by supporting activities that contribute to the professional development of individuals in the cultural sector, e.g. through increasing exposure and visibility towards new audiences, by facilitating exchanges for talent development and funding training courses (e.g. on first aid to cultural heritage after emergencies). The fund also supports the development of cultural organisations, in particular through the Network Partnership Programme that allows organisations from different contexts to learn from each other. Furthermore, the Fund aims to contribute to the overall knowledge base on Culture and Development, e.g. through M&amp;E and research.</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project creates and shares &apos;Alternative Narratives&apos;, which is one of the 3 overall outcome areas of the Prince Claus Fund, as also explained in the Theory of Change. Alternative narratives (AN) are stories, explanations, histories, spaces that provide an alternative to the dominant discourses and / or that are threatened by disappearance. Alternative narratives must be heard or seen to have significance. They take different forms, which include literature, oral history, visual arts, theatre, music, cultural heritage, i.e. artistic expressions in all disciplines. The safe spaces to make and experience AN are also included. Given its overall aim of more inclusive societies, the Fund supports AN that are relevant within context and foster inclusive societies.</narrative>
