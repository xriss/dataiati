++Outcome++_s_

To raise public awareness about the issue of the broken life cycle of the European Eel due to man-made barriers.

Look at how immersive, new technology can deliver new engaging ways of talking about sustainability.

Inspire a public debate that will reach decision-making bodies.

++Impact++

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Ohrid Lake, which lies between North Macedonia and Albania, is a UNESCO natural heritage site and home to the endangered European Eel. There are 6 hydroelectric dams on the lake, which divide the lake from the Adriatic Sea, and obstruct the migration route of the Eels to the Sargasso Sea (their breeding site). Because the natural migration is obstructed the lake is artificially populated with eels, when the eels try to follow their instinctive migration they are killed in the water turbines, and never make it to their breeding grounds. The project will aim to cast a light on the plight of the eels and inform people of the issue of migration in the hope to inspire public debate, and build momentum towards revisiting the policies on this topic.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Where We All Meet, a collaborative project between artist Kristina Pulejkova and the environmental organisation Ohrid SOS, centres on the plight of the European Eel. Due to climate change and human interference in the Ohrid Lake the migration route of the European Eel is obstructed. The lake&#x2019;s natural ecosystem has been altered, and has been artificially populated with Eels since the 1960&#x2019;s. Each year the eels start their natural migration to breeding grounds, only to be killed in the hydorelecrtic pumps blocking the route. Through a performative project that brings together scientific knowledge with artistic interpretation, the applicants want to raise awareness on this issue and hope to influence local policies. The project consists of scientific &amp; artistic research, panel discussions, a workshop and public multimedia performances in which Puljekova will interpret the outcomes of the research in new media projections.</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Prince Claus Fund strongly believes that &apos;people develop themselves&apos;, as once stated by Prince Claus himself. The Fund facilitates such personal and organisational development by supporting activities that contribute to the professional development of individuals in the cultural sector, e.g. through increasing exposure and visibility towards new audiences, by facilitating exchanges for talent development and funding training courses (e.g. on first aid to cultural heritage after emergencies). The fund also supports the development of cultural organisations, in particular through the Network Partnership Programme that allows organisations from different contexts to learn from each other. Furthermore, the Fund aims to contribute to the overall knowledge base on Culture and Development, e.g. through M&amp;E and research.</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project creates and shares &apos;Alternative Narratives&apos;, which is one of the 3 overall outcome areas of the Prince Claus Fund, as also explained in the Theory of Change. Alternative narratives (AN) are stories, explanations, histories, spaces that provide an alternative to the dominant discourses and / or that are threatened by disappearance. Alternative narratives must be heard or seen to have significance. They take different forms, which include literature, oral history, visual arts, theatre, music, cultural heritage, i.e. artistic expressions in all disciplines. The safe spaces to make and experience AN are also included. Given its overall aim of more inclusive societies, the Fund supports AN that are relevant within context and foster inclusive societies.</narrative>
