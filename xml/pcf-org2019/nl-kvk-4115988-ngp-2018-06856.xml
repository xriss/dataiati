   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Mada Masr is an independent online newspaper, founded in June 2013 in Cairo.  Their reporting and investigative journalism, published in both English and Arabic, is highly respected across the region and they are regularly referred to as the only credible news source left in Egypt. They also have a track record of publishing high quality cultural content, in the form both of creative writing and essays and of detailed coverage of Cairo&#x2019;s artistic life, as well as organising or co-organising cultural events. This artistic and cultural coverage has from the start been marked by its innovative approaches to form and content, and by its desire to experiment. They have been financially stable since inception, having been primarily funded through grants and gradually transitioning into self-funded activities.

They are a founding member of a network of independent Arab media organisations, which meets every February to discuss shared issues and is currently engaged in putting together an alternative curriculum for young Arab journalists.</narrative>

   <description>
    <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Prince Claus Fund strongly believes that &apos;people develop themselves&apos;, as once stated by Prince Claus himself. The Fund facilitates such personal and organisational development by supporting activities that contribute to the professional development of individuals in the cultural sector, e.g. through increasing exposure and visibility towards new audiences, by facilitating exchanges for talent development and funding training courses (e.g. on first aid to cultural heritage after emergencies). The fund also supports the development of cultural organisations, in particular through the Network Partnership Programme that allows organisations from different contexts to learn from each other. Furthermore, the Fund aims to contribute to the overall knowledge base on Culture and Development, e.g. through M&amp;E and research.</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project creates and shares &apos;Alternative Narratives&apos;, which is one of the 3 overall outcome areas of the Prince Claus Fund, as also explained in the Theory of Change. Alternative narratives (AN) are stories, explanations, histories, spaces that provide an alternative to the dominant discourses and / or that are threatened by disappearance. Alternative narratives must be heard or seen to have significance. They take different forms, which include literature, oral history, visual arts, theatre, music, cultural heritage, i.e. artistic expressions in all disciplines. The safe spaces to make and experience AN are also included. Given its overall aim of more inclusive societies, the Fund supports AN that are relevant within context and foster inclusive societies.</narrative>
