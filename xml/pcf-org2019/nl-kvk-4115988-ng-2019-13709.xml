   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In Jamaica homosexuality is illegal, and the country has a history of violent attacks on gay men and women that attests to an entrenched cultural homophobia. In large parts of society homosexuality if not accepted and being openly gay can lead to emotional and physical abuse. The visual art community in Kingston is at the forefront of changing social attitudes and offers artists a safe space to express themselves openly. Because of this making artwork that explores LGBT-related issues is becoming increasingly more accepted. Despite this there is still a lack of safe spaces where young LGBT artists, participants and audiences can safely explore and develop their identities without being marginalized or hiding. The aim of this mentorship program is to empower young queer artist with the tools to creatively and confidently challenge restrictive gender-norms and to create and explore their own narrative.</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Prince Claus Fund strongly believes that &apos;people develop themselves&apos;, as once stated by Prince Claus himself. The Fund facilitates such personal and organisational development by supporting activities that contribute to the professional development of individuals in the cultural sector, e.g. through increasing exposure and visibility towards new audiences, by facilitating exchanges for talent development and funding training courses (e.g. on first aid to cultural heritage after emergencies). The fund also supports the development of cultural organisations, in particular through the Network Partnership Programme that allows organisations from different contexts to learn from each other. Furthermore, the Fund aims to contribute to the overall knowledge base on Culture and Development, e.g. through M&amp;E and research.</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project creates and shares &apos;Alternative Narratives&apos;, which is one of the 3 overall outcome areas of the Prince Claus Fund, as also explained in the Theory of Change. Alternative narratives (AN) are stories, explanations, histories, spaces that provide an alternative to the dominant discourses and / or that are threatened by disappearance. Alternative narratives must be heard or seen to have significance. They take different forms, which include literature, oral history, visual arts, theatre, music, cultural heritage, i.e. artistic expressions in all disciplines. The safe spaces to make and experience AN are also included. Given its overall aim of more inclusive societies, the Fund supports AN that are relevant within context and foster inclusive societies.</narrative>
