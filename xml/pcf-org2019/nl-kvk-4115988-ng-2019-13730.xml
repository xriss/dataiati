   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Bolivia is the highest and most isolated country in South America. Sonandes wants to collaborate more with countries in the region, they feel Bolivia to be too isolated despite being assisted with energy and creativity in the arts and cultural sector by neighbouring countries and seek more participation in the Ibero-American culture. The project _INFRA Bank of tools and experiences _follows this line as the project takes place in several countries in the region and they want to publish their results which they see as a replicable model -internationally. 

During March 2016, a group of 500 disabled people started a march towards the city of La Paz demanding a bonus of 60 euros per month, remaining in the streets near the government  Palace for two months and in spite of repression by the police, they managed to put a series of demands and needs on the public agenda. Sonandes  follows up on this by making use of a comparative advantage they have in human resources, infrastructure and networks.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">INFRA Bank of tools and experiences consists of the publication of the results of an artistic experimental high tech sonar project involving young deaf people. It will explore electroacoustic composition via vibrations by using an amplification system which will pass through a wooden floor, transmitting the vibrations to the bone structure of the participants to evoke actions and expressions of their bodies in space. Workshops are held in 4 Latin American countries.</narrative>

   <description>
    <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Prince Claus Fund strongly believes that &apos;people develop themselves&apos;, as once stated by Prince Claus himself. The Fund facilitates such personal and organisational development by supporting activities that contribute to the professional development of individuals in the cultural sector, e.g. through increasing exposure and visibility towards new audiences, by facilitating exchanges for talent development and funding training courses (e.g. on first aid to cultural heritage after emergencies). The fund also supports the development of cultural organisations, in particular through the Network Partnership Programme that allows organisations from different contexts to learn from each other. Furthermore, the Fund aims to contribute to the overall knowledge base on Culture and Development, e.g. through M&amp;E and research.</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project creates and shares &apos;Alternative Narratives&apos;, which is one of the 3 overall outcome areas of the Prince Claus Fund, as also explained in the Theory of Change. Alternative narratives (AN) are stories, explanations, histories, spaces that provide an alternative to the dominant discourses and / or that are threatened by disappearance. Alternative narratives must be heard or seen to have significance. They take different forms, which include literature, oral history, visual arts, theatre, music, cultural heritage, i.e. artistic expressions in all disciplines. The safe spaces to make and experience AN are also included. Given its overall aim of more inclusive societies, the Fund supports AN that are relevant within context and foster inclusive societies.</narrative>
