   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Throughout India, stepwells have provided water for drinking, washing, bathing, and the irrigation of crops and were used by the local inhabitants as well as travelers for centuries. They were available to both genders and every religion and served as important social meeting points. It is estimated that by the 19th century, several thousand of these often highly decorated architecture objects had been built throughout India and that one-fourth of the patrons who had commissioned a stepwell were female (www.britannica.com). Most stepwells had fallen into disuse by the early 21st century as they were deemed unhygienic and were substituted by modern taps or tanks so that they collapsed or are threatened to be damaged. The project proposals aims at monitoring, cleaning, repairing, deepening and restoring the Sayeed step well in Jaipur, Rajasthan. India is among the world&#x2019;s most water-stressed countries, according to Worldbank. Groundwater makes up 40 % of the country&apos;s water supply but has been depleting for years. According to an official announcement of June 2019, also two-thirds of India&apos;s reservoirs are running below normal water levels, according to CNN.</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Prince Claus Fund strongly believes that &apos;people develop themselves&apos;, as once stated by Prince Claus himself. The Fund facilitates such personal and organisational development by supporting activities that contribute to the professional development of individuals in the cultural sector, e.g. through increasing exposure and visibility towards new audiences, by facilitating exchanges for talent development and funding training courses (e.g. on first aid to cultural heritage after emergencies). The fund also supports the development of cultural organisations, in particular through the Network Partnership Programme that allows organisations from different contexts to learn from each other. Furthermore, the Fund aims to contribute to the overall knowledge base on Culture and Development, e.g. through M&amp;E and research.</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project creates and shares &apos;Alternative Narratives&apos;, which is one of the 3 overall outcome areas of the Prince Claus Fund, as also explained in the Theory of Change. Alternative narratives (AN) are stories, explanations, histories, spaces that provide an alternative to the dominant discourses and / or that are threatened by disappearance. Alternative narratives must be heard or seen to have significance. They take different forms, which include literature, oral history, visual arts, theatre, music, cultural heritage, i.e. artistic expressions in all disciplines. The safe spaces to make and experience AN are also included. Given its overall aim of more inclusive societies, the Fund supports AN that are relevant within context and foster inclusive societies.</narrative>
