   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Doers organization is a humanitarian organisation aimed at developing community resilience against disasters and climate-related risks by carrying out localized, participatory, inter-disciplinary and sustainable interventions. They propose to use their expertise to develop a disaster risk reduction and response plan for a local important heritage site: the Gaiety theatre complex. This Victorian Gothic architectural style theatre was built in 1887 but was declared unsafe in 1912, because it started showing problems of leakages and cracks. The Department of Language &amp; Culture in collaboration with the Himachal Pradesh Public works department the restoration of the building to restore its safety and function. Today, the old Gaiety theatre is solid structure but threats to its existence are now mostly coming from external factors. The theatre is deemed vulnerable to hazards like fire, earthquake, landslides, floods and stampede. Doers would like to prepare an Emergency Preparedness and Response plan to face a potential emergency situation in the future, and to prevent this frequently visited Theatre from being lost while at the same time taking measures to protect its visitors. This particular proposal is interesting because of the different partners involved, public works, public safety, community resilience and heritage.</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Prince Claus Fund strongly believes that &apos;people develop themselves&apos;, as once stated by Prince Claus himself. The Fund facilitates such personal and organisational development by supporting activities that contribute to the professional development of individuals in the cultural sector, e.g. through increasing exposure and visibility towards new audiences, by facilitating exchanges for talent development and funding training courses (e.g. on first aid to cultural heritage after emergencies). The fund also supports the development of cultural organisations, in particular through the Network Partnership Programme that allows organisations from different contexts to learn from each other. Furthermore, the Fund aims to contribute to the overall knowledge base on Culture and Development, e.g. through M&amp;E and research.</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project creates and shares &apos;Alternative Narratives&apos;, which is one of the 3 overall outcome areas of the Prince Claus Fund, as also explained in the Theory of Change. Alternative narratives (AN) are stories, explanations, histories, spaces that provide an alternative to the dominant discourses and / or that are threatened by disappearance. Alternative narratives must be heard or seen to have significance. They take different forms, which include literature, oral history, visual arts, theatre, music, cultural heritage, i.e. artistic expressions in all disciplines. The safe spaces to make and experience AN are also included. Given its overall aim of more inclusive societies, the Fund supports AN that are relevant within context and foster inclusive societies.</narrative>
