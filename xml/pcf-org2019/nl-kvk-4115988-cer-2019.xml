  <description akvo:type="5" type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Cultural Emergency Response (CER) programme supports first aid to cultural heritage damaged by man-made disaster, natural disaster or conflict. By taking immediate action, CER aims to prevent further damage and implement basic repairs. CER believes that rescuing cultural heritage helps affected communities reaffirm their sense of identity, community and human dignity. An object &#x2013; a temple, a statue, a manuscript &#x2013; may be a powerful symbol for a community. Especially for deprived or excluded communities, cultural heritage and its preservation helps to safeguard their physical presence in world history.

Worldwide Cultural Emergency Response projects provide financial means and support to quickly help to evacuate, stabilise or rescue cultural heritage that is under imminent threat of destruction or that has been damaged by man-made or natural disasters.

CER projects are always implemented in direct cooperation with local partners in the affected communities in order to afeguard the heritage these communities feel is important tot hem.

CERs&#x2019; approach, extensive local network, ability to respond immediately and broad remit still fills a void. CER remains a crucial bridge between people with immediate needs and bigger organisations. CER&#x2019;s focus will therefore be on situations that remain difficult for other organisations to respond to.</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">Alternative narratives (AN) are stories, explanations, histories, spaces that provide an alternative to the dominant discourses and / or that are threatened by disappearance. Alternative narratives must be heard or seen to have significance. They take different forms, which include literature, oral history, visual arts, theatre, music, cultural heritage, i.e. artistic expressions in all disciplines. The safe spaces to make and experience AN are also included. Given its overall aim of more inclusive societies, the Fund supports AN that are relevant within context and foster inclusive societies.</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">In short, the PCF aims for more inclusive societies in which culture thrives through 3 outcome areas: Alternative Narratives that matter (AN)*, Networks for Exchange (NfE)** and Growth of People and Organisations (GPO)***, it does so through providing short term and long term grants, awards and supporting / (co-) organizing activities. (Also see our Theory of Change and M&amp;E Framework.)

*Alternative narratives (AN) &#x2013; stories that lead to greater understanding; stories that are seldom heard, that differ from a dominant narrative, that reveal a more complex reality

**Networks of exchange (NfE) &#x2013; interchange among organisations and individuals that broaden horizons and open new possibilities

***Growth of individuals and organisations (GPO) &#x2013; activities that strengthen the confidence and competence of cultural practitioners</narrative>

     <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Prince Claus Fund organizes several activities (mostly in The Netherlands) throughout the year that are linked to its different programmes. Some of these activities are done in collaboration with other cultural organizations. These activities vary from the Annual Awards Ceremony in Amsterdam, to an annual international Cultural Speeddate in which Dutch as well as international cultural practitioners participate, activities for and with youth, exhibitions etc.</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">The PCF strongly believes that &apos;people develop themselves&apos;, as once stated by Prince Claus himself. The Fund facilitates such personal and organisational development by supporting activities that contribute to the professional development of individuals in the cultural sector, e.g. through increasing exposure and visibility towards new audiences, by facilitating exchanges for talent development and funding training courses (e.g. on first aid to cultural heritage after emergencies). The fund also supports the development of cultural organisations, in particular through the Network Partnership Programme that allows organisations from different contexts to learn from each other. Furthermore, the Fund aims to contribute to the overall knowledge base on Culture and Development, e.g. through M&amp;E and research.</narrative>
