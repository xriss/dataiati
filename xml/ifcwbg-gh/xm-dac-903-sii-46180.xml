The project will do this by supporting the development of the new facilities. This will directly benefit patients in Accra and Takoradi and the larger community through the provision of enhanced specialist care, and contribute to the markets development.   
The concessional rate for the cost of capital will accord AMC the ability to reduce service charges and/or introduce discount pricing to untapped segments of the market which could result in an expansion of AMCs outreach to a larger populace. 

The funding will result in the provision of the following additional services at AMC Accra: (1) Obstetrics &amp; Gyanaecology Services; (2) Neo-natal Intensive Care Unit ; (3) Intensive Care Unit /High Dependency Unit Services, and  (4) Specialist Surgical Services. Access to critical care and emergency care services to help improve the capacity and quality of critical care services
