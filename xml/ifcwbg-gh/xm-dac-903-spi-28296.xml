   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Esoko Networks Ltd. (Esoko or the company) began as TradeNet in 2004 as a software application undertaken by a Ghanaian software incubator BusyLab. Esokos product is a market information platform - an SMS and web-based platform that enables real time data gathering and dissemination to end-users (any internet or mobile phone user).  The platform can be applied to any application or industry that would benefit from direct access to a mobile phone based-population, specifically one that requires low-cost usage.  Esoko has developed a strategy to expand its operation in Africa and Asia through franchising.  Esoko operates its own franchise in Ghana (Esoko Ghana  100% owned) in order to showcase the product and provide feedback for product development.  Esoko Networks has licensed its platform in 8 African countries and Afghanistan.  Most licensees are public projects, government initiatives or NGOs seeking to establish commercial market information systems.  The first and most developed application on the platform is Esoko Market Live, a market information system for the agri-business sector.   This product provides agriculture commodity prices (input and output) and trading capability to rural farmers, buyers, traders, associations and agri-businesses mostly via SMS.  Customer feedback indicates a reduction in market inefficiencies through improvement in supply chains, more equitable pricing and better access to markets for farmers and buyers.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Market information systems have a high development impact in industries where they are implemented as dissemination of pricing information empowers producers, particularly in low income economies.  Markets in Ghana and elsewhere in Sub-Saharan Africa are inefficient. These markets are characterized by the following constraints: long transaction cycles between producers and consumers; poor access to appropriate and timely market information; low product volumes of varied quality offered by small scale and individual producers; and poorly structured and inefficient markets. The lack of market information represents a significant impediment to market access especially for small producers: it substantially increases transaction costs and reduces market efficiency.  The marketing chain consists of multiple middlemen, each taking a margin at every stage of the chain, and price variations in space and time are often large and erratic.  In case of Esoko Market Live, Esoko is helping farmers to increase their incomes by giving them better access to markets and by empowering them to negotiate better transaction terms.  In addition, Esokos platform will promote cross border trade through more transparent  facilitation of supply and demand information.  The Esoko platform has the potential to stabilize supplies (by avoiding over production) as well as prices.  It is expected that awareness created by Esoko platform will improve farm-gate prices, reduce spatial arbitrage between markets, enable the introduction of new products such as weather insurance in Africa and may lead to the foundation of a formal commodities exchange.</narrative>
