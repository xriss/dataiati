   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Economy-wide effects- The Ready-Made Garments (RMG sector in West Africa was badly hit during the onset of the pandemic and it is gradually recovering. Against this backdrop, the Project is expected to have various positive economy-wide effects, including i) domestic value addition and grow exports from the region through the expansion of the CMT operations and increasing product complexity (including potential production of PPE); ii) the direct creation of 2,900 formal manufacturing jobs, mostly for women, and a larger number of indirect jobs. 

Contribution to market creation Market Competitiveness: The Project is expected to improve the sector competitiveness through the expansion of the CMT operations to achieve scale, and therefore improve the efficiency of apparel production in the West Africa region and through backward integration (the 2nd phase of the Project). The capacity for DTRT to produce fabric for other companies in phase 2 will create an additional opportunity to serve other apparel manufacturers on the African continent, particularly those that are increasingly focused on establishing West African CMT operations and would benefit from locally produced fabrics (e.g., Ghana, Nigeria, Senegal, Cote d&apos;Ivoire). As such, as the first mover in the Ghanaian market to integrate its operations at scale, DTRT can serve a significant demonstration effect, and case study for building the textiles sector in West Africa. This could have significant ripple effects, attracting other investors and players in the region, and permitting the West African textiles sector to follow the trajectory of other successful cases (Bangladesh and Sri Lanka) and to develop in ways that will not be possible without this type of first-mover investment.</narrative>
