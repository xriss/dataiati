   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The proposed project is an initiative to provide local currency financing and technical assistance to private K-12 schools in Ghana. It is the first such initiative in the education sector. IFC would provide a partial guarantee of up to 9.5 billion cedis ($1.1 million equivalent) to The Trust Bank (TTB, the Bank, or the company) on loans extended to eligible private schools in the Accra region. These loans will be used to finance construction, purchase of educational materials, and other capital expenditures.  In parallel with the financing facility, a comprehensive technical assistance program is under preparation. The program will be designed to strengthen schools financial, management, and educational capacities; improve the business environment for private education; and foster the development of an independent provider of educational services to private schools. 

Currently, few local banks are lending to private primary and secondary schools, and those that do, generally lend for less than two years. Thus, even if schools are able to secure bank financing, the tenor of that financing is generally not long enough to support expansion or modernization projects. Such projects thus proceed in a piecemeal fashion, resulting in a great deal of inefficiency and lost potential revenue. Further, expansion by such means cannot keep pace with the huge growth in demand for private schooling. IFCs guarantee would be structured to encourage the Bank to extend maturities to 3-5 years, tenors more appropriate for financing capital investments. 

Despite the impressive growth of private schools in Ghana over the past 15 years, most remain fundamentally weak in their financial and managerial capacities, as well as in their ability to develop more effective educational delivery mechanisms. The majority of schools has minimal financial expertise, weak information systems, if any, and limited opportunities for teacher training and curriculum development. The technical assistance program designed in conjunction with the financing facility is intended to address many of these shortcomings for participating schools, and, in addition, to strengthen the environment for private school operators.</narrative>
