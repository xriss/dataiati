   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Ghana&apos;&apos;s tertiary enrollment rate of 5% is low and the demand for tertiary education greater than current supply. Ashesi aims to educate a new generation of ethical, entrepreneurial leaders in Africa. The Project will increase access and delivery of good quality tertiary education in Ghana and support Ashesi in the next phase of its expansion and growth with the construction of its own physical campus facilities. In a short time, Ashesi has achieved an excellent local reputation and is known as one of the best private tertiary education institutions in Ghana. It is contributing to setting good quality industry standards with a strong demonstration effect for the local tertiary education sector (public and private) and has a high rate of graduate employment. Ashesi also provides a substantial financial aid program  currently about 40% of its students are beneficiaries of this program.</narrative>
