   <narrative xml:lang="EN">1.Additional Reach: Tata Capital HF&apos;&apos;s strategy is to expand its affordable housing portfolio across India, for which they have a unique ability to penetrate thanks to the strong Tata brand.  2. Pan-Indian Presence: Tata Capital HF is the appropriate partner for IFC to provide financing to under-served segment of the market as the Company is present all across India.  3. Cross- selling products: Tata Capital HF gives the opportunity to cross-sell services of the other group companies. In addition TCL is considering an affordable housing fund to invest in developers of affordable housing projects and has invited IFC to play a lead role in the structuring and design of the Fund and to act as an anchor investor. IFC will evaluate this opportunity on its own merits but it provides an example of the potential synergies that IFC can benefit from through its collaboration with TCL as it seeks to make a major impact in the housing finance area.</narrative>
