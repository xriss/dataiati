   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project is to provide early-stage funding to Punj Lloyd Upstream Limited (Punj Upstream or the company), a newly formed Indian oilfield services company established by Punj Lloyd Limited (PLL) to participate in the opportunities afforded by the Indian exploration and production (E&amp;P) sector, which has benefited from the rise in international oil and gas prices and the Government of Indias (GoI) New Exploration Licensing Policy.

The company plans to initially acquire four onshore drilling rigs and cater to private and national oil companies operating in India. Punj Upstream is in the process of assembling a robust technical team and is expected to take delivery of the onshore drilling rigs over the next 6-24 months.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The proposed IFC investment will facilitate the establishment of a new domestic player in the onshore oilfield services business and is expected to lead to the following development impacts:

- Demonstration effect:  

Punj Upstream will be the first Indian oilfield services company to adopt the Performance Standards and would set a new standard for E&amp;S policies and procedures for drilling service companies. 

- Increase private sector participation and promote competition:  

The emergence of oilfield service companies such as Punj Upstream will help increase the number of attractive options available to private and national oil companies such as ONGC. Currently, private drilling companies only number about 15. As a result, E&amp;P companies operating in India are experiencing delays in the implementation of their exploration and development plans.  Further competition will also allow such companies to develop their assets in a timelier manner.

- Employment:  

The project will create full-time employment for 440 people by 2011.

- Local purchases of goods and services:  

Punj Upstream will seek to procure local goods and services which will be tracked on an annual basis.

- Maximize the use of domestic natural resources:  

The project will lead to the further exploration, appraisal and development of domestic natural resources. Such activities are important to India, given that the country already imports about 70% of its oil requirements and faces a large mismatch between potential demand and supply of natural gas.

IFC plans to monitor during supervision, the number of full-time employees, the amount of local purchases and the number of private onshore drilling companies operating in India.</narrative>
