   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Support to India&apos;&apos;s Renewable Energy and Climate Change goals:  The project will support a wide range of renewable energy and climate change related projects. The long term funding will be on terms that are consistent with the underlying cash flow profile of such long gestation and capital intensive projects.   Development of the Green Bond Market: IFC&apos;&apos;s investment will generate support and confidence in the Green Bond market which is a new asset class in India and help create a new and viable source of long term financing for climate change projects in the domestic markets. The development of the Green Bond Market will provide an impetus to the development of the overall local currency bond market which is a high developmental priority for IFC and for the Government of India. IFC&apos;&apos;s investment in an Emerging Market Green Bond will encourage issuers in other markets to issue Green Bonds and support greater resources for Climate Change finance and development of domestic capital markets.  Increased reach to Women owned MSMEs: Women-owned businesses are less likely to be banked because they tend to be smaller and less formal. The socio-cultural environment, where men are still regarded as the heads of the household owning land and property of the family, makes it difficult for women to present assets as collateral to access finance. While banks perceive women-owned businesses to be higher risk, they often do not recognize the economic and social benefit of banking women-owned businesses, who tend to be more loyal customers, less price sensitive and more risk averse.</narrative>
