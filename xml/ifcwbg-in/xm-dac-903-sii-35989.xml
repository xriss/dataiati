   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Regency Hospital Limited (Regency or the Company) is a healthcare service provider in Kanpur, the largest city of the state of Uttar Pradesh (UP), a Low- Income-State (LIS) in India. Established in 1989 and promoted by Dr. Atul Kapoor and Dr. Rashmi Kapoor, Regency owns and operates a network which includes: two tertiary care hospitals (a 175 bed multi-specialty hospital and a 75 bed renal care super-specialty hospital); a healthcare clinic providing outpatient and diagnostic services; and dialysis treatment centers operated under a joint venture with Fresenius Medical Care, the worlds largest provider of products and services to people with chronic kidney failure.   The proposed project (the Project) would increase the number of operational beds by 550 beds through organic expansion in the state of UP, which is one of the most underserved regions in terms of healthcare infrastructure. The project will include completion and opening of operations for a secondary care hospital and an oncology hospital, both in Kanpur.  The oncology hospital will be the first cancer treatment center hospital in the state of UP, and will be operated under a joint venture between Regency and Health Care Global (HCG), Indias largest specialist cancer treatment provider.  The project will support Regency to add multi-specialty, renal and dialysis, and oncology care facilities in other cities of central and eastern UP, under its own brand and through the joint ventures with Fresenius and HCG.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">i)	Providing healthcare to a LIS - The state of Uttar Pradesh lags behind India and other states in terms of healthcare infrastructure - it has 0.6 beds per 1000 people compared to an all-India average of 0.9 beds per 1000 people. In UP, private health care is highly unorganized and dominated by small standalone hospitals, with a negligible presence of corporate groups. Thus, there exists a substantial gap in UP&apos;&apos;s healthcare delivery. Investing in Regency will help expand quality healthcare services within this most needed state.  ii)	Skill development - As Regency expands, employment of more doctors and nurses would result in skill-training and thus addition of trained healthcare manpower in the country. Regency also operates a nursing school to train nurses to meet demand of its hospital. The Company is also implementing a training plan with Fresenius for skilled dialysis technicians, who will be required to fuel the growth expected under the Fresenius JV and shop-in-shop nephrology model. iii) Increase in patients reached - Since the company is planning to increase its bed capacity by almost 200% over the next few years, the Project is expected to increase the number of patients reached by a quality healthcare service provider over the next few years.</narrative>
