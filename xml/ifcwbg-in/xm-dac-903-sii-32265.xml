   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Employment generation: The Project will create direct and indirect employment in Chhattisgarh. The Project will provide skilled and unskilled jobs during the construction phase. In addition, the Project will create a large number of indirect jobs in the transportation and delivery sectors.   Increased local supply chain and consumption of local goods and services: The Project will create new business opportunities in the local economy due to increased demand for the supply of raw materials and provision of transportation and delivery services  Other benefits to local communities: The Company has established health and medical facilities in India to benefit about 200,000 people and manages schools in India where more than 6,500 students attend. The local communities will benefit from the Company&apos;&apos;s corporate social responsibility initiatives.   Positive climate change impact: As a member of the Cement Sustainability Initiative (CSI) of the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD), a global association of about 200 companies dealing exclusively with business and sustainable development, UltraTech is committed to sustainable development. Its investment in energy efficient initiatives has resulted in specific heat consumption in its clinker production being one of the lowest. The Company has taken the lead in the cement sector in India to co-process industrial and agricultural wastes as fossil fuel substitutes in its plants. The Company is among the early proponents of waste heat recovery and alternative fuel usage in cement operations in India. The Project includes a waste heat recovery system, which will reduce energy usage.   Higher level of environmental and social performance: By complying with IFC&apos;&apos;s performance standards and the World Bank Group&apos;&apos;s environmental, health, and safety (EHS) guidelines, UltraTech will achieve higher environmental and social standards, which should increase its reputation, reduce the risk of adverse impacts on local communities, and increase the credibility of the private sector with respect to corporate social responsibility.   Private sector development: The success of the Project will send a positive signal to other investors considering investments in Chhattisgarh, a low-income state where foreign direct investment (FDI) is limited. The Project is expected to set environmental and social standards that can be replicated by other cement producers.  Increase in domestic revenues: The Project is expected to contribute to the domestic economy through increased tax revenues.</narrative>
