   <narrative xml:lang="EN">IFCs involvement in the project is expected to have a development impact in terms of: 

- Access to affordable and potable drinking water: 

The lack of 24/7 safe drinking water has significant adverse impacts on the quality of life and health conditions of people. This Project will allow WIPL to replicate its success in providing reliable and quality water to people in rural areas increasing their health and overall longevity of life. Access to clean water would also help in significantly reducing the high number of water borne disease cases in the country. The systems installed through the current project are expected to be able to serve the potable water need of about five million people. 

- Strong Environmental benefits:

The adoption of WHIs systems also yields important environmental benefits. Firstly, in addition to its high energy efficiency, avoidance of the use of chemicals with potential toxic by-products, and minimal wastage of input water, one WHC-65 unit would displace the equivalent of 500 metric tons of carbon emissions that would have been created by boiling water with firewood. Secondly, as a high level of commercial and physical losses in the water sector make it commercially infeasible; the current Project assists in minimizing water losses by supplying water at the retail level thereby avoiding supply leakage losses. These benefits are expected to make the company eligible for credits under the CDM route.

- Contribution to employment opportunities 

Each WHC-65 employs two service operators, maintenance engineers and other requisite personnel. The company engages people from the village for these services and trains them to operate machines and perform the revenue collection function. As WIPL expands to more villages, it would provide employment, training and capacity building for locals in that area.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">WaterHealth India Private Limited (WIPL or the Company), a wholly owned subsidiary of WaterHealth International Inc. (WHI) currently provides distributed water services through its retail outlets or Water Centers (WCs) spread across approximately 175 villages in the State of Andhra Pradesh in India.

The company has the benefit of a partial debt financing guarantee (of up to 50%) by DCC, amounting to $30 million which would therefore enable it to mobilize debt financing up to $60 million. Within the current project, it plans to install an additional about 800 systems in (200 WHC-65 systems and around 600 WHC-21 systems) over a 12-month horizon in villages spread across three states.</narrative>
