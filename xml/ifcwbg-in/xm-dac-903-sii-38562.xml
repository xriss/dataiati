   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The proposed investment is closely aligned to the World Bank Group&apos;&apos;s strategy for private sector education in India. Education is one of the most basic human needs and is fundamental to the well-being and socio-economic development of any society.  - Democratization of access to affordable, high quality education in underserved geographies: Given the overall shortage of quality teachers available for students in most emerging markets, Byju will use disruptive technology to enable easy access of quality education for K-12 students. Currently, more than 43% of students on Byju&apos;&apos;s platform are from outside India&apos;&apos;s top-10 cities in; this is expected to increase to 60% of sales over the next 5 years. With this fundraise; the company intends to expand coverage of its curriculum to include several subjects and grades. - Increase in consumers reached: The Company&apos;&apos;s education app was downloaded by more than 4.5 million users in less than 10 months since launch. This is expected to grow rapidly in the next few years of operations and potentially exceed 15 million by CY21 if the necessary capital is available for expansion efforts.  - Employment opportunities: The Company employs approximately 800 people in its direct operations. It intends to keep growing its business and is expected to increase its work force &gt;4x by CY20 creating employment for over 3,000 people.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Think &amp; Learn Private Limited (BYJUs or the Company) was founded in 2011 in Bangalore, India, and is currently engaged in providing mobile based digital K-12 and test prep education services throughout India and some parts of the Middle East. Till date, the Company has developed immersive, engaging educational content for math and science subjects across grades 6 to 12 as well as educational content for prep content for several entrance examinations across India.   Indian students and parents yearn for quality educational products, and the Indian market is estimated to be the largest globally for K-12 education with more than 250 million new enrollments per year. However, good quality teachers are in short supply with access usually limited to metros and other tier 1 cities. Typically students in India are accustomed to attending several daily / weekly private tutoring classes in the after school hours, as parents strive to provide the best quality education for their children.  The Company is addressing these issues by democratizing access to high quality, affordable and personalized, education focused on stimulating conceptual clarity and suited to the aptitude of a student, rather than rote learning; yet being accessible from anywhere, anytime via mobile devices.  The Companys K-12 education product; The Learning App has seen downloads in excess of 4.5 million in less than 10 months since launch, and more than 43% of its paid users are located outside Indias top-10 cities.  The Company is focused on leveraging technology as it scales rapidly. It currently employs approximately 800 people and all the content and technology are developed in-house. It is one of thousands of examples that the Countrys Start-Up India initiative is trying to promote.   The proposed IFC investment (Project) consists of up to US$15 million in equity for a minority stake in BYJUs in order to finance the expansion of the Companys education services offering, further technology development and potential inorganic growth opportunities.</narrative>
