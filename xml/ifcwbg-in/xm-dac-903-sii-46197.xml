   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Stakeholder Impact: 
Improved access to affordable housing finance: Rapid urbanization and the lack of affordable housing finance has led to a severe shortage of housing units in urban areas. Recent estimates suggest Indias urban housing shortage was 29 million units in 2018, increasing by over 58 percent since 2012. The rural housing shortage also continues to be a concern and is estimated to be twice that of the urban housing shortage as the rural segment is less attractive to private sector developers. Housing financiers have been reluctant to finance the affordable segment due to the difficulties in assessing the debt servicing capacities of low- and middle-income group borrowers and the high costs of servicing such loans. IFC anticipates that this Project will significantly increase retail borrowers access to housing finance and encourage homeownership for EWS &amp; LIG segments. India&apos;s mortgage market depth (outstanding mortgage as % of GDP) is low compared to other emerging economies. Through this Project, and IFCs previous investments, IFC has been supporting the Government of Indias initiative of Housing for All.

Increased access to green affordable housing finance: Limited penetration of green housing is another key challenge in the housing market in India. IFC estimates a total green buildings and housing investment opportunity of US$1.4 trillion in India from 2018 to 2030, with the residential sector accounting for US$1.25 trillion (89 percent) of this opportunity. In addition to increasing access to affordable housing finance, the Project will also support Aadhar in growing its green affordable housing portfolio.

Market Impact: 
Competitiveness: The housing market in India is very active, however, a large proportion of the housing finance focuses on high-income or salaried groups, and low &amp; middle-income groups remain unserved/underserved. In the context of green financing, the market for green affordable housing finance remains underdeveloped with a very few HFCs/ financial institutions focused on financing for green building/housing as green finance is considered expensive and thus not meant for the affordable housing segment. IFCs support through the project will promote greater competitiveness in the green affordable housing segment, by demonstrating the viability of providing such financing to lower income segments.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The proposed IFC investment comprises an up to 7-year senior debt investment of up to US$90 million in Aadhar Housing Finance Limited (Aadhar). The proceeds will be utilized to extend financing to retail buyers of affordable/green affordable housing units. The Project is expected to provide counter-cyclical support for the housing needs of lower income groups, who have been severely impacted by the disruptions caused by COVID-19, as well as support green housing, which is still underdeveloped in India, particularly in the affordable segment. Subject to internal approvals, the Project may receive support from the Market Accelerator for Green Construction (MAGC) Program as discussed in the Blended Finance Section.</narrative>
