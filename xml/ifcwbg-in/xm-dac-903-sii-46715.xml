   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Stakeholders impact: 

Improved access to finance for MSMEs: The MSME sector plays a key role in the Indian economy, accounting for over 30% of the GDP and providing employment to more than 110 million people. Overall, the Covid-19 pandemic further intensified the issues around financing MSMEs. Commercial vehicle financing in particular was amongst the worst-hit segments in the financial sector given low vehicle utilization rates. Although MSME financing and CV financing have been recovering and are close to pre-pandemic levels, the recovery remains nascent, and inflationary pressures and supply chain bottlenecks pose a threat to the recovery. Continuing to provide access to finance to MSMEs will be crucial to ensure their sustained recovery from the pandemic. The proposed investment would support access to finance to MSMEs, for purchasing commercial vehicles, focusing on MSMEs in underserved areas like low-income states and rural regions of India. 

Market impact:

Resilience: This Project, along with other efforts conducted by IFC in the MSME segment, is part of IFCs systematic approach in India seeking to encourage FIs to increase access to finance for MSMEs by offering financial products and services catering specifically to this underserved segment. This project, together with other efforts by IFC, will signal confidence in financing MSMEs, and is likely to influence other financial institutions to grow their MSME portfolio and replicate this approach resulting in overall credit growth towards this underserved segment.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The proposed project comprises of an up to US$350 million investment in Cholamandalam Investments &amp; Finance Company Limited (Ltd) (CIFCL, the Company) through a 3-year US dollar (USD)-denominated senior secured loan. IFC will provide up to US$150 million through its own account, and mobilize up to US$200 million from other lenders, with an unspecified greenshoe. The proposed project supports vehicle financing for micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME), with a focus on the low-income states (LIS) and rural regions of India. The Covid-19 pandemic has aggravated the already weak economic environment for this segment since they are less resilient to exogenous shocks. Thus, this project is part of IFCs systematic approach in India where IFC will work with different financial institutions (FIs) to continue to support the recovery of MSMEs from the Covid-19 pandemic and stimulate growth.</narrative>
