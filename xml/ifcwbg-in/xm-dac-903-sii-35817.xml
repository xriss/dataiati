   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Education materials are a key part of the overall education delivery system. The proposed project will contribute to increased access to affordable education materials (textbook and digital), including in second and third tier cities and Low Income States (LIS), thus contributing to improvement in learning outcomes, in addition to providing skilled jobs.  The Project is expected to have the following development impacts:  -	Increase the number of students reached by S Chand&apos;&apos;s education materials including textbooks and digital learning systems. S Chand&apos;&apos;s education materials reach students across the country, including in Tier-2/3 cities and LIS. -	Help improve quality and relevance of education materials:  S Chand has significant experience in publishing textbooks across primary, secondary and tertiary education. The Company&apos;&apos;s textbooks provide structured educational content aligned to the curricular guidelines of the education boards in India, and the use of multimedia in the classroom will further serve as an effective supplement to regular instruction. -	Create additional jobs including skilled jobs in editorial, management, and marketing and sales teams including in second and third tier cities.</narrative>
