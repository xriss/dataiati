  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">National Collateral Management Services Limited (NCML or&#xA0; the Sponsor) through its wholly-owned project subsidiaries (Project SPVs) is developing grain storage silos in India&#xA0; under a 32-year concession agreement awarded by the&#xA0; Food Corporation of India (FCI). IFCs proposed investment is by way of subscription to unlisted, secured Non-Convertible Debentures (NCD) for a total of upto INR3,300 million (equivalent to US$44 million) to be issued by 7 Project SPVs&#xA0; to finance the development of grain&#xA0; silos with a capacity of 50,000 metric tonnes each at 7 locations in the states of Haryana, Punjab, and Uttar Pradesh (the Project).</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The proposed Project complements NCML&apos;s investment for increasing capacity of modern storage structures through the development of grain storage silos. IFC expects the Project to support the government&apos;s ability to manage the grain stocks more efficiently, thus benefitting consumers and farmers through better access to staple foods and reduced spoilage. The most significant expected Project-level outcome is the expected reduction in post-harvest losses associated with introduction of modern silos, which in turn would have positive implications both for food security of the Indian consumers and favorable environmental effects from avoided GHG emissions. Food safety can be compromised in traditional storage facilities since torn bags, transferred manually numerous times, put the wheat inside at risk of contamination. The shift from warehouse to silos is expected to reduce wheat losses as a result of improved logistics and better overall facilities. In particular, NCML Silos will be built and operated following best practices in the industry with better cleaning technologies, temperature and quality control during storage, more efficient weighing and regular quality checks. 

Environmental effects: Agriculture is a significant contributor to GHG emissions in India, accounting for 22 percent of the total. By reducing food losses, the Project is expected to result in reduced or avoided GHG emissions stemming from wasted wheat.</narrative>
