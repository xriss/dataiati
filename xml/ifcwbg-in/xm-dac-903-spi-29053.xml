   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Improved Product Availability and Quality.  
The Indian market is undersupplied with locally-manufactured, high voltage motors and generators that are state-of-the-art technologically.  The importance of manufacturing this equipment locally derives not only from transportation cost savings but also because this equipment is built-to-order to very detailed specifications, bringing to the client benefits from the ease and accuracy of information exchange with a local manufacturing facility and improved delivery times. 

Infrastructure Development.  
Infrastructure, including power generation is a bottleneck to economic development in India.  WEG will increase its capacity to sell turbines for small-scale, run-of-the-river generation projects that tend to serve areas that are off-grid.  Further, another important segment which requires high voltage motors are the producers of basic infrastructure building blocks: cement and steel  plants.  WEG also is building on its track record in India of supplying motors for the pumping stations that make up important, government-sponsored irrigation projects.

Employment.  
The Project will generate at least 250 direct jobs and is estimated to generate a multiple of this in the supply chain of WII and contractors for corporate and industrial services including maintenance, security, transportation providers, etc.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">WEG Industries (India) Pvt. Ltd. (WII) is constructing a greenfield plant near Hosur, Tamil Nadu State, India, to produce high voltage motors and generators.  Production is expected to be ramped-up by the end of 2011 and in its initial years of operation, the plant is expected to produce an average of about 250 motors and generators per year (the Project).  Sales will be largely in India, although there will also be exports from India to neighboring countries.  These motors and generators are large, technologically sophisticated and are typically used in infrastructure (small, electric generation stations and water pumping stations), agriculture (irrigation), as well as mining and industry.</narrative>
