   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Founded in 2017, ESR India (the Company) is one of the largest logistics developers in India. The Company invests in acquisition and development of best-in-class logistics and warehousing infrastructure assets across tier-1 and tier-2 cities in India through various special purpose vehicles (SPVs). The proposed IFC investment is a senior secured loan of up to INR 7,500 million (equivalent to approximately US$100 million) to select SPVs of the Company which will develop and operate warehousing and industrial properties in India.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Company plans to construct multiple Grade A warehouses in several cities in India such as Chennai, Hyderabad, Kolkata, NCR, Mumbai, etc. The increased availability of logistics infrastructure will allow firms from various sectors to (i) reap efficiency gains through improved access to modern equipment and amenities, (ii) reduce supply chain costs and  (iii)  meet the growing demand for E-commerce. E-commerce transactions in India are expected to double by 2025  underlying the importance of providing the necessary urban infrastructure. Furthermore, in Tamil Nadu, the regional government enacted a plan to expand manufacturing activity in the same timeline, again supporting the future demand for high-quality warehousing.  

Contribution to Market Creation: 
Indias rental warehousing market is fragmented and dominated by one large player and several small players. IFC anticipates that the proposed investment will provide a significant positive step forward for the Indian warehousing market, which is moving towards greater consolidation. If the Company is successful in attracting new tenants and offer their properties, it will help demonstrate the Companys modern and cost-efficient business model, which will improve competitiveness of Indias Warehousing sector if other players were to replicate.</narrative>
