   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Stakeholders impact: 

Improved access to finance for MSMEs in the transportation sector: The MSME sector is extremely critical for the development of the country as it accounts for over 30% of the GDP and provides employment to more than 110mn people. The Covid-19 pandemic has aggravated the already weak economic environment for the MSME sector, and continuing to provide access to finance to MSMEs will be crucial to ensure their sustained recovery from the pandemic. The proposed investment would support access to finance to MSMEs, particularly micro enterprises, for purchasing commercial vehicles, focusing on MSMEs in underserved areas like low-income states and rural regions of India. 

Market impact:

Beyond the project level outcomes, IFC anticipates the investment to promote greater resilience in the market via innovation, demonstration, and replication channels. This project will signal confidence in financing MSMEs, and support an increase in financing to MSMEs, especially micro-enterprises. The project also supports integration of the securitization market in India, by attracting long term capital from institutional investors.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The proposed project envisages a rupee denominated investment into securitized assets of Shriram Transport Finance Company Limited (SHTF) through Pass Through Certificates (PTCs) of up to USD 300 million equivalent (of which up to USD150 million will be through IFCs own account and remaining through mobilization). The proposed project supports vehicle financing for micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME), particularly the micro segment, with a focus on the low-income states (LIS) and rural regions of India. The Covid-19 pandemic has aggravated the already weak economic environment for this segment since they are less resilient to exogenous shocks. Thus, this investment is part of IFCs systematic effort to infuse confidence back into the market through innovative capital market instruments such as securitizations. These instruments will provide liquidity to the extremely important MSME segment through NBFCs, and enable resilient business recovery.</narrative>
