   <narrative xml:lang="EN">-	Providing housing to the economically weaker segments: According to the housing plan of the Government of India, about 100 mn homes must be built in India, 95% of which will be in the economically weak and low-income categories - affordable housing segment. The above HFCs are exclusively focused on providing access to housing finance to low income borrowers, specifically those employed in the informal sector such as self-employed micro-entrepreneurs and un-organized sector salaried workers. This segment is largely ignored by the large HFCs and Banks owing to perceived higher risk profile of such borrowers and difficulty in credit assessment. IFC&apos;&apos;s investment will directly expand the availability of housing finance to the low income and relatively excluded customer segments.   -	Job Creation: The construction industry is one of the largest employers of labour in urban India and affordable housing is the most labour intensive construction, providing high potential for employment opportunity to the urban poor. The provision of significant volumes of affordable housing finance will spur housing construction with positive linkage impacts on employment and growth.</narrative>
