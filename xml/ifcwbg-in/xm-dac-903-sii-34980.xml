Tikona currently provides enterprise connectivity services to a diversified base of over 1,500 small, medium and large enterprises across India.  Tikona also has the licenses to use 20MHz of spectrum in the 2.3 GHz band (auctioned in June 2010) in five circles  Gujarat, Rajasthan, Himachal Pradesh, UP (East) and UP (West).

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">i. Technological innovation driving broadband penetration through increased capacity, higher speeds and lower tariffs: Tikona&apos;&apos;s innovative wireless broadband solution solves multiple problems including affordability and capacity in India&apos;&apos;s underserved market.  This unique, low-cost network is rapidly scalable and can deliver high-quality broadband to India&apos;&apos;s price sensitive, data-hungry mass market. Tikona is currently present in 25 cities in India and has potential to expand to Tier III and new urban and semi-urban developments which current do not have access to broadband. Tikona is also well poised to deploy 4G LTE network and provide coverage in rural Tehsil towns in its 5 Circles to homes, SMBs, schools, health care centers, e-gov kiosks etc. The solution is also quite relevant to other global markets where the last mile wire line plant is scantily built.  ii. Direct and Indirect Employment: Expansion of the business will provide jobs to c.350 qualified professionals over the next 5-6 years as well as create c.20,000 indirect jobs in support and facilitation functions.  iii. Private Sector Enterprise: The proposed investment will promote private sector enterprise in the following manner: o Facilitate the growth of SMEs: Enable access to low cost, customised data solutions for small and medium businesses including a host of applications such as cloud-based services o Drive efficiency and competition as an independent, focused, pan-India player in the broadband market  o Economic growth: Tikona&apos;&apos;s initiatives in the broadband space will help boost broadband penetration in India&apos;&apos;s lesser and un-penetrated areas. Much like the penetration of voice services in the previous decade, roll out of broadband services is a powerful economic &quot;equalizer&quot; which will enable better access to knowledge and opportunities, driving productivity improvements for individuals and enterprises as well as overall economic growth.</narrative>
