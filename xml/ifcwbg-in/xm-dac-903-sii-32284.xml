   <narrative xml:lang="EN">1.	Access to Microfinance by expanding the outreach of Equitas in several of the poorer states in India, where the Company would scale up in the next few years.  2.	Access to Finance for Affordable Housing and Used Commercial Vehicle Financing to people engaged in the informal sector for affordable housing and used commercial vehicle financing, several of whom are currently underserved by the formal banking system.   Clients who avail finance for purchase of second hand commercial vehicles would be able to open up a livelihood opportunity for themselves and their families and turn from being a driver to an owner.  The housing finance company helps people who run businesses in the informal sector to plan for and buy a house at current prices.  Typically such people are almost fully excluded from the formal financial sector. 3.	Promoting a more balanced growth of microfinance by supporting an institution that has been a front-runner in adopting technology, is amongst the pioneers in best practices on responsible financing, takes a very active part in sector development and is working to provide varied financial services to customer segments which have limited access to formal sources of finance.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The proposed project envisages an equity investment in Equitas Holdings Private Limited (Equitas or the Company) which is the holding company for a leading microfinance institution, Singhivi Investment and Finance Private Limited (Equitas Microfinance) headquartered in Chennai, India and amongst the top 10 MFIs in India. Equitas Microfinance has a borrower base of 1.2 million across 5 states and 1 union territory including the Low Income States of Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh.  Equitas has also started recently businesses in the areas of affordable housing (Equitas Housing Finance Private Limited) and used commercial vehicle financing (Equitas Finance Private Limited) to cater to the relatively unbanked population in these financial services segments with a view towards financial inclusion.   Equitas is widely acknowledged for following best practices in responsible financing and corporate governance.  Equitas also has a strong focus on using technology and process innovation to increase operational efficiency through implementation of a scalable system for IT infrastructure.   The proposed project intends to help Equitas fund its geographical expansion, scale up new businesses and meet its regulatory capital adequacy requirements for the next 3-5 years</narrative>
