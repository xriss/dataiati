-  the acquisition, rehabilitation and refurbishment of an existing 34 MW facility in Maharashtra (BH II),

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">The BH I project is located on Lake Arthur Hill Reservoir in the Upper Pravara River Basin in Maharashtra state. The nearest town, Ghoti, is 36 km away from the project site.  BH I was constructed in 1986 by the Government of Maharashtra Irrigation Department, and rehabilitated by the Sponsor upon acquisition in 1996.   

The BH II project is located 10 km downstream of BH I on the Pravara River in Maharashtra state.  BH II was constructed in 1999 and operated until today by the Government of Maharashtra Irrigation Department.  Upon acquisition later this year, the Sponsor will rehabilitate and refurbish the project site.

Birsingphur project is located in the Umaria District, about 180 km northeast of the city of Jabalpur in the eastern part of the State of Madhya Pradesh.  The project is located within the fence of the Sanjay Gandhi Thermal Power Station, an 840 MW coal-fired power plant owned and operated by the Madhya Pradesh State Electricity Board.  The sponsor is finalizing construction of the Birsingphur plant and anticipates commercial operations in August 2005.

The three greenfield mini-hydro plants will be located in the state of Himachal Pradesh.  All are located in the mid-range Himalaya mountains at elevations of around 2,000 meters.  The climate is of the tropical monsoon nature, with a maximum summer temperature of around 30 degrees celsius and a minimum winter temperature below freezing.  The exact location of each project is:

-  Sechi: located on Sechi khad (stream), a tributary of the Sutlej river, near the village of Samej in the district of Shimla,
-  Melan:  located on Melan khad, also a tributary of the Sutlej river, in the Kinnaur district, and
-  Panwi: located on the Panwi khad, also a tributary of the Sutlej river, very close to the Melan khad, in the Kinnaur district.  

Access roads to the Sechi and Panwi sites are via a state road and a bridge from a national highway, respectively.  Access to Melan is currently very limited; however, a bridge is being constructed by the Himachal Pradesh government which will provide adequate access to the project site.</narrative>
