   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Stakeholders: Increased access to finance for underserved individuals. The Company will support underserved individuals in the country whose livelihoods were severely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. The Project will increase access to finance to these low-income borrowers who need funds to rebuild their lives, maintain small businesses and meet medical expenses. Along with the proposed investment, IFC will also support women, who are underserved as they often do not possess credit history or other assets to use as a collateral. Once the borrower engages with MFL through gold loans or micro loans, the borrower is also introduced to other products such as vehicle loans and home loans that help borrowers access to finance into other areas as well.

Inclusiveness: Gold lending addresses a crucial financing gap for the underserved, who often do not possess credit history or other assets to use as collateral. This investment will help MFL to extend lending to the underserved segments and is expected to stimulate other players in the market to increase their financing for un/underbanked when the country needs support to recover from the COVID-19 crisis.</narrative>
