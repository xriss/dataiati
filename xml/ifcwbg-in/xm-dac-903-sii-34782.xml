   <narrative xml:lang="EN">1.	Increasing Access to Finance for Infrastructure and Affordable Housing Finance:  By providing longer-term funding, the proposed project would support Axis Bank in growing its infrastructure and affordable housing finance portfolio. The new Government in India has declared infrastructure development and access to affordable housing finance to be top priorities and is raising financing for these sectors through the banking system.  Given the high level of NPLs in public sector banks, private sector banks are expected to play a vital role in channeling liquidity to infrastructure and affordable housing projects.  Axis Bank has traditionally been a leading financier of infrastructure and housing and the proposed project will support the Bank in further expanding this business and contributing to the Government&apos;&apos;s priorities for economic growth.  2.	Promoting a New Asset Class: The recent directive of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) allowing banks to issue infrastructure bonds will result in the creation of a new asset class for investors. The success of the proposed bond issue will send a positive signal to other banks and help promote the growth of this asset class.  3.	Promoting Environmental and Social (E&amp;S) Standards: Axis bank has agreed with IFC to adopt a roadmap towards implementation of IFC Performance Standards and other environmental best practices across the Bank&apos;&apos;s portfolio which will make it amongst the largest private sector banks in India to be compliant with IFC&apos;&apos;s E&amp;S standards. The Bank is expected to be an industry leader in adopting E&amp;S global standards with a strong demonstration impact on the banking sector in India.</narrative>
