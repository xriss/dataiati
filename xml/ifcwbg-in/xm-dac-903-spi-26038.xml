   <narrative xml:lang="EN">IFCs investment is expected to reinforce OCILs ongoing contribution in building a sustainable domestic fiberglass sector. In many applications, fiberglass provides a better alternative to traditional materials such as steel, wood and aluminum, in terms of cost and durability. OCIL, through working directly with fabricators and end users to develop applications, has actively helped the market grow in India by educating customers on the advantages of fiberglass reinforced plastics. Given Indias very low per capita consumption of fiberglass, there is considerable scope for catch-up growth. Industries in India that stand to benefit from increased use of composites include infrastructure, electrical equipment, telecommunications, building and construction, automotive, and marine. Fiberglass is a key input to Indias growing wind turbine manufacturing industry.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Owens Corning (India) Ltd. (OCIL or the company), an existing IFC client, is the largest fiberglass manufacturer in India. The company has been expanding its manufacturing capacity from approximately 36,000 tons per annum (tpa) to 51,500 tpa at a cost of $39 million. The project comprises:   - rebuild, modernization &amp; expansion of the existing glass melter,  - installation of additional downstream equipment to pull increased volumes of glass fiber, and  - energy and efficiency improvements.  OCIL has a world-class, state-of-art glass-fiber manufacturing facility at Taloja, 40 miles from Mumbai in the state of Maharashtra. OCIL is one of the lowest cost producers of glass-fiber amongst parent company Owens Cornings (US) stable of glass-fiber factories worldwide. OCIL manufactures three main lines of products:  - chopped strand mat; - rovings (a slightly twisted strand of fibers); and  - T-30, used in the composites industry.   In late July 2005, OCILs plant in Taloja was severely affected by heavy rains and the resultant massive floods. The plant had to be closed down for safety reasons and to limit damage to equipment and property. Prior to the floods, OCIL had proposed a cold repair for the melter including some modifications and ancillary repairs. The stoppage of the plant provided OCIL an opportunity to rebuild the melter completely to a capacity of 51,500 tpa to meet growing domestic demand. However, downstream fiberglass pulling capacity remains at 38,000 tpa and needs to be expanded so the the company can fully utilize the new melter.</narrative>
