   <narrative xml:lang="EN">- Renewable energy:

The project will contribute to increase the countrys installed capacity from renewable energy sources and will contribute to the development of cleaner sources of energy. IFCs support of this and similar projects will help increase the production of wind energy in India, a zero-emission energy source. The project will contribute to meeting Indias goal of increasing power generated from renewable energy from the current level of 5% to 25% by 2030 and is expected to benefit from carbon credits.  This could have positive demonstration effects on other potential generators of renewable energy. 

- Reduction of power shortages:

India faces severe shortages of electricity, with peak shortages estimated at approximately 12% of total demand. The project will contribute to reduce this demand-supply gap, which has resulted in erratic supply of electricity with fluctuations in voltage and/or power outages. The consequences of the power shortage are far-reaching and adversely impact commerce, industry, agriculture, education, and socioeconomic development. 

- Hedge against high fuel prices:

Diversifying Indias generation portfolio and investing in wind power offers a hedge against potential future increases in fossil fuel prices.  

- Linkages to local economy:

It is estimated that the equipment produced locally by wind turbine manufacturers has 80% of domestic content; this creates jobs and linkages to the local economy.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">MSPL Limited (MSPL or the company), a family-owned company, is one of the largest private iron ore producers in India. The company is over 40 years old and, while its background is in the mining business, the company is currently the largest private generator of wind power in the country (installed capacity is 111.6 MW as of July 2006).  In FY 2006, sales of iron ore represented 91% of total revenues, while sales of wind energy represented 8% of total revenues.

The project consists of the installation, operation and maintenance of 36.6 MW of wind power generators in the states of Karnataka and Gujarat in India, to be implemented by MSPL. Electricity will be sold through long-term power purchase agreements to state-owned electricity distribution companies.  After the project, MSPLs wind portfolio would be 148.2 MW.</narrative>
