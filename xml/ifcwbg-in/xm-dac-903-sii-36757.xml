   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project involves financing of up to INR 3.5 billion (around US$55 million) to Capital First Limited (CFL or the Company), a Systemically Important Non-Deposit Accepting Non-Banking Financial Company, to support its growth strategy in the unbanked segments of micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME) and individuals (both self-employed and salaried) that lack adequate access to financial services. The proposed project is intended to help a private sector financial institution to improve access to finance for Indian MSMEs, which employ a substantial portion of the Indian working population, and provide financing to address various needs of both salaried and self-employed individuals, mostly in the low and middle-income segments.  The Company caters its services to approximately 760,000 active customers in 222 locations across India as of March 2015. Out of this, almost 125,000 number of customers were from West Bengal, Assam, Orissa, Chattisgarh, Utarakhand and Madhya Pradesh. Also, a significant number (almost 114,000) of the CFLs customers are women borrowers. Since its inception to date, the Company has financed more than 1.5 million customers with various loan products.</narrative>
