   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Improvement in food safety standards &amp; technology: In India majority of the milk &amp; milk products have very poor traceability till farm level. Also contamination and adulteration of milk is common owing to significant supply-demand gap and lack of extensive cold chain network. An organized sector player like Parag will help improve food safety standards. Also, Parag is ahead in technology as compared to other players in the Indian dairy sector.   Enhanced supply chain linkage with farmers and food suppliers: Parag currently collects milk from ~60,000 farmers directly or through third parties and is focusing on growing the procurement network by setting up more chilling centers and bulk coolers. This increased demand of milk will lead to increase in number of farmers in the supply chain. It will also support other input suppliers to the industry including feed and veterinarian suppliers.  Development of medium and small enterprises: Parag distributes its products through 60+ super-stockists, 1,000+ distributors and over 120,000 retail outlets thus having a far reaching impact on supporting medium and small enterprises across the country.   Improved incomes in rural and peri-urban areas: The project will create direct and indirect employment and result in other development benefits such as linkages with local suppliers, as also seen in our previous project with Pran Dairy, Bangladesh. Also, Parag sells cows from its own dairy farm to the local population after the cow has its 5th / 6th lactation. These are superior breed cows with yields better than those reared locally and will hence help improve rural incomes.  Supporting growth/guiding the critical Indian dairy industry: Expecting a shortfall in supply and to improve yields, NDDB expects a gradual increase in the share of the organized sector to 60% from the current share of 30%. IFC investment will help this medium sized dairy Company to expand rapidly and develop best practices to increase yield that would be disseminated down to farmers who form a critical link in Company&apos;&apos;s supply chain.</narrative>
