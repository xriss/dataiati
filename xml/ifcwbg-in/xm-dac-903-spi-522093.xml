   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Enercon India Ltd (EIL) is a joint-venture between Enercon Gmbh from Germany (56% share) and the Mehra family of Mumbai (44%). EILs commercial operations started in 1995. The company is involved in the manufacturing, installation and services (O&amp;M) of wind turbines in India. While the core business of EIL is to provide turn-key solutions for potential investors in wind power in India, the company also takes principal positions in some of the projects. EIL has wind projects in 8 high potential states in India. Enercon Gmbh is a technology leader in the industry and operates across 27 countries and manufactures from 5 of them (Germany, India, Brazil, Turkey and Sweden). As of April 2005, Enercon Gmbh has an installed capacity of 7.4 GW of wind power around the globe.

EIL is implementing CDM projects based on wind farms that are displacing fuel based generation in the regional grids in India (Karnataka and Rajasthan). The total installed capacity of the projects is presently 75 MW. The EIL project comprises many sub-projects (individual wind farms owned by several entities) of smaller capacities. These plants share common facilities within 2 wind parks managed by EIL. 

EIL owns 50% of the installed capacity in the Karnataka site (8.4 MW out of 16.8 MW) and 41% of the installed capacity in the Rajasthan site (24 MW out of 58.2 MW). EIL is aggregating all projects into a bundle and plans to sell CERs from the bundle of wind projects to INCaF.</narrative>
