   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Shareholders impact: The project is expected to improve access to finance for the MSME sector in LIS, by earmarking the proceeds towards these enterprises. It would also support formal job creation by contributing to improvement in economic activity.

Market Impact: The funding to LIS will enable greater financial inclusion in these states which are the poorest states in the country with significantly low penetration of financial services. In addition, by investing through a relatively nascent market segment of securitization of Non-PSL portfolio where there is low participation of institutional investors, IFC will continue to support market creation for viable market-based funding tools in India.</narrative>
