   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Project consists of an IFC equity investment of up to $15 million in India Knowledge-Manufacturing Company (IKMC or the Fund) or a maximum of 20% of total combined capital commitments in IKMC and all parallel entities.  With a target size of $150 million including commitments from parallel entities, the Fund is expected to invest in about eight to 10 primarily unlisted small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and mid-cap companies in India.  The Fund will focus on underserved sectors with high growth rates --such as healthcare, information and communication technology, engineering (including related manufacturing and services), and clean technology.  Some investments are expected to be made into companies located in Tier II and Tier III cities, thus creating jobs and driving growth and demand in these cities.  IKMC will invest through Forum Synergies India Trust (the Trust), a venture capital fund registered with the Securities and Exchange Board of India.  The Trust will be managed by Forum Synergies (India) PE Fund Managers Pvt. Ltd. (Forum Synergies or the Fund Manager), a well qualified first-time fund management team based in Bangalore, India.  The Fund Manager will use its strong operating experience and skills to bring high standards of corporate governance to portfolio companies, thus contributing towards the transformation and industry growth in these sectors.</narrative>
