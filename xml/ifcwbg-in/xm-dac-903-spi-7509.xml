Description of Company and Purpose of Project    	This joint venture, between the world leader in the glass fiber industry and Indias largest single consumer of glass fiber, will construct a state-of-the-art facility to produce glass fiber for composites.  The capacity will be 30,000 tonnes per annum.  Initially, 75% of production will be exported under an off-take agreement with Owens-Corning but an Owens-Corning Application Development Center in Bangalore, India, will seek to expand domestic demand from industries which are expected to be of growing importance in India such as automobiles, computers, telecommunications, appliances and water and gas pipes.  Composites frequently offer advantages over traditional materials such as aluminum and steel in such industries.  IFC is playing a key role in attempting to put together the best possible debt package from local and overseas sources under the circumstances prevailing in India at this time.  Current Indian regulations require that loans from foreign sources for projects of this nature must have an average life of at least seven years.  This is far too long for most international lenders.    Environmental Category and Issues    	Category B.
