   <narrative xml:lang="EN">1.	Driving financial inclusion by increasing accessibility, financial literacy and lowering distribution costs: MyUniverse is providing online personal financial management services to individuals who do not have access to these services. MyUniverse&apos;&apos;s initiatives in the area will help improve awareness about personal financial management and help ensure that consumers are able to access the most appropriate financial products for their needs in a cost effective manner. This has the potential to positively impact over 10 million users over the next five years.  2.	Improved transparency in the financial investment: MyUniverse is expected to have a significant impact on first time salaried professionals, especially in lower income brackets, who do not have access to sophisticated financial advisers. By providing transparent, rule based, system driven recommendations, MyUniverse allows individuals to choose products that are most appropriate for their financial profiles and not based on commissions that agents receive for selling these products. This is expected to improve the rate and quality of savings, investment activity and overall wealth creation for this under served segment of the population.  3.	Demonstration Effect: While online personal financial management  has evolved in developed markets, this concept is new to India. IFC&apos;&apos;s investment will help in the viability and scaling up of this business and lead to other companies targeting this sector, resulting in further adoption of financial services management in the market.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">MyUniverse is an internet based personal financial services platform providing aggregation, analysis, rule based recommendations and transactions to help individuals manage their personal finances. Users can link their bank accounts, savings account, credit cards, insurance, investment accounts etc. on a single platform with a dashboard to manage assets, liabilities, expenses and income.  The platform opens up the possibility of large scale participation in personal financial management - something which has largely been available only to high net worth individuals. In addition, the Indian market is characterized by a low level of financial literacy, high level of savings that generate limited returns and lack of transparency available to the general population on appropriate investment products. MyUniverse aims to empower individuals to make informed decisions about savings and investing for the long term. MyUniverse is targeting all age groups with special focus on 25 to 45 year olds, many of whom are getting their first opportunity, through this portal, to manage finances and implement structured investments.  IFC is considering an equity investment in the company to support the expansion of the existing business in India.</narrative>
