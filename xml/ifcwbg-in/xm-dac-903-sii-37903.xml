   <narrative xml:lang="EN">-	Expand access to high quality and affordable healthcare across India especially in Tier II cities: The proposed investment in HCG is aligned with IFC&apos;&apos;s strategy in healthcare which includes partnering with leading providers to support their expansion into underserved markets, including in Tier II/III cities and low income states. The proposed investment is expected to help the Company&apos;&apos;s growth plans of adding 915 beds, of which ~630 beds or ~70% will be in Tier II and the low income states of Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan. The quality of services provided is expected to have a demonstration effect for other healthcare providers to establish operations in these cities.  -	Increase in patients reached: Since the Company is planning to increase its bed capacity by over 80% over the next few years, the Project is expected to increase the number of patients reached by quality cancer care network significantly over the next few years.  -	Enhancement of medical infrastructure: The Project will aid enhancement of the country&apos;&apos;s oncology medical infrastructure and improve access to quality oncology healthcare services across Tier II cities in India. The proposed hospitals would provide access in areas where good quality cancer care equipment and services are often quite limited.  -	Employment generation: The Company currently employs approximately over 3,800 employees and medical consultants; the Project is expected to increase jobs to employees and medical consultants, including employment increasing in Tier II cities and low income states.   -	Providing access to specialized healthcare for the lower income segments of the population: The Company, through the HCG Foundation, performs surgeries to population in the lower income segment. Further, has patients from the Government schemes catering to the bottom of the pyramid population. The Project is expected to increase the number of patients reached through these efforts.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The proposed IFC equity investment in Healthcare Global Enterprises Ltd (HCG or the Company) is a part of the equity issuance of the HCG initial public offering (IPO).

It operates its cancer centers across 13 cities and towns in 8 states. The Company also operates 2 multispecialty hospitals and has a presence in the reproductive health segment.    This proposed financing is a corporate financing with proceeds from the IPO expected to be utilized to fund the Companys India growth plans and partly for de-leveraging.  The Company plans to open 12 new cancer care centers (CCC), buy new medical equipment for its centers, upgrade its information technology (IT) systems, and repay debt to reduce overall leverage (Project).</narrative>
