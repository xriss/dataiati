   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Vishwa Infrastructures and Services Pvt. Ltd. (Vishwa or Company) was founded in 1992 by a group of technocrats with a focus to execute infrastructure projects. Vishwa is recognised as a turnkey contractor involved in developing integrated water supply and waste water projects which include:
Laying of water and waste water pipeline networks
Construction of water and sewage treatment plants
Construction of pumping stations
Management of NRW Projects
Construction of allied infrastructure including reservoirs, civil and electrical works projects

Vishwa has a team of about 600 employees with an experienced execution team with in-house design capabilities.  It has successfully manufactured and laid pipelines with aggregate length of over 1000 kms for various water supply and waste water projects. It has constructed water treatment plants (WTPs) ranging from 6 MLD to 84 MLD, and sewage treatment plants (STPs) with capacities ranging from 6 MLD to 60 MLD. Vishwa was recently awarded two water/wastewater projects to be executed on a PPP basis:

Khandwa Project: The Khandwa water supply project is a public-private partnership between Khandwa Municipal Corporationl (KMC) and Vishwa, under the Urban Infrastructure Development Scheme for Small and Medium Towns (UIDSSMT). The project will commence supplying 29 million L/day (MLD) to Khandwa (population 240,000) for domestic consumption, increasing to 43 MLD by the end of the concession period (2034), meeting the current shortfall by almost doubling the volume of water currently supplied. Under this build-own-operate-transfer (BOOT) scheme Vishwa has a 25 year concession period (2 years construction, 23 years operation and maintenance). The project will pump water through an intake well on the Chhotitave River, a backwater of the Indira Sagar Reservoir, to the adjacent water treatment plant (WTP). The WTP (2.7 ha site) will treat water then pump it to Khandwa via a 50 km long 800 mm reinforced pipeline. The pipeline will discharge into a 1,222 m3 Ground Level Master Balancing Reservoir (GLMBR), from where it will be pumped to nine separate overhead tanks. Water will then be gravity fed to the township via a network of distribution pipelines. The project includes the laying of 60 km of poly distribution pipeline through the streets of Khandwa. Project construction commenced in 2010. The Project is being executed by Vishwa Utilities Private Limited (VUPL) which is 89% held by Vishwa.

Kolhapur Project: The Kolhapur STP is a long term public-private partnership concession between Kolhapur Municipal Corporation, Kolhapur, Maharashtra and Vishwa. The project will service apart from new STP of 7 area of Kolhapur and will have a sewage treatment capacity of 76 million L/day (MLD), the project involves construction of allied works such as new sewage pumping stations and new rising mains at Bapat Camp, Line Bazaar and Jayant Nallah, pipe laying for discharge into the Panchganga river and other miscellaneous civil works. Under this design, finance, construct, operate and maintenance scheme Vishwa has a 15 year concession period (2 years construction, 13 years operation and maintenance). Sewage will be pumped to the STP by the new pumping stations. The STP is a replacement of the existing STP operated by the Kolhapur Municipal Corporation and is located within the existing compound. The STP will utilise Sequential Batch Reactory (SBR) technology to treat the wastewater. Treated wastewater discharged from the site will either be utilised for industrial or agricultural consumption and/or discharged into the Panchganga river. The remaining organic residue will be applied to land as a fertiliser in an approved manner. Project construction commenced in early 2011.</narrative>
