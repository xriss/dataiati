   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project consists of a 15-year subordinated debt of $100 million to HDFC Bank Ltd. (HDFC Bank or the Bank), Indias second largest private commercial bank with 2.2% market share in terms of total banking sector assets. The project will support the Bank in augmenting its capital base to meet the enhanced capital requirements as per Basel II norms, as well as increase its market share. This long-term funding will also help improve the Banks maturity mismatch position.   HDFC Bank is a domestic AAA rated institution and has the strong backing of its parent - Housing Development Finance Corporation (HDFC)  a housing finance institution that IFC helped founded in 1978.  HDFC Bank is listed on the Mumbai and National Stock Exchanges, as well as on the NY Stock exchange. It has built up a formidable brand name and franchise in a relatively short span of time and has outperformed most other banks, private sector or government-owned, by a significant margin.  As of March 31, 2006, the Bank had total assets of $16.5 billion and net worth of $1.2 billion.  Although HDFC Bank has been able to raise about $130 million equivalent Upper Tier II Capital (UT2) in the domestic bond market from April 1, 2006 till date, it has approached IFC for an additional investment as it is desirous of diversifying its funding sources and investor base.  The proposed investment, which qualifies as Upper Tier II Capital, will be structured as per the guidelines recently issued by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) permitting banks to raise subordinated debt in foreign currency from foreign investors. This is a window of opportunity for IFC to play a key role in introducing and encouraging new, innovative banking products in India, and in developing the subordinated debt market.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project is expected to have strong development impact by:    - Demonstration effect:     The investment will have a demonstration effect in introducing and encouraging new, innovative liability products such as UT2 and stimulating investor demand for the product.     - Strengthening the presence of the private sector banks in India:     The government-owned banks are still dominating the banking industry, and HDFC Bank and a few large private sector banks (such as ICICI Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank and UTI Bank) are poised to take the lead position in the countrys banking industry. The project will support the consolidation and long-term growth strategy of HDFC Bank and improve its financial fundamentals by strengthening capital adequacy, diversifying funding sources and reducing maturity mismatch. It will facilitate this well-run private sector bank to overtake the state-owned banks, and set new a benchmark for the industry.</narrative>
