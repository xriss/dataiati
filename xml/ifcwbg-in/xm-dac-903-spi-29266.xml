   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Incorporated in 2004, National Collateral Management Services Limited (NCMSL or the Company) is an independent provider of integrated supply chain solutions as well as risk management services for producers, traders and end users of agricultural and non-agricultural commodities. Its main services are warehousing and storage, procurement and collateral management for banks providing agri-commodity financing. The Project involves setting up of owned warehouses across the country for storing agri-commodities. The Company currently operates around 400 warehouses taken on short / medium term lease contracts across the country in over 80 locations. Due to the nature of these lease contracts, the Company is exposed to the risks of lease price volatility as well as non-renewal of the contracts. The Company believes that the only way to improve overall services levels (across procurement, warehousing and collateral management), operating efficiencies and long term-profitability in this business is by moving from a 100% lease-based model to a more balanced mix of owned and leased warehouses.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project will have a strong development impact by helping build efficient agriculture supply chain solutions and promoting inclusive growth as several of the proposed warehouses are in low income states. Around 50% of NCMSLs current (leased) warehousing capacity by volume is located in the low income states of UP, MP and Rajasthan while 33% of the new (owned) warehousing capacity is proposed to be established in these states.

Additionally, most of the procurement activities of the Company are in LIS; for example in the case of Suguna, procurement is being carried out largely in Rajasthan while in the case of FCI, procurement was carried out in Orissa, Bihar, MP, Rajasthan and UP.</narrative>
