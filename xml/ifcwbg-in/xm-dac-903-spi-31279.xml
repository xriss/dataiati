The Company presently provides turnkey active and passive network installation and active &amp; passive network management services primarily in India with a strategy to expand its international footprint. Microqual also manufactures a range of passive components like RF cables &amp; transmission kits, in-building products, repeaters etc. for RF/ microwave industry at its plants located in India.   The Company is planning a foray into outdoor telecom leasing infrastructure business by installing mobile telecom towers on existing electricity grid network (Power Tower) for the first time in India. Microqual, through competitive bidding processes, has obtained 10-year exclusive rights to develop wireless telecom site solutions on selected power transmission towers from Powergrid Corporation of India (PGCIL) and State Transmission Companies (STC) for installing and operating mobile telecom equipments on these towers. Microqual intends to develop a portfolio of about 10,000  15,000 such towers across India and lease it out for use by various telecom operators. To enhance its technical and safety capabilities, Microqual has entered into a joint venture agreement with Buckley Cable Construction Co., United States, which has two decades of experience in deploying and managing telecom infrastructure including power solutions.   Additionally, the Company is also developing a portfolio of in-building distributed antennae system across various properties in India. This will also be leased out to various telecom operators in India.</narrative>
