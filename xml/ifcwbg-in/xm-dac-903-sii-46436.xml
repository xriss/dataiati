   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Project level outcomes are delivered through increasing access to equity and value creation for mid-cap companies in India with a focus to also support companies with a scope for expanding significant operations in low-income states. MOA is an experienced fund manager and will support value creation in its investee companies through operational improvements by leveraging its in-house team of experts, in turn, positioning companies for market expansion across India.  
Market creation is delivered by strengthening the competitiveness of the private equity (PE) market in India. The project supports an experienced fund manager to raise a follow-on fund in the mid-cap market segment. Beyond the project, the success of the Fund will encourage other local fund managers to raise new or follow funds in the segment. In turn, this will attract domestic and international institutional investors and is expected to reduce the need for development financial institution (DFI) presence in the market for future fundraisings</narrative>
