   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The market segments focused on by Yes Bank overlap with some of IFC&apos;&apos;s top priorities. Through this investment IFC will initiate and develop a relationship with a potentially important development partner. IFC will help refine the focus and strengthen the capabilities of the Bank in effectively addressing SMEs and agriculture customers as it expands its network and increases its exposure in these market segments.  Access to finance: The proceeds of IFC&apos;&apos;s funding will be utilized by Yes Bank to finance its customers in the SME and agricultural sectors. IFC&apos;&apos;s investment will thus ensure continued and increasing access to finance to the SME sector in increasingly challenging credit environment.  Supporting a private sector bank in the growth years:  Yes Bank is a recently established private sector bank with 7 years of operations, and has demonstrated consistently good performance. Yes Bank was also the regional (Asia Pacific) winner of the 2011 FT/IFC Sustainable Finance awards. The Bank has ambitious plans to expand its branch network, broaden its footprint in smaller cities and grow its SME franchise. This project will support the long-term growth strategy of Yes Bank and improve its financial fundamentals.</narrative>
