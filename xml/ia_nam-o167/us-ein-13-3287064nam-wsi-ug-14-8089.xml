   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Creating demand for HIV services including: couples, safe male circumcision, prevention of mother to
child transmission, sexually transmitted infection testing, condoms, and anti-retroviral therapy.
Partners create linkages through community mobilization and education interventions and services at
health facilities. Targeted outreaches are carried out in known &#x201C;hot spots&#x201D; and referrals are provided
for related prevention and care services. Trained resource persons and Trainers of Trainers work at
the parish level to: a) refer clients to services, b) improve risk perception, and c) promote demand for
and use of preventive services.
&#xF0B7; Developing and implementing a Behavior Change Communication strategy including targeted
messages through media (radio) and interpersonal communication channels and distribution of
information, education, and communication materials at outreach events.
&#xF0B7; Emphasizing testing and disclosure among all target populations. Outreach is coordinated with
providers and infotainment techniques are used to elicit interest in services.
&#xF0B7; Addressing cultural and social issues that drive the HIV epidemic in the district through a series of
community dialogue meetings and following the Stepping Stones model. Community dialogues reach
the target populations and others (community development officers, local opinion leaders, religious
leaders). Gender, sexual violence, male dominance, cross-generational sex, stigma and
discrimination, and lack of women&#x2019;s decision-making around sexual and reproductive health
decisions, among others are addressed. Dialogue meetings are reinforced with radio talk shows and
call-in shows on specific topics.
The project trained 240 community owned resource persons; reached 53,666 people with HIV prevention
messages and 69,590 through community dialogues; assisted 22,674 people with HIV prevention services
(safe male circumcision, HIV counseling and testing, prevention of mother-to-child transmission, antiretroviral
treatment, sexually transmitted infection treatment and distribution of 779,050 condoms);
developed and aired 20 radio shows; supported nine district and 80 sub county AIDS committee meetings,
and referred 10,711 clients for services.</narrative>
