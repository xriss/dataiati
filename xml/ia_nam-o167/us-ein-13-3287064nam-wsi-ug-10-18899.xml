   <narrative xml:lang="EN">An average Ugandan woman will have six children in her lifetime. A lack of knowledge about and access to family planning services contributes to this high fertility, which leads to high rates of maternal and infant mortality. There is a high-unmet need for family planning in Uganda.  Through Advancing Partners &amp;amp; Communities (APC), WellShare&#x2019;s Advancing Community-based Access to Injectable Contraceptives in Uganda project worked to scale up access to both intramuscular and subcutaneous injectables in eastern Uganda (Iganga and Kumi Districts). In 2014, a new cascade model of training was developed in partnership with the two District Health Teams, 10 District Health Team staff were trained as master trainers, and 30 health center staff and 161 Village Health Team members (VHTs) were trained to provide comprehensive community-based family planning. These district staff and volunteers supported activities in 2015.</narrative>
