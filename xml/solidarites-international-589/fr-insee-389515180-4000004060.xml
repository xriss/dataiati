       <narrative xml:lang="EN">The high temperature and humidity in Aden during the first few months of the project (summer season) led to difficulties in finding water containers that were positive for mosquito pupae that could have been collected. In addition, as became apparent during the first entomological survey, people store their water in small jerry cans and water buckets rather than larger water containers, such as water drums. The SumiLarv 2MR disks can only be used in water containers of 40L upwards. 
While mosquitoes still breed in jerry cans and water buckets, these reciprocals are not suitable for the 2MR disks. The entomological team will continue to search for suitable water containers during the wetter season of the year.</narrative>

     <narrative xml:lang="EN">Basic drinking water services: According to Indikit.net, basic drinking water is that from  an improved source provided collection time is not more than 30 minutes for a roundtrip including queuing). Limited water service is from an improved source where fetching time exceeds 30min . Out of  gross popln 60,000 targeted, at least 85% or 51,000 are reached of who 8,400 or 16% of 51,000 will get water at doorstep; balance of 42,600  through water points, some accessible within 500m  and 30min and some varyingly beyond 500m and 30min. This is because population density in rural areas is sparse and it may not always be feasible to find  a good water source. However, even a comparatively  long walking distance to a new and safe water source would still be a health boost to them for the very first time in their lives.  The figure of 42,600 added to 8,400 (R3.3.2 below)  adds to 51,000 pple.</narrative>

The assembly comprises a UPVC pipe or ferro cement conduit leading to a 50-250 litre ferrocement or stone cistern or plastic barrell.  Based on local practices, this activity is only feasible in mountaneous districts of the project area like Wazziyah and Mawza which receive about 3-4 months of rain annually. Training will be done by SI engineers, targeting about 20 villages with estimated 50 HH per village, total 1000 HH</narrative>

     <narrative xml:lang="EN">Sustainable means resilient to weather elements and coping well  in adverse situations; has foreseeable lifespan of 10-15 years; is environment friendly; utilizes local materials, skill and knowledge capacities.
Safe: means structurally, psychologically and culturally sound, hazard free, as well as dignifying and acceptable.
Accessible: Means is available in adequate quantities and quality, by all (including easy access for differently abled persons) most of the time, within  reasonable reach (distance) and affordable cost
Environmental sanitation means sanitation that is cognizant of public health benefits but also hazards; it is environmentally friendly, and climate change sensitive. It also highlights the opportunity to  to reuse, to reduce and to recycle waste, and to dispose what cannot be disposed safely. In this context, at least 80% of population will benefit from  latrines and/or  solid waste disposal services  (vector control is treated separately and Result 4).</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">The number of DPAs to train had to be adapted. In the context of the Covid-19 epidemic, the training of 430 DPAs represented a real challenge for MI. To mitigate the risk of spreading the virus during the upcoming DPA sessions with households, MI eventually trained 91 DPAs and strengthened their training by extending their duration from one day to four days per week, but reaching the same number of community memebers as 430 DPAs would have. 
Among them, one was absent on the 2nd day of the training and two stopped the work due to personal reasons, so MI is currently employing 88 DPAs. This reduced setup also lowers the costs and logistics associated with training and reduce the overall training period before implementation. At last, as the they are more closely invested in the project, DPAs are more motivated.</narrative>
