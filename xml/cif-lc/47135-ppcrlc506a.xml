   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The main objective of the project is to strengthen the viability of agri-business operators in the southern region of St. Lucia within the context of climate change. The model that has been developed to achieve this objective includes three inter-related elements, specifically: (1) support for capacity building and financing of climate resilient practices by small producers in the targeted region; (2) development and leverage of new, more sustainable and profitable market channels in the island&#x2019;s tourism and retail sectors; and, (3) strengthening of cooperative structures to organize independent small producers and ensure that quality, pricing and quantities required for transactions with larger scale buyers are achieved and maintained.</narrative>
