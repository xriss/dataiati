   <description>
    <narrative xml:lang="EN">In 2020, IDI will support over 90 Supreme Audit Institutions in developing countries. Over 200 SAI teams will participate in IDI&#x2019;s global and regional initiatives, and over 1,000 SAI leaders and staff will benefit from professional capacity development. IDI will also provide targeted SAI-level support to 8 SAIs and will provide or broker long-term holistic support to 11 SAIs &#x2013; such as Somalia and South Sudan &#x2013; operating in some of the most challenging contexts in the world. IDI approved a new Strategic Plan 2019-23 to enhance the impact and sustainability of its support. During 2020, IDI will largely complete the transition to its new strategic approach. IDI&#x2019;s portfolio of discrete, time bound programmes has been transformed into four integrated, long-term work streams. Taken as a package, these address the capacity development needs of SAIs. In 2020 IDI will strengthen the synergies and further enable cross-working between these work streams. IDI also promised a strategic shift to fully integrate gender into its work. During 2020, IDI will finalise its gender strategy, and operationalise its Gender Analysis Framework and Guidance as an integral part of the design of all new IDI initiatives. The new Strategic Plan is incredibly ambitious in terms of the scaling-up of financial and human resources needed. By the end of 2020, IDI plans to have increased its annual funding from 60m NOK in 2017 to 100m NOK in 2020, and increased staff levels from 25 to 42. For this, IDI is extremely grateful to its financial partners within the INTOSAI and Donor communities, as well as the in-kind support received from SAIs and INTOSAI bodies. IDI will continue to foster these partnerships, by engaging partners in strategic dialogue, investing in building relationships, maintaining good governance, and communicating the results and successes of its work.</narrative>

   </title>
   <description>
    <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Strategic Plans are long-term plans spanning from five to six years. The IDI&#x2019;s strategic priorities over the planning period are discussed in the Strategic Plans. Besides the strategic priorities, the strategic plans provide an insight into the way IDI selects its portfolio and how it delivers the Strategic Plans. The Strategic Plan 2019-2023 is the IDI&#x2019;s latest Strategic Plan. Taking the needs of Supreme Audit Institutions in developing countries as a starting point (based on the Global SAI Stocktaking 2017) and aiming for more sustainability and impact, it builds on: IDI&#x2019;s experience feedback and involvement of key stakeholders a review of implementation of the previous Strategic Plan. The plan sets out how IDI will continue to support SAIs in developing countries in their efforts to sustainably enhance their performance and capacity for the benefit of their citizens. The new Strategic Plan introduces two major strategic shifts: The introduction of long-term work streams that will provide scaled-up, holistic, tailored support to SAIs in the areas of independence, governance, professionalism and relevance The full integration of a gender perspective throughout the plan.</narrative>
