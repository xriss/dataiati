   <narrative xml:lang="SV">Development problem Countries in the North Africa have ratified all the fundamental conventions of ILO - the problem is that they are unable to implement the content of the conventions. Consequently, there are substantial imbalance in the labour market; high unemployment rates (among the highest in the world) and low level of economic activity. These problems persist despite the fact that the region has generally had a relatively high economic growth, but poverty and inequality are not showing clear signs of decreasing. It has had limited effects on poverty reduction and job creation. In Egypt, by large the biggest country of the region, the national poverty rate increased from 17 percent in 2000 to 28 percent in 2015,&#xA0;largely unaffected in years of stronger economic performance. The situation is mirrored in the labour market, with unemployment and precarious employment remaining stubbornly high, particularly challenging for the youth. This evidence suggests that North Africa does not need higher growth levels, but a different form of growth, one that allows to invert rising poverty and marginalization by creating more and better jobs for a youthful and growing population. Achieving this requires reform in the labour market and real implementation of the international conventions.
The aim of the interventionThe project strategy builds on an analysis of the key stakeholders and the change agents that need to be effectively engaged with, to achieve the expected results. Decent work is a multidimensional reality that requires the active involvement of a range of actors. It is an economic as much as a social and a rights-based challenge; it needs to involve a range of public authorities, social partners and NGOs. The project will accompany the Governments and the social and economic actors in North Africa in their path towards the implementation of the Decent Work Agenda, It will also support the Governments in fulfilling their obligations towards the realization of the SGDs (in particular the SDG 8), the objectives of their national development strategies and the sectoral strategies.The project will intervene both at regional and at national levels. The countries have been selected because they present a mix of key challenges requiring support, but also of real opportunities for development cooperation. The demand for technical assistance and development cooperation from national stakeholders and the importance given to decent work and employment in national development frameworks have been considered when developing the proposal. This gives opportunities in making sure that the reforms are real and broad.

Overall objective of the intervention: Decent work deficits are effectively addressed in North Africa through the following outcomes:
Outcome 1: Policy stances in North Africa steer job-rich growth
1.1 Key Decision makers&#x2019; and stakeholders&#x2019; capacities are built to promote quality jobs and sustainable economic growth.
Based on the methodological and consultative work accomplished in the inception phase, the project will facilitate the formation of a regional network of experts on the nexus between job creation and economic growth and put in place an online community of practice (CoP) to exchange information. The CoP will provide a collaborative workspace for experts and all those with a specialist interest on the nexus between economic growth and employment in the region and will contribute to the development and sharing of practitioner-oriented knowledge and operational tools on the themes of employment promotion and social protection. The project will also produce a Regional Jobs and Growth Report on a yearly basis for wide dissemination. Such a report will act as a flagship product to raise awareness and be a key reference to policy makers and stakeholders at the national and regional level. The project will also convene annual conferences, to present the results of the report and plan for the following issues, and to raise awareness and exchange views at the policy and strategic levels.
1.2 A close monitoring of the real economy is paramount for Governments to be able to steer their economies as close as possible to their productive potential.
To balance the objectives of financial stability and of growth and jobs, policy action in the social domain and in favour of the real economy needs to be as appropriately informed as policy action on the financial and monetary levels. The project will support strengthening national macroeconomic accounting and analysis systems. This will involve improving technical computation and interpretation methods, technical capacities or collaboration among the different stakeholders, data user-producer dialogue to improve the relevance and usage of the data, etc. The project will support the creation of &#x201C;real economy monitor&#x201D; facilities/tools that produce and track key economic and social indicators and parameters. The project will collaborate with a leading national institution in each of the target countries to host and manage the monitor or similar data platforms.
With an enhanced &#x201C;birds-eye view&#x201D; of how the real economy is faring, focused diagnostics and technical assistance can be made use of to address weaknesses and opportunities. The project will act as a &#x201C;technical assistance facility&#x201D; to fulfil government needs in revising policies and programmes and recommending innovations and best practices. In doing so, the project will as much as possible build local capacities in a learning-by-doing approach that will associate local public officials and experts in the technical work. Diagnostics yielding concrete policy options will be implemented with respect to fiscal incentives, investment regimes, public investment policies, active labour market measures, and social protection programmes. Policy scan tools, such as the &#x201C;Assessment Based National Dialogue on Social Protection&#x201D; (ABND) will be used.
1.3 The Ministry of Employment/Labour have enhanced capacity to fulfill more effectively their roles
The capacities of the Ministries in charge of employment in the different countries of the region are not adequate to enable them effectively coordinate development cooperation among multiple actors, to effectively learn from practice and ensure that best practices are scaled up. In Egypt, for example, the ILO has mapped over 250 projects that were active over the course of 5 years with pertinence to youth employment. However, no system was in place to ensure they knew about each other; some conflicting approaches were being pursued; and the Ministry hasn&#x2019;t learned out of all this work what should be prioritized for expansion and further work. Similarly, in Tunisia, a mapping exercise completed in 2018 by the Ministry of Professional Training and Employment with the support of UNDP highlighted the lack of knowledge exchange between the different international cooperation projects focusing on employment and professional training and their poor alignment with the Ministry&#x2019;s strategic axes.
&#xA0;An effective Information Management System is an essential instrument for the Ministries to avoid the scattering of efforts and capacities. The project will work with Ministries on enhancing their internal management systems. Access in real-time to critical information - both financial and substantive - about all of development cooperation projects will be ensured. Best practices for development cooperation coordination will be facilitated, including the preparation of development partner inventories (who does what) in the fields of employment promotion and social protection. Thirdly, evaluation policies and practices of the Ministry will be enhanced, including the linkage between evaluation findings and management decisions.

Outcome 2. Decision makers and influencers make better use of policy evidence to promote social and labour rights
2.1 National Parliaments and Governments in focus countries are better informed of ILS and of other key developments on the social and rights front.
The project will work under this outcome in close consultation with ILO labour standards specialists in Cairo and in Geneva. It will first strengthen the systems and tools that inform national Parliaments, with a focus on social and labour rights issues. The project will conduct a needs assessment to identify the current resources and needs of Members of Parliaments with regard to their access to information on social issues and explore possible alternatives information and knowledge brokering and management tools (such as through newsletters, online portals) that the project can support to ensure a stronger access to key resources.
&#xA0;The project will also facilitate the composition of a network of experts from Ministries, academia and think tanks who will feed information and analysis to the Parliament. These experts need to be able to analyse, interpret relevant information, and distil it in a way that it is intelligible to the non-specialist in the Parliament. The availability of such information would allow the Parliament to keep the pulse on what matters and steer change within the government afterward. With respect to ILS, labour lawyers willing to be contributors will be trained on the findings and recommendations of the Committee of Experts (CoE) and prepare reader-friendly notes for the information of the parliament and the media.
National expert networks (labour law, sector specialists as required) will further be supported to appraise the alignment of national law and practice with selected conventions (to be defined at national level, and including fundamental conventions). It will build on the findings of ILO global supervisory bodies, and address priority domains at country level. The text of the law and actuating decrees, but also actual practices, structures and capacities will be reviewed. Concrete recommendations on laws drafts, but also decrees and government structures and capacities, will be drawn. Trainings for Governments to better report on the observation of ILS will be a corollary activity.

2.2 International Labour Standards are better reflected in the national jurisprudence of focus countries.
The ILO Committee of Experts has consistently emphasized the importance of the role of courts in enforcing ILS at the national level. It has also stressed the importance of taking measures to draw to the attention of judges as to the standards laid down in International Labour Conventions. Building on the pilot work done in Egypt, the project will collaborate with judicial authorities (Cassation Courts or equivalents, national centers for judicial studies or training center,) to train a pool of judges on ILS and their applicability to their national contexts. These judges will be supported in producing a manual and then rollout training to their peers, with a view to expanding the reference to ILS in the national jurisprudence.
2.3 The media and civil society are more knowledgeable of ILS and decent work and enrich the national discourse.
The importance of the media, including social media, in advancing labour and social rights is well recognized. Much can be gained from a better informed national discourse as relates to sensitive, complex topics such as freedom of association and protection of unionists, for instance. Therefore, the project will enhance the knowledge of journalists and media professionals on key decent work issues and on how and where to get key information. This will allow journalists to better understand the options and the stakes, and contribute in a constructive manner to the national discourse around ILS and related topics. Collective agreements on conditions at national, local or sectoral level between employers and workers to find common interest areas in terms of wages and working conditions will also be promoted along this line of work.
2.4 Enhanced labour standards and good practices are promoted in different economic sectors through the cooperation with the private sector.
Under this output the project will work with the private sector to enhance labour standards and promote the adoption of best practices in favour of better working conditions. The cooperation with the private sector is gaining importance in many dimension of the ILO work, playing an increasing role in advancing towards the realization of the &#x2018;Decent Work&#x2019; agenda, and occupies an important place in the &#x2018;Decent Work&#x2019; component of the Swedish MENA strategy 2016-20 within the economic sector.
To achieve the expected results, the ILO will collaborate primarily with international corporations operating in North Africa, which are already implementing and are aiming to enhance labour standards among their staff or the suppliers. The starting point will be with Swedish corporations, including Volvo and Ericsson: the models offered by these Corporations - for the example in the area of Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) - will be proposed for a generalization in the relevant economic sector and for influencing the standard setting processes. The work on this output will contribute to produce training material, new procedures, new standards, and also pilot the implementation of these new tools.
Overall, the partnership with the international corporations will aim to expand good labour practices to different economic sectors, influencing the standards and contribute to create the capacity to implement the standards, in a perspective of sustainability and national appropriation. Documentation and knowledge sharing will be an essential part of the action.

Conclusion:
Sida assesses that these reforms are necessary for the region to&#xA0;be able to create jobs. Sida&apos;s assessment is that the outcomes/outputs are ambitions, but ILO has necessary knowledge, routines and&#xA0;leverage to make sure that they are&#xA0;achieved.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The aim of the intervention is to create better conditions for the job market and creation of new jobs. This is done by supporting effective implementation of international norms and regulations in the labor market - better apply the necessary labor market reforms and decisions that promote long-term sustainable job creation mechanisms. Here, issues like social protection, decent wages, dialogue between different partners in the labor market become central. The proposed intervention addresses many of the structural causes of today&apos;s labor market. The countries in the region have ratified several of the ILO Conventions but lack implementation. This effort aims to address and reduce the gap between ratification and implementation of international conventions, in order to create better conditions for people to get decent jobs. In addition, the ILO will support the countries with adequate and relevant evidence to implement appropriate labor market reforms</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="SV">Its important to note that this is the first conclusion on performance for this project. The project was handed over to the embassy in Amman On January 2020. Th officer since then have been trying to get familiar with the project , its activities, results and develop a good communication plan with the partner.
ILO has submitted the second progress report for the period of January 2019 to December 2019.
The first progress report that covers the first 6 months of the project submitted to Sida in July 2019, thus this report builds on the results presented in the first progress report and adds on it.
The cooperation with the partner has been good, the partner is responsive to Sida&#x2019; requests and maintain a good dialogue.
The project had some implementation challenges due to lack of obtaining security clearances, especially in Egypt, and the security clearance was not obtained till the end of the reporting period, adding to difficulties in obtaining security clearances for the engagement of international experts to collaborate with the project.
The project ensured a fast-track recruitment, where 2 national staff in Algeria expected to be engaged to the project by early 2020, furthermore a new CTA has been recruited to start in January 2020. A National Coordinator has been recruited in Tunisia in December 2019, and a new National Project Officer (Coordination/ M&amp;E) has joined the project in Egypt in the end of 2019.
&#xA0;
Below some notable results under this period of implementation:
In the area of International Labour Standards (ILS), where the advocacy and research work conducted with the support of the project, the ILS have been realized in Egypt Morocco through advocacy, capacity building, information sharing and knowledge generation, in partnership with National Parliaments, Ministries of Labour, Ministries of Justice, Judges and social partners
In Egypt: the project confirmed its partnership with the Egypt&#x2019;s National Center for Judicial Studies (NCJS), which resulted in a number of 141 judges from Cassation, Appeal and Primary Courts have been trained and enhanced their awareness about the ILS through training courses supported by the project, developing a training manual for Judges &quot;Benchbook&quot; has been approved to be completed by 2020. Discussion on institutionalize the ILS contents in the NCJS&#x2019; training work has taken place as well.
In Morocco: the advocacy and research work resulted in registration of ratification of 3 ILO conventions during the recent International Labour Conference of 2019, and the advocacy work is to be continued in support of registration of 5 other conventions, adding to one protocol is approved and waiting for registration at the ILO.
- The project provided technical assistance and advisory services for the functioning of the Tripartite Committee in-charge of the promotion and enhancement of the ILS application.
Tunisia: with regard to strengthening the institutional capacity, an Information and Management Systems for the projects of International cooperation (IDEMA) of the Ministry of Professional Training was officially launched in June 2019, the system was populated with data and used to monitor the deployment and use of IDEMA to ensure its sustainability.
