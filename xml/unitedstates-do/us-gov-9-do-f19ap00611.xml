  </title>
  <description>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Two of the most threatened Neotropical migrant landbird species experiencing decades of population declines - the Cerulean Warbler (CERW) and Golden-winged Warbler (GWWA) - depend on tropical forests across Colombia as stopover and wintering sites for their survival during their annual migrations. However, now more than ever, this habitat is being destroyed at an accelerated rate. The situation is particularly dire as the country emerges from 50 years of a violent civil war that ironically protected much of its natural resources by preventing development and international investment. As peace settles across the nation, deforestation rates have nearly doubled each year since 2015. This project will directly protect and manage habitat at 19 of those protected areas encompassing 46,724 acres that are important stopover and wintering locations for CERW and GWWA; to expand Colombia&apos;s protected area network for migratory birds by protecting an additional 3,322 acres at two of those sites; to restore 1,870 acres of migratory bird habitat at two of those sites; to monitor populations of CERW and GWWA at those sites; and to raise awareness about the conservation of these species through education and public outreach with surrounding communities.</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">U.S. assistance supports the foreign policy priority of building the Dominican Republic&apos;s effectiveness as a regional partner, and is aligned with the priorities established in the Dominican National Development Strategy. A challenging security environment, climate change, weak institutions, corruption, inadequate public health services, poor education, and a lack of job opportunities are major development challenges facing the Dominican Republic. The U.S. government collaborates with Dominican authorities to address these challenges, while working with local and international partners to strengthen institutional and technical capacity. A secure and stable Dominican Republic is important to the advancement of U.S. interests in the Caribbean. The FY 2017 foreign assistance request aims to build resilience to the effects of climate change, improve the quality of basic education, and increase access to quality prevention, care, and treatment services for HIV/AIDS. To address the needs of marginalized populations, including women, the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex (LGBTI) community, people of Haitian descent, and people with disabilities, U.S. assistance will fund activities to support their inclusion in all aspects of Dominican society. Bilateral programs will complement and enhance security and citizen safety assistance being provided through the Caribbean Basin Security Initiative.</narrative>
