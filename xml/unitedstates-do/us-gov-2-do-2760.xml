   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This award strives to support the science and practice of food, feed, and fiber production (including forestry, wildlife, fisheries, aquaculture and floriculture) and its relationships to natural resources, processing, marketing, distribution, utilization (including nutrition), and trade. In addition, this award From January 9-July 9, 2017, APHIS sponsored training related to compliance with the International Air Transport Association (IATA) regulations for shipping scientific samples. The majority of the countries of the Caribbean do not have diagnostic capacity to test for animal diseases. In the event of a disease outbreak, several Caribbean countries have to send samples to regional and/or reference laboratoriesin other countries. In order to ship samples to reference laboratories, officials who pack and ship samples were trained and certified to comply with IATA regulations..</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">U.S. assistance supports the foreign policy priority of building the Dominican Republic&apos;s effectiveness as a regional partner, and is aligned with the priorities established in the Dominican National Development Strategy. A challenging security environment, climate change, weak institutions, corruption, inadequate public health services, poor education, and a lack of job opportunities are major development challenges facing the Dominican Republic. The U.S. government collaborates with Dominican authorities to address these challenges, while working with local and international partners to strengthen institutional and technical capacity. A secure and stable Dominican Republic is important to the advancement of U.S. interests in the Caribbean. The FY 2017 foreign assistance request aims to build resilience to the effects of climate change, improve the quality of basic education, and increase access to quality prevention, care, and treatment services for HIV/AIDS. To address the needs of marginalized populations, including women, the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex (LGBTI) community, people of Haitian descent, and people with disabilities, U.S. assistance will fund activities to support their inclusion in all aspects of Dominican society. Bilateral programs will complement and enhance security and citizen safety assistance being provided through the Caribbean Basin Security Initiative.</narrative>
