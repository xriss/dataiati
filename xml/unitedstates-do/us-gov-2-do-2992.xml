   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This award strives to support the science and practice of food, feed, and fiber production (including forestry, wildlife, fisheries, aquaculture and floriculture) and its relationships to natural resources, processing, marketing, distribution, utilization (including nutrition), and trade. In addition, this award Pests and insects interceptions in the United States have been a serious challenge for fruit and vegetables exporters in the Dominican Republic (DR). Despite efforts made by the DR Ministry of Agriculture and producers/exporters to address the issue of increased pest interceptions at the U.S. Ports of entry, pests such as thrips remain a serious problem. In August 2017, a mission from Miami Airport Authorities and APHIS-PPQ, delivered a conference on market requirements and entry procedures of the U.S. The APHIS team explained the importance of proper inspection and export certification system to detect pests prior shipping. The APHIS team also visited two packing houses and highlighted some weak points that may affect the quality of the inspections. The Export Quality and Safety Program (EQS) implemented by IESC (International Executive Service Corps) is providing support to improve the DR inspection system (infrastructure, training, tools, etc.) following the recommendations provided by APHIS. In this projects, APHIS conducted additional, follow-up hands-on and in-depth training on inspection and mitigation procedures for the DR Plant Health officials, producers and packers. The overall goal is to lower the risk of introduction of quarantine pests into the U.S., by reducing pest load in the field and packinghouses in the Dominican Republic..</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">U.S. assistance supports the foreign policy priority of building the Dominican Republic&apos;s effectiveness as a regional partner, and is aligned with the priorities established in the Dominican National Development Strategy. A challenging security environment, climate change, weak institutions, corruption, inadequate public health services, poor education, and a lack of job opportunities are major development challenges facing the Dominican Republic. The U.S. government collaborates with Dominican authorities to address these challenges, while working with local and international partners to strengthen institutional and technical capacity. A secure and stable Dominican Republic is important to the advancement of U.S. interests in the Caribbean. The FY 2017 foreign assistance request aims to build resilience to the effects of climate change, improve the quality of basic education, and increase access to quality prevention, care, and treatment services for HIV/AIDS. To address the needs of marginalized populations, including women, the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex (LGBTI) community, people of Haitian descent, and people with disabilities, U.S. assistance will fund activities to support their inclusion in all aspects of Dominican society. Bilateral programs will complement and enhance security and citizen safety assistance being provided through the Caribbean Basin Security Initiative.</narrative>
