   <narrative xml:lang="EN">As a result of expanding trade and tourism industries in the Caribbean, this area has long been recognized as a stepping stone for pests to enter the United States, especially via Florida. With 28 air and sea port, Florida serves as the first point of entry to the US mainland for many products and passengers for the Caribbean. In light of this there is need for the Region to have the capacity and ability to rapidly and accurately diagnosis plant and animal health problems to ensure the safe and sustainable trade of agricultural and animal products that are demanded by the U.S market and have access to relevant and scientific information systems to address trading partner&#x2019;s requests.. This project supports the Caribbean region&apos;s capacity and ability to rapidly and accurately diagnose plant and animal health problems to ensure the safe and sustainable trade of agricultural and animal products with U.S and other markets. APHIS supported several projects at the University of the West Indies (UWI) to help support diagnostic and information services for the region. These included: 1) Laboratory training in Fruit Fly Identification, Rearing and Trapping Training for Trinidad and Tobago: 15 members of staff of the Trinidad and Tobago Crop Protection and Pest Risk Analysis (PRA) Unit were trained; 2) PRA Laboratory Training and Evaluation Exercise for Trinidad and Tobago: 15 members of staff of the T&amp;T Crop Protection and PRA unit were trained; 3) Regional Plant Quarantine Principles and Procedures Training Course (Laboratory Facilitators) &#x2013; 20 participants at the UWI Annual Regional Course were trained; 4) APHIS supported training for one laboratory technician from UWI at University of Florida for 2 weeks in Pathology Rapid Identification.</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">U.S. assistance supports the foreign policy priority of building the Dominican Republic&apos;s effectiveness as a regional partner, and is aligned with the priorities established in the Dominican National Development Strategy. A challenging security environment, climate change, weak institutions, corruption, inadequate public health services, poor education, and a lack of job opportunities are major development challenges facing the Dominican Republic. The U.S. government collaborates with Dominican authorities to address these challenges, while working with local and international partners to strengthen institutional and technical capacity. A secure and stable Dominican Republic is important to the advancement of U.S. interests in the Caribbean. The FY 2017 foreign assistance request aims to build resilience to the effects of climate change, improve the quality of basic education, and increase access to quality prevention, care, and treatment services for HIV/AIDS. To address the needs of marginalized populations, including women, the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex (LGBTI) community, people of Haitian descent, and people with disabilities, U.S. assistance will fund activities to support their inclusion in all aspects of Dominican society. Bilateral programs will complement and enhance security and citizen safety assistance being provided through the Caribbean Basin Security Initiative.</narrative>
