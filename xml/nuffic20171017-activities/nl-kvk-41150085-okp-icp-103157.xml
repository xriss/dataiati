   <description>
    <narrative xml:lang="EN">Reporting is an important management tool which is used to inform relevant government officials and other stakeholders about the results being achieved by individual projects and the programme as a whole. 
For project partners, it is compulsory to use the prescribed Orange Knowledge annual report format in order to report on project achievements. The annual report also provides valuable data on the financial situation of the project. Based on an analysis of the project performance in relation to the project output(s) and expected outcome(s), a revision of the project work plan may be suggested by the project partners. The consequences of a possible revision on the project work plan and budget must be made clear in the annual report.
Nuffic monitors outputs and outcomes and not activities . Therefore, the main focus of the annual report must be on the achievement of the project&#x2019;s output(s) and planned outcome(s). The information provided in the annual reports of the projects is used by Nuffic to monitor the progress of the project and to inform the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and other stakeholders about the output(s) and outcome(s) being achieved by individual projects and the Orange Knowledge programme as a whole. 
Please note that if project progress is in accordance with the original planning, reporting requirements are minimal. Only in case of deviations from the planning, more elaboration is demanded.
In the grant award letter, the dates for submission of the annual reports are mentioned. In case of a three-year project, between 5-7 reports are obligatory.
The first report (0) is a very short report which focuses on specific conditions and/or recommendations in the grant. There is no need to report on progress in achieving outputs and outcomes, which is done in the first annual report. As annex to the report 0, the consortium agreements between the partners should be submitted.
The final report must reflect on the entire project period.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">16-03-2021: Because this project has only been in operation for one year, We can&apos;t measure the student graduates clearly. We are sure in the end of 2021 we can have a better estimation of student graduates with enriched comepetences. 
Looking at teachers, 20 teachers are trained and more or less graduated for the skills training. Next step is to train them as trainer for emerging farmers. 
At this point we did not yet train emerging farmers, so there is no result on gradutes in this target group.
Although many processes in South Africa, including education, has been put on halt now due to COVID-19, we hope we can catch up all activities soon, to be able to continue with deliverance of graduates on all levels.</narrative>

Interesting to see is that all organisations profit of the discussions and steps we made. Also in actions that are formulated during workshops, all other organsiations were invilved or want to be involved. Compliments here for Elangeni and Stellenbosch university who spend time in a network development approach in stead of own organisation centered approach.
These organisations perform better:
KZN: near to Elangeni  5 other TVET&apos;s: Umfofolozi, Costal, Mthashana, Majuba, Esayidie
and to HE organisations: Cedara and University of Kwazulu Natal (UKZN)

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">16-03-2021: In South Africa and globally, the emphasis is increasingly on building inclusive societies where diversity, in all its manifestations, is valued and harnessed as key to society&apos;s development and well-being. South Africa&apos;s higher education system reflects this diversity and acknowledges the need to transform (Higher Education Act 101 of 1997; Education White Paper 3: A Programme for Higher Education Transformation [1997a]; Education White Paper 6: Special Needs Education; Building an inclusive education and training system [2001]; National Plan for Higher Education of 2000; Strategic Policy Framework on Disability for the Post-School Education and Training System [2018]). SU is no exception with its increasingly diverse student body and staff corps that embody not only South Africa&#x2019;s strengthening democracy, but also broader global trends, such as the increasing inclusion of people with disabilities in higher education. The Constitution of South Africa (RSA, 1996) and the country&#x2019;s legislative framework create an enabling environment to foster respect for diversity and to protect people from discrimination based on race, gender and disability. These principles also feature strongly in the policy governing the higher education system, which emphasises the imperative that all members of society participate equitably in, and benefit from, higher education, with specific reference to people with disabilities in higher education. 1.2 In line with these developments in society in the broader sense and as a means to strive towards social justice, 
SU has increasingly sought to assert the importance of these values to its strategic vision and its role as a university in South Africa and greater Africa.

Through meetings with industry and education, organized in this SEAD SA project, network linkages have been established. Elangeni TVET organised a Business breakfast for sector related industry. From this meeting new placements for students have been offered.
Stellenbosch University has no problems for practial work and Internships. The connection with industry on Horticulture sector is good and for that placements are good to organize.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">16-03-2021: In this project our partners are a TVET with students who are only from previously disadvantaged backgrounds, which means mainly black communities. At Stellenbosch it is quite different, here there are those from priviledged backgrounds as well as about &#xBC; from previously disadvantaged backgrounds . So what is a minority? In the TVET a white rich student is a minority. In Stellenbosch University there is policy for more participation of students from black communities.  
Because Elangeni is country A partner in this project we have a direct inclusion of students from previously disadvantaged communities (black). Many students are from poor households. Because the focus in KZN is on 3 sectors poultry, dairy and pig production, we influence the animal husbandry programs. In this program many students participate. At this stage we envisage to educate 2 groups (classes). The number will be higher towards the end of the project, because we focus on teacher capacity and curriculum improvement.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">16-03-2021: The goal of this project is to increase skills and knowledge in 4 sectors at two institutes. Because we will not design new curricula, but instead &quot;upgrade&quot; the existing curricula, we think that many students in the excising flows will benefit from this work. Easy to identify at this moment:
1. We have been training teaching staff. So after the training, current students are profiting from better skilled teachers
2. The new placements/ internships are not only open to new students but also for current students

In addition to improving curricula we are supporting Blended Learning in all 4 sectors. Blended Learning has two advantages:
1. Existing students can specialize more easily by combining standard education with online specialization in dairy, poultry, pig production or Horti.
2. For non students there is an open gateway to enter high quality sector education at the TVET or University of Stellenbosch</narrative>

2.	Knowledge transfer in study groups for emerging Farmers. In this strategy the agro industry is included. So network development. (3)
3.	Blended Learning, the introduction of Blended Learning skills (4). These didactics help to make students more active with knowledge and in that way more time is left for individual competency development related to job related skills, soft skills and responsibility for individual learning processes.

1.	Focus on Blended Learning: We have designed and integrated 2 trainings in Blended learning. Focussing on the didactical things and use of online material. This didactic will bring learners in the lead in practice.
2.	Development of a safe food for the future approach in existing curricula
3.	Design of studygroups to share knowledge as TVET with emerging farmers. In that process we transferred teachers from lecturers into learning facilitator. This is also an important enrichment for the day to day education. Since industry and NGO&#x2019;s are involved in these studygroups.
4. A  partnership with Umngeni water is at emerging stage.

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">16-03-2021: We foresee two actions that can support the outreach:
1. Student intervention teams. As part of the long-term relationship between SA and NL education we are planning to set up student intervention teams (students form SA and NL in mixed teams). These teams will:
- Conduct a survey in the field among SME&apos;s and Emerging farmers
- Based on the responses received students will develop in small teams specific knowledge products such as for instance user-friendly leaflets, apps etc.
- From this survey we also identify the need for farming skills and specific skills training. This will be organised and carried out at the colleges.

2. The second action is Smartg use of Blended Learning materials. With online materials we are planning to reach out with knowledge (clips) to the society via mobile phones.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">16-03-2021: We organized a high level meeting at the embassy in Pretoria. This meeting was scheduled the 14th of April 2020. (and did not find place because of COVID-19).With the input from meetings (sept. 2019) with stakeholders from education and industry we constructed a &quot;Concept note&quot;. This concept note  is the basis for this meeting with DHET and DAFF. We want to discuss the upograde of AEC&apos;s and next to that supporting budget for TVET&apos;s to be able to send students for skill training weeks in these AEC&apos;s. We aim for a pilot, to show and evaluate the strenght of skill training towards better professionalisation in the 4 sectors.

Both organisations are active in regional and national policy and law groups. Sometimes on sector level, sometimes on social level. So the interaction and professional input is appreciated also on htah level.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">16-03-2021: Through Elangeni the strategic plan is to improve teaching skills for the 4 selected sectors. Through coopeartion with industry and Agricultural training centers where each sector is united. In these AEC&apos;s skill training and innovations are brought together for students, teachers and emerging farmers. In that way teachers can also train farmers on these AEC&apos;s where equipment and animals are relevant for training.

SU: currently work with larger scale family farms but these are all white owned. It will not be possible to change them black owned. However, we will aim for female supervisors to be realised (source, NPC 2016). 
Supervisors will be reached through the employers survey which will be designed as part of project. This survey we will have to do electronically in 2020.

Because we are still in the &quot;construction&quot; phase of building teh network, upgrade teacher skills, identify learning strategies, we did not train farmers yet.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">30-08-2021: The project is badly influenced by COVID-19. Initially we planned to support 140 emerging farmers. With the introduction of a study group approach we think we can reach out to 100-140 emerging farmers in 2021. Next to that we will introduce a Blended Learning platform for dairy production, this will be piloted via Future Farmers and in that way in bigger Dairy production farms. So in total we think we manage to support 150 farms directly to improve productivity.
The systematic approach will lead to more knowledge and skills transfer, since studygroup approach and use of blended learning platforms will be integrated so it is to be expected that more farms will benefit in the long term.
At this moment we expect in the 22 emerging farms increased productivity. 15 of the 22 are younger than 35 years old.</narrative>
