    <narrative xml:lang="EN">Reporting is an important management tool which is used to inform relevant government officials and other stakeholders about the results being achieved by individual projects and the programme as a whole. 
For project partners, it is compulsory to use the prescribed Orange Knowledge annual report format in order to report on project achievements. The annual report also provides valuable data on the financial situation of the project. Based on an analysis of the project performance in relation to the project output(s) and expected outcome(s), a revision of the project work plan may be suggested by the project partners. The consequences of a possible revision on the project work plan and budget must be made clear in the annual report.
Nuffic monitors outputs and outcomes and not activities . Therefore, the main focus of the annual report must be on the achievement of the project&#x2019;s output(s) and planned outcome(s). The information provided in the annual reports of the projects is used by Nuffic to monitor the progress of the project and to inform the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and other stakeholders about the output(s) and outcome(s) being achieved by individual projects and the Orange Knowledge programme as a whole. 
Please note that if project progress is in accordance with the original planning, reporting requirements are minimal. Only in case of deviations from the planning, more elaboration is demanded.
In the grant award letter, the dates for submission of the annual reports are mentioned. In case of a three-year project, between 5-7 reports are obligatory.
The first report (0) is a very short report which focuses on specific conditions and/or recommendations in the grant. There is no need to report on progress in achieving outputs and outcomes, which is done in the first annual report. As annex to the report 0, the consortium agreements between the partners should be submitted.
The final report must reflect on the entire project period.</narrative>

     <actual value="All 5 partners of STITCH (VU, RO, IPDS, DGFP, VU) have diversity in management and teaching staff:

1. IPDS pay attention to the diversity of its staff and Management Board Members. Among the staff, IPDS has staff from four indigenous nationalities. They are : Garo, Khasi, Hajong and Banai. IPDS has an Indigenous Peoples&apos; Policy fully focusing on the ethnic, religious and linguistic minority rights.
2. RedOrange believes in diversity and works for women empowerment. We especially invite females to apply for our positions (externally and internally) which is according to our HR Policy. More than 35% team members are female at this moment. In our line management, we have Senior staff, mid-level staff and female staff. 
3. Yes, DGFP is paying duly attention from the beginning of its journey regarding diversity in management and teaching staff. DGFP is prioritizing the capacity development of Senior staff, mid-level staff and junior level staff to improve the quality of services on FP-MCH and Adolescent health care. For organizing the training DGFP include both male and female officers from the field-level and DGFP and from BKMEA; For venue selection we consider both govt and non-govt premises. For training sessions we include senior and junior, male and female officers from the field-level and DGFP.
4. Answer: We have a good balance at ASDC. Our management and project staffs are a mix of  age, experience and men &amp; women with significant participation/representation of  minority. The governing and management committee is comprised of male and female (senior by age and diversified experience), executed by a very highly educated young team (CEO and implementation officials), the key positions like Communication Officer and the Admin officer are from the Hindu minority community. ASDC recruitments are also made  based on the relevance of the post  with academic-education background  supported by experience &amp; skills and evidence of quality of the person (job ability) and a gender balance is important (ASDC has 50:50 ratio at the head office and at the Training Centre it is 60m:40f with representation from minority community.   As vocational training sector is dominated by male instructors other than garments trade.      
5. VU has a dedicated &#x2018;diversity office&#x2019;. Society and with it our university community has a wide variety of gender, sexual orientation, nationalities, cultures, ways of thinking and religions. We train and educate our students to deal with these differences. So that they, as professionals, are able to view matters from a broader perspective, and as future leaders can make the difference in society. We strive for &apos;inclusive excellence&apos; through four pillars, whereby students, teachers, lecturers and employees within VU use mutual differences to stimulate more creativity and talent development"></actual>

                ethnic, religious and linguistic minority rights. 2. RedOrange promotes diversity
                and inclusion and also ensures an environment which is conductive for minorities.
                For our recruitment process we encourage all genders and communities to apply that
                is part of our HR Policy. 3. DGFP is providing importance to provide services to the
                minorities in the hill tracks areas and hard to reach areas. They involve minorities
                as service providers to ensure that the DGFP services run smoothly in the minority
                areas. Recently DGFP has developed an SRHR training manual for health services
                providers at RMG sector (as result of STITCH) in which information and priorities of
                minority groups and disabled persons have been incorporated. As humanity and equity
                is the first priority to the Bangladesh Government so minority peoples and peoples
                with disabilities are receiving services according to their need from the service
                centers at different tires.DGFP is also working together with some development
                partners and NGOs like UNFPA Bangladesh, Unicef Bangladesh, The Embassy of the
                Kingdom of the Netherlands, Path Finder International, Red Orange and local
                government to provide services to the Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh. 4. ASDC
                Answer: Education for All is the firm stand of the govt. ensured by the Constitution

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">17-01-2022: All 5 partners of STITCH (VU, RO, IPDS, DGFP, VU) 1. IPDS
                follows procedures to recruit women and men staff. IPDS policy approved for
                consideration of 50% female staff. IPDS has a Gender Policy and IPDS is a gender
                sensitive organization. 2. RedOrange has Sexual Harassment Policy, Gender Policy,
                Anti-harassment Policy among other Policies which ensure the gender sensitive
                environment at workplace. For example, a focal person for Sexual Harassment Policy
                where any team member can report and every team member are oriented about this. 3.
                As a government organization, DGFP is following the sustaining policies/procedures
                of the Government. These are not gender specific however well describe gender issues
                and women empowerment. DGFP follows the population policy, current health policies,
                Five Years Operational Plan, Adolescent Health Strategy where the gender issues are
                focused as per priority. There is a good practice of DGFP to conduct session in a
                training program to ensure gender sensitive environment, the resources person always
                pay their attention during delivering their sessions as well as regarding topics,
                they also practice group works, role play, quiz, and interesting brain storming
                plays among participants to ensure convenient atmosphere in the classroom. Moreover,
                for selecting venues we consider safe and comfortable areas, good transportations
                facilities and separate lavatory for gens and ladies. 4. Yes, ASDC has a Gender
                policy which is part of the HR Policy. 5. Yes, VU has a Gender and Diversity policy
                and various toolkits which assist developing towards a university which becomes even
                more inclusive and diverse. WO&amp;MEN is a network of VU employees, committed to
                improving gender equality within the VU.</narrative>
