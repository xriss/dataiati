    <narrative xml:lang="EN">Reporting is an important management tool which is used to inform relevant government officials and other stakeholders about the results being achieved by individual projects and the programme as a whole. 
For project partners, it is compulsory to use the prescribed Orange Knowledge annual report format in order to report on project achievements. The annual report also provides valuable data on the financial situation of the project. Based on an analysis of the project performance in relation to the project output(s) and expected outcome(s), a revision of the project work plan may be suggested by the project partners. The consequences of a possible revision on the project work plan and budget must be made clear in the annual report.
Nuffic monitors outputs and outcomes and not activities. Therefore, the main focus of the annual report must be on the achievement of the project&#x2019;s output(s) and planned outcome(s). The information provided in the annual reports of the projects is used by Nuffic to monitor the progress of the project and to inform the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and other stakeholders about the output(s) and outcome(s) being achieved by individual projects and the Orange Knowledge programme as a whole. 
Please note that if project progress is in accordance with the original planning, reporting requirements are minimal. Only in case of deviations from the planning, more elaboration is demanded.
In the Grant Obligations and Conditions, the obligatory dates for submission of the annual/additional reports are mentioned. The final report must reflect on the entire project period.</narrative>

     <actual value="Due to Covid-19 pandemic quiet a lot of adjustment and re-planning has been necessary in the realization of the project. The first TMT of the project was supposed to be a face to face training, but due to COVID-19 restriction the course is redeveloped (by adapting the step 1 and 2 of the project) to an 8 weeks online course with 8 hours of work load every week to let participants follow the course parallel to their work. Also there have been some adjustment in the budget to offer good internet connection and IT facilities to participants. This change also offered the opportunity to use more experts in different topics to share their knowledge with participants.  

With the very high motivation and commitment of participants and project leader from requesting organization we were able to conclude the first TMT successfully. This TMT was also evaluated very positively by participants. Throughout this first TMT participants used an individual professional portfolio development plan to identify their learning goals and desired impacts after the completion of the project.  

Now we are working on next phases of the project out of 19 participants (11 Female and 8 Male from 10 different public organizations) in the first TMT, based on the above-mentioned portfolio 10 participants are chosen to be trained as trainers in 3 partially different tracks, at the moment this ToT is planned in the face to face scheme in 2021, however there exist a fall back plan to move most of the training online. One to one online discussions are scheduled for the partisans of this training."></actual>
