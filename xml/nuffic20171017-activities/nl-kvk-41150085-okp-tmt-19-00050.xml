    <narrative xml:lang="EN">Reporting is an important management tool which is used to inform relevant government officials and other stakeholders about the results being achieved by individual projects and the programme as a whole. 
For project partners, it is compulsory to use the prescribed Orange Knowledge annual report format in order to report on project achievements. The annual report also provides valuable data on the financial situation of the project. Based on an analysis of the project performance in relation to the project output(s) and expected outcome(s), a revision of the project work plan may be suggested by the project partners. The consequences of a possible revision on the project work plan and budget must be made clear in the annual report.
Nuffic monitors outputs and outcomes and not activities. Therefore, the main focus of the annual report must be on the achievement of the project&#x2019;s output(s) and planned outcome(s). The information provided in the annual reports of the projects is used by Nuffic to monitor the progress of the project and to inform the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and other stakeholders about the output(s) and outcome(s) being achieved by individual projects and the Orange Knowledge programme as a whole. 
Please note that if project progress is in accordance with the original planning, reporting requirements are minimal. Only in case of deviations from the planning, more elaboration is demanded.
In the Grant Obligations and Conditions, the obligatory dates for submission of the annual/additional reports are mentioned. The final report must reflect on the entire project period.</narrative>

     <actual value="During the scoping mission the role of men and women in  farming was discussed during field visits with participating  organisations. Some of the organizations actively involve  women as part of their implementing activities. Traditionally,  the role of women is limited to farming tasks such as Narrative report - Tailor-Made Training - Orange Knowledge Programme Page 8 of 10 transplanting and post-processing of harvest in packhouses.  Farmer cooperatives are mainly dominated by men, also in  terms of land-holding. The training incorporated several  female farmers to show that farming practices need not be  only men-dominated practices. During the training week, special attention was given to women to share their  knowledge and experience: both during theoretical sessions  as well as during the practical field visits. This strengthened the  position of women and raised awareness among the male  farmers of the readily and well-developed knowledge  available with female farmers. The number of female extension staff employed at the  participating organizations and governmental bodies is  limited or even negligible. Both within Meki Batu Union, as well  as in the targeted woreda and kebele agricultural offices, no  women are active in horticultural extension service provision.  When asking, the participants indicated that this is likely to  change in the near future, since an increasing number of  female development agents (DAs) graduate nowadays from  regional TVET colleges and are to enter extension office  positions."></actual>

Especially, the  practical field training components were highly valued. Multiple  participants stressed the importance of the training for raising  awareness on the excessive water use within the Basin and the  impact continuing these practices will have on the future  existence of lake Ziway. This is not only important for current  generation, but even more for future generations. Even though  majority of the participants were born in the training area, they  did not know and realize the insights shared on the Basin in  Balance module. Participants stressed that the learnings will be passed on to  farmers as well as colleagues who are also involved in the  provision of extension services.
