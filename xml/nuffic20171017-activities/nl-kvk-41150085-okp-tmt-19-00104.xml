For project partners, it is compulsory to use the prescribed Orange Knowledge annual report format in order to report on project achievements. The annual report also provides valuable data on the financial situation of the project. Based on an analysis of the project performance in relation to the project output(s) and expected outcome(s), a revision of the project work plan may be suggested by the project partners. The consequences of a possible revision on the project work plan and budget must be made clear in the annual report.
Nuffic monitors outputs and outcomes and not activities . Therefore, the main focus of the annual report must be on the achievement of the project&#x2019;s output(s) and planned outcome(s). The information provided in the annual reports of the projects is used by Nuffic to monitor the progress of the project and to inform the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and other stakeholders about the output(s) and outcome(s) being achieved by individual projects and the Orange Knowledge programme as a whole. 
Please note that if project progress is in accordance with the original planning, reporting requirements are minimal. Only in case of deviations from the planning, more elaboration is demanded.
In the grant award letter, the dates for submission of the annual reports are mentioned. In case of a three-year project, between 5-7 reports are obligatory.
The first report (0) is a very short report which focuses on specific conditions and/or recommendations in the grant. There is no need to report on progress in achieving outputs and outcomes, which is done in the first annual report.

     <actual value="The RO expressed the need to gain experience in providing awareness related to the sexual and reproductive health issues (values, rights, culture and sexuality, understanding gender, violence and staying safe, human body and development, sexuality and sexual behaviour, sexual and reproductive health among the children&#x2019;s and adolescents aged 8-19 years as talking about sex and sexuality is a taboos in the villages of Nepal due to strict adherence to the culture and tradition. This they wanted to achieve through the &#x201C;development of a comprehensive sexuality education program for children and adolescent, that can be delivered by nurses and paramedics to the school-aged children.&#x201D;

As was stated, the program was designed with the themes: the friendship and love, puberty, the reproductive system, gender and sex, human rights sexual behavior, family planning and violence.

The program was co-designed by the nurses, who will now go on to run the program and train future trainers.

The nurses, and future trainers, also received training on interactive teaching methods and on talking about sexuality. Unfortunately, practical implementation in the schools was only possible in a very limited extend, and without observation of the Dutch team. The RO has however remained in conversation with schools with the full intention to continue full implementation when that becomes possible."></actual>

     <actual value="1. A situational analysis (incl. stakeholder involvement) on CSE is conducted.

This output was reached during the first activity. A comprehensive needs analysis were done and stakeholder involvement and buy-in was a key part. Good support was gathered for the initiative and schools were identified where the program can be rolled out.

1. A comprehensive sexuality education (CSE) program is developed as an effort between the Requesting organization and the consortium. And is locally sensitive and supported by the relevant stakeholders.

This output was for the most part successfully reached. The program was developed in a collaborative setting, the RO are in possession of the completed materials and as has been discussed, relevant buy in and support was secured from the start of the project. Following the initial three visits to Dhulikhel the process went online. All themes agreed on were covered, complete with training materials and guide.

1. Staff of the Dept of Community Programs is trained in giving CSE to school-ages children and on training others (via ToT). This includes interactive teaching methods and communication skills

Uncertain. Only Dhulikhel staff was trained as Covid related delays prevented roll out as well as the (intended) inclusion of other stakeholders. Local nurses were unable to participate online due to their work in hard to reach areas in Nepal. We do however expect them to learn from the Dhulikhel staff, once the sexuality education program is rolled out."></actual>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">04-01-2022: The challenges around SRHR are ongoing in Nepal and Dhukikhel. The skills acquired towards making learning on the topic accessible have been expressly highlighted by the participants as valuable in their interaction with colleague&apos;s and community partners. The acquired knowledge was directly applied in the pilot sessions in two schools. Further application of skills and knowledge will continue once the outreach department can visit the schools and communities again.</narrative>

It is however planned for the final developed product, a comprehensive sexual education programme, to be implemented and passed on to schools in the region. Those schools will indirectly benefit from the TMT. During the project we only had the opportunity to pilot the new sessions in two schools, in a time of relaxed Covid-restrictions. This was unfortunately quickly followed by new imposed restrictions and therefore piloting was discontinued.</narrative>
