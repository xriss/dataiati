    <narrative xml:lang="EN">Reporting is an important management tool which is used to inform relevant government officials and other stakeholders about the results being achieved by individual projects and the programme as a whole. 
For project partners, it is compulsory to use the prescribed Orange Knowledge annual report format in order to report on project achievements. The annual report also provides valuable data on the financial situation of the project. Based on an analysis of the project performance in relation to the project output(s) and expected outcome(s), a revision of the project work plan may be suggested by the project partners. The consequences of a possible revision on the project work plan and budget must be made clear in the annual report.
Nuffic monitors outputs and outcomes and not activities . Therefore, the main focus of the annual report must be on the achievement of the project&#x2019;s output(s) and planned outcome(s). The information provided in the annual reports of the projects is used by Nuffic to monitor the progress of the project and to inform the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and other stakeholders about the output(s) and outcome(s) being achieved by individual projects and the Orange Knowledge programme as a whole. 
Please note that if project progress is in accordance with the original planning, reporting requirements are minimal. Only in case of deviations from the planning, more elaboration is demanded.
In the grant award letter, the dates for submission of the annual reports are mentioned. In case of a three-year project, between 5-7 reports are obligatory.
The first report (0) is a very short report which focuses on specific conditions and/or recommendations in the grant. There is no need to report on progress in achieving outputs and outcomes, which is done in the first annual report. As annex to the report 0, the consortium agreements between the partners should be submitted.
The final report must reflect on the entire project period.</narrative>

     <actual value="**- 15 persons   are trained to train other farmers ** 

**- 3 formal collaborations with processors are established - This milestone has been reached as COFIA is now in formal agreement with outgrowers (one collective) and two offtakers for the processed maize flour (posho)**

**-Delphy is still present in Uganda - Delphy is still present in Uganda and expanding its operations**

**-FACOM has increased the number of Maize and Cassava   farms that are managed in the sustainable way.**

**Approximately 200 acres of cassava are now under improved sustainable agricultural practises in Wobulenzi Region and we estimate that a total of 1,000 acres under improved practises in Tororo Region shall be reached by the end of 2022**

     

**- 15 participants   receive certificate of completion   (9 females and 6 males) - we reached the objectives and 15 partipants (10 females and 5 males) completed the TMT **

**- 90% of participants are satisfied - participants acknowledged the importance of this training and how it contributes to building their capacity and knowledge. They gained much confidence to provide their extension services in an improved way. **

  - at least 70% of the participants are able to replicate the trainings to other farmers - the farmers all received practical training on presentation and public speaking skills. Every training day the trainees presented their works to each other either in a group or indvidual setting. By building their capacity in this practical manner the trainees confirmed that they are now much more comfortable to share knowledge without fearing to make errors. 

- new positions are immediately dedicated to women and disabled people, for now we have not managed to secure postions for disabled people but we will find a way to do so once the processing factory is expanded. The infrastructure needs to be adjusted to allow easier acces for disabled people.

- developing training modules to scale up this training to other farmers - Cofia, Delphy and Facom have to wish to roll out a local gap certification system for the outgrowers. In a way this will also result in a seperate training module that shall be developed to guide the outgrowers to ensure that they adhere to the gap guidelines. By having this system in place we strive to improve customer trust but also bargaining power. 

--Economic performance and resilience of farming systems improved. - It is still too early to to evaluate this.

-Water efficiency in agriculture improved, the irrigation system at the demo farm is currently under repair. The trainees shall use input from the training modules as guidance to get the system back to work.
