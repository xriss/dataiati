   <description>
    <narrative xml:lang="FR">Reporting is an important management tool which is used to inform relevant government officials and other stakeholders about the results being achieved by individual projects and the programme as a whole. 
For project partners, it is compulsory to use the prescribed Orange Knowledge annual report format in order to report on project achievements. The annual report also provides valuable data on the financial situation of the project. Based on an analysis of the project performance in relation to the project output(s) and expected outcome(s), a revision of the project work plan may be suggested by the project partners. The consequences of a possible revision on the project work plan and budget must be made clear in the annual report.
Nuffic monitors outputs and outcomes and not activities . Therefore, the main focus of the annual report must be on the achievement of the project&#x2019;s output(s) and planned outcome(s). The information provided in the annual reports of the projects is used by Nuffic to monitor the progress of the project and to inform the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and other stakeholders about the output(s) and outcome(s) being achieved by individual projects and the Orange Knowledge programme as a whole. 
Please note that if project progress is in accordance with the original planning, reporting requirements are minimal. Only in case of deviations from the planning, more elaboration is demanded.
In the grant award letter, the dates for submission of the annual reports are mentioned. In case of a three-year project, between 5-7 reports are obligatory.
The first report (0) is a very short report which focuses on specific conditions and/or recommendations in the grant. There is no need to report on progress in achieving outputs and outcomes, which is done in the first annual report. As annex to the report 0, the consortium agreements between the partners should be submitted.
The final report must reflect on the entire project period.</narrative>

     <actual value="After the training stopped in March 2020, everyone enthusiastically picked up the training again after eight months. The overall attendance in the training was 98%. All participants were very motivated and the two participants who, for various reasons, were not able to continue in the last period found this very regrettable. All components mentioned in the training application were trained. The dance technical training , improvisation techniques, hip-hop  and acting and presentation skills created knowledge for all participants to build on. The SRHR training was conducted by a local person with great satisfaction of the participants and the management of Jiriladon. Although less focused on international discussion techniques, the personal and local context approach of the Malian trainer was highly effective and creates a lot of insight and awareness around communication and sexuality. The management training could be conducted online with national and international cultural management specialists. In addition, a short training on communication was also carried out on request, especially how to effectively use Facebook and Instagram to market the compagnie and her activities. Although the training was created for Jiriladon, some of the street dancers were also connected to Pas &#xE0; Pas, an artistic intitative by the partner of Fatoumata Bagayoko and co-member of the artistic direction of Jiriladon. Both initiatives work together or separate, depending on the kind of projects but all were participants in the training. 

The skills that have been transferred require more training and experience but offer sufficient tools for the group to continue. It is up to the management of Jiriladon to take the next step, where dependence on subsidies is always a vulnerable factor. For that reason, contact was also made with a cultural management trainer from IKAM in S&#xE9;gou, an institute that also manages a fund. It is relevant for the group to strengthen its network, international but especially national. Through the training, Jiriladon has also come into contact with the SRHR initiatives of the Dutch Embassy.

A strong performance has been developed in which themes such as traditional harmful practices and unwanted sexual behaviour are unequivocally discussed. This offers Jiriladon the opportunity to develop more broadly as an art in context group, using the performance(s) to spark discussions within local communities."></actual>

     <actual value="After an initial two-week intensive module, which also uncovered mental issues, it was difficult to restart the project. At the same time there was enough time for reflection during 8 months of interruption. When we started again we decided to take 5 days more to restart where we left 8 months before, and to have enough time for all different outputs to reach.  As the counselling part in discussion techniques to talk with youngsters about sexuality was less developed due to a change of trainer, we can mention that this output is less succeeded. All the other outputs have been realized. The creation of a performance was a plus and added strongly to awareness and the output of learning how to express sensitive issues in a theatrical form. In thinking about ideas the group brought forward that family is important but also problematic in the development of each participant. They saw each other in the training more as a family with shared dreams and progressive tendencies then their genuine family. For the team of trainers it was therefore interesting to shift the focus to the family and to investigate to what extent and in what way family and upbringing are obstacles to free development, especially in the sphere of gender investigation, gender safety and development of identity. It was therefore decided to create the performance around the theme of family. Sharing the stories with each other made the group more aware about themselves, about others and how to deal with each other. Besides the development of technical skills to express these issues, the awareness and analyses of education in a broader sense and the effect of it on each of the participants and the support and recognition by others is perhaps the biggest achievement in the process of the training."></actual>

       <narrative xml:lang="FR">03-05-2021: All of the participants have gained new knowledge through the offered skills. Although some had some experience with contemporary dance techniques, most of the skills and principles of learning were new. None but one had any experience in acting presentation techniques; on stage but in fact also in daily life. Most of the training can be regarded apart from the technical aspects as a form of life skills: working together for a common goal (performance), making choices and explaining and analysing why you make these choices. And on the other hand learning to ask questions and to stimulate active listening Matters that were all relevant in the context of this training. The SRHR training part confronted all participants with the taboos and harmful practises around sexuality in their cultural environment.</narrative>

For Jiriladon and affiliate compagnie Pas &#xE0; Pas gender has definitely become a strong focus of attention. The training has supported Jiriladon in her efforts to give young females a change to develop and to become more aware of their strengths and to become more assertive.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="FR">03-05-2021: The training in SRHR and Dance and theatre technical training was well received. The highest score went to the creation of a performance where societal constraints in SRHR topics and technical development came together.  The lowest score concerned the element of didactics by trainers. This had  solemnly to do with a young trainer from Benin who was asked to step in  due to illness of the teamleader and had the difficult task to manage the nervous final edit of the performance. This demands overview and encouragement and a lot of experience . Besides, for a young African female trainer authority amongs peers comes less easily compared to the elder and  more experienced Dutch trainers in this situation.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="FR">03-05-2021: The training started with 16 persons in SRHR and technical dance and theatre training in March 2020.  Due to COVID 19 the training has been suspended for 8 months after a first two weeks intensive. In November one male dancer and medical student was obliged to help in a hospital due to COVID-19 and one female dancer already had a contract with another compagnie from 1th of January.  So two people did not graduate. The management training in the Netherlands for one person was changed into an online training which offered the possibility for more people to join. In the end 4 people followed the entrepreneur training in February 2021of which 2 had taken part in the SRHR and technical training.</narrative>

     <actual value="The professionalism of the performing arts in Mali is largely determined by the presence of a conservatory for dance and music. This institution suffers from a chronic lack of resources and classes are often cancelled due to strikes. Motivation and discipline are not strongly developed and there are few initiatives and little knowledge to express social themes through dance and theatre. Compagnie Jiriladon is one of the exceptions and its company consisted in the training of 50% artists who had passed the conservatory and 50% self-taught who had learned dance in the street and could train here and there with existing grass-roots initiatives. All trainers experienced little difference in quality between the group from the street and the conservatory. The street group was actually more motivated, more disciplined and more open to innovation than the group that had gone through the academic conservatory. During the course of the training, both groups grew more towards each other. More knowledge about the professionalism of the profession emerged; through analysis and perception they gained a better understanding of the demands of the profession, there was strong technical progress in everyone and each participant became more aware of the functioning and expression of their own body. Theatre training made them more aware of presenting themselves and with more security and trust to be on the stage and to tell a story.

Recurring theme that required attention in the training was collaboration. Growing up in a low trust society, there is a tendency for all participants to profile themselves at the expense of others. Often it seemed like there were 17 trainers running around correcting others , unhindered by the lack of knowledge on the subject. Strong competition within the domain of the performing arts did not make it easier. 

Positive attitude, constructive criticism was a slow and difficult process of change. Especially in working towards a joint performance this was a recurring problem for all trainers. The lack of strong leadership from the artistic director in the training also made this more difficult.   Through various game techniques to listen and to perceive and not immediately judge, the general attitude did improve. Presenting the performance at different venues had a positive effect on their mutual necessity of collaboration."></actual>
