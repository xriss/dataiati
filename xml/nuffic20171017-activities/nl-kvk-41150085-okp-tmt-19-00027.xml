    <narrative xml:lang="EN">Reporting is an important management tool which is used to inform relevant government officials and other stakeholders about the results being achieved by individual projects and the programme as a whole. 
For project partners, it is compulsory to use the prescribed Orange Knowledge annual report format in order to report on project achievements. The annual report also provides valuable data on the financial situation of the project. Based on an analysis of the project performance in relation to the project output(s) and expected outcome(s), a revision of the project work plan may be suggested by the project partners. The consequences of a possible revision on the project work plan and budget must be made clear in the annual report.
Nuffic monitors outputs and outcomes and not activities. Therefore, the main focus of the annual report must be on the achievement of the project&#x2019;s output(s) and planned outcome(s). The information provided in the annual reports of the projects is used by Nuffic to monitor the progress of the project and to inform the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and other stakeholders about the output(s) and outcome(s) being achieved by individual projects and the Orange Knowledge programme as a whole. 
Please note that if project progress is in accordance with the original planning, reporting requirements are minimal. Only in case of deviations from the planning, more elaboration is demanded.
In the Grant Obligations and Conditions, the obligatory dates for submission of the annual/additional reports are mentioned. The final report must reflect on the entire project period.</narrative>

     <actual value="A cross section of extension workers active in the NRDC working area participated in the TMT. Age varied from 29 to 52. This &#x201C;mixture&#x201D; of participants lead to good discussions and team work. During the training it became quickly clear that every topic and the approach used to transfer knowledge and skills were &#x201C;eye openers&#x201D; to all participants. For most it was also a good experience to work in teams comprising of men and women of different ages on assignments and exchanging experiences. A lot of ideas were developed on ways and means to improve the performance on the farms in their working area. In the time period between the main course and the assessment week the Aeres Coordinator received many pictures of participants working on assignments on farms in their working area. The teacher training component was also very new to most of the participants and a very good experience.

During the Modules on agricultural value chain analysis and development, covering all of the identified knowledge and skill gaps identified in the original TMT Proposal, students were made aware of the concept of agricultural value chains. They are able to describe and analyse existing value chains, the role of actors, service providers, administration(s) and policies (local, national and international). They are able to link these issues to their own situation. Attention was also given to quality control in the Value Chains. Participants are enthusiastic about the Value Chain concept, however, they understand that small holder farmer can only participate successfully in value chains if they have the basic knowledge and skills to run their farm as a business. During the TMT the principles of farm economics, management and entrepreneurship were explained and exercised. Use of key performance indicators for assessing/ analysing the technical and financial performance were explained and used in various, initial theoretical, exercises. Various categories of farmers were visited (small scale, emerging farmers, commercial farmers, male as well as female farmers) and students were assigned to analyse the technical as well as financial performance of these farms in groups and develop plans for improvement of the technical as well as the financial performance based on their observations and information collected from the farmers during the visits. Also gender related issues were included in the assignment. Each group was assigned a specific farm for their assignment and present their findings and recommendations. Also attention was given to various technical topics. In the last Module attention was given to &#x201C;Training of Trainers&#x201D; topics. Principles of competence based learning, developing short training programs for farmers/farm workers (in his/her area of expertise), developing a lesson plan (one training session) and implementation of the lesson plan developed. At the end of week 3 student were given the assignment to develop a short farmer training program in a step wise approach (in groups) which was monitored by Aeres. In week 4 feedback was provided to the work done and individual training performance assessed.

During the evaluation of the Course almost all participants acknowledged that they had learned a lot and that their way of training of emerging young commercial farmers would change and improve a lot."></actual>
