    <narrative xml:lang="EN">Reporting is an important management tool which is used to inform relevant government officials and other stakeholders about the results being achieved by individual projects and the programme as a whole. 
For project partners, it is compulsory to use the prescribed Orange Knowledge annual report format in order to report on project achievements. The annual report also provides valuable data on the financial situation of the project. Based on an analysis of the project performance in relation to the project output(s) and expected outcome(s), a revision of the project work plan may be suggested by the project partners. The consequences of a possible revision on the project work plan and budget must be made clear in the annual report.
Nuffic monitors outputs and outcomes and not activities. Therefore, the main focus of the annual report must be on the achievement of the project&#x2019;s output(s) and planned outcome(s). The information provided in the annual reports of the projects is used by Nuffic to monitor the progress of the project and to inform the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and other stakeholders about the output(s) and outcome(s) being achieved by individual projects and the Orange Knowledge programme as a whole. 
Please note that if project progress is in accordance with the original planning, reporting requirements are minimal. Only in case of deviations from the planning, more elaboration is demanded.
In the Grant Obligations and Conditions, the obligatory dates for submission of the annual/additional reports are mentioned. The final report must reflect on the entire project period.</narrative>

     <actual value="_Stakeholder engagement_

Following the project strategy, the Consortium engaged first with potential employers of graduates from JUST and performed a ++Labour Market Assessment++ to understand the demand of the agricultural sector in which JUST graduates would be seeking a job. COVID-19 slowed down the engagement process and affected the gathering of stakeholders. Two face-to-face meetings could be held with selected stakeholders; however, the main data collection had to be done through online meetings and online interviews.

After engaging with external stakeholders, the Consortium presented the findings to JUST staff and jointly identified training their training needs. This was done during a face-to -face session on 21 June at JUST University between consortium representatives of Advance Consulting and Luminus and JUST University representatives. Specifically training on pedagogical skills (such as virtual teaching) and training on engagement skills with the private sector were seen as areas where staff upskilling could take place.

_Training delivery_

++Making blended training work ++

4 staff members participated in an iCRA online course and were trained on:

&#xB7; Making the perfect blend: mixing online and face-to-face group training, combining synchronous and asynchronous online learning

&#xB7; Motivating &amp; engaging trainees both online and face-to-face

&#xB7; Linking learning to real-life situations

&#xB7; Using tools for interactive and practical learning 

++Training on engagement skills ++

4 staff members were trained on building relationships:

&#xB7; Network mapping and strengthening relationships with the private sector

&#xB7; Building trust with stakeholders, specifically listening skills, creating connections, and finding common ground

++Training on entrepreneurship++

8 staff members were familiarized with the theory and practice of entrepreneurship and small business management:

&#xB7; Introduction to Entrepreneurship

&#xB7; Theories of New Venture Creation

&#xB7; Screening the Business Opportunity

&#xB7; Creating Customers

&#xB7; The Process of Planning and Strategy in the Small Firm"></actual>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">08-11-2021: &#x201C;The training course has provided us with very clear and
                easy to follow steps into making blended training a success. It was not regular
                training; it was like we got a personal trainer. Learning about the motivation start
                and the learning in steps facilitated positive learning outcomes. This training
                course helped us in embedding education in real life, offering teaching that goes
                beyond classroom walls that keeps students engaged and eager to learn. The training
                was eye-opening to the methods that can be applied in a blended course easily and
                applicable to the fields in agriculture and life sciences.&#x201D; &#x2013; Quotation

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">08-11-2021: &#x201C;The training course has provided us with very clear and easy to follow steps into making blended training a success. It was not regular training; it was like we got a personal trainer. Learning about the motivation start and the learning in steps facilitated positive learning outcomes. This training course helped us in embedding education in real life, offering teaching that goes beyond classroom walls that keeps students engaged and eager to learn. The training was eye-opening to the methods that can be applied in a blended course easily and applicable to the fields in agriculture and life sciences.&#x201D; &#x2013; Quotation from JUST staff</narrative>
