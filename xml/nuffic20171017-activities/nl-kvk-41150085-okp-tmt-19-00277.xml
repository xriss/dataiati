    <narrative xml:lang="EN">Reporting is an important management tool which is used to inform relevant government officials and other stakeholders about the results being achieved by individual projects and the programme as a whole. 
For project partners, it is compulsory to use the prescribed Orange Knowledge annual report format in order to report on project achievements. The annual report also provides valuable data on the financial situation of the project. Based on an analysis of the project performance in relation to the project output(s) and expected outcome(s), a revision of the project work plan may be suggested by the project partners. The consequences of a possible revision on the project work plan and budget must be made clear in the annual report.
Nuffic monitors outputs and outcomes and not activities . Therefore, the main focus of the annual report must be on the achievement of the project&#x2019;s output(s) and planned outcome(s). The information provided in the annual reports of the projects is used by Nuffic to monitor the progress of the project and to inform the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and other stakeholders about the output(s) and outcome(s) being achieved by individual projects and the Orange Knowledge programme as a whole. 
Please note that if project progress is in accordance with the original planning, reporting requirements are minimal. Only in case of deviations from the planning, more elaboration is demanded.
In the grant award letter, the dates for submission of the annual reports are mentioned. In case of a three-year project, between 5-7 reports are obligatory.
The first report (0) is a very short report which focuses on specific conditions and/or recommendations in the grant. There is no need to report on progress in achieving outputs and outcomes, which is done in the first annual report. As annex to the report 0, the consortium agreements between the partners should be submitted.
The final report must reflect on the entire project period.</narrative>

     <actual value="Given the degree of stated &amp; additional outputs achieved (95%) on the one hand, and the feedback from the requesting organisation on the impact of the project to their organisational activities/ objectives, we can conclude that is TMT project was highly beneficial to Gusoor. In fact the organisation was very satisfied and mentioned that it was one of the kind capacity building trajectory they have received since the organisation was established. We have fully achieved the project objectives and additional project results which were not defined in the proposal (training on project management and financial sustainability). Therefore, we can conclude that the project was very successful and our collaboration will continue in the future. 

As for the lessons learned, we have faced significant challenges in planning and execution of the project due to COVID-19 and deteriorating security situation in Yemen. In this regard, we have learned to act more adequately and consult earlier with the requesting organisation to discuss and agree on less ambitious alternatives. We are very thankful to Nuffic for having received extra time to implement the project. Without extra time and involvement of local expertise, it wouldn&apos;t be possible to implement this project properly.

     <actual value="**Output 1:** understanding peace building concepts, mechanisms, theory and practice
**Output 2: **understanding in both theoretical and operational aspects of conflict prevention and peace building
**Output 3:** skills in developing and implementing monitoring and evaluation plans for peace building programmes and projects
**Output 4:** knowledge and skills on analysing and developing public policy papers
**Output 5:** knowledge and skills on lobbying, networking and communication methods and tools

To achieve output 1-5 we have organised training on peace building and conflict resolution.  The workshop was implemented for 5 training days with an average of 8 training hours per day from 14-17 February 2021, with the aim of strengthening the team&apos;s capabilities on conflict management and resolution, peace building and local mechanisms of intervention, in addition to strengthening the strategy of mobilisation, advocacy and social justice. The important milestone achieved was the fact that the alumni have developed interventions on local governance and community level to raise awareness and empower community members to promote peace building and resolve/ prevent conflicts. ++Based on the post-test evaluation we can state with confident that these outputs have been achieved with 95%.++ Please see appendix 1 (training report).

++**Additional outputs**++

**Output 6: **improved knowledge and skills in Strategic Planning
The needs assessment has revealed that Gusoor was in dire need to develop and implement a sustainable strategic plan to work more efficiently and effectively to achieve it&apos;s long- and short- term goals. Therefore, a 5 days training and on-job coaching was organised to enable the alumni develop and implement a 3 years strategic plan. Based on the midterm evaluation we can conclude that this output has been achieved fully. Please see appendix for more details (training report).

**Output 7: **Improved knowledge and skills in Project Management for the Development Sector
As a project based NGO, Gusoor was facing great challenges to manage their projects in the context of a conflict setting. Therefore, a 5 days training on Project Management for the Development Sector was organised in Ca&#xEF;ro, Egypt. The post-test evaluations shows that this was a very much needed training and has enabled the alumni to work more effectively on the projects at Gusoor. It has enabled them to apply new approaches, methods, innovative tools and to work more efficiently as a team. A side effect, this training has also revealed many internal issues on managerial level/ organisational structure at Gusoor. We can state with full confident that this was a very useful training to Gusoor staff and we have achieved this output with 100%

**Output 8:** Improved knowledge and skills in Financial Sustainability
Based on the needs assessment output we have developed and implemented a 5 days local training on financial sustainability to enable Gusoor sustain it&apos;s financial situation more carefully. The post-evaluations shows that this was also a very useful training for the alumni. We can conclude that this output has been achieved with 95%. Please see appendix for more details (training report).
