  </title>
  <description akvo:type="5" type="1" xmlns:akvo="http://akvo.org/iati-activities">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Agriculture has been identified as one of the key sectors in OKP&apos;s Country Implementation Plan for Mozambique. The aim is to increase food and nutrition security, sustainable production and improving community access to land, inputs, services and markets, with a focus on value chain development. The Zambezi Valley Development Agency (Agencia) Mozambique is requesting training in nutrition sensitive value chains to gain knowledge and skills to integrate food and nutrition security objectives in the existing agriculture value chain development programmes in the Zambezi Valley region (Tete, Manica, Sofala and Zamb&#xE9;zia). This knowledge will be imparted by KIT in to staff of agricutlure devleopment organisations  partnering with the Agencia.  It will help them identify interventions to reduce food and nutrient losses, improve food safety an enhance nutrition value of the fresh produce as well as processed products thereby not only improving economic returns but also making essential nutrition available to low income consumers including producer households in the region.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The TMT will be spread out over a one year period covering three specific events with a 3 month gap between each event to allow participants to apply their learning in their own programmes. The three training events are as follows: 

++**Training Event 1:**++** **++**Introduction to Nutrition Sensitive Value Chains-6days**++** **

Day 1: Conceptual framework - What is a nutrition-sensitive approach? How is it different from traditional value chain analysis? Using a nutrition lens: linking nutrition problems to food supply and demand; Strategies and entry points to make value chains nutrition-sensitive and how they contribute to nutrition outcomes; Impact pathways and target groups/ mediators of impact of NSVCs

Day 2: Nutrition situation analysis -Prevalence and causes of malnutrition; Diet characterisation and identification of diet problems and gaps; Collecting data- secondary data.

Day 3: Fieldwork to carry out community mapping of nutrition problems in targeted community &#x2013; primary data 

Day 4: Commodity selection: Nutrition improvement potential of different local commodities, Market potential, Income generation potential, Gender, environment and climate issues; Data collection methods 

Day 5: Fieldwork to identify commodities that can address identified nutrition problems: Food consumption, seasonality, food preferences, food composition, Market demand, private sector interest, Smallholder engagement, margins.

Day 6: Process of selecting commodities with due consideration of context-specific issues, opportunities for diversification and complementarity with existing dietary patterns.

++**Training Event 2: Nutrition Sensitive Value Chains Analysis &#x2013; 6 days**++

Day 1: Value chain mapping

-Characterisation of selected commodity value chains; Structure and functions, Value chain actors, relationships; Business models; Enabling environment, gender 

-Opportunities for value chain upgrading- functional, product and process , coordination, business model upgrading

-Analysis of constraints and opportunities in: Supply, Demand (market and consumption), Nutrition Value

-Data collection methods

Day 2 and Day 3: Field exercise to undertake value chain analysis using a nutrition lens to identify constraints in supply, demand and nutrition value in relation to:  pre-production,  production, post harvest handling and storage, processing, transportation, trading and marketing, promotion and consumption

Day 4: Data Analysis and Identifying intervention options: Types of interventions, cost-effectiveness, Tensions and trade-offs, Targeting strategy

Day 5: From a single value chain to a food system approach - recap and Consolidation of concepts, intervention strategy, targeting strategy, implementation arrangements, indicators for monitoring impact.

Day 6: Participants make action plans for applying learning in ZVDA programmes and designing learning modules for field functionaries.

**Training Event 3: Reflection Workshop &#x2013; 3 days**

Day 1: Presentation and self-evaluation of individual action plans to apply learning in project implementation and/or training modules &#x2013; progress, challenges, lessons &#x2013; facilitating peer learning and evaluation

Day 2: Presentation of ZVDA project implementation plans and plans of institutes of higher education to incorporate NSVC in routing programmes; Identifying and addressing knowledge and skill gaps.

Day 3: Continuing the learning process; how to disseminate learning to increase capacity within the region; Final evaluation of TMT.</narrative>

  <description akvo:type="9" type="1" xmlns:akvo="http://akvo.org/iati-activities">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">ZVDA acknowledges that the following shortcomings as the baseline situation with respect to the capacity of  program staff implementing FNSp rograms: 

- lack of knowledge regarding basic principles of nutrition, how to reduce malnutrition and other nutrition problems and the agriculture pathways to improve nutrition outcom, 
- limited experience and exposure to nutrition-sensitive agriculture interventions and their integration in agriculture development programmes, 
- poor understanding of intra-household gender relations and decision-making to develop behavioural change strategies; 
- lack of skills to engage multi-sectoral actors and stakeholders; 
- poor knowledge about how to improve food safety and reduce food losses across the value chain; 
- lack of capacity of the educational institutions and programmes to train manpower in accordance with national policies to tackle problems of malnutrition through agriculture development.</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">Reporting is an important management tool which is used to inform relevant government officials and other stakeholders about the results being achieved by individual projects and the programme as a whole. 
For project partners, it is compulsory to use the prescribed Orange Knowledge annual report format in order to report on project achievements. The annual report also provides valuable data on the financial situation of the project. Based on an analysis of the project performance in relation to the project output(s) and expected outcome(s), a revision of the project work plan may be suggested by the project partners. The consequences of a possible revision on the project work plan and budget must be made clear in the annual report.
Nuffic monitors outputs and outcomes and not activities . Therefore, the main focus of the annual report must be on the achievement of the project&#x2019;s output(s) and planned outcome(s). The information provided in the annual reports of the projects is used by Nuffic to monitor the progress of the project and to inform the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and other stakeholders about the output(s) and outcome(s) being achieved by individual projects and the Orange Knowledge programme as a whole. 
Please note that if project progress is in accordance with the original planning, reporting requirements are minimal. Only in case of deviations from the planning, more elaboration is demanded.
In the grant award letter, the dates for submission of the annual reports are mentioned. In case of a three-year project, between 5-7 reports are obligatory.
The first report (0) is a very short report which focuses on specific conditions and/or recommendations in the grant. There is no need to report on progress in achieving outputs and outcomes, which is done in the first annual report. As annex to the report 0, the consortium agreements between the partners should be submitted.
The final report must reflect on the entire project period.</narrative>

Reflect on how the training has contributed to addressing the capacity needs as described by the requesting organisation in the proposal form. How effective and efficient has the TMT+ been in reaching the desired objectives? Please formulate lessons learned and recommendations for the post-project period.

In your email submitting the final report, the partners will enclose: 
 - an inventory of equipment purchased 
 - a document signed by the (Lead partner) Dutch consortium/provider and Lead partner consortium country A or requesting organisation on the transfer of ownership
 - a list with the names and email addresses of staff members who participated in staff training for their registration in the Holland Alumni Network database</narrative>
