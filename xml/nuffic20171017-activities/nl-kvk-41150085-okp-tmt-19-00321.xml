    <narrative xml:lang="EN">Reporting is an important management tool which is used to inform relevant government officials and other stakeholders about the results being achieved by individual projects and the programme as a whole. 
For project partners, it is compulsory to use the prescribed Orange Knowledge annual report format in order to report on project achievements. The annual report also provides valuable data on the financial situation of the project. Based on an analysis of the project performance in relation to the project output(s) and expected outcome(s), a revision of the project work plan may be suggested by the project partners. The consequences of a possible revision on the project work plan and budget must be made clear in the annual report.
Nuffic monitors outputs and outcomes and not activities . Therefore, the main focus of the annual report must be on the achievement of the project&#x2019;s output(s) and planned outcome(s). The information provided in the annual reports of the projects is used by Nuffic to monitor the progress of the project and to inform the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and other stakeholders about the output(s) and outcome(s) being achieved by individual projects and the Orange Knowledge programme as a whole. 
Please note that if project progress is in accordance with the original planning, reporting requirements are minimal. Only in case of deviations from the planning, more elaboration is demanded.
In the grant award letter, the dates for submission of the annual reports are mentioned. In case of a three-year project, between 5-7 reports are obligatory.
The first report (0) is a very short report which focuses on specific conditions and/or recommendations in the grant. There is no need to report on progress in achieving outputs and outcomes, which is done in the first annual report. As annex to the report 0, the consortium agreements between the partners should be submitted.
The final report must reflect on the entire project period.</narrative>

     <actual value="Through this project, the ICCPG was directly supported in its educative role as a multiplyer in Guatemala in the field of Human Rights, women&#x2019;s rights, SRHR and LGTBI rights. Staff effectively gained skills and knowledge and are already active in offering replication courses, both formal and informal, aimed at key social groups. Three curricula for non-degree and short courses were developed and are in use. An increasing number of beneficiaries in society is so reached with improved knowledge and skills (see below).

Individually, 24 scholarship holders successfully completed the TMT, of whom 16 (67 %) were women. Evaluations show that with the TMT, they developed stronger and more sophisticated attitudes on critical issues that are highly controversial in Guatemala.

The Pandemic effectively impeded the three planned on-site course modules in Guatemala City. It took time to adjust and to verify that it was feasible to give the Course online. When conditions for participants were facilitated, this became possible. Adaptation took several months though. Project planning and coordination costs have increased as a result. Thanks to the flexibility of the ICCPG Team and of the international expertise network of VU and LASO, we have been able to reschedule the TMT training into a digital, online format. Also, we have been able to include, within the existing budget, an additional activity on Human Rights and COVID-19 mitigation for indigenous populations speaking their own languages.

This TMT was carried out with a strong combination of learning strategies and instruments. Due to Corona restrictions, the training was provided wholly online instead. Of course, this impeded some on-site, face-to-face learning instruments, such as live discussions, practical group work, field visits. To counter this, various novel online learning modalities were used, including online master classes, group discussions, reading assignments and creative tasks."></actual>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">22-04-2021: Staff effectively gained skills and knowledge and are already active in offering replication courses, both formal and informal, aimed at key social groups. Three curricula for non-degree and short courses were developed and are in use. An increasing number of beneficiaries in society is so reached with improved knowledge and skills. Evaluations show that with this training, the participants developed stronger and more sophisticated attitudes on critical issues which are highly controversial in Guatemala.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">22-04-2021: The theme of the training was on the development of a gender strategy in the larger context of Guatemala. The outcomes of the training in terms of attitude are also expected to have a positive effect on further development of an institutional gender strategy for ICCPG, enhancing the capacity of the staff and its management towards critical analysis and action.</narrative>
