   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Longer term impact will be on development of local dairy value chains resulting in more food security and higher income levels.

Medium term impact will be improved capacity of the staff of the livestock departments of the 3 participating institutions in developing and implementing curricula for students of their institutions in dairy value chain development.

In addition, through the signing of a MOU, cooperation between Aeres University and the requesting organization will continue after the TMT has ended.

The outcome of the TMT is enhanced knowledge and skills of 15 staff members of the 3 requesting institutions as already mentioned above.</narrative>

     <actual value="The overall score of all subjects was 8.5 on a scale of 1 to 10, so very good. The excursions showed variation in their appreciation, some excellent, some average. It was frequently remarked that this course was a professional training program which should be conducted yearly. In some subjects it was remarked that more time was needed to grasp it, especially in farm economics and competence based learning. It was the first time that lecturers of the 2 universities and College participated jointly in a dairy training program. All lecturers, besides teaching students at their place of learning, were also involved in community development programs involving mainly organizing small holder training programs. Some also small holdings themselves.
Despite their background knowledge, skills and experience in the technical aspects of analysing dairy value chains and setting up and managing a small scale commercial dairy farm appeared not up to the mark. Although there was awareness about the &#x201C;competence based learning concept&#x201D; none of the participants had ever tried to develop a training program which was set up in line with CBL principles.
The training in combination with an assignment to develop a short farmer training program which was based on CBL principles worked out perfectly. Not only for personal development, but it also lead to an understanding between participants/ institutions that more cooperation was required to come to a more uniform approach in teaching students/ training small holder farmers which should include gender aspects and raising more awareness about the environmental impact of the dairy sector. During the Module on dairy value chain analysis and development students were made aware of the concept of (dairy) value chains. They are able to describe and analyze existing dairy value chains, the role of actors, service providers, administration(s) and policies (local, national and international). They are able to link these issues to their own situation. Attention was also given to quality control in the Dairy Value Chain and sensoric evaluation of dairy products.
Participants are enthusiastic about the Value Chain concept, however, they understand that small holder farmer can only participate successfully in value chains if they have the basic knowledge and skills to run their farm as a business.
During the Dairy Farm Management Module the principles of dairy farm economics, management and entrepreneurship were explained and exercised. Use of key performance indicators for assessing/ analysing the technical and financial performance were explained and used in various ,initial theoretical, exercises. Various categories of dairy farmers were visited (small scale, emerging farmers, commercial farmers, male as well as female farmers) and students were assigned to analyse the technical as well as financial performance of these farms in groups and develop plans for improvement of the technical as well as the financial performance based on their observations and information collected from the farmers during the visits. Also gender related issues were included in the assignment. Each group was assigned a specific dairy farm for their assignment and present their findings and recommendations.
Also attention was given to dairy cattle nutrition management, young stock rearing, health management, fertility management and housing.
In the last Module attention was given to &#x201C;Training of Trainers&#x201D; topics. Principles of competence based learning, developing short training programs for farmers/farm workers (in his/her area of expertise), developing a lesson plan (one training session) and implementation of the lesson plan developed.
At the end of week 3 student were given the assignment to develop a short farmer training program in a step wise approach (in groups) which was monitored by Aeres. In week 4 feedback was provided to the work done and individual training performance assessed.
During the evaluation of the Course all participants acknowledged that a lot was learned, that finally they had an idea how to incorporate CBL principles in their curricula and that teachers of the 3 institutes would continue to work together to develop their curricula in a more uniform way. Greenhouse gas emissions on dairy farms received special attention during the Course. Awareness was raised that particularly in Africa GHG emissions per kg milk are particularly very high due to the low efficiency and poor quality of feed available to dairy animals. Measures to mitigate the impact of climate change and measures to reduce GHG emissions on dairy farms were discussed thoroughly. Ideas have been used by the participants and they intend to incorporate this information into their own curricula. The training has certainly contributed to the institutional capacity in curriculum development, technical knowledge and skills and M&amp;E system of training programs. Accreditation systems were briefly touched upon (the system in place by Aeres (NVAO)).
A special output during the training program was the establishment of a taskforce with representatives of all 3 institutions for the continuation of cooperation in developing training programs and course materials after the TMT was completed.
For gender see the output below.
All of the above will certainly have an impact in the way trainees/ institutions will develop and implement teaching training programs in the future. total of 9 female lecturers participated fully in the training and discussions, participating side by side with their male colleagues as equals. Various training sessions and exercises involving gender issues were included in the training raising awareness.
In the training of trainers Module attention was given on how to develop curricula which were gender sensitive.
Trainees represented various ethnic groups and religions and age varied from 25 to 60 years."></actual>

     <actual value="A total of 9 female lecturers participated fully in the training and discussions, participating side by side with their male colleagues as equals. Various training sessions and exercises involving gender issues were included in the training raising awareness.
In the training of trainers Module attention was given on how to develop curricula which were gender sensitive. Gender and Value Chains was an important issue during the course. Through exercises they were made aware of role of gender in different areas of the chain realizing the inequality between different groups and the need to change this. The participants are aware of the gender (in)sensitivity of their own organization.
Participants were assigned to discuss gender related issues with dairy farm managers having an impact on the performance of their dairy farms during visits of dairy farms during the Module on dairy farm management and farm economics.
Participants were made aware about gender while developing lesson plans during the third module and how to make training programs gender sensitive.
In total 9 female lecturers participated in the training."></actual>

     <actual value="The training in combination with an assignment to develop a short farmer training program which was based on CBL principles worked out perfectly. Not only for personal development, but it also lead to an understanding between participants/ institutions that more cooperation was required to come to a more uniform approach in teaching students/ training small holder farmers which should include gender aspects and raising more awareness about the environmental impact of the dairy sector. During the evaluation of the Course all participants acknowledged that a lot was learned, that finally they had an idea how to incorporate CBL principles in their curricula and that teachers of the 3 institutes would continue to work together to develop their curricula in a more uniform way."></actual>
