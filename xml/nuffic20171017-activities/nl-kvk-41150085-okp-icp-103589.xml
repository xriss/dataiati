   <narrative xml:lang="EN">**Goals overview**

The proposed project must contribute to the following objective:

- To ensure availability and sustainable management of water for all (SDG 6)

**The proposed project must contribute to the following long-term impact:
**
- Water is used sustainably and equitability, ensuring the needs of all sectors and the environment
- Water efficiency in agriculture is increased.

**Medium-term impact that will contribute to this:**

1.  Education system (TVET/HE) is of good quality, relevant and accessible (SDG 4)
2.  Partnerships between persons and organisations are inclusive and sustainable (SDG17)
3. Organisations key to (sectoral) inclusive development of partner countries are strengthened by inflow of enhanced workforce.

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Myanmar is unlike any other country in the world &#x2013; unique in its challenges, unique in its opportunities. After many years of isolation, the country opened its doors to th world in 2012. 

Paradoxically, it may be exactly these decades of isolation that can become their unique factor in accelerating development. Already from the beginning, the TU Delft and IHE Delft became active in Myanmar - building a trustful relationship with the Yangon Technological University (YTU) ,the Myanmar Maritime University (MMU) and their related government departments.

One of the main projects was the NICHE program which laid the first stepping stones for educational change in integrated water resources management (IWRM). While admirable progress has been made by both universities, it is now time to use this foundation and the carefully built relationship for realising more impact. To ensure sustainable uptake and educational change, the continuation of this cooperation is

crucial. 

Therefore, this proposal will:

- continue the educational and institutional strengthening of YTU and MMU in the field of IWRM;
- further enhance the use of innovative and smart technologies for data collection (&#x201C;leapfrogging&#x201D;)to support the educational transition to a more practical, entrepreneurial and student-centred way of teaching;
- create linkages between Myanmar, SE Asian and Dutch scientists, professionals, young experts and students for an optimal exchange of technical and didactical knowledge; 
- reap the benefits of the trustful relationship that was built. All partners have learned a lot and possess very valuable knowledge - now that we trust and understand each other, it is time to continue the implementation to achieve real impact together.</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">Reporting is an important management tool which is used to inform relevant government officials and other stakeholders about the results being achieved by individual projects and the programme as a whole. 
For project partners, it is compulsory to use the prescribed Orange Knowledge annual report format in order to report on project achievements. The annual report also provides valuable data on the financial situation of the project. Based on an analysis of the project performance in relation to the project output(s) and expected outcome(s), a revision of the project work plan may be suggested by the project partners. The consequences of a possible revision on the project work plan and budget must be made clear in the annual report.
Nuffic monitors outputs and outcomes and not activities . Therefore, the main focus of the annual report must be on the achievement of the project&#x2019;s output(s) and planned outcome(s). The information provided in the annual reports of the projects is used by Nuffic to monitor the progress of the project and to inform the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and other stakeholders about the output(s) and outcome(s) being achieved by individual projects and the Orange Knowledge programme as a whole. 
Please note that if project progress is in accordance with the original planning, reporting requirements are minimal. Only in case of deviations from the planning, more elaboration is demanded.
In the grant award letter, the dates for submission of the annual reports are mentioned. In case of a three-year project, between 5-7 reports are obligatory.
The first report (0) is a very short report which focuses on specific conditions and/or recommendations in the grant. There is no need to report on progress in achieving outputs and outcomes, which is done in the first annual report. As annex to the report 0, the consortium agreements between the partners should be submitted.
The final report must reflect on the entire project period.</narrative>

     <actual value="At YTU and MMU, there is a general overrepresentation of women in water studies&#x2013; on a student as well as staff level. This means that when we discuss gender balance, our aim is to attract more male participants. More male students were targeted through showcasing innovative measuring tools and equipment as well as using models. A general focus on more fieldwork in the curriculum also helps with this. Furthermore, young staff is getting more responsibility through our project, allowing them to present their ideas. Myanmar is generally quite conservative and the university system is still very hierarchical. We&apos;re gradually empowering young staff members, both male and female, by allowing them to voice their ideas  concerns privately. We involve them in many trainings and other opportunities in professional development to assert themselves. We&apos;re furthermore leading by example by sending a diverse team of people to Myanmar. We send (both male and female) young students for exchange research, Young Expert (YEP) for local coordination, PhD students, junior and senior lecturers, (associate) professors and even retired professors."></actual>
