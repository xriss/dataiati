    <narrative xml:lang="EN">Reporting is an important management tool which is used to inform relevant government officials and other stakeholders about the results being achieved by individual projects and the programme as a whole. 
For project partners, it is compulsory to use the prescribed Orange Knowledge annual report format in order to report on project achievements. The annual report also provides valuable data on the financial situation of the project. Based on an analysis of the project performance in relation to the project output(s) and expected outcome(s), a revision of the project work plan may be suggested by the project partners. The consequences of a possible revision on the project work plan and budget must be made clear in the annual report.
Nuffic monitors outputs and outcomes and not activities. Therefore, the main focus of the annual report must be on the achievement of the project&#x2019;s output(s) and planned outcome(s). The information provided in the annual reports of the projects is used by Nuffic to monitor the progress of the project and to inform the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and other stakeholders about the output(s) and outcome(s) being achieved by individual projects and the Orange Knowledge programme as a whole. 
Please note that if project progress is in accordance with the original planning, reporting requirements are minimal. Only in case of deviations from the planning, more elaboration is demanded.
In the Grant Obligations and Conditions, the obligatory dates for submission of the annual/additional reports are mentioned. The final report must reflect on the entire project period.</narrative>

     <actual value="The project start was delayed due to Corona outbreak, and the first training was provided in September 2020. It became apparent that Corona also affected the travel possibilities of the trainees in Iraq &#x2013; for instance the staff of the Ministries in Bagdad were in principal prohibited from travelling to Erbil (only 2 senior managers of MoA could attend this training) &#x2013; and that all the uncertainty involving travel and Corona would impact the execution and planning of the visits to Iraq. This impact was also clear from the unsecure safety situation in Basra (political unrest), and the advice of the Dutch Embassy and WUR to postpone travel to southern Iraq. Therefore, Corona and security concerns strongly affected the location and method of training.

The original projection was that all 14 short courses could be held in Iraq, but due to the above situation all participants agreed that the theoretical components would preferably be trained online, and the practical elements would be done in Iraq. For these reasons, the order of the 14 courses and individual lectures were rearranged. The training started in Erbil, moving to Basra in June 2021 now that this appears to be safe. The contents of training were adjusted to this situation and to the preferences of the trainees as discussed during the first meeting in September and subsequent meetings. In all, more focus has gone towards integrated mixed cropping and soil management systems (the apparent problems in Iraq are more complex and clearly more related to soil degradation and poor water management, than to poor water quality such as brackish water) with less focus going to purely salt.

Major technical milestones in 2020 were completion of the several courses from September onwards, 2 visits to Erbil (Sep + Nov 2020) and a practical, climate smart farm design for a large commercial (silage and cattle) farmer in Erbil. A organisational milestone was the addition of new trainees from several universities, lifting the number of institutes and universities to 8 in total, while the response of trainees was overall positive on a new way of thinking on sustainable farming and water management."></actual>
