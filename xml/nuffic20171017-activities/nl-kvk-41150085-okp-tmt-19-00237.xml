     <actual value="The key capacity need that the requesting organisation expressed in the proposal was the lack of skills, knowledge and attitude of staff in NGOs, CBOs and government agencies to recognise the creativity of smallholder farmers to engage with farmer innovators in farmer-led innovation development processes. The TMT was entirely geared to fill this capacity need - not only theoretically through the on-line workshops, but also practically through the pilot projects that the trainees engaged in. Despite the challenges faced due to Covid restrictions, the TMT effectively and efficiently met its objective of training and mentoring a group of participants from 11 organisations in participatory innovation development. We were able to cover the content, engage the trainees in field application of what they had learned, reflected on the learning at the final workshop, and stayed within budget. Moreover, through the field pilots, we were able to provide an opportunity for trainees to work in multistakeholder groups, which was a new and useful experience for them.

**Lessons and recommendations:**

a. Unforeseen circumstances (such as the Covid pandemic) called for adaptability, flexibility and patience from all involved. A good team (trainers, field facilitator and requesting organisation) that was able to communicate and make necessary changes helped to successfully complete and achieve the objectives of the TMT. The support and understanding from the side of Nuffic were equally important. 

b. Virtual training became the only way forward in the face of the Covid pandemic. However, it is quite a challenge in countries (areas) that do not have good connectivity and participants who have limited or no connectivity. In such situations, it is essential to have a competent and capable field facilitator on location for organisation, logistics etc.  

c. Enabling the participation of women was sought from the outset of the programme and we were diligent in following this through. We thus succeeded in getting women trainees who participated actively throughout the programme. Moreover, a mix of men and women participants allowed for good discussions on gender issues and how it relates to their work as development practitioners.

d. The use of &quot;real life&quot; cases of farmer innovation from across Africa in the training was considered illuminating by the trainees. They were motivated to seek farmer innovation within their own fields of work. 

e. The short field pilots were an excellent way for the trainees to apply what they had learnt hands-on and in collaborative teams. Though short, these pilots were greatly appreciated by the trainees. Moreover, they were able to share their experiences through the reflection workshops. The trainees will continue the activities started through these field pilots even after the completion of the TMT.

f. The trainees will continue to be connected through the Prolinnova country network as well as with network partners in other African countries and thereby continue to share and learn together on farmer-led innovation. This is important in terms of sustainability.

     <actual value="**Output 1: 18 staff members from Kulima and other agricultural development organisations attend the two TMT training workshops and prepare action plans.**

Despite the Covid-19 related challenges, this output was achieved with satisfaction. 15 staff members of 11 organisations including Kulima (as requesting organisation) attended the two workshops. The main activities completed in relation to this output were:

- Introductory (virtual) training workshop in local innovation and participatory innovation development (14 to 17 September 2020)
- Preparation of post-training pilot projects by trainees in four groups based on a farmer innovation within their working areas. Four PID pilots were submitted to their managers and the trainers and approved for implementation.
- Implementation of the pilots projects during a period of 5-6 months, involving the farming community, other staff from their own and other organisations (From October 2020 to March 2021)
- Monitoring of the pilots and mentoring of the trainees by the local facilitator, on-site, and the trainers, virtually.
- Reflection workshop at the end of the programme with each pilot project group presenting their findings, what they had learned and how they plan to share their knowledge with their colleagues (26 - 28 April 2021).

**Output 2: 18 development practitioners develop practical skills in identifying examples of local innovation and supporting their improvement through a process of PID**

This output was also achieved with success through the pilot projects undertaken by the trainees. These pilots were based on local innovations identified by the trainees in their working areas:

Pilot 1 - ++Use of mint as a biopesticide++ (an innovation of a male farmer innovator). This pilot was used to set up and implement a joint experiment to try out the mint decoction against aphids with a larger group of small-scale farmers on their cabbage plots. The community members, mostly women, planted cabbage on four plots and were able to get a good harvest with no attacks from aphids using mint as a biopesticide. (trainees from UCAM/UNAC engaged in this pilot)

Pilot 2 - ++Use of pots made of banana yarn (biodegradable material) for raising plant/tree nurseries instead of plastic bags++ in Gwemulini, Chiboto District. This is an innovation of a woman farmer. In this pilot, the trainees joined up with the innovator to share the innovation within the community. The woman innovator taught the others how to make the banana yarn pots, they then made their own and raised plant nurseries. The seedlings were planted in areas that have been damaged due to erosion caused by heavy rain and flooding in the area. 23 community members learned about the innovation. They made 500 degradable pots, raised 500 seedlings (mainly fruit trees), and planted them on degraded land during the pilot. The produce of the trees will be for family consumption of the community. They also set up a community nursery (trainees from Tchemulane Association, FONGA, and ACTIVA were engaged in this pilot).

Pilot 3 - ++Drying of tomatoes and other vegetables to combat post-harvest loss and increase shelf life++ in Conhane, Chokwe district. Traditionally, vegetables are boiled for preservation. This innovation of a women farmer has used drying instead. Her method was shared and tried out successfully by 60 women farmers who now have a better way to preserve their vegetables (trainees from ISPG, ARES, and Kulima engaged in this pilot).

Pilot 4 - ++Protecting vegetable plots against saltwater intrusion by placing pipes in the dyke++. This is an innovation by a farmer who managed to keep out the saltwater from his vegetable plot of 2 ha by placing pipes in the dyke in the coastal area of Marrambone, Inhambane. Through this pilot, the trainees were able to share the innovation with farmers in the larger community and expand the technique to reclaim 33 ha and use the land to grow vegetables. (trainees from ACUDES, DPP, and UPCI were involved in this pilot)"></actual>

     <actual value="The core of this training programme was to get trainees acquainted with the participatory innovation development (PID) approach for improving food and nutrition security. This approach takes farmer innovation as an entry point. As such, emphasis was placed on the need to discover and support innovation of women farmers, which is often hidden from sight. Gender integration into PID was covered as one of the sessions in the training. There was a good gender balance among the trainees which allowed for getting the feedback of both men and women and examining the need to give more attention to women farmers who are often disadvantaged. The trainees were also encouraged to look for women&apos;s innovation in their post-training pilots. This exposure to gender in a very practical way helped the trainees to better understand the need to pursue gender equality and equity in their daily work as agricultural and development workers."></actual>

     <actual value="This training programme has contributed to changing attitudes of trainees in the following aspects:

a. **Recognising and respecting farmer innovation **- realising that small-scale farmers are people who are knowledgeable and experienced in food production and capable of finding new and innovative ways of improving their farming. Hence, identifying and supporting these farmer innovations and sharing them with others can help in improving food and nutrition security in small-scale farmer communities.

b. **Collaboration with others in development** - Often staff in organisations are rather insular in their activities. This training has shown them the importance and value of multi-stakeholder collaboration and how it can be more efficient in pooling strengths and resources and reducing duplication. The trainees came from different organisations and were able to interact and work with each other in the training as well as in the pilot projects.  

c. **The role of facilitation** - often, staff of development organisations (public and private) tend to take the lead and make decisions on behalf of farming communities. However, this training has emphasised the need to play a facilitating/ supporting role, giving community members (women and men) the opportunity to make their own development decisions."></actual>
