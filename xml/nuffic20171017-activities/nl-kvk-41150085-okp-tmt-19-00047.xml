   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The TM training programme aims to develop a sustainable water and food nexus system
        in the coastal zone of Mekong Delta. The coastal zone has suffered from severe shortage of
        freshwater supply and saltwater intrusion resulting in salinization problems. Many household
        has lost their income as rice farmer. The ecology is deteriorating as a result of
        salinization. The requested training will promote salt tolerant crops which is better suited
        to local conditions. Meanwhile, brackish groundwater is widely available in shallow depth
        which can be used to supplement irrigation during the dry period. The transition from rice
        crop to salt tolerant crops will not only improve food security, but also ecological
        environment in the coastal zone of Mekong Delta. The outputs of the programme include: -
        lecture materials on saline agriculture and use of brackish groundwater for irrigation have
        developed; - a large number (28) of specialists have been trained including junior
        university staff and water and agricultural experts from provinces in Mekong Delta; - a
        strategy for saline agriculture extension in Mekong Delta is being developed. The long-term
        benefits of the training programme include: - The education programme at Can Tho University
        is extended with saline agriculture and new source of brackish groundwater for irrigation; -
        Saline areas in Mekong Delta are transformed into ecologically sustainable food production.

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">Reporting is an important management tool which is used to inform relevant government officials and other stakeholders about the results being achieved by individual projects and the programme as a whole. 
For project partners, it is compulsory to use the prescribed Orange Knowledge annual report format in order to report on project achievements. The annual report also provides valuable data on the financial situation of the project. Based on an analysis of the project performance in relation to the project output(s) and expected outcome(s), a revision of the project work plan may be suggested by the project partners. The consequences of a possible revision on the project work plan and budget must be made clear in the annual report.
Nuffic monitors outputs and outcomes and not activities . Therefore, the main focus of the annual report must be on the achievement of the project&#x2019;s output(s) and planned outcome(s). The information provided in the annual reports of the projects is used by Nuffic to monitor the progress of the project and to inform the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and other stakeholders about the output(s) and outcome(s) being achieved by individual projects and the Orange Knowledge programme as a whole. 
Please note that if project progress is in accordance with the original planning, reporting requirements are minimal. Only in case of deviations from the planning, more elaboration is demanded.
In the grant award letter, the dates for submission of the annual reports are mentioned. In case of a three-year project, between 5-7 reports are obligatory.
The first report (0) is a very short report which focuses on specific conditions and/or recommendations in the grant. There is no need to report on progress in achieving outputs and outcomes, which is done in the first annual report. As annex to the report 0, the consortium agreements between the partners should be submitted.
The final report must reflect on the entire project period.</narrative>
