   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The proposed project must contribute to the following ++objective++: \* Ensure
        access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all (SDG 7). The proposed
        project must contribute to the following ++long-term impact++: \*Ensure access to
        affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy services by the rural populations
        accross Mozambique by (i) creating conditions for the emergence of small youth business in
        the renewable energy secotr, (ii) leveraging a capable private and public renewable energy
        sector, following Mozambique&apos;s commitment under the SDG&apos;s. ++Medium-term impacts++ that will
        contribute to this: (I) Education system (TVET/HE) is of good quality, relevant and
        accessible (SDG 4); (II) Partnerships between persons and organisations are inclusive and
        sustainable (SDG 17); (III) Organisations key to (sectoral) inclusive development of partner
        countries are strengthened by inflow of enhanced workforce. ++Outcome++: TVET/HE
        organisations (in Mozambique and in NL) perform better their core tasks, firmly embedded in
        their environment (in line with country/regional specific labour market needs &amp; aiming
        at inclusiveness) To that end, the following ++output(s)++ must be achieved by the end of
        the project: 1. Future Search Conference &amp; Joint vision for the development of an
        Education system in renewable Energies in Mozambique 2. Development of new training
        materials in &apos;Design &amp; Installation of Energy Solar Solutions&apos; at vocational level. 3.
        Translation of 5 TUD&apos;s MOOCS in Renewable Energies and Entrepreneurship into Portuguese and
        adaptation to the Mozambican context. 4. Training of Mozambican higher-education staff by
        TUD staff following a Train-the-trainers approach and re-runs of the trainings across the
        Zambezi Valley by UEM Staff. &#x200B;</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">Reporting is an important management tool which is used to inform relevant government officials and other stakeholders about the results being achieved by individual projects and the programme as a whole. 
For project partners, it is compulsory to use the prescribed Orange Knowledge annual report format in order to report on project achievements. The annual report also provides valuable data on the financial situation of the project. Based on an analysis of the project performance in relation to the project output(s) and expected outcome(s), a revision of the project work plan may be suggested by the project partners. The consequences of a possible revision on the project work plan and budget must be made clear in the annual report.
Nuffic monitors outputs and outcomes and not activities . Therefore, the main focus of the annual report must be on the achievement of the project&#x2019;s output(s) and planned outcome(s). The information provided in the annual reports of the projects is used by Nuffic to monitor the progress of the project and to inform the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and other stakeholders about the output(s) and outcome(s) being achieved by individual projects and the Orange Knowledge programme as a whole. 
Please note that if project progress is in accordance with the original planning, reporting requirements are minimal. Only in case of deviations from the planning, more elaboration is demanded.
In the grant award letter, the dates for submission of the annual reports are mentioned. In case of a three-year project, between 5-7 reports are obligatory.
The first report (0) is a very short report which focuses on specific conditions and/or recommendations in the grant. There is no need to report on progress in achieving outputs and outcomes, which is done in the first annual report. As annex to the report 0, the consortium agreements between the partners should be submitted.
The final report must reflect on the entire project period.</narrative>
