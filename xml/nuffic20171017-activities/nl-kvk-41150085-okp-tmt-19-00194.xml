    <narrative xml:lang="EN">Reporting is an important management tool which is used to inform relevant government officials and other stakeholders about the results being achieved by individual projects and the programme as a whole. 
For project partners, it is compulsory to use the prescribed Orange Knowledge annual report format in order to report on project achievements. The annual report also provides valuable data on the financial situation of the project. Based on an analysis of the project performance in relation to the project output(s) and expected outcome(s), a revision of the project work plan may be suggested by the project partners. The consequences of a possible revision on the project work plan and budget must be made clear in the annual report.
Nuffic monitors outputs and outcomes and not activities . Therefore, the main focus of the annual report must be on the achievement of the project&#x2019;s output(s) and planned outcome(s). The information provided in the annual reports of the projects is used by Nuffic to monitor the progress of the project and to inform the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and other stakeholders about the output(s) and outcome(s) being achieved by individual projects and the Orange Knowledge programme as a whole. 
Please note that if project progress is in accordance with the original planning, reporting requirements are minimal. Only in case of deviations from the planning, more elaboration is demanded.
In the grant award letter, the dates for submission of the annual reports are mentioned. In case of a three-year project, between 5-7 reports are obligatory.
The first report (0) is a very short report which focuses on specific conditions and/or recommendations in the grant. There is no need to report on progress in achieving outputs and outcomes, which is done in the first annual report. As annex to the report 0, the consortium agreements between the partners should be submitted.
The final report must reflect on the entire project period.</narrative>

**Tailor-made Training:**  **Innovative Tools in Plant Breeding for Climate Smart Agriculture for Improved Food Security in Tunisia**

**10 February to 8 April 2021**

**Title of the TMT**: Innovative Tools in Plant Breeding for Climate Smart Agriculture for Improved Food Security in Tunisia

**Reference**: TMT.OKP.19/00194

**Requesting Organization:**  CRRGC-Beja (IRESA-Ministry of Agriculture)-Regional Field Crops Research Centre of B&#xE9;ja in collaboration with CRP Wheat Septoria Precision Phenotyping Platform and National Agronomic Institute of Tunisia.

**Provider**: Wageningen University and Research (WUR)-Plant Breeding

**Date of the training**: 10 February to 8 April 2021

**Number of participants**: 25 (11 male and 14 female)

**Number of local trainers** /resource persons involved: two

**Mode of implementation** **and methodology**: Online whereby the teaching materials were distributed to all the participants. Each module consisted of lectures, videos, literatures, assignments, discussion group and action plan. During the implementation, several video conferences were held to strengthen the link between and among the participants and also to discuss and share knowledge between the participants. In addition, practical exercises were implemented at two sites in the field whereby two resource persons were engaged to share their experiences with the participants.  

**Training activities**: Two module were addressed 

Module 1: Plant breeding for biotic stress factors 

Module 2: Use of molecular tools in plant breeding 

**The training course contributed for addressing the following capacity needs :**

Participants got familiar with the available technology that can be adopted to select for durable disease resistance

Participants get familiar with the available tools that can be deployed in their place of working especially in the application of molecular tools in plant breeding to accelerate the development of new food crop varieties

Participants enabled to design efficient plant breeding program that address the local needs and meet the wishes of growers and local market. 

Participants enabled to share the local knowledge and lessons learned from local resource persons in topics related to the training course.  

Lessons learned, recommendation and follow up 

&#xB7;  TMT was implemented online and achieved its objectives whereby participants were able to upgrade their knowledge and skills on the last development in plant breeding and biotechnology. However, participants would have liked to include more practical exercises but this it was not possible due to Covid-19 pandemic.

&#xB7;  There is a need to organize training course that include academic and training exercises that include webinars, field trips and lab exercises and also address the last development and cutting edge in plant breeding and biotechnology such as the use SNP markers and sequencing technology. 

&#xB7;  Participants are eager to allocate more time &amp; receive and apply more practical training in the field and lab and exchange their experiences with their colleagues.

&#xB7;  Addressing value chain combined with the use of land races and participatory plant breeding is highly recommended. The role of gender in agriculture development is considered essential. The criteria of consumer and household proved to be important and should be included in the training. 

Breeding for abiotic stress factors combined with nutritional quality is recommended. In addition, working in interactive way on mounting a breeding experiment based on a recent expedition from genetic diversity analysis to inoculation on a populations or lines combined with the use of molecular tools.

&#xB7;  Interactive assignments are highly recommended for implementation online Participants took the initiative to identify the need of capacity building at their center&#x2019;s that leads to enhancing the efficiency of the requesting organization in fundamental and applied research. It has been suggested to develop memorandum of agreement that combine the need of training in specific topics and match the existing expertise at WUR and contributes towards strengthening the link between WUR and GRRGC in Tunisia.

&#xB7;  Sharing information and experiences through NUFFIC Alumni is highly recommended by the participants.
