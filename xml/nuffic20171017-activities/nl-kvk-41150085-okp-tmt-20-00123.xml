   <description>
    <narrative xml:lang="EN">Reporting is an important management tool which is used to inform relevant government officials and other stakeholders about the results being achieved by individual projects and the programme as a whole. 
For project partners, it is compulsory to use the prescribed Orange Knowledge annual report format in order to report on project achievements. The annual report also provides valuable data on the financial situation of the project. Based on an analysis of the project performance in relation to the project output(s) and expected outcome(s), a revision of the project work plan may be suggested by the project partners. The consequences of a possible revision on the project work plan and budget must be made clear in the annual report.
Nuffic monitors outputs and outcomes and not activities . Therefore, the main focus of the annual report must be on the achievement of the project&#x2019;s output(s) and planned outcome(s). The information provided in the annual reports of the projects is used by Nuffic to monitor the progress of the project and to inform the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and other stakeholders about the output(s) and outcome(s) being achieved by individual projects and the Orange Knowledge programme as a whole. 
Please note that if project progress is in accordance with the original planning, reporting requirements are minimal. Only in case of deviations from the planning, more elaboration is demanded.
In the grant award letter, the dates for submission of the annual reports are mentioned. In case of a three-year project, between 5-7 reports are obligatory.
The first report (0) is a very short report which focuses on specific conditions and/or recommendations in the grant. There is no need to report on progress in achieving outputs and outcomes, which is done in the first annual report. As annex to the report 0, the consortium agreements between the partners should be submitted.
The final report must reflect on the entire project period.</narrative>

     <actual value="Most of the capacity needs described by the requesting organisation in the proposal: IPM, propagation methods, value addition, protected horticulture,  record keeping have been addressed during the training. Particularly protected horticulture was a topic of interest, as it is one of the fields that are developing most rapidly in Ghana and that offer great chances for young entrepreneurs and farm managers

The project was a great learning opportunity for all organisations in the use of online education for training, this was well received given the complex circumstances dictated by the Covid pandemic, however it was the feeling of the Dutch trainers that this type of education cannot fully replace the real-life education. It must be noted that most Dutch trainers never had the chance to actually travel to KITA and see with their own eyes the situation. This makes a huge difference in the capacity to assess the learning progress as well as spot additional improvements and challenges of the local organisation to be addressed in the training. In future trainings a blended learning approach will still be used but trying to alternate physical presence with online presence.

Another limitation of online training is that it is difficult to cover the same amount of topics, especially the ones that require practical experience and continued practice. One of the main wishes from the trainees was to receive more practical supervision on scouting for pest and diseases, this was difficult to address from a distance, but would be a very good candidate for follow up activities, together with post-harvest management and processing of crops. 

All in all, the project was experienced positively by both trainers and trainees. From the students of KITA that participated in the training, 4 have formed a task-team specifically focussing on the greenhouse activities and sharing responsibilities for the management. The product of the greenhouse is being marketed through the local partner AIC for the time being and all organisations involved are looking to opportunities for continued collaboration in the area of greenhouse production."></actual>

     <actual value="The project output was:&#x201D; 14 staff, extension officers and students trained(50% women trained, 30% youth) trained**. **

This output was addressed by means of the following activities: 

- Training on the job on greenhouse construction.

- Blended learning training on the following topics. 

o Soil Health, compost and Nursery Management

o Plant water requirements, water need and application for indoor and outdoor cultivation, advanced greenhouse cultivation

o Integrated Pest &amp; Disease Management in (protected) horticulture

o Value Addition and entrepreneurship. 

o Record keeping and business management

The first four topics were adressed in a blended fashion, in the morning the class would receive online lectures by the Dutch partner and in the afternoon they would have more practical lectures with the local partner. 

- Business development workshop for the management of KITA: to develop the business case around the greenhouse infrastructure that has been established during the TMT. This was an important step to ensure that the investment done in this infrastructure would remain even after the end of the project, as the previous structure was in decay upon begin of the program. During the training much attention was also given to the financial aspects of farming (e.g. cost-price determination) that must be taken into account to be able to afford maintenance and replacement of the greenhouse. 

KITA has picked up well on the knowledge provided in the training and has shown great motivation in applying what has been acquired. The group was different than originally planned as it was finally 18 people of which 60% youths and 40% female. The group was composed of students, staff and management of KITA as well as one extension officer from the local Ministry of Agriculture."></actual>

It was the impression of the training provider that the management of KITA was open to discussing the topic and they certainly did their efforts to work towards the targets in terms of women participation. Of the students selected by KITA for training, 70% were female. 

Gender has been also included in the training in the following forms: 

1. entrepreneurship was discussed and linked to gender when trainees were invited to reflect on opportunities and which types of businesses are usually run by men and women and the reasons behind that. It is also worth mentioning that all trainees were invited to develop their own business plan. Since most students participating were female, the hope is that this will support them in getting started with their own economic activities, therefore, promoting female entrepreneurship. 

2. Particular attention to the inclusion of female trainers as role models in both crop management and marketing/business aspects

3. Attention to female health and fertility aspects under the topic of crop protection, which will be included in all upcoming practical activities of KITA."></actual>

     <actual value="The following changes in attitudes and attributes were reported by the trainees during the conclusive feedback session, particularly they are an elaboration on the answers to the question &apos;How do you hope to change your practices as a result of the training?&quot;

- Many trainees reported a change of perspective on the importance of data collection and the competence to use it for decision making. For several trainees, the upgrade and introduction of detailed record-keeping practices in their professional activities are one of the main practices for their personal and professional track. One of the most enthusiastic trainees stated that he would be introducing record-keeping for multiple aspects of his personal life. 

- For some, the training mainly resulted in increased knowledge on agronomy and particularly on greenhouse management, since for most this was a new topic. The technical aspects mentioned by the trainees on this were: greenhouse production and nutrient management but also organic production. Some of the trainees involved in knowledge transfer activities (KITA lecturers and the extension service officer) stated that this knowledge will be included in the lectures of KITA as well as brought to farmers in various communities in the operational area of KITA/extension services

- A third topic that seemed to trigger many was the aspect of business development and the use of tools such as the Business Model Canvas. Many trainees reported a change of perspective in the way to include customer perspective in their own business plan and the way to communicate with them and answer to their needs. This is also a topic that will be included in later educational activities by KITA however one of the trainees who is also an entrepreneur also stated that he will review his own business strategy at the hand of the knowledge acquired."></actual>
