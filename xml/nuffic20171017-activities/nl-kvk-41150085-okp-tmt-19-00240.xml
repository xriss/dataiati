    <narrative xml:lang="EN">Reporting is an important management tool which is used to inform relevant government officials and other stakeholders about the results being achieved by individual projects and the programme as a whole. 
For project partners, it is compulsory to use the prescribed Orange Knowledge annual report format in order to report on project achievements. The annual report also provides valuable data on the financial situation of the project. Based on an analysis of the project performance in relation to the project output(s) and expected outcome(s), a revision of the project work plan may be suggested by the project partners. The consequences of a possible revision on the project work plan and budget must be made clear in the annual report.
Nuffic monitors outputs and outcomes and not activities . Therefore, the main focus of the annual report must be on the achievement of the project&#x2019;s output(s) and planned outcome(s). The information provided in the annual reports of the projects is used by Nuffic to monitor the progress of the project and to inform the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and other stakeholders about the output(s) and outcome(s) being achieved by individual projects and the Orange Knowledge programme as a whole. 
Please note that if project progress is in accordance with the original planning, reporting requirements are minimal. Only in case of deviations from the planning, more elaboration is demanded.
In the grant award letter, the dates for submission of the annual reports are mentioned. In case of a three-year project, between 5-7 reports are obligatory.
The first report (0) is a very short report which focuses on specific conditions and/or recommendations in the grant. There is no need to report on progress in achieving outputs and outcomes, which is done in the first annual report. As annex to the report 0, the consortium agreements between the partners should be submitted.
The final report must reflect on the entire project period.</narrative>

     <actual value="**Holistic approach towards capacity development**

**Strengthened capacities at organizational level**

- The revised course modules benefit the curriculum at Gedu College of Business Studies
- The Centre for University Learning and Teaching (CULT) which provides a weeklong Induction Training on Teaching for all newly recruited faculty members of Colleges of RUB. 
- Samtse has developed the Postgraduate Certificate in Higher Education (PgCHE) Programme for continuous professional development of RUB academics. 
- Both CULT and PgCHE are designed in a similar way like the VU-UTTP programme

**Strengthened capacities at individual level**

- Involved staff have gained more insights on their own strengths and weaknesses. They have obtained a broad array of new interactive teaching methods which they are able to apply in class as well as during online teaching. They have the competencies to set up new and revise existing course designs in line with labour market needs and in line with international standards. Staff have gained more confidence to teach our students by putting their needs at the center of the learning process. Even the teaching pedagogies of international practices is something the participants know about and use in their daily teaching.

 **How effective and efficient has the TMT been in reaching the desired objectices?**

- Due to the fact that the Nuffic grant award letter did not match the academic calendar of RUB, the proposed pre-visit could not take place live and was replaced by online meetings. Due to the Covid-19 pandemic all other planned activities could not take place live anymore either. The positive effect has been that we have been able to implement this project in a much more cost efficient way. Due to the fact that planned international travels and stays of experts could not take place, we used these funds to organize 4 additional online training modules. 
- Both our principal experts (dr Anja and Carmen) retired but since they already committed themselves to the project, they did still facilitate the first part of the training. Dr Anja continued doing so whereas Carmen was replaced by Esther. Due to their retirements Carmen and Anja could be hired for a more cost-friendly amount which increased our efficiency. 
- Due to Covid-19 we needed 3 months extra to reach our envisioned objectives thus reducing the effectivity of our project. Only once (online/ offline) teaching had resumed in Bhutan we could continue with the assessment of improved teaching practices.
- The expected co-funding of RUB could not take place as planned. RUB would contribute financially for the pre-visit and the Teaching &amp; Learning Lab which would both take place in Bhutan. Since both planned international visits couldn&#x2019;t take place and we moved to online learning modalities less own contribution could be made financially. 

**Lessons-learnt:**

- Though we could not have imagined this early 2020, we managed well in assessing the improved teaching competencies of staff through a variety of online ways;
- The good relationships among the Bhutanese and Dutch coordinator created a firm base for aligning alternative implementation scenarios. 
- As a result of the visit to VU, Gedu feels the need to restructure the classrooms to create better learning environments. 
- There are more benefits than what meets the eye. Though the program targeted to equip the participants with university teaching practices, the participants enjoyed the exposure to western learning environment, infrastructure, and noted its impact on the learners&#x2019; learning motivation. 
- Importance of communication, which has helped was navigate successfully in the face of the challenges brought on by Covid. And also how it helped us to understand our needs better.

**Recommendations:** we strongly recommend Nuffic to consider in investing long-term in certain universities. That way the effects of various TMT interventions can have a multiplier and longer-term effect on institutions as experienced in our case. 

Since our TMT did not allow any equipment to be purchased a &#x2018;transfer of ownership&#x2019; is not relevant.

     <actual value="Despite Covid measures in Bhutan, we were able to organize a live &#x2018;gender sensitization&#x2019; training in Bhutan, facilitated by a Bhutanese gender expert. The main aim of the gender sensitization workshop was to orient the participants on being gender aware and gender sensitive in their educational programmes and teaching practises. We were able to achieve the following objectives:

- To enhance understanding of key gender concepts &amp; gender situation in Bhutan and in the education sector with a focus on tertiary education and teaching 
- To better prepare the participants for integrating gender in their lives and during teaching and in their course modules
- To equip the participants with tools to mainstream gender in their teaching and course modules."></actual>
