Report TMT Tunisia

On-line Tailor-Made Training (TMT) Course

Application of Genomic plant breeding for challenging climate change in Tunisia

4 October-10 December 2021

Summary
The importance and utilization of genomic plant breeding technology and bioinformatics in relation is addressed. During the TMT course, participants got familiar with the following technologies that enable them to utilize it in their daily activities. This includes, Phenotyping and genotyping technology, Genomic sequencing technology, genomic assembly, Genetic approaches for discovering novel alleles for crop improvement, GWAS, SNPs, genomic assembly, and data base search
Case studies of genomic as potato, tomato, and wheat, sharing experiences with resouarce persons. During the course, exercises using software programs /assignments/action plan/case studies

Resource persons at national and international level were engaged to share their experiences with the participants whereby two experts from the international Centre of maize and wheat (CIMMYT) in Mexico were invited to share their experiences in genomic selection and traits discovery. 

Based on the new development and knowledge gained during the TMT, the participants were enabled to develop action plan on the most important crops in Tunisia which is expected to be implemented at their place of work. 

Collaborating partners 

Wageningen University &amp; Research (WUR)-Plant Breeding (The Netherlands) 

The Regional Field Crops Research Centre of Beja (CRRGC) in Tunisia-Beja (Ministry of Agriculture-IRESA)

Objectives of the course

Upgrading skills and know&#x2013;how on the use and application of genomic plant breeding 

Familiarize participants and update knowledge on the application of Bioinformatics, data management and analysis 

Programme and content of the course 

Module 1. Use and application of genomic plant breeding for improved traits. 

This module is proposed to help the participants getting access to most modern plant breeding technology and tools that contribute towards improving their efficiency (in terms of time, cost and reliability) in developing new varieties in food crops that are having the desired traits. The described topics are mentioned below and will be addressed in one week as follows:&#xA0;

1.  Modern sequencing techniques, importance of the genetic variation in the breeding program

2.  Use of molecular tools in genotyping, mapping populations, marker system, phenotyping the individuals of the mapping populations, linkage analysis, and quantitative loci analysis. 

3.  Characterization of genetic resources using molecular tools

4.  Identification of specific markers, identification of microsatellite sequences in plant genome

5.  Introduction and assignments on using CAPS (Cleaved Amplified Polymorphic Sequences), SCARs (Sequence Characterized Amplified Regions) and KASPar genotyping.

Module 2. Use and application of Bioinformatics in data management and analysis

This module commences with basic training in database management, computer programming and training in elementary bioinformatics tools aimed at using existing software to collect, analyse and interpret DNA and protein sequence information and moves on to more open challenges. Assignments with case studies are implemented during the course. It is worth noting that WUR-Plant Breeding has developed several software programs which can be used as open source. during the course, participants are familiarized with the existing software which can serve their purposes.&#xA0;

Approach and methodology used

The online training course is self-study course whereby the teaching materials are made available online to the participants. In addition, teaching materials are complemented with assignments, literature, case studies, videos and interactive sessions. The selected participants will be able login with a personal account and subsequently can follow the course at their available time. After completing the course, evaluation is carried out and certificate of participation is issued. 

Target audience 

The target audience is consisting of plant breeders, researchers, docents, agronomists, plant pathologists, biotechnologists and plant physiologists at BSc, MSc and PhD level who are working and involved with the above-mentioned topics. 

Trainers involved

Dr. Sjaak van Heusden (Trainer-WUR-Plant breeding)

Dr. Christian Bachem (Trainer and genomic expert)

Dr. Judith Risse (Biometrician , WUR) 

Dr. Sarrah Ben M&#x2019;Barek ( Coordinator IRESA) 

Ing. Angela Machacilla (facilitator-WUR)

Julia Philomin, The use of bioinformatics in plant breeding , CIMMYT, Indi-Mexico

Number of participants who successfully complete the course:  

A total of 24 participants have completed the course consisting of 15 females and 9 males. 

Outcome

Participants are familiar with the molecular techniques that enables the participants to develop food crop varieties inefficient and effective way. 

Participants were enabled to develop action plan that can be used at their working place

Participants got exposed to International and local experiences in modern plant breeding 

Gaining experiences through assignments by using software in bioinformatics

Sustainability

Links are established between the trainers and participants whereby several academic and projects are expected to take place whereby the trainers can provide the required know-how.

Room for improvement
Practical work in lab is missing due to Covid-19
More time is required for exercises in data base software ( Galaxy and Syntheny)
Present concrete example of sequencing to understand the assembly techniques. , 
Include more videos and increase number of hours of the course
More case studies on sequencing technology and molecular breeding

Recommnedations 
Implementing interactive Online quiz
Needs for enhancing capacity building in management of genetic resources 
And design of plant bereding program especially in forest and semi forest crops, melon, palm, figs and faba beans  
Implement future courses after summer holiday and in the morning
Need for practical work in field and lab
Improve interaction between trainers and participants through face-to-face training 
Visits to laboratory and getting familiar with the new equipment&#x2019;s and technology in Holland.
Addressing technology on Molecular finger printing and traits mapping

Follow up 
Nuffic and OKP priorities /training
Nuffic alumni
opportunities ( scholarship, refresher course, short courses in NL (CDI, TMT, TMT+, collaborative research program, MSc and PhDs)
Country plan of implementation 
Proirity is focused on food security , ecnomnmic growth and creating job opportuinties
