     <actual value="Entrepreneurship as a standalone module in the new FBC curriculum was scheduled as a year 5 module; with the original intention of offering in the 2020/21 academic year. Staff were, however, not trained in delivering entrepreneurship education and performing entrepreneurial teaching. The TMT remedied this by building competence in terms of entrepreneurship knowledge, skills and attitudes. The strategy was to obtain a core group of trained personnel in the area of entrepreneurship first and then cascade the training down to the lower years in the Faculty programme. The TMT intervention did, as anticipated, facilitate this capacity building process of obtaining that critical mass of trained personnel who will train others. In addition, the TMT helped the FBC to strengthen its strategic process of becoming more entrepreneurial.

_**Lessons learned**_

&#xB7; A key lesson is that the design and organization of online education should start early in the lifespan of a project.

&#xB7; The pandemic has shown that project risk management is fundamental and necessary in the design stage of a project with risk mitigating actions clearly identified.

&#xB7; Due to the uncertainty of the duration of the pandemic there was some &#x201C;wait and see&#x201D; when at least the option of a blended learning approach entailing an online first phase would have resulted in reduced time compression in the final months.

&#xB7; The recruitment of highly experienced expertise, including management of the online learning environment, certainly helped to capture the attention and interest of the participants.

&#xB7; The training was linked to the formulation and enhancement of operational plans enabling a clear strategic alignment for the program which promoted interest and participation.

&#xB7; Shorter phased online training sessions, combined with group and individual assignments during the week, served to maintain a high level of interest, minimize conflicting time demands and organize learning into manageable bite-sized chaunks.

&#xB7; Stakeholder collaboration can disseminate learning beyond the project partner and strengthen future collobarative platforms.

_**Recommendations**_

&#xB7; The project partner, FBC, made effective use of the TMT to advance its strategy and merits continuing donor support.

&#xB7; Whilst FBC faculty have enhanced knowledge and skills on entrepreneurship, it should be noted that it is firstly a cross-cutting topic, and secondly, that the University of Sierra Leone Business School participated in the facilitation of the training and should be a partner in the continuing development of the entrepreneurial university.

&#xB7; Notwithstanding the covid-19 pandemic, online education and training is here to stay and should be an option, at least in a blended learning design, in future similar TMT.

&#xB7; The TMT program is a useful and flexible mechanism for building capacity aligned with key country priorities; it has resource limitations but should remain available as a tool for development."></actual>

     <actual value="_**Output 1: An entrepreneurial transformation plan for the Fourah Bay College and the Faculty of Engineering and Architecture in particular**_

By agreement it what was decided to combine the Entrepreneurial Transformation Plan (output 1) with the Operational Plan for setting up a Centre for Innovation and Entrepreneurship (output 2) in one document. The reason for this is that FBC has recently set up an Innovation Hub, which included some support provided under a DFID funded project for FBC. The TMT team, led by Dr. Paul Engel, collaborated with the lead consultant from the DFID project and provided further technical advice on the strengthening of the Innovation Hub within the framework of the entrepreneurial university and overall goal of strengthening youth entrepreneurship in Sierra Leone.

&#x2018;Transformation&#x2019; was a key word in the program, in effect _sine qua non_ to the development of an entrepreneurial university. Accordingly, the TMT team paid permanent attention to transformative organisational processes and change management. A specific training session on institutional transformation was also conducted as well as an additional training session on diversity and inclusion was conducted by Dr. Mo Solomon. The latter was considered an important aspect of transformational change. The TMT team believes that ten of the participant group represent a strong core, regarded as change champions, who will provide a driving force for institutional transformation into the future.

_**Output 2: An operational plan for setting up a Centre for Innovation and Entrepreneurship**_

Dr. Engel&#x2019;s TMT sessions were focused on &#x2018;Reading the Business Innovation Eco-System&#x2019; and &#x2018;Strengthening the Innovation Hub at FBC.&#x2019; These further served to provide a way forward for the Innovation Hub in six strategic implementation steps:

1. Strategically position the Hub by linking with current policy objectives

2. Establish a clear profile and visibility by defining the Hub&#x2019;s primary aim and focus

3. Define the instruments that the Hub is going to apply and their costs

4. Define the facilities that the University provides to the Hub and their costs

5. Define knowledge management, networking and learning strategies for key areas

6. Build learn and highlight track record noting the Hub is not starting from scratch.

_**Output 3: The curriculum for an entrepreneurship education program for students**_

All TMT sessions included key topics for inspiring the entrepreneurship curriculum; three were conducted specifically by Dr. Meine Pieter van Dijk, and included lessons from startups as well as comparative analysis of transitions at other fairly similar universities that aimed to become an entrepreneurial university. Dr. Engel contributed lectures on the role of partnership and networking in mobilising and transforming the FBC business (innovation) ecosystem. Emphasis was put on mainstreaming entrepreneurship in the curriculum as well as the sub-topics relating to Entrepreneurship as a standalone course. The approach in the training was not prescriptive, but drew from good practice in such a way that FBC curriculum developers can use a range of materials, approaches and case examples to build the curriculum. Topics covered in the training included individual level focus on the young entrepreneur:

&#x2022; How to start your business

&#x2022; About the competition and the basics of business planning

&#x2022; About costing &amp; record keeping

&#x2022; You as an entrepreneur; The feasibility study

&#x2022; Your business idea; A marketing plan

&#x2022; Form of business, Staff, Legal responsibility and insurance; Costing your product and services

&#x2022; Financial planning and record-keeping; Required start-up capital; Types and sources of start-up capital, or Starting the business 

And the organisational and system level topics relevant in the case of FBC:

1. Changes in the world of entrepreneurship

2. New ways of financing

3. New legal forms

4. The importance of agglomeration

5. The role of innovation and an innovative climate

6. Demand and supply analysis

7. The importance of networking and partnerships

8. Understanding partnership opportunities in Sierra Leone

9. Understanding the Business Ecosystem and FBC&apos;s role in it

10. Direction, demand and supply in the Business Ecosystem

11. Articulating FBC Business Ecosystems

12. Navigating the Business Ecosystem for innovation and scaling your business

_**Output 4: Enhanced knowledge and skills of 20 participants on enterprising and active teaching methods**_

A maximum total of 22 TMT participants attended the training sessions. From post-course feedback and comments it can be concluded that the majority indicated that they have enhanced knowledge and skills as a result of the training.

The fully online TMT training delivery was in itself a relatively new method for the project partners that required a different training style. The session facilitators were throughout informed by &#x2018;reflective practitioner&#x2019; teaching principles and routinely debriefed together after active training to learn from what worked well in the classroom. The TMT team included Sierra Leoneans who understood the local context and worked effectively with the partners in developing good online teaching skills.

_**Output 5: Sharing staff personal experiences and learning**_

During training sessions opportunity was always allowed for questions, discussion and sharing of personal experiences. The conclusions on this planned output should not, however, only be drawn from the formal sessions, as weekly group and individual assignments were addressed through one-to-one online meetings and small group meetings between project partners and facilitators. These entailed not only sharing of experiences, but also discussions about entrepreneurial opportunities and ways to continue the partnerships. During the group assignments an inventory of ongoing entrepreneurial initiatives was established, discussed/analyzed at group level, and shared during formal sessions. It provided a track record to be used to attract funding for the FBC Innovation Hub. These discussions have been continuing post-project."></actual>
