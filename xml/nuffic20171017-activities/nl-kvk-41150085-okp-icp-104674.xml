    <narrative xml:lang="EN">Reporting is an important management tool which is used to inform relevant government officials and other stakeholders about the results being achieved by individual projects and the programme as a whole. 
For project partners, it is compulsory to use the prescribed Orange Knowledge annual report format in order to report on project achievements. The annual report also provides valuable data on the financial situation of the project. Based on an analysis of the project performance in relation to the project output(s) and expected outcome(s), a revision of the project work plan may be suggested by the project partners. The consequences of a possible revision on the project work plan and budget must be made clear in the annual report.
Nuffic monitors outputs and outcomes and not activities . Therefore, the main focus of the annual report must be on the achievement of the project&#x2019;s output(s) and planned outcome(s). The information provided in the annual reports of the projects is used by Nuffic to monitor the progress of the project and to inform the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and other stakeholders about the output(s) and outcome(s) being achieved by individual projects and the Orange Knowledge programme as a whole. 
Please note that if project progress is in accordance with the original planning, reporting requirements are minimal. Only in case of deviations from the planning, more elaboration is demanded.
In the grant award letter, the dates for submission of the annual reports are mentioned. In case of a three-year project, between 5-7 reports are obligatory.
The first report (0) is a very short report which focuses on specific conditions and/or recommendations in the grant. There is no need to report on progress in achieving outputs and outcomes, which is done in the first annual report. As annex to the report 0, the consortium agreements between the partners should be submitted.
The final report must reflect on the entire project period.</narrative>

                Therefore, the consortium is reaching out to agricultural department of the Karen
                Technical Training Institute for the Deaf to see how the adjusted courses can be
                implemented in their institute. Additionally, the consortium is also reaching out to
                Machakos Institute for deaf and blind to find ways on who they can benefit from the
                project results. This institute has already collaborated with one of the project
                partners. For 2021 this result is reported in AKVO.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">The consortium finds it important that marginalized/disadvantaged groups
                also profit from the improved curricula on water and climate smart agriculture.
                Therefore, the consortium is reaching out to agricultural department of the Karen
                Technical Training Institute for the Deaf to see how the adjusted courses can be
                implemented in their institute. Additionally, the consortium is also reaching out to
                Machakos Institute for deaf and blind to find ways on who they can benefit from the
                project results. This institute has already collaborated with one of the project
                partners. Please specify the number of students enrolled in the new curricula at
                these two specialised institutions.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">The consortium finds it important that marginalized/disadvantaged groups also profit from the improved curricula on water and climate smart agriculture. Therefore, the consortium is reaching out to agricultural department of the Karen Technical Training Institute for the Deaf to see how the adjusted courses can be implemented in their institute. Additionally, the consortium is also reaching out to Machakos Institute for deaf and blind to find ways on who they can benefit from the project results. This institute has already collaborated with one of the project partners. For 2021 this result is reported in AKVO.</narrative>
