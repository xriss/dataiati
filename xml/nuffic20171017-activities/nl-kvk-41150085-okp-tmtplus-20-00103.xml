     <actual value="**Output 1: the newly developed entrepreneurship curriculum that is gender sensitive, open to host community &amp; refugee youth and that provides trainees with practical entrpereneurship tools to start their own business is implemented within the VTC of Erbil**

The output is partly realised. During consultations with project partners, we decided to not develop a completely new entrepreneurship curriculum but to enrich the already developed &quot;I am an Entrepreneur&quot; curriculum of UNESCO. Reason for this is that this curriculum is developed in 2018 but has only seen one pilot in the VTC of Erbil. The curriculum is in line with the recently endorsed TVQF (endorsed in 2021) of Iraq. Building further on this curriculum is therefore most logical. The enrichment proces focussed on 1) making the curriculum more practical, 2) adding more attention to entrepreneurial attidues, 3) giving attention to Mental Health and Psycho-social support elements. One big addition to the project proposal is that - in consultation with MoLSA - the newly enriched curriculum will not only be implemented in the VTC of Erbil, but in all 8 VTCs throughout the Kurdistan region. The implementation of the curriculum is planned for 2022 and has not yet taken place.

**Output 2: Teaching staff of VTC Erbil and respresentatives of the other five VTCs apply their newly acquired skills and knowledge in their teaching
**14 teachers have been trained in the TMT+ training sessions conducted in 2021. They have not yet been able to apply these newly acquired skills and knowledge since the implementation of the entrepreneurship course is planned in 2022. These teachers have also not been able to teach other subjects in which they could apply their newly acquired skills as there has been too little financing for TVET in 2021 (which caused a lack of students).

**Output 3: The VTC in Erbil established strong and structural relationships with local private sector organisations: MSMEs, finance institutes, markets, mentors and experts
**Even though the teachers cooperated with succesful entrepreneurs during the curriculum development workshops, this output deserves attention during the next project phase. During the Jordan learning exchange, the VTC coaches decided they will do personal outreach to local entrepreneurs for the mentorship programme. Such outreach is a first step in establishing more structural relationships with private sector organisations. The VTCs currently have very limited relationships with the private sector. Cordaid will focus on connection to finance institutes and markets during the next project phase.

**Output 4: Integration of refugee youth in formal TVET education and private sector
**Consultations between CINOP and UNHCR in Iraq resulted in a mutual agreement that UNHCR will assist us in reaching the most vulnerable refugees with entrepreneurship aspirations before the start of the course in 2022. Their network and trust among the refugee community is needed for outreach activities to stimulate enrolment  in the course. MoLSA has officially opened the opportunity for refugees to participate in the VTCs, so no legal barriers are there. Teaching staff of the VTCs are trained in MHPSS topics in order to deal with cultural differences and trauma in the classroom. The implementation of the entrepreneurship course -with mixed classes of host community and refugee youth- will serve as a pilot to monitor the integration of refugee youth in the formal TVET system.

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">21-01-2022: In the proposal phase of this project, we agreed to work with
                all Vocational Training Centres in the Kurdistan region under the Ministry of Labour
                and Social Affairs. At the time of proposal writing, there were only 6 VTCs.
                However, during the last year there were two new VTCs established under MoLSA. The
                first one was the -already existing and running- Swedish Academy in Erbil who is now
                formally a MoLSA VTC. The second one is the recently opened VTC in Halabja. During
                the first activities of the project, the initial 6 VTCs participated. From September
                2021 onwards, there were 2 training sessions conducted in which all 8 VTCs
                participated. All project partners agreed of the importance of including the newest
                VTC members in order to ensure the benefits of the TMT+ project are open to all
                VTCs. The performance of the VTCs have improved in the topics of: - Teaching staff
                gained knowledge on MHPSS &amp; gender awareness in education - Entrepreneurship
                curricula enriched - Teaching staff gained knowledge on inclusive entrepreneurship
                education for refugees/IDPs - Teaching staff and manager of the VTCs gained
                inspiration on future VTC plans due to a learning-exchange with Jordanian
                organisations</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">21-01-2022: The aim of project partners was to develop an entrepreneurship
                course that was demand-driven and inclusive to all. After initial consultations with
                Dr. Arif (deputy general of MoLSA), an adaptation in the initial plan was made.
                Instead of developing a completely new curriculum, we worked together with UNESCO to
                strengthen and enrich their entrepreneurship curriculum. In 2018, UNESCO developed
                the &quot;I am an Entrepreneur&quot; curriculum for all MoLSA training centres (in KR-I as
                well as Central Iraq). This curriculum was in line with the Technical Vocational
                Qualification Framework (TVQF) which was also developed by UNESCO and which is
                endorsed in 2021. In order to build further upon the work of UNESCO, CINOP worked
                together with their experts in order to further strengthen the existing curriculum.
                The main additions made is the incorporation of MHPSS elements and more practical
                learning objectives &amp; a focus on entrepreneurial attitudes In the next phase of
                the TMT+ project, this curriculum will be piloted in all 8 VTCs.</narrative>

                allowed to travel during day light. We ensured that they were able to travel to
                Erbil and stay in a hotel 1 day before the start of each workshop and 1 day after
                the end of each workshop. This allowed them to participate.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">21-01-2022: Up until now, 14 participants have participated in the TMT+
                workshops. However, more workshops are planned in 2022 and the workshops are seen as
                a complete package. So succesful completion of the TMT+ workshops cannot be
                evaluated at this moment. We are greatly challenged by the number of females
                participating in the workshops. There are several reasons for this: - MoLSA
                directorate has employed only 4 female trainers to provide entrepreneurship training
                in the VTCs (of which 2 participated in the workshops) - The other 2 female trainers
                are on maternity leave, which can take up to a year in Kurdistan CINOP, Cordaid and
                MoLSA are currently discussing together how the number of female entrepreneurship
                teachers can be increased. Especially because female students can benefit greatly
                from female role models when the entrepreneurship course is implemented next year.
                The main idea currently is to bring female entrepreneurs to the classroom for guest
                lecturing, but this idea needs further research.</narrative>

     <actual value="In March 2021, fifteen entrepreneurship coaches of the Vocational Training Centres of MoLSA met each other in the Swedish Academy in Erbil. They travelled from various governates including Sulimania, Erbil, Dohuk, Soran and Garmyan to attend a training on Mental Health and Psycho-social Support (MHPSS) and gender awareness in educational settings. 

The aim of the workshop was to strengthen the capacity of coaches of the VTCs to recognize and give attention to mental health and gender equality topics in the classroom. Youth in Iraq are affected by conflict and crisis, and bring these experiences with them when they enter the classroom. Vocational training is still perceived to be &#x2018;a thing for men&#x2019;, and even though women enrol in vocational training, they often do not apply for vocational jobs. Instead of staying silent about such topics (which are often considered taboo), teachers are inspired to talk about them with their students. Recognition of the mere existence of mental health issues, trauma and gender issues is already a first step in supporting students in their learning process. The teachers will implement these learnings during the implementation phase of the entrepreneurship course. Where the project partners will monitor the application of gender awareness and gender sensitive teaching in the classroom.
