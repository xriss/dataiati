    <narrative xml:lang="EN">Reporting is an important management tool which is used to inform relevant government officials and other stakeholders about the results being achieved by individual projects and the programme as a whole. 
For project partners, it is compulsory to use the prescribed Orange Knowledge annual report format in order to report on project achievements. The annual report also provides valuable data on the financial situation of the project. Based on an analysis of the project performance in relation to the project output(s) and expected outcome(s), a revision of the project work plan may be suggested by the project partners. The consequences of a possible revision on the project work plan and budget must be made clear in the annual report.
Nuffic monitors outputs and outcomes and not activities. Therefore, the main focus of the annual report must be on the achievement of the project&#x2019;s output(s) and planned outcome(s). The information provided in the annual reports of the projects is used by Nuffic to monitor the progress of the project and to inform the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and other stakeholders about the output(s) and outcome(s) being achieved by individual projects and the Orange Knowledge programme as a whole. 
Please note that if project progress is in accordance with the original planning, reporting requirements are minimal. Only in case of deviations from the planning, more elaboration is demanded.
In the Grant Obligations and Conditions, the obligatory dates for submission of the annual/additional reports are mentioned. The final report must reflect on the entire project period.</narrative>

     <actual value="**The extent to which the outputs have been achieved. The activities that have taken place and the most important milestones.**

Note: in our original project design the end date of the project was (and still is) 31-03-2022. We face a Covid-19 related delay and therefore we will submit a BNE before the end of 2021, requesting for a new end date, most likely 6 or 9 months later. In case Nuffic allows us to use 6 or even 9 months more (which we assume), most of the indicators according to the logframe will relate to 2022 and beyond instead of 2021. The below description of results so far, has to be seen against that background.

_Output 1 &amp; 2 according to the project plan / logframe: Trainers are trained on relevant CSA and efficient water management topics and with specific attention for problem-based learning and blended &amp; online teaching methods &amp; Improved trainings at PMU and improved curricula and trainings at the partner universities and TVETs, based on the challenges and needs in the labour market_

After we selected 40 participants with a nice blend of public and private organisations, we already conducted 2 multi-day technical trainings with classroom sessions and practical field sessions. From the side of the provider, Dutch private sector companies with highly relevant technology (e.g. in testing and remote sensing) were involved. The trainees already learned a lot about CSA and water management. With respect to problem-based learning: we offered online introduction meeting, an on-site introduction training &#x2018;activating didactics&#x2019; (2 days) and an online coaching trajectory in order to let the participants prepare their own lecture or training, to be conducted for their target group (students or peers or farmers) in the final phase of the project.

In the course of the summer 0f 2021 in total 4 participants were no longer available for training due to changes in their work. These four then left and 36 remained.

Pictures and other materials available for illustration of the above

- Pictures of classroom sessions, assignments, field days etc.
- Pictures of activating-didactics session
- Group composition of didactical development
- ToT manual

_Output 3 according to the project plan / logframe: Improved training equipment and materials at PMU and KeSU, with emphasis on innovative methods and technology to deal with climate change and water management challenges_

We provided both PMU and KeSU with a meteo station for measuring and monitoring soil, crop and air data in order to ease crop management decisions. Installation of the stations in the field as well as demonstration and explanation, has been integrated in the training sessions. For the second part of the project we&#x2019;re still in dialogue with the two partners which additional equipment and/or materials to purchase, based on optimal effectivity, to be used by the (40) participants and their employers.

- Pictures of meteo station and instruction

_Output 4 according to the project plan / logframe: Strategic partnerships between PMU, partner institutions, universities, affiliated vocational schools and private sector stakeholders (NL and EG) for internships, guest lectures and joint projects_

We came to a signed partnership agreement between KeSU, 2 TVETs in Kafrelsheik Governorate (represented by their Ministry) and Rijk Zwaan Egypt, addressing cooperation in the field of practical student training and internships. This MoU is a pilot and will come to implementation from December 2021 onwards. Based on the first results and experiences, the model will be rolled out with other partners, always in a setting with private and public institutions.

- MoU document
- Pictures of meetings at RZ

_Output 5 according to the project plan / logframe: Student ambassadors with improved awareness of CSA, efficient water management and agricultural sector developments, via a long-term international internship exchange program between Aeres UAS and the Egyptian partner universities_

Due to Covid-19 related travel limitations, this activity has been on hold for the time being. Both Aeres and KeSU didn&#x2019;t allow students to travel so far. From the second semester of the 2021-2022 academic year onwards, we&#x2019;ll start a twinning activity in which Egyptian KeSU students will participate in a minor &#x2018;water management&#x2019; of Aeres, in which the majority of students is Dutch. The initial steps are based on online participation, but as soon as international travel becomes easier, international exchange will be implemented. The MoU between Aeres and KeSU is the main foundation for this exchange program, but also other stakeholders in the project (especially Cairo University) will get the chance to participate.

_Output 6 according to the project plan / logframe: An end seminar for dissemination of_ _acquired knowledge and lessons learned to relevant educational stakeholders, government, farmers and their organisations, with the purpose to upscale all achievements and stimulate employment and youth interest_

++Not yet scheduled++.

_Other achievements:_

We invested much time and efforts in the inception phase (from September 2020 till March 2021) and created a solid and strong coordination team, existing of two Dutch experts (Peter Prins and Jos Leeters) as well as two Egyptian coordinators (Magdi El Samad and Ahmed El Arini). Having two dedicated coordinators in Egypt pays out in the planning and execution phase that followed. In particular the close ties and short communication lines between the coordinators and the (40) participants is very helpful in efficiently and effectively conducting the project.

Although travel limitation hindered physical participation of some of the Dutch business partners so far, involvement of the (Dutch) private sector as such pays out. On the one side companies that already have activities in Egypt (e.g. Rijk Zwaan, HZPC, RMA) and also companies that are new in Egypt (e.g. Eurofins) had valuable contributions in the teaching and learning so far, in particular demonstrating modern inputs and technology. By bridging between our project partners and a trade mission on the occasion of the Sahara trade fair in Cairo (September 2021), initiated by the Netherlands Embassy in Cairo and NABC, we realised an evident spin-off in the Dutch presence in Egypt.
