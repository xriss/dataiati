End hunger and children&apos;s undernourishment, double smallholder productivity and income, and ensure the sustainability and resilience of food production systems by 2030 (SDG 2)

**Long-term impact**

End hunger and children&apos;s undernourishment, double smallholder productivity and income, and ensure the sustainability and resilience of food production systems by 2030 (SDG 2)

**Outcome(s) at project level**

ATVET/HE organizations (In Ghana and in NL) perform better their core tasks, firmly embedded in their environment (in line with Ghanaian/ regional specific labour market needs &amp; aiming at marginalized inclusiveness and gender mainstreaming).

The following proposed outputs will contribute directly to achieving the project outcomes: 
- The Farm Institutes offer gender sensitive CBET education by certified teachers 
- The Farm Institutes implement COTVET accredited new and revised demand-driven, and industry led curricula that are gender sensitive 
- The Farm Institutes possess the organizational and infrastructural capacity to implement the new and revised curricula 
- Entrepreneurship capacity of the Farm Institutes enhanced (for students and the tutors)</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project is developed by a consortium consisting of the 3 public Farm Institutes, Kwadaso Agricultural Colleges, Sunyani Technical University, MSM, InHolland, Q-point, CINOP, Graafschap College and KNUST.  

The project aims to contribute to SDG 2: &#x201C;End hunger and children&apos;s undernourishment, double smallholder productivity and income, and ensure the sustainability and resilience of food production systems by 2030&#x201D; by realizing the following outcome: 

ATVET/HE organizations perform better their core tasks, firmly embedded in their environment (in line with Ghanaian/ regional specific labour market needs &amp; aiming at inclusiveness) 

Our aim is to enhance the educational and organizational capacity of the three Farm Institutes. These are currently challenged, as they can&#x2019;t attract sufficient students. However, the FI&#x2019;s are very important in strengthening the agricultural potential of the Ghanaian population. And therefore this consortium supports them to rebrand the institutes in order to enhance their image, become more attractive for secondary education graduates as well as professional agriculturalists. 

The consortium aims to enhance the sustainability of the partnership through a mix of activities, such as: staff exchange, guest lecturing and joint projects, with special attention of implementing projects that contribute to address the needs of people from marginalized groups and to realise gender equality.</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">Reporting is an important management tool which is used to inform relevant government officials and other stakeholders about the results being achieved by individual projects and the programme as a whole. 
For project partners, it is compulsory to use the prescribed Orange Knowledge annual report format in order to report on project achievements. The annual report also provides valuable data on the financial situation of the project. Based on an analysis of the project performance in relation to the project output(s) and expected outcome(s), a revision of the project work plan may be suggested by the project partners. The consequences of a possible revision on the project work plan and budget must be made clear in the annual report.
Nuffic monitors outputs and outcomes and not activities . Therefore, the main focus of the annual report must be on the achievement of the project&#x2019;s output(s) and planned outcome(s). The information provided in the annual reports of the projects is used by Nuffic to monitor the progress of the project and to inform the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and other stakeholders about the output(s) and outcome(s) being achieved by individual projects and the Orange Knowledge programme as a whole. 
Please note that if project progress is in accordance with the original planning, reporting requirements are minimal. Only in case of deviations from the planning, more elaboration is demanded.
In the grant award letter, the dates for submission of the annual reports are mentioned. In case of a three-year project, between 5-7 reports are obligatory.
The first report (0) is a very short report which focuses on specific conditions and/or recommendations in the grant. There is no need to report on progress in achieving outputs and outcomes, which is done in the first annual report. As annex to the report 0, the consortium agreements between the partners should be submitted.
The final report must reflect on the entire project period.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">24-11-2020: In June 2020, occupational standards have been developed and are validated by COTVET for the following educational programs:
- Livestock and Meat Production
- Agribusiness
- Mechanization and Irrigation
- Tree Crop Production
- Arable Crop
- Poultry Value Chain.

The DACUM workshops and Validation workshops had to be re-designed in online workshops, which required more time than the originally planned face-to-face workshops. The curriculum development steps were therefore delayed. Now that the occupational standards are validated by COTVET, the final curriculum development phase can start.

Tailor made short courses are under development

For 6 short courses accreditation is in its final stages.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">24-11-2020: Even though this sub-output is planned for year 2, in August 2020 a feasibility study has been done by a local expert (Dr. Theophilus Adomako) on academic progression and upward educational mobility for graduates of the farm institutes within the context of the developed Occupational Standards. As students of the farm institutes belong to the most vulnerable groups in Ghana (rural, marginalized), the farm institutes need to become a place of opportunities. The feasibility study is a first step in achieving this goal. This study has been assessed by the HR department of MOFA and was highly appreciated

Effectuation of this study is planned for year 2.</narrative>
