   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The TMT aims to help Dalit to implement its projects more effectively and become a sustainable institution that can provide SRHR services and effectively use gender and SRHR as a crosscutting theme in its efforts to improve the lives of the dalit communities. Since Dalit is one of the pioneers in developing change-makers among the dalit community, this model could be more effective if Dalit increase their capacity in terms of knowledge, skills and attitude and provide professional support to the change-makers.</narrative>

   <description>
    <narrative xml:lang="EN">Reporting is an important management tool which is used to inform relevant government officials and other stakeholders about the results being achieved by individual projects and the programme as a whole. 
For project partners, it is compulsory to use the prescribed Orange Knowledge annual report format in order to report on project achievements. The annual report also provides valuable data on the financial situation of the project. Based on an analysis of the project performance in relation to the project output(s) and expected outcome(s), a revision of the project work plan may be suggested by the project partners. The consequences of a possible revision on the project work plan and budget must be made clear in the annual report.
Nuffic monitors outputs and outcomes and not activities . Therefore, the main focus of the annual report must be on the achievement of the project&#x2019;s output(s) and planned outcome(s). The information provided in the annual reports of the projects is used by Nuffic to monitor the progress of the project and to inform the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and other stakeholders about the output(s) and outcome(s) being achieved by individual projects and the Orange Knowledge programme as a whole. 
Please note that if project progress is in accordance with the original planning, reporting requirements are minimal. Only in case of deviations from the planning, more elaboration is demanded.
In the grant award letter, the dates for submission of the annual reports are mentioned. In case of a three-year project, between 5-7 reports are obligatory.
The first report (0) is a very short report which focuses on specific conditions and/or recommendations in the grant. There is no need to report on progress in achieving outputs and outcomes, which is done in the first annual report. As annex to the report 0, the consortium agreements between the partners should be submitted.
The final report must reflect on the entire project period.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">02-08-2021: 100% of the participants stated that they have learnt at least some thing new from different training. Some training was totally new for them such as Writing Winning Proposal, Advanced SRHR and Resource Mobilization. It is observed that the participants&#x2019; renewed knowledge helped significantly in improving quality of service and management decision making process. However, it is expected, it will take time to have an effect on &#x2018;mind-shift&#x2019; to have an improved and open management system and organizational culture. It is an acculturation process which has been starting in different tiers that were also observed.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">02-08-2021: 95% staff expressed their satisfaction on different training topics. Apart from training delivery, other logistical arrangements were also part of this satisfaction. Most of the participants rated the training as &quot;good&quot; or &quot;very good&quot; in the training evaluations. 
A comment on the Advanced SRHR training is:
&quot; If a person and an organization wants to keep pace with the reality of life, they should participate in the training courses facilitated by MDF&quot; 
Another comment on Advanced SRHR:
&quot; I consider this as a great opportunity that I could participate in this training of MDF and i could learn a lot about the reality from this course. This type of training is very much necessary as it opens our eyes and helps us to support the targeted participants of the projects&quot; 
A comment on M&amp;E training:
&quot; Overall, this training was so essential for our organization in future to implement the field activities&quot;
Comments on Strategic Leadership and Change Management:
&quot;This training is very good. It will make our work sustainable, Thanks MDF.&quot; 
&quot; This training was beyond my expectation. It helps me to know myself scientifically, emotionally and practically. I can say its a mirror training for me. Thanks again, again and again.&quot;</narrative>
