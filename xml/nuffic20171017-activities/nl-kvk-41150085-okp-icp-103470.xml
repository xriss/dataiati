   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Strengthening Agriculture TVET Teacher Training in Kenya and the Netherland</narrative>
  </title>
  <description akvo:type="5" type="1" xmlns:akvo="http://akvo.org/iati-activities">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">For the current OKP proposal a unique partnership has been established between Aeres, TVETA, Egerton University and KTTC. This partnership is furthermore by supported by the Ministry of Education &#x2013; State Department of Technical and Vocational Training, 3 ATVET Institutes in Kenya, Kenyan and Dutch private sector and MDF (in cooperation with Cadena in the Netherlands).

The proposal provides for ATVET teacher training improvement and strengthening at Higher Education and TVET level. This will be achieved through: - teacher training curriculum improvement (including in-service and pre-service programmes); - agriculture training curriculum improvement (at different levels); - design and implementation of ATVET teacher training traineeship programmes and workplace based learning programmes at selected ATVET institutes and private sector companies; - capacity building of teachers and trainers (covering pedagogical, didactical and technical skills); - institutionalization and strengthening of the collaboration with private sector to support curriculum development, traineeship programmes, workplace based learning, overall intensified dialogue and cooperation through the (e-) portal, and cooperation for the development of joint financing mechanisms; - improve quality assurance mechanisms (including pre-service, in-service, traineeships and workplace based learning programmes and registration of training companies) and strengthen TVETA.

Key concepts embedded in the approach and above interventions are CBET, ICT and blended learning, 21st century learning skills, entrepreneurship development, gender sensitiveness, and GAP (including innovations, value chain, and climate smart agriculture) responding to labour market needs, sustainability and the establishment of long-term partnerships.</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">Reporting is an important management tool which is used to inform relevant government officials and other stakeholders about the results being achieved by individual projects and the programme as a whole. 
For project partners, it is compulsory to use the prescribed Orange Knowledge annual report format in order to report on project achievements. The annual report also provides valuable data on the financial situation of the project. Based on an analysis of the project performance in relation to the project output(s) and expected outcome(s), a revision of the project work plan may be suggested by the project partners. The consequences of a possible revision on the project work plan and budget must be made clear in the annual report.
Nuffic monitors outputs and outcomes and not activities . Therefore, the main focus of the annual report must be on the achievement of the project&#x2019;s output(s) and planned outcome(s). The information provided in the annual reports of the projects is used by Nuffic to monitor the progress of the project and to inform the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and other stakeholders about the output(s) and outcome(s) being achieved by individual projects and the Orange Knowledge programme as a whole. 
Please note that if project progress is in accordance with the original planning, reporting requirements are minimal. Only in case of deviations from the planning, more elaboration is demanded.
In the grant award letter, the dates for submission of the annual reports are mentioned. In case of a three-year project, between 5-7 reports are obligatory.
The first report (0) is a very short report which focuses on specific conditions and/or recommendations in the grant. There is no need to report on progress in achieving outputs and outcomes, which is done in the first annual report. As annex to the report 0, the consortium agreements between the partners should be submitted.
The final report must reflect on the entire project period.</narrative>

Supported by the NICHE-KEN283 project a Quality Assurance Framework for the TVET has been developed together with an online TVET MIS. An advanced draft of the Trainer Qualification Framework has been discussed in the kick-off workshop of our OKP project and suggestions for improvement have been in taken into account. 
The project will have a detailed look at QA mechanisms for traineeship-coaching, partnerships, entrepreneurship regarding ATVET teacher training,  once piloting will have concluded. 
In this framework it is important to mention that Egerton University curriculum for ATVET teacher training at Bachelor level is quality assured by the Ministry of Higher Education, Science &amp; Technology.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">25-02-2021: In Kenya all policies and procedures focus on conducive environment for minorities, although no specific funding or measures have been allocated in institutional budgets and plans. The project will focus on the group of youth with special needs and for that, will establish linkages with relevant specialised TVET institutes. In the recruitment and selection of new students, special attention will be paid to the enrolment of this group.</narrative>
