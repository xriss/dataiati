   <description>
    <narrative xml:lang="EN">Reporting is an important management tool which is used to inform relevant government officials and other stakeholders about the results being achieved by individual projects and the programme as a whole. 
For project partners, it is compulsory to use the prescribed Orange Knowledge annual report format in order to report on project achievements. The annual report also provides valuable data on the financial situation of the project. Based on an analysis of the project performance in relation to the project output(s) and expected outcome(s), a revision of the project work plan may be suggested by the project partners. The consequences of a possible revision on the project work plan and budget must be made clear in the annual report.
Nuffic monitors outputs and outcomes and not activities . Therefore, the main focus of the annual report must be on the achievement of the project&#x2019;s output(s) and planned outcome(s). The information provided in the annual reports of the projects is used by Nuffic to monitor the progress of the project and to inform the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and other stakeholders about the output(s) and outcome(s) being achieved by individual projects and the Orange Knowledge programme as a whole. 
Please note that if project progress is in accordance with the original planning, reporting requirements are minimal. Only in case of deviations from the planning, more elaboration is demanded.
In the grant award letter, the dates for submission of the annual reports are mentioned. In case of a three-year project, between 5-7 reports are obligatory.
The first report (0) is a very short report which focuses on specific conditions and/or recommendations in the grant. There is no need to report on progress in achieving outputs and outcomes, which is done in the first annual report. As annex to the report 0, the consortium agreements between the partners should be submitted.
The final report must reflect on the entire project period.</narrative>

     <actual value="All the trainings and workshops have been evaluated through evaluation forms and meetings with participants. The requesting organisation have revealed their gratitude for the trainings we provided. It enabled the requesting organisation to tackle their capacity needs in third gender. In addition, the requesting organisation received training in strategic planning (which was not part of this training). This was much appreciated by the requesting organisation as this enabled them to integrate the gained knowledge within their organisation. 

Through this training the requesting organisation was enabled to establish - for the first time in Afghanistan- a task force to promote justice for the third gender in Afghanistan. Most importantly through this training the requesting organisation was able to involve the key stakeholders to work towards an equal society for all! 

We as Dutch provider are proud and happy to jointly deploy this valuable project. Our cooperation with HBORL is sustained as we have developed a 5-year proposal to develop policies and laws to promote justice for the third gender in Afghanistan."></actual>
