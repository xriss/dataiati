   <narrative xml:lang="EN">**Myanmar is a country with huge water and agriculture-related challenges. However, ground data on e.g. river flows, rainfall and crop growth are only very sparsely available. The training will enhance capacity of YTU educational staff in using Google Earth Engine to analyse water resources and support water management. Technical staff of Department of Meteorology and Hydrology) and the Department of Water resources and Improvement of River systems will participate to gain advanced skills in working with satellite-derived data to support flood monitoring and risk mitigation, water efficiency improvements to enhance food security, and drought monitoring.**</narrative>

   <description>
    <narrative xml:lang="EN">Reporting is an important management tool which is used to inform relevant government officials and other stakeholders about the results being achieved by individual projects and the programme as a whole. For project partners, it is compulsory to use the prescribed Orange Knowledge annual report format in order to report on project achievements. The annual report also provides valuable data on the financial situation of the project. Based on an analysis of the project performance in relation to the project output(s) and expected outcome(s), a revision of the project work plan may be suggested by the project partners. The consequences of a possible revision on the project work plan and budget must be made clear in the annual report. Nuffic monitors outputs and outcomes and not activities. Therefore, the main focus of the annual report must be on the achievement of the project&#x2019;s output(s) and planned outcome(s). The information provided in the annual reports of the projects is used by Nuffic to monitor the progress of the project and to inform the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and other stakeholders about the output(s) and outcome(s) being achieved by individual projects and the Orange Knowledge programme as a whole. Please note that if project progress is in accordance with the original planning, reporting requirements are minimal. Only in case of deviations from the planning, more elaboration is demanded. In the Grant Obligations and Conditions, the obligatory dates for submission of the annual/additional reports are mentioned. The final report must reflect on the entire project period.</narrative>

     <narrative xml:lang="EN">At the start of the training the participants scored their satellite data analysis a 2.7 on a scale of 0 to 5. The experience of the trainers is that knowledge of remote sensing data is improving in Myanmar. For example, YTU has a highly skilled Director and Head of the Remote Sensing department (Dr. Sao Hone Pha). During the first part of the training we dedicated a lecture to Remote Sensing and its methodologies to improve the remote sensing knowledge of the participants. Of course, the rest of the training consisted of working with remote sensing data using GEE which highly improved the participants skills. At the end of the training none of the participants indicated in the feedback poll that their remote sensing skills are particularly lacking.</narrative>

     <narrative xml:lang="EN">To the open question what they&#x2019;ve learned of the individual assignment, seven participants specifically reported that they had gained proficiency in using programming techniques to process geodata. For example, one participant recalled: &#x2018;I learned new things like calculating flood depths using GEE.&#x2019; However, at the question what we can do to improve the training, 4 of 15 particpants responded that we can focus more on programming techniques used in GEE. Also, because the participants gave themselves at the start of the training only a score of 1.7 of a scale from 0 to 5 on programming skills. So, there is still room for improvement!</narrative>

     <narrative xml:lang="EN">Seven participants in the training were explicitly teaching staff of YTU and MMU. Of these seven two came to us before the training and showed us assignments of their students in which GEE was used (because of a previous training). Two teachers of Mandalay University are busy writing a paper on river behavior using GEE. By doing so they can improve their knowledge on river behavior, which can translate into higher quality education.</narrative>

However, nobody gave a lower score than 2 to this question. Therefore, actually 100% of the respondents agreed to the statement that they can use the skills gained during the training in their own work. During the training and at the symposium the participants that presented also made clear that they will use GEE to in their future work. Therefore, the 80% use of GEE is easily reached.</narrative>

Nobody rated this question lower than 3, therefore all participants will use GEE in their work including the government staff. Furthermore, during the trainings and individual assignment we noticed that government staff chose their current projects to integrate GEE in. For example, by adding the information from the satellite images of GEE into hydrodynamic models they use to decide on evacuation priorities when a dam breaks.</narrative>
