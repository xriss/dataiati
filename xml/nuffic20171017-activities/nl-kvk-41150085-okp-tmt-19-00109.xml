     <actual value="Both the Dutch and the Jordanian partners were content with the output of the project. The project evaluation with a response rate = 81%  showed that more than 75 %  of the participants agreed or strongly agreed with the organizational, the duration of the project,  the learned knowledge, and how the project helped to increase the potential of inclusive development, and future collaboration opportunities. The project support survey with a response rate = 90 %   showed that more than 80% agreed that the amount and the provided support from the staff members by the ITC during the different phases of the project and the UJ  in the case studies was about right and good respectively. Besides, the participants  highly valued the coordination, the field work and the UAV implementation part in the project. 
Please find attached the complete evaluation of the project translated to English. 

Remote sensing using satellite images and UAVs is a promising technique to evaluate, monitor and conserve forests and agriculture. By using these techniques, we can scale-up forest and agriculture mapping and monitoring activities to larger areas. The TMT provided the opportunity to broaden the knowledge and skills of 22 members from 5 relevant organizations and one university in Jordan through the intensive training course, the implementation and the provided support by the specialists. This can be seen clearly not only by the implemented ongoing case studies in the project such as case study 1 where more data to be collected in summer 2021, and case study 4 where the inspection will be done regularly using the UAV, but also by including the knowledge in the research activities and university curricula. 

Furthermore, the webinar helped increasing  the awareness of the innovative technology, paved the way to create an enabling environment for UAVs in Jordan, and brought different stakeholders and users together for further collaboration.   

**Lessons learned:** 

- To increase the number of practical and discussions sessions in training. Participants found the sessions very useful for a better understanding of theoretical knowledge.  
- Using real examples and sample data from the same country increased the stimulation and the engagement of the participants in the training.  
- The importance of the harmonization and the teamwork  between the project partners (UT and UJ)
- Continuous communication between the UT and UJ, and the UT and the participants from the different organizations. 
- Continuous support and supervision between the UT and the other participants increased the motivation and improved the outputs
- Taking early action to mitigate and adapt the unexpected changes  in the project. 

**Recommendations for post project period:**

- Continuous contact and collaboration with the participants especially with the UJ
- Coordinate and collaborate with relevant  institutions and stakeholders at the local and regional level"></actual>

     <actual value="All the project&apos;s proposed phases have been implemented and completed, with some deviations from the actual plan as described in the previous sections. Besides,  the project was extended for five months, including the standard Budget Neutral Extension (BNE) for three months. Despite these challenges, we managed to mitigate the impact of unforeseen factors and achieved the project objectives 

**The following outcomes have been achieved in the project:**

1. Preparation phase&#x2013; completed.
Three staff members of ITC prepared the course materials and tailored it and fine-tuned together with the UJ School of Agriculture.  Besides, selecting 22 eligible participants from 5 organizations working on different agricultural, water and forest aspects. The involved local institutions were: NARC, MoA, MoWI, RBG and RSCN. 

2. Delivering the training (TMT) in Jordan- completed
Two staff members of ITC ran a nine working days course related to the use of UAV and satellite RS  in agriculture, water and forestry. The course included topics such as introduction to agriculture and forestry Remote Sensing and UAV Applications, flight planning and processing UAV images, crops mapping and monitoring, forest fires mapping and monitoring, among others. The course had lectures, practical and discussion sessions.
Besides, the course included a one-day demonstration for data collection using UAV in Ajloun Forest Reserve area.
Furthermore, the ITC and UJ staff members ran a workshop regarding the development of materials to include satellite and UAV RS  into the curriculum of the School of Agriculture.

3. Implementation of satellite and  UAV RS learned knowledge on the ground and university curriculum development (completed) 
Six ongoing case studies were chosen by the participants according to the interest and needs of their organizations, in which they applied the skills and the knowledge gained from the training on the ground. 
However, only three full case studies were completed, and the other two were relatively well prepared that reflects the acquired knowledge and skills. One case study could not be applied due to Covid19 situation. For more explanation, please check the external factors and risks section. The Dutch experts provided ongoing support at a distance to the partners from Jordan, including but not limited to, organizing regular online meetings.. 

4. Follow-up, dissemination, and sustainability mission (completed)
Due to COVID-19, it became impossible for the Dutch experts to travel to Jordan to conduct the third phase of the project in person. So we adapted the case studies supervision and following up to an online format, where regular virtual meetings were provided by the ITC staff members. Furthermore, due to the same reason, the open day was also cancelled and replaced by a webinar to increase the awareness,  represent the project and the main outputs. 

**The main outcomes of the project are:**

&#x2022; Five case studies are implemented and reflected UAV and RS technologies&apos; potential to create ecologically sustainable food systems and better water management. The five case studies are: 

- CASE STUDY 1: Can remotely-sensed data detect plant physiology indicators in Ajloun forest reserve?. Team:  The University of Jordan- collaborated with the Rangers) &amp; RSCN
- CASE STUDY 2:  Use of remote sensing to studying the impact of delaying rainfall on the Vegetative Cover at Al-Karak Governorate. Team: NARC 
- CASE STUDY 3:   Use of remote sensing (aerial and satellite data) in forest fire management in Jarash, Jordan.  Team: MoA - Department of Forestry collaborated with UJ &amp; Rangers
- CASE STUDY 4 : Mapping and analysis of vegetation cover patterns and changes in the Royal Botanical Garden (RBG) using satellite images. Team:  RBG and MoWI
- CASE STUDY 5 : Measuring the change of forest area at Ajloun Forest Reserve and its surroundings using NDVI . Team:  RSCN

Please find as an attachment the summary for the case studies. 

&#x2022; Six organizations were strengthened by individual and group training on Remote Sensing applications for sustainable food and water management systems,  where The TMT approached participants from different governmental and non-governmental institutions working on different agricultural, forest and water aspects. 

&#x2022; In total 22 people were trained from the six organizations, whereas the original target was 20 participants. 

&#x2022; Six organizations were strengthened by establishing a collaboration network among them. Besides existing collaborations, three new MoUs formal collaboration have been established. 

&#x2022; One pilot at least to be trained form the UJ by the Rangers following the collaboration letter which was signed on 4 January 2021.

&#x2022; Increased awareness and dissemination of the results by organizing a webinar with around 65 attendees and distributing the recording to 142 registrations 

&#x2022; Paved the way to create an enabling environment for UAVs through the MoUs with the Rangers, the  webinar and by bringing the different organizations together.  

**Related to Jordan university &#x2013; School of Agriculture :**

&#x2022; Two new curricula for revised courses were developed and taught: Forestry and Farm Machinery&amp; technology. 109 students in newly revised study programs graduated in December 2020, and 13 graduated in Summer 2020.  

&#x2022; One new course to be developed and taught in 2021 ( Precision Agricultural)- 300 graduates per academic year

&#x2022; Established stronger collaboration with the UT, other public and NGOs institutions in Jordan. 

&#x2022; Two research methodologies were implemented in the case studies, and two joint publications between organizations are planned to be published.

&#x2022; 1 MoU with the Rangers, and 3 MoUs re-activated with MoA, NARC, and RSCN"></actual>

                Therefore, seats were given for the ten eligible participants with less financial
