    <narrative xml:lang="EN">Reporting is an important management tool which is used to inform relevant government officials and other stakeholders about the results being achieved by individual projects and the programme as a whole. 
For project partners, it is compulsory to use the prescribed Orange Knowledge annual report format in order to report on project achievements. The annual report also provides valuable data on the financial situation of the project. Based on an analysis of the project performance in relation to the project output(s) and expected outcome(s), a revision of the project work plan may be suggested by the project partners. The consequences of a possible revision on the project work plan and budget must be made clear in the annual report.
Nuffic monitors outputs and outcomes and not activities. Therefore, the main focus of the annual report must be on the achievement of the project&#x2019;s output(s) and planned outcome(s). The information provided in the annual reports of the projects is used by Nuffic to monitor the progress of the project and to inform the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and other stakeholders about the output(s) and outcome(s) being achieved by individual projects and the Orange Knowledge programme as a whole. 
Please note that if project progress is in accordance with the original planning, reporting requirements are minimal. Only in case of deviations from the planning, more elaboration is demanded.
In the Grant Obligations and Conditions, the obligatory dates for submission of the annual/additional reports are mentioned. The final report must reflect on the entire project period.</narrative>

1.

Additionally, discussing with partners, the project work plan was collaboratively developed;
2. Fifteen (15) lead experts/ToTs (mentioned in A.E.3) were successfully trained on a short course (11 &#x2013; 20 March 2021) on field diagnostics (Plantwise Module 1) and best practice delivery of advice to farmers through plant clinics (Plantwise Module 2). Through the training, the knowledge and skills of those trained (on diagnosis and management of plant health problems) were assessed to have increased by 12%. Amongst those trained, five were female.
3. Twenty-five (25) plant doctors (mentioned in A.S.1) were successfully trained (22 &#x2013; 30 March 2021) by ToTs, with backstopping by CABI experts, on (i) principles of field diagnosis of plant health problems and providing simplified details/characteristics of pest groups (Plantwise Module 1), (ii) giving good advice to farmers (Plantwise Module 2), and (iii) electronic capture of plant clinic data. Among those trained, three were female.
4. Nine lead experts (selected from among those mentioned in A.E.3) and 15 plant doctors (selected from among those mentioned in A.S.1) were successfully trained (6 &#x2013; 18 June 2021) on (i) the importance of pest management methods that embrace an array of techniques including use of biological control agents as part of Good Agricultural Practices (GAP) and on (ii) diagnostics and management of the invasive fall armyworm"></actual>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">03-11-2021: 1. Faculty of Agriculture of the University of Burundi (FABI)
                was involved in each activity carried out during the reporting period, including
                having one of its staff members trained as a master trainer for plant doctor
                modules. In addition, FABI is represented in the National Steering Committee for
                Plantwise in Burundi. 2. Through the stakeholder analysis carried out in the
                reporting period, TVETs were identified as being the ideal institutions for
                integrating plant doctor modules into their curricula. Consequently, in the next
                reporting period, opportunities will be sought for integrating plant doctor modules
                into the curricula of TVETs - either directly by engaging the technical colleges, or
                indirectly by working with organizations (such as INADES and FIDA (IFAD)) that are
                actively involved in TVET. We very much hope this will be possible but need to see
                whether INADES and/or IFAD could be open to collaboration and willing to support
                this integration.</narrative>

                will see the implementation of the entire Plantwise approach in Burundi), and based
                on experience from elsewhere where Plantwise was implemented, in the long-term, the
