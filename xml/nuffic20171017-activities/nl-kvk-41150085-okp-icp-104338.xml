   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The proposed project must contribute to the following ++objective:++

- End hunger (SDG 2))

The proposed project must contribute to the following ++long-term impacts++:

- Reduce malnutrition; and
- Promote agricultural growth.

++Medium-term impacts++ that will contribute to this:

(I) Education system (TVET/HE) is of good quality, relevant and accessible (SDG 4);

(II) Partnerships between persons and organisations are inclusive and sustainable (SDG 17);

(III) Organisations key to (sectoral) inclusive development of partner countries are strengthened by inflow of enhanced workforce.

++Outcomes:++

- TVET/HE organisations (in the selected partner countries and in NL) perform better their core tasks, firmly embedded in their environment (in line with country / regional specific labour market needs and aiming at inclusiveness). 

1. UEM delivers graduates that will have acquired a multidisciplinary set of competencies that are required to effectively address the cross-sectoral challenges of malnutrition in Mozambique.

2. Providers of training in the area of nutrition and other stakeholders (including i.a. farmer organisations and organisations outside the agricultural sector) collaborate on a range of issues which may include:

- Traineeships for students in nutrition
- Regular consultations concerning the various curriculae in nutrition
- Analysing the labour market needs in the area of nutrition
- Achieving a higher level of coordination and complementarity between key stakeholders with regard to nutrition.

3. Farmer groups that receive training in nutrition, and organisations that employ graduates in nutrition (including farmer organisations, consumer organisations, industry, governmental and non-government organisations) work with students and graduates who are better equipped to facilitate change towards improved nutrition in Zambezi Valley and Cabo Delgado.

To that end, the following ++outputs++ must be achieved by the end of the project:

1. A comprehensive, multidisciplinary master programme in nutrition.
2. A roadmap towards achieving a higher level of coordination and collaboration between faculties and other universities, as well as with the labour market and other institutions that have an important stake in the sector of nutrition.
3. Solutions to knowledge questions of key stakeholders in the area of nutrition developed by groups of students in the 4th semester of the programme. (Key stakeholders include farmers, farmer associations and non-agricultural sector stakeholders).</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">Reporting is an important management tool which is used to inform relevant government officials and other stakeholders about the results being achieved by individual projects and the programme as a whole. 
For project partners, it is compulsory to use the prescribed Orange Knowledge annual report format in order to report on project achievements. The annual report also provides valuable data on the financial situation of the project. Based on an analysis of the project performance in relation to the project output(s) and expected outcome(s), a revision of the project work plan may be suggested by the project partners. The consequences of a possible revision on the project work plan and budget must be made clear in the annual report.
Nuffic monitors outputs and outcomes and not activities . Therefore, the main focus of the annual report must be on the achievement of the project&#x2019;s output(s) and planned outcome(s). The information provided in the annual reports of the projects is used by Nuffic to monitor the progress of the project and to inform the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and other stakeholders about the output(s) and outcome(s) being achieved by individual projects and the Orange Knowledge programme as a whole. 
Please note that if project progress is in accordance with the original planning, reporting requirements are minimal. Only in case of deviations from the planning, more elaboration is demanded.
In the grant award letter, the dates for submission of the annual reports are mentioned. In case of a three-year project, between 5-7 reports are obligatory.
The first report (0) is a very short report which focuses on specific conditions and/or recommendations in the grant. There is no need to report on progress in achieving outputs and outcomes, which is done in the first annual report. As annex to the report 0, the consortium agreements between the partners should be submitted.
The final report must reflect on the entire project period.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">By the end of the project period 1 HEI =(UEM) will have acquired the
                capacity of offer a comprehensive, multidisciplinary programme in nutrition
                involving non-agricultural stakeholders. Risks: A factor which the project parties
                have not under control is the duration of the accreditation process. From experience
                UEM staff knows that it usually takes approximately a year but depending on the
                comments of the reviewers this can be shorter, but also longer.</narrative>
