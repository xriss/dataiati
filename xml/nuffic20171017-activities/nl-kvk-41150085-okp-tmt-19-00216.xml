    <narrative xml:lang="EN">Reporting is an important management tool which is used to inform relevant government officials and other stakeholders about the results being achieved by individual projects and the programme as a whole. 
For project partners, it is compulsory to use the prescribed Orange Knowledge annual report format in order to report on project achievements. The annual report also provides valuable data on the financial situation of the project. Based on an analysis of the project performance in relation to the project output(s) and expected outcome(s), a revision of the project work plan may be suggested by the project partners. The consequences of a possible revision on the project work plan and budget must be made clear in the annual report.
Nuffic monitors outputs and outcomes and not activities . Therefore, the main focus of the annual report must be on the achievement of the project&#x2019;s output(s) and planned outcome(s). The information provided in the annual reports of the projects is used by Nuffic to monitor the progress of the project and to inform the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and other stakeholders about the output(s) and outcome(s) being achieved by individual projects and the Orange Knowledge programme as a whole. 
Please note that if project progress is in accordance with the original planning, reporting requirements are minimal. Only in case of deviations from the planning, more elaboration is demanded.
In the grant award letter, the dates for submission of the annual reports are mentioned. In case of a three-year project, between 5-7 reports are obligatory.
The first report (0) is a very short report which focuses on specific conditions and/or recommendations in the grant. There is no need to report on progress in achieving outputs and outcomes, which is done in the first annual report. As annex to the report 0, the consortium agreements between the partners should be submitted.

     <actual value="**Output 1 Report on labour market survey and needs assessment for curriculum development produced**

- Labour market survey and needs assessment was performed during (1) a stakeholder consultation workshop at the University of Yangon in March 2020 and (2) a survey completed by about 15 water sector organisations and potential employers;

- Based on the results of the survey a detailed report was presented to UY. Outcomes of this were used in the curriculum and course development;

- A Standard Operation Procedure (SOP) for conducting a labour market needs assessment was developed and presented to UY. It describes the steps and process for conducting labour market surveys for future use in the Curriculum Development Program at Environmental &amp; Water Studies Department University of Yangon. We set this up since Periodic assessments will help align the courses and programme with the labour market and community needs.

**Output 2 Co-design of competence-based Bachelor Programme in Water Studies**

- From 9-13 March a co-design workshop took place on the Curriculum Development of a Bachelor Programme for the Environment and Water Studies Department. The workshops were attended by a variety of UY staff, 2 VU experts and TWA experts (via this project), 4 other international experts (funded by another project) and various stakeholders to create the conditions for co-design. It resulted in the 4-year design, agreements on the interdisciplinary approach and formulation of the overall objectives, philosophy of the curriculum and agreements on follow-up steps

- A critical review of the first co-design took place during the online week in August during which UY staff and experts jointly restructured the overall curriculum. 

- The competence-based Bachelor Programme was finalized in December, together with 48 course designs (see output 3). The UY Senate approved the curriculum in January 2021 after which it was accepted by the Ministry of Education.

**Output 3 Design of 24 Courses for BSc programme**

- From April until August UY worked on the design of their courses with distance support/ feedback of international experts. Course outlines contain learning objectives, detailed content, literature as well as course schedule, respective reading materials and detailed activities for each course.

- In August 2020 an online in-depth course-development week took place organized by VU. It was joined by VU and TWA experts as well as experts from Northern Illinois University/ USA, Colorado State University/ USA and Lund University, Sweden. Specific attention was paid to Living Lab approach to &#x2018;expose&#x2019; students to the practical world instead of just class room lectures. Per course we explored whether the living lab approach would be suitable or not.

- International experts focussed on the co-design of courses of which UY had not yet sufficient knowledge about.

- In the end this resulted in the design of 48 courses (instead of 24) of which the project supported 40:

- 8 foundational courses (Myanmar, English, Mathematics): note, developed by other departments

- 29 core courses

- 10 elective courses

- 1 BSc thesis 

**Output 4 Improved competencies on innovative teaching methods**

Instead of a 5-day study tour to the Netherlands for a limited number of 6 staff we replaced this with online activities to improve the competencies of 9 staff (note: 2 staff members were only appointed after our activities took place). We organized:

- Tailor-made &#x2018;Teaching for Learning Programme&#x2019; consisting of 6 online sessions. The content of the course was dedicated to enable the participants with knowledge and experience to design a practice based curriculum. The participants were actively engaged in reading and discussing the main principles of practice based education throughout the course. The participants experienced practiced based education themselves in a variety of activities and reflected on these throughout the course. In addition information was given about how to make knowledge clips and use them in teaching. Participants made their own knowledge clips and together the group reflected on these.

- In addition we made an inventory among staff of content topics which they believed to be important for their diverse staff to get acquainted with in order to teach the curriculum. We identified the following 6 topics: Hydrology, Climate Change, Disaster Risk Reduction, GIS, Remote Sensing and Water Governance. Due to the military coup our planned online learning sessions could not take place. We have replaced them with the development of teaching clips on both the content itself, and how a course on the topic can be designed. The lecturers can access these clips via the Climate Lab Asia at their own pace.

**Output 5 Accredited Bachelor Degree**

The new Bachelor Degree Programme was approved by the University Senate in January 2021 after which it was accepted by the Ministry of Education. The Minister of Education expressed to UY to be very satisfied with the set-up of the interdisciplinary, practise-based oriented curriculum. The curriculum is however not yet being offered to students. After the military coup only a very low number of youth have shown interest in academic studies due to which the Ministry has decided to only offer existing curricula and not new ones yet. The launch of the new curriculum is now planned in December 2022. 

**Output 6 Water Hub established**

&#x25AA; An international reference study was performed and presented to UY with best-practices showing how top universities around the world support students to connect with the labour market.

&#x25AA; A functional design for an online and offline Water Hub was co-developed with the team of UY and with input from several local employers, featuring a range of potential career orientation services that will support students to develop the practical skills and competences needed to make a good start with their career.

&#x25AA; Three _Letters of Intent_ were signed by local employers expressing their wish to participate in the UY Water Hub, for example by offering internships, providing guest lectures and workshops, host company visits, etc.

We jointly explored the concept of a Living Lab approach during the tailor-made training for Teachers. We propose to create a Living Lab, using the _Thaketa Climate Adaptation Pilot Project_ (Partners voor Water project) as a unique and exciting learning environment for teachers and students. Stakeholders in this project include Yangon Region Government, YCDC, local community (residents, businesses), international companies, local companies, World Waternet and the Dutch government. Objective of the Living Lab is to create practise-based education for teachers and students, thereby making use of real-life examples in their own nearby environment."></actual>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">13-08-2021: Both UY, VU Amsterdam and TWA were strengthened by participating in this TMT. For UY it&apos;s already obviously stated in the progress report. VU Amsterdam staff became better capable in guiding foreign staff to develop competence based curricula. TWA coordinated the labour market survey and gained more experience in that.
In addition 5-6 organizationas actively participated in the curriculum design and became more aware on their role and importance as &apos;water stakeholders&apos; in the educational process.
5-6 stakeholders...</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">13-08-2021: During the TMT activities we worked with 9 staff. In February another 2 staff were recruited but by that time they could not benefit anymore from TMT activities. All 9 staff who did actively participate were all able to apply their newly acquired competencies. We therefore more than regret that out of these 9 only 1 staff member has remained after the military coup.</narrative>

In this case however gender equality would imply having more male staff. Since the recruitment process is coordinated by the Ministry it was beyong our span of control to influence this."></actual>

     <actual value="We have observed changes in 4 different areas among the staff of the department:

1. they all have obtained an interdisciplinary focus by integrating water &amp; environment

2. all staff have become more than enthusiastic about learning about and applying interactive teaching methodologies

3. the course designs are set up in such a way that include practise-oriented teaching which is a new attidude for teaching staff

4. during the  Tailor-made &#x2018;Teaching for Learning Programme we observed many changes in the soft skills of the staff: they became more assertive, open to ask questions, they felt comfortable working on home work assignments and improved working as a team and became more confident in presenting.
