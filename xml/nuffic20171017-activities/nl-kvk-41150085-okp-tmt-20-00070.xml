     <actual value="The lowland areas of South Kalimantan province have diverse biophysical, environmental and socio-economic conditions. The rivers, canals, swamps and specific soil and water management characteristics offer unique opportunities for socio-economic development but also pose challenges for sustainable development. For example, tidal lowlands in Indonesia including those in South Kalimantan have developed over the last 50 years. While these development efforts have contributed to enhanced agricultural production and socio-economic development, there are also many issues such as acidification of soils, watershed degradation and water quality problems. The climate change is expected to impact water and agriculture sector, with possibility of more extreme floods and drought events. The soil and water management challenges require integrated management approaches, which are adopted in the water policy and institutional arrangements in Indonesia but face challenges in successfully putting them into practice. Moreover, academia and water sector organizations need capacity enhancement in acquiring advanced knowledge, tools and skills to successfully address the current and emerging soil and water related challenges in the sustainable lowland development. The University of Lambung Mangkurat realizes these challenges and has aims to become a centre of excellence of wetland environment in Indonesia. The university aims to improve its human resource capacity in lowland development, become a centre of excellence in tidal lowland development, and support the Indonesian government in improving and stabilizing the national food security by improving soil and water management strategies in tidal lowland areas. Moreover, the Orange Knowledge Programme&#x2019;s Country Plan of Implementation for Indonesia also focuses on addressing water and food security related issues in Indonesia. 
This training programme has made an important contribution to address the capacity development needs of the University of Lambung Mangkurat as well as of the important government institutions and ministries working on water, agriculture, forestry and environment related matters in South Kalimantan. The following concluding statements highlight the specific contribution of this tailor-made training programme in addressing the capacity development needs in South Kalimantan, Indonesia.
&#x2022;	The flexible and pro-active risk management approach was successfully followed, which helped to tailor the courses to online settings in response to restrictions due to COVID 19 Pandemic. The flexible response of NUFFIC in providing the extension for this training programme was instrumental in successfully achieving the training objectives.
&#x2022;	The joint efforts from the project coordination team from IHE Delft and University of Lambung Mangkurat were instrumental in developing a tailor-made programme to address priority needs and issues related to soil and water management for the tidal lowlands. The designed programme was very well aligned to address the capacity development needs of the region including alignment with OKP&#x2019;s country plan of implementation.
&#x2022;	COVID 19 pandemic was a major bottleneck in the implementation of face to face training as originally planned. However, an alternative approach was developed, and the trainings were successfully designed and delivered following an online mode. The trainings were successfully delivered in three online parts from 21 September 2020 to 02 June 2021. 
&#x2022;	The selected staff of University of Lambung Mangkurat and six other water sector and related organizations were equipped with advanced knowledge, tools and skills on the management of soil, water, environment, agricultural and socio-economic issues in the tidal lowland areas of Indonesia.
&#x2022;	The online communication and teaching using Zoom went very well. There were no major issues encountered related to internet connections by the participants both in their home and office environments. The good internet facilities in the Netherlands and Indonesia contributed in the smooth delivery of the programme in an online setting.
&#x2022;	Both IHE Delft and University of Lambung Mangkurat enhanced their online education experience through this training programme. The experience will contribute in delivering the online education at both institutions in the future.
&#x2022;	The course materials are provided to the training participants and is also archived at University of Lambung Mangkurat, which could serve the future use of these materials in education at University of Lambung Mangkurat and capacity development of water related institutions besides the potential use in the future by IHE Delft in the educational and capacity development programmes for Indonesia and beyond. 
&#x2022;	The collaboration between IHE Delft and University of Lambung Mangkurat is established through this training programme. This is the first project that is jointly developed and implemented by the two institutions. Both institutions have identified areas of future collaboration, and a letter of intent is signed by both parties to develop future collaboration.  
&#x2022;	The training provided a very useful opportunity for University of Lambung Mangkurat to improve the networking with water sector organizations in South Kalimantan. This was demonstrated by enhanced communication and involvement of training participants from several organizations.
&#x2022;	The training was highly appreciated by the participants, and they affirmed the achievement of the learning objectives outlined for this training programme. The participants appreciated the new knowledge, tools and skills gained during this training programme, and found the training useful to improve their professional work. Most of the participants (over 80%) were highly satisfied with the course and rated it good. 

In addition to above mentioned conclusions, following recommendations are made for the University of Lambung Mangkurat and water sector organizations in South Kalimantan.
&#x2022;	Make a good plan to improve communication and dissemination of the gained knowledge and skills through this training programme, which could include activities such as organizing training workshops, short courses, seminars/webinars on soil and water management for the tidal lowlands in Indonesia.
&#x2022;	Building on the established networks, enhance efforts to improve coordination among academia, water sector organizations and stakeholders including policy and decision makers as well as communities.
&#x2022;	Both IHE Delft and the University of Lambung Mangkurat are advised to pro-actively look for developing joint educational, research and capacity development activities. 
&#x2022;	To monitor long-term outcomes and impacts of this training, University of Lambung Mangkurat can develop an impact evaluation plan, which could focus on how the gained knowledge and skills have been used within the university for education, research and societal outreach. The programme could also include communication with water sector organization to monitor the impacts of this training, and also assess their education and capacity development needs.
&#x2022;	The field activities were not possible due to COVID 19 pandemic. It is recommended to develop pilot field scale applications of the gained knowledge and skills in the future, which could be jointly developed by the participating institutions."></actual>

     <actual value="The project successfully achieved the two expected outputs as discussed below.
Output 1: University of Lambung Mangkurat staff is able to understand the concept, approach and modelling of Soil and Water Management of Tidal Lowlands especially adaptation to climate change and improved their land productivity;
The first output was achieved by delivering a well-designed online training programme in three parts. The delivery of these training parts was done online because COVID pandemic made it impossible to do face to face training in South Kalimantan. The successful delivery of the three inter-connected online components was an important milestone towards the achievement of the output 1. A brief description of the course topics is given below, which indicates the alignment of the course contents with the expected output 1. During this training, the advanced knowledge and skills were transferred on the selected topics with contextualization to the Indonesian situation by presenting case studies and tailored exercises.
Training Part 1 (21-23 September, 2020): The main topics included potential and constraints of tidal lowlands in Indonesia; peat soil and water management; and hydrology and water balance with focus on agriculture. The teaching activities included theory and exercises, with contents tailored to the Indonesian context.
Training Part 2 (4-18 March, 2021):  The main topics covered in part 2 were related to lowland development in the Netherlands and Indonesia; integrated water resources planning with focus on global overview and Indonesian context; climate change impacts with case study discussion for the water management systems in the lowland areas; soil and water management to address acidic conditions; environment and ecology of tidal lowlands with case study discussion from Indonesia; land and water management for socio-economic development including challenges and opportunities for socio-economic development in South Kalimantan; theory and case study on open water, groundwater and hydraulic structures and canal blocking in lowland areas. Additionally, the participants worked in teams on case studies from Indonesia, which were closely related to the topics addressed in this part of the training, and they made presentations of their work. 
Training Part 3 (24 May to 02 June 2021): The main topics in this final part were related to field survey and investigation of tidal lowlands; soil and water conservation in a watershed management perspective; measures related to fire in tidal lowland, canal blocking, monitoring and evaluation; hydrotopography, drainability and irrigability of tidal lowland areas; Overview of DUFLOW model for lowland operation and management; introduction and hands on training on FAO&apos;s Aquacrop model. In addition to learning the Aquacrop model, the participants worked in teams on evaluating soil and water conservation measures for Indonesia, and presented their selected case studies.

As mentioned before, due to COVID 19 pandemic all the training parts were delivered online. There were two field visits planned, which were cancelled because travelling was not possible due to COVID related restrictions. 
Nevertheless, delivery of the training in online format contributed to the successful achievement of the first output.

Output 2: University of Lambung Mangkurat will be able to train and disseminate the knowledge gained during the training to the stakeholders, consultants and decision makers involved in improving water management systems in tidal lowland.

As indicated in the training proposal, besides the staff of the University of Lambung Mangkurat, participants were invited from other organizations as well. The training programme originally aimed to train 20 participants (10 males and 10 females). However, during implementation phase, it was decided to invite more participants, and efforts were made to involve several water sector and related organizations from the South Kalimantan Province. The online format made it possible to invite more than 20 participants without incurring much additional costs and administrative arrangements. In total, 33 participants were nominated for this training. However, 23 (14 males; 9 females) out of 33 participants could successfully complete the training; 10 of them were from University of Lambung Mangkurat and rest of them were invited from various government agencies. The selection of participants was mainly based on the experience related to tidal lowland management (e.g. soil, water, agriculture, forestry, and environment). The female participation was ensured with about 40 % representation of women.  
Furthermore, the staff of University of Lambung Mangkurat took more responsibility in coordination of the online training as the IHE staff could not travel to Indonesia due to COVID 19 pandemic. The University of Lambung Mangkurat staff also shared more responsibility related to teaching compared to original planning, which helped to improve local contextualization of the advanced knowledge provided by the Dutch training provider (IHE Delft). The University of Lambung Mangkurat staff took a pro-active approach in communication with the stakeholders and decision makers involved in the soil and water management systems in tidal lowland areas. There was a high level of interest in the training programme from these local stakeholders and decision makers, which resulted in extending the invitations to these organizations to send their staff for this training programme. The interaction among the participants from University of Lambung Mangkurat and other government agencies was very useful in strengthening the communication among academia and water sector organizations in the region.
All the training materials (e.g. power point presentations) were made available to the training participants, which they can use for their own benefit but also for wider dissemination within their own organization and beyond. The University of Lambung Mangkurat staff indicted that the gained knowledge and skills could be used improve their teaching curriculum and research related to water management in the tidal lowland areas. The improved knowledge and communication with local partner were helpful for University of Lambung Mangkurat to move a step forward to providing academic leadership on addressing water related issues in the region.
These efforts and activities contributed in the achievement of second output expected from this training programme. The successful achievement of the course objectives was confirmed by the results of the evaluation survey, for example over 80% of the participants reported that the training objectives were successfully achieved. 
The details on the course schedule and some pictures taken during the online delivery of the training are provided in the annexes given in the attached file."></actual>

                programme. However, the question was asked in a follow up survey. The response rate
                was very low (only 5 participants responded. Four respondents (80%) indicated that
                they have applied the knowledge (e.g. in teaching and research). One respondent

     <actual value="Although it was very difficult to measure the changes during the project period, the participants indicated the knowledge and skills gained through this course were useful in improving their professional competences. The evaluation results show that the participants were satisfied with the training and gained new knowledge and skills. For example, some of them reported that the gained knowledge and skills will be very helpful in improving their teaching, research and practical work.
However,  this question was asked in a follow up survey after the course completion. The response rate was very low (only 5 participants responded). Majority of the respondents (80%) positively responded to this question, for example indicating ability to understand things from different perspectives, and contribution to improve confidence in explaining the subject. One respondent indicated that the changes were difficult to capture due to short duration after the course completion."></actual>
