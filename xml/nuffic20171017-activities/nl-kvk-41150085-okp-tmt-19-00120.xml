     <actual value="**Extent to which capacity building needs have been addressed**. Although teachers of the relevant UP departments (agronomy, economics and rural sociology) master basic concepts for business development and entrepreneurship, they did not all have the required knowledge and skills that are needed to accompany small and medium enterprises. This situation slows down the ardor and dedication of teachers to educate and train students as future entrepreneurs and coach local entrepreneurs who want expand their business. This joint UP-KIT TMT project provided 22 university teachers of the most relevant departments with the required concepts, approaches and practical methods and tools. According to the results of the participants&#x2019; evaluations of the two training-workshops, the TMT project succeeded in achieving this aim as initially defined by the university. 

In addition, the curricula of relevant UP departments include modules on business development and entrepreneurship in general, but not specifically for the agrifood sector. Various teachers asked to be trained in concepts and methods that are linked to socio-economic realities of the largely informal agri-food sector and its potential to contribute to food and nutritional security. The training-workshops therefore focused on the local agrifood sector (e.g. quick scan study prior to the trainings) and included exchanges between teachers and local entrepreneurs (field visits, interviews, and joint practical exercises during trainings). Although the trained teachers indicated that they will &#x2018;quite/highly likely&#x2019; apply the required knowledge and skills, it also depends on UP senior management whether this will be materialized. This aim of the TMT project was thus partially achieved.

**Lessons learnt**. The results from the participants&#x2019; evaluations of the trainings revealed that they very much appreciated the exchanges with local agrifood entrepreneurs, which allowed them to be acquainted with the daily reality of women or young entrepreneurs. Consequently, the programme of the second training was built upon exercises around real-life business cases. 

Lessons learnt from this experience: (i) extensive participatory evaluations are key and instrumental in adapting training trajectories that focus on practical tools and skills; and (ii) capacity strengthening goes beyond &#x2018;training&#x2019; (the basic activity of this TMT project) and should include facilitation of stakeholder interaction with a clearly defined training objective.

The changes made to the TMT project, which already started (Oct 2019) before the COVID-19 pandemic, forced KIT as the training service supplier to work from a distance; i.e. relying on local consultants and trainers and using digital communication tools. 

Lessons learnt from these adaptations: (iii) the training service supplier (KIT) needs to have an extensive in-country network of experienced trainers, on whom it can rely (commitment, availability and quality); and (iv) both the requesting organization (UP) and service supplier (KIT) need to strengthen staff&#x2019;s capacity in using digital platforms and tools for training purposes.

**Recommendations for the University of Parakou**. Based on the above-mentioned lessons learnt, (i) the relevant UP departments could strengthen linkages with local networks and associations of (female and young) entrepreneurs in order to institutionalize exchanges between teachers and entrepreneurs ; and (ii) UP should invest in collective equipment for facilitating the use of digital platforms and tools for education and training purposes (NB: during the TMT trajectory, the UP TMT coordinator and trainees relied upon their personal equipment for KIT back-stopping)."></actual>

     <actual value="Prior to the 1st training-workshop, a small team of UP researchers conducted a quick scan of the local agri-food sector by assessing the demand for capacity strengthening (interviews of 60 entrepreneurs; 59% women and 58% youth) and the supply of courses and training by UP (15 teachers interviewed). The results of these interviews allowed for asserting the training topics that were identified in the project proposal, and prioritizing topics. Target value = 1 field study report; actual value = 1 field study report (100%).

The UP and KIT jointly organized two training-workshop: the first one focused on basic concepts and approaches for agri-food enterprise development and the second one on practical methods and tools for proving business advice to entrepreneurs. The programme of the 2nd training mainly consisted of practical exercises for which four business owners were participated in the training. Target value = 2 trainings; actual value = 2 trainings (100%).  

Strictly speaking, no training guidelines were produced. It was agreed upon with the UP TMT coordinator to produce instead technical sheets (9 sheets) that briefly explain the methods and tools. This allows teachers to adapt the material and integrate it into courses for which already pedagogical guidelines exist. Furthermore, all participating teachers received the material (background literature, practical exercises) that was used for the training-workshops. Target value = 3 training guidelines; actual value = 0 guidelines (0%).

During the training-workshops, especially during the second one, exercises were organized around the use of business development tools. An adapted Business Model Canvas (BMC) formed the basic conceptual framework for these tools. Target value = 10 practical exercises; actual value = 11 practical exercises (110%).

Immediately after each training-workshop, participants individually evaluated the training on of four sets of criteria: the relevance of concepts and tools discussed; their satisfaction and the perceived level of innovation; the expected use of the knowledge and skills acquired; and the quality of training-facilitation approach. The activity (closing capitalization workshop) replacing the initial final activity (coaching of young entrepreneurs by trained teachers) was not a training activity that required an extensive evaluation by the participants; although the workshop was globally evaluated as &#x2018;good&#x2019;. Target value = 3 evaluations realized by trainees; actual value = 2 evaluations realized by trainees (66%).

The evaluations revealed that participants (teachers) very much appreciated face-to-face exchanges with enterprises (field visits, interviews and joint exercises). For many of them, it was a first opportunity to discuss with entrepreneurs on the difficulties they face and explore together options for improving the situation.  

More field visits (agri-enterprises) were initially planned for the 2nd training-workshop but the number had to be limited because of COVID-19 measures still inforce; i.e. enterprises were only allowed a small number of visiting teachers which required organizing logistics allowing for all teachers to participate in the visits. Target value = 6 agrifood enterprises visited; actual value = 4 agrifood enterprises visited (66%)."></actual>

       <narrative xml:lang="FR">19-03-2021: Through the evaluation of the 1st training-workshop, all
                participants mentioned at least one concept, approach or method/tool that was new to
                them. The most cited new topics were the business incubation experience of the
                Start-Up Valley Foundation of the University of Abomey-Calavi (mentioned by 38% of
                the participants); the concept of Base of the Pyramid (market segment of consumers
                with low purchasing capacity; also mentioned by 38%); and the concept of agri-food
                value chains (mentioned by 19% of the participants). At the end of the 2nd
                training-workshop, 65% of participants mentioned at least one tool that was new for
                them. This lower percentage as compared to the 100% of the 1st training-workshop
                might be explained by the fact that the majority of the trainees (13 out of 20) also
                participated in the 1st training-workshop. The topics that were mainly identified as
                new were the Business Canvas Model (BMC; mentioned by 25% of the participants);
                territorial marketing (8%); and coaching-advice of entrepreneurs (also mentioned by
                8% of the participants). On average, 82.5% of the participants stated that they have
                acquired new knowledge (concepts and approaches) and skills (use of methods and
                tools).</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="FR">19-03-2021: When issuing the call for participation, the appointed UP TMT
                coordinator particularly targeted female staff in order to raise their interest.
                However, the relatively low number of female staff in the relevant UP departments
                &#x2013; an estimated 15% of total staff - remains a structural constraint for equal
                participation of female teachers in training-workshops. During the two
                training-workshops, the participants were equipped with tools allowing for taking in
                account gender (e.g. framework for assessing women&#x2019;s economic empowerment,
                inclusive agribusiness and agrifood enterprise development). Finally yet
                importantly, women-led enterprises were visited during the 1st training-workshop and
                female business owners participated in 2nd training-workshop and the closing
                workshop. The participants of the 2nd training-workshop used their business cases
                for testing the tools. Through these exercises, female business owners benefitted
                from advice given by teachers-in-training.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="FR">25-03-2021: A total of 22 teachers of the University of Parakou (UP)
                participated in the two training workshops; the 1st training-workshop in November
                2019 (focus on theory and concepts) and the 2nd in August 2020 (focus on practice
                and tools). Furthermore, 4 business owners participated in the 2nd
                training-workshop. These 26 participants included 16 male and 6 female teachers and
                2 male and 2 female business owners. 10 teachers (6 men and 4 women) and 3 business
                owners (2 men and 1 woman) participated in the 3rd closing workshop. These
                participants were carefully selected in line with the aim of this last workshop,
                i.e. finalizing the tools used during the 2nd training-workshop and formulating
                recommendations for institutionalizing the results of the two training-workshops. On
                average 35% female teachers participated in both training-workshops, but only 3
                female teachers (19%) were present in both training-workshops. This is 31% below the
                target. In fact, female professors are still a minority of UP staff; an estimated
                15%.</narrative>
