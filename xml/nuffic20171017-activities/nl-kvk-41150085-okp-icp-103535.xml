   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project has to contribute to the following impact and must achieve the outcomes and outputs as stated below.

The project must contribute to the following objective:
- Contribute to end hunger (SDG2).

The proposed project must contribute to the following long-term impacts: 
- Promote agricultural growth;
- Create ecologically sustainable food systems;
- Water efficiency in agriculture increased.

Medium-term impacts that will contribute to this: 
(I) Education system (TVET/HE) is of good quality, relevant and accessible (SDG4);
(II) Partnerships between persons and organiations are inclusive and sustainable (SDG 17);
(III) Organisations key to (sectoral) inclusive development of partner countries are strenthened by inflow of enhanced workforce. 

Outcome:
(A) TVET/HE organisations (in the selected partner countries and in NL) perform better their core tasks, firmly embedded in their environment (in line with country/regional specific labour market needs &amp; aiming at inclusiveness). 

To that end, the following outputs must be achieved by the end of the project:

(1) Increase the quality of the educational programmes of ATVETs in the horticultural sector.

1.1 A-TVET staff carried out a labour market needs assessments for the horticultural industry and an educational assessment on existing (agriculture) teaching methodologies and curricula at relevant Horticulture Training Institutions;
1.2 Revised and newly developed accredited (by TVETA and Qualified by KNQA) market driven and gender sensitive (blended learning) curricula and short courses with a specific focus on application of practical skills through incubation projects in collaboration with the private sector and TVETA and KNQA, and TVET-CDACC;
1.3 ATVET training infrastructure and facilities can support practical field trials by students and blended learn&#xED;ng online courses;
1.4 Students &quot;trained on the job&quot; as part of the incubation projects that are integrated in the horticulture curricula
1.5 Career guidance programme integrated in curricula developed and implemented.

(2) Increased institutional capacity to implement gender transformative Competence Based horticulture programmes.

2.1 A-TVET staff trained on agricultural teaching skills to review, develop, deliver, and access competency-based, market relevant and inclusive curicula together with private sector;
2.2 A-TVET staff trained on practical skills and learning processes, to be able to facilitate practical skill development among students and incubation projects with a focus on application of skills;
2.3 Blended learning skills of A-TVET staff improved to develop and implement e-learning teaching methods;
2.4 A-TVET management and staff trained on gender mainstreaming and inclusivity in teaching;
2.5 Training of Trainers program (TOT) for ATC&apos;s, County polytechnics, TVCs, other TVETs and the horticulture community in the neighbourhood of the 3 ATVETS to roll out lessons learned.

(3) Established and sustained triple helix horticulture innovation platform.

3.1 TVETS, public, private stakeholders and sector organizations (FPEAK, HCDA) establish working groups and e-platforms per horticulture commodity under the platform and develop a strategy for a horticulture Triple helix innovation platform (alumni, youth, women and marginalized groups are represented in the platform);
3.2 An accredited &quot;work place program&quot; for teaching and training staff and apprenticeship programme for students in collaboration with the horticultural industry (and alumni) developed with help of the triple helix platform;
3.3 A satellite program for practical training per horticulture commodity at selected locations (model farms, in-company or public fields) is developed in collaboration with private sector, alumni, educational institutions and (county)government, with help of the triple helix platform;
3.4 Teaching staff &quot;trained on the job/industry attachments&quot; as part of the &quot;work place program&quot; and &quot;satellite program&quot; in the horticultural industry with focus on practical skills;
3.5 Students &quot;trained on the job&quot; as part of the &quot;satellite program&quot; and &quot;apprenticeship programme&quot; in the horticultural industry with focus on practical skills;
3.6 Mentorship programme as part of the horticulture triple helix platform to support incubates &amp; youth in their innovation project or starting Enterprise;
3.7 Female talent development program at ATVETs is developed in collaboration with the industry and implemented;
3.8 Monitoring and evaluation mechanisms at ATVETs strengthened, to monitor practical skill competence of students (and staff), including tracer studies and out of school learning processes (apprenticeship program and satellite program).</narrative>

  <description akvo:type="5" type="1" xmlns:akvo="http://akvo.org/iati-activities">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project will concentrate on the horticulture sector in Kenya. It is based on the fundamental notion that improving the quality and employability of A-TVET graduates should be based on the needs in the labour market. Bukura Agricultural College (BAC), Egerton University (EGU) and Latia will be capacitated to introduce gender sensitive and market driven (blended learning) programs and to perform inclusive value chain management, food safety, production teaching, technology transfer and industry extension (incl. apprenticeships).  The project will focus on three main output areas: curriculum review and development, institutional capacity development at the 3 ATVETs and the establishment of a triple helix horticulture innovation platform in Kenya. The project pays specific attention to inclusion of women and disadvantaged groups. Labour market relevance and publicprivate partnerships (Kenya-Dutch) are key elements of the project approach.</narrative>

   <description>
    <narrative xml:lang="EN">Reporting is an important management tool which is used to inform relevant government officials and other stakeholders about the results being achieved by individual projects and the programme as a whole. 
For project partners, it is compulsory to use the prescribed Orange Knowledge annual report format in order to report on project achievements. The annual report also provides valuable data on the financial situation of the project. Based on an analysis of the project performance in relation to the project output(s) and expected outcome(s), a revision of the project work plan may be suggested by the project partners. The consequences of a possible revision on the project work plan and budget must be made clear in the annual report.
Nuffic monitors outputs and outcomes and not activities . Therefore, the main focus of the annual report must be on the achievement of the project&#x2019;s output(s) and planned outcome(s). The information provided in the annual reports of the projects is used by Nuffic to monitor the progress of the project and to inform the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and other stakeholders about the output(s) and outcome(s) being achieved by individual projects and the Orange Knowledge programme as a whole. 
Please note that if project progress is in accordance with the original planning, reporting requirements are minimal. Only in case of deviations from the planning, more elaboration is demanded.
In the grant award letter, the dates for submission of the annual reports are mentioned. In case of a three-year project, between 5-7 reports are obligatory.
The first report (0) is a very short report which focuses on specific conditions and/or recommendations in the grant. There is no need to report on progress in achieving outputs and outcomes, which is done in the first annual report. As annex to the report 0, the consortium agreements between the partners should be submitted.
The final report must reflect on the entire project period.</narrative>
