    <narrative xml:lang="EN">Reporting is an important management tool which is used to inform relevant government officials and other stakeholders about the results being achieved by individual projects and the programme as a whole. 
For project partners, it is compulsory to use the prescribed Orange Knowledge annual report format in order to report on project achievements. The annual report also provides valuable data on the financial situation of the project. Based on an analysis of the project performance in relation to the project output(s) and expected outcome(s), a revision of the project work plan may be suggested by the project partners. The consequences of a possible revision on the project work plan and budget must be made clear in the annual report.
Nuffic monitors outputs and outcomes and not activities . Therefore, the main focus of the annual report must be on the achievement of the project&#x2019;s output(s) and planned outcome(s). The information provided in the annual reports of the projects is used by Nuffic to monitor the progress of the project and to inform the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and other stakeholders about the output(s) and outcome(s) being achieved by individual projects and the Orange Knowledge programme as a whole. 
Please note that if project progress is in accordance with the original planning, reporting requirements are minimal. Only in case of deviations from the planning, more elaboration is demanded.
In the grant award letter, the dates for submission of the annual reports are mentioned. In case of a three-year project, between 5-7 reports are obligatory.
The first report (0) is a very short report which focuses on specific conditions and/or recommendations in the grant. There is no need to report on progress in achieving outputs and outcomes, which is done in the first annual report. As annex to the report 0, the consortium agreements between the partners should be submitted.
The final report must reflect on the entire project period.</narrative>

                the low number of female staff in the Environmental Engineering department, CMU.
                However, female staff members and PhD candidates from the Environmental Engineering
                department got the first priority to attend this training. Moreover, the female
                staffs from other related fields were also invited and got the first priority to
                attend this training. Information about the TMT was sent by email and as a
                poster/flyer to all head of the related departments of Chiang Mai University (CMU).
                The TMT facilitated good networking opportunity for IHE Delft staffs and also CMU
                staffs with other universities in Thailand. 2) Prof. Susanne Rotter, one of the
                trainers, could not attend the training in person from Berlin. Therefore, she joined
                by SKYPE. 3) Eldon Raj from IHE Delft also conducted a half day scientific writing
                workshop for PhD students of CMU and it was attended by ~15 female
                students.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">31-03-2021: 1) Only 15 female staff members attended the training due to the low number of female staff in the Environmental Engineering department, CMU. However, female staff members and PhD candidates from the Environmental Engineering department got the first priority to attend this training. Moreover, the female staffs from other related fields were also invited and got the first priority to attend this training. Information about the TMT was sent by email and as a poster/flyer to all head of the related departments of Chiang Mai University (CMU). The TMT facilitated good networking opportunity for IHE Delft staffs and also CMU staffs with other universities in Thailand.

2) Prof. Susanne Rotter, one of the trainers, could not attend the training in person from Berlin. Therefore, she joined by SKYPE.

3) Eldon Raj from IHE Delft also conducted a half day scientific writing workshop for PhD students of CMU and it was attended by ~15 female students.</narrative>

They wanted to apply these technologies and skills in their job, and also in ongoing agriculture-related projects in Thailand. 

Concerning changes in professional attitude: Some of the staff have integrated this new knowledge into their existing curriculum or courses. Besides, they also learnt new methods of teaching, including the use of KAHOOT, Mentimeter, etc that helped them to teach online during the COVID pandemic
