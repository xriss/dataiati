    <narrative xml:lang="EN">Reporting is an important management tool which is used to inform relevant government officials and other stakeholders about the results being achieved by individual projects and the programme as a whole. 
For project partners, it is compulsory to use the prescribed Orange Knowledge annual report format in order to report on project achievements. The annual report also provides valuable data on the financial situation of the project. Based on an analysis of the project performance in relation to the project output(s) and expected outcome(s), a revision of the project work plan may be suggested by the project partners. The consequences of a possible revision on the project work plan and budget must be made clear in the annual report.
Nuffic monitors outputs and outcomes and not activities . Therefore, the main focus of the annual report must be on the achievement of the project&#x2019;s output(s) and planned outcome(s). The information provided in the annual reports of the projects is used by Nuffic to monitor the progress of the project and to inform the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and other stakeholders about the output(s) and outcome(s) being achieved by individual projects and the Orange Knowledge programme as a whole. 
Please note that if project progress is in accordance with the original planning, reporting requirements are minimal. Only in case of deviations from the planning, more elaboration is demanded.
In the grant award letter, the dates for submission of the annual reports are mentioned. In case of a three-year project, between 5-7 reports are obligatory.
The first report (0) is a very short report which focuses on specific conditions and/or recommendations in the grant. There is no need to report on progress in achieving outputs and outcomes, which is done in the first annual report. As annex to the report 0, the consortium agreements between the partners should be submitted.
The final report must reflect on the entire project period.</narrative>

     <actual value="The training responded thoroughly to the key and immediate needs of the Council, as identified during the Training Needs Analysis. These needs include: 

1. new skills and knowledge to confront challenges in land, water and sanitation service provision. In the Training Needs Analysis, there was an emphasis on participatory approaches in programme design (especially with traditional authorities and local communities);
2. identifying, analysing and engaging stakeholders was also a priority from the conducted analysis-  
3. on the other hand, the project worked towards building a reservoir of knowledge to be resident within the key departments of the Council. This includes training materials, action plans developed by participants, commitments to share knowledge across departments, and new awareness on the need for inclusive, gender responsive and participatory processes. 

Part of the follow up strategy is to continuously engage the trained staff in the upgrading of solid waste management and service delivery. It was agreed that the trained staff will be incorporated into the different components of the upgrading programmes to ensure knowledge is being shared and applied. The key areas include: 

- Orientation of the role of the Council among traditional leadership; 
- Involvement of the traditional leadership not only the Council of elders (a local civil society organization) that all along was wrongly considered as representing the traditional leadership until the training.  The Council will deploy the trained staff to be part of the programmes aimed at improving service delivery and will give an active role to traditional authorities to participate in such programmes.

The training clearly opened up more communication within the Council and its stakeholders. Within the training, during the identification of the issues surrounding the upgrading programme, the participants had reached consensus on what the issues were and what actions they needed to take to improve the programme. The previous communication barrier made the Council appear indifferent to the local customary institutions, especially the Customary Leadership who are the custodians of the land that is currently sought after by the Municipality for its expansion. 

The training brought these groups together, built trust, resolved misunderstandings, clarified roles and responsibilities,  generated goodwill, and created commitments from both sides to actively work together in closing cooperation. The training has also seen an integration of other key stakeholders.

**Traditional Leaders**

- Support identification and allocation of parcels of land for development

- Mobilise the local people to participate in the project

- Identify families that require compensation

- Support communities to access services from the Council to improve housing, water access and sanitation

**Ministry of Water, Sanitation and Environmental Protection**

- Sensitise members of the traditional communities and those in the Municipality on water rights

- Increase access to clean and safe water for drinking

- Provide information on the services provided including on quality systems for water

**Zesco**

- Increase access to power connection

- Document households and businesses that require connection

- Support the upgrading programme by increasing access for the communities

**Ministry of Lands**

- Expedite the process of titling for the upgraded communities

- Increase access to survey services

**North Western Water and Sewerage**

- Increase access to water and sanitation services

- Improve discharge and management of raw sewerage"></actual>
