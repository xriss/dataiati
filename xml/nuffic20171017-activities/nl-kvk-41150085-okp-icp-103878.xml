  <description akvo:type="6" type="1" xmlns:akvo="http://akvo.org/iati-activities">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Tropical   Cyclone IDAI made landfall with   strong winds between 180 and 220 km and heavy rains of 200mm in 24 hours   (source: INGC), in central Mozambique on 14th of March 2019. At the same time, owing to the heavy   rains, the river Buzi and Revue achieved maximum alert and the dam at   Chicamba had to be opened causing massive floods in most areas of the Buzi   and Nhamatanda districts. An estimated 1.7   million people across Mozambique have been affected (source: WFP) and according   to the International Organisation for Migration (10th April 2019) 240,000 houses (source: IOM)   have been identified as partially or totally destroyed. 

Although there has been a strong response   through international organisations, such as 

World Food Program, UNICEF and Red Cross,   as well as from the government of Mo&#xE7;ambique through INGC - Instituto   National de Gest&#xE3;o de Calamidades, the numbers of effected people by the   cyclone IDAI are absolutely overwhelming. 

The latest official information (10th   April 2019) released by INGC noted that just within the proposed district for   this intervention, namely Beira and Dondo, approximately 603,000 people have   been identified as affected by cyclone IDAI. 

Young Africa Beira located at the   Bairro of Manga, Nova Chamba (Administration post of Inhamizua) will work   with affected families in the neighborhoods of Manga and Inhamizua. Young   Africa Agri-Tech in Dondo, located in the neighborhood of Macharote will work   with the affected families around the Centre in Macharote. 

For the identification of the affected   families and their respective houses, Young Africa, will work with both the &#x201C;Chefes de Bairro&#x201D; that   are elected by the municipality and Community Leaders that are elected by the   community itself. Both, the &#x201C;Chefes de Bairro&#x201D; as well as the community   leaders are currently supporting activities of identifying the most affected   families for their support.

As Young Africa Mozambique (YAM) wants to   avoid any duplicate support, YAM will provide the list of identified families   to the local government and ensure that they have not already been identified   for reconstruction support by other organisations or the government.

Young people have lacked access to   affordable, practical TVET training, already before Cyclone IDAI has hit the   central region of Mozambique, as it is one solution to youth employment in   Mozambique. Now, after Cyclone IDAI, where many affected families come   exactly from a socially and economically disadvantaged background, the   decision to send your children to vocational Training has been made even more   difficult what has created a even higher need for the provision of   scholarships. 

YAM follows a strict internal selection   process. 1. An interview with the potential beneficiary 2. A visit to the   household of the potential beneficiary (by 2 YAM staff members) to ensure the   information provided is correct (i.e housing type, ascertain access to water,   electricity, number of people in household, number of dependents etc.) A   report, with a recommendation, on both the personal interview and home visit   is prepared by the Programme Officer and presented to the Director for a   final decision. 

YAM proposes to implement the   reconstruction team in 2 phases &#x2013; the first phase will consist of the   disbursement of 200 scholarships: 70 Civil Construction, 50 Carpentry, 50   Electrical Installation, 30 Plumbing. The beneficiaries will be divided into   groups consisting of 3-4 Civil Construction students, 2 Carpentry Students, 2   Electrical Installations, 2 Plumbing. Each group~~s~~ will have different   time sets at a house during the construction phase. After the first month of   theoretical lessons, the reconstruction teams are expected to start their   practical lessons. The first disbursement of scholarships will construct at   least 40 houses, after this there will be a second group of scholarship   disbursement of another 200 scholarships that will follow the same model then   the first one.</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">Reporting is an important management tool which is used to inform relevant government officials and other stakeholders about the results being achieved by individual projects and the programme as a whole. 
For project partners, it is compulsory to use the prescribed Orange Knowledge annual report format in order to report on project achievements. The annual report also provides valuable data on the financial situation of the project. Based on an analysis of the project performance in relation to the project output(s) and expected outcome(s), a revision of the project work plan may be suggested by the project partners. The consequences of a possible revision on the project work plan and budget must be made clear in the annual report.
Nuffic monitors outputs and outcomes and not activities . Therefore, the main focus of the annual report must be on the achievement of the project&#x2019;s output(s) and planned outcome(s). The information provided in the annual reports of the projects is used by Nuffic to monitor the progress of the project and to inform the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and other stakeholders about the output(s) and outcome(s) being achieved by individual projects and the Orange Knowledge programme as a whole. 
Please note that if project progress is in accordance with the original planning, reporting requirements are minimal. Only in case of deviations from the planning, more elaboration is demanded.
In the grant award letter, the dates for submission of the annual reports are mentioned. In case of a three-year project, between 5-7 reports are obligatory.
The first report (0) is a very short report which focuses on specific conditions and/or recommendations in the grant. There is no need to report on progress in achieving outputs and outcomes, which is done in the first annual report. As annex to the report 0, the consortium agreements between the partners should be submitted.
The final report must reflect on the entire project period.</narrative>
