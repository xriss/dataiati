   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The TMT could assist in enhancing knowledge of the staff on the state-of-art practices in the field of irrigation, drainage and agriculture. TMT could also assist in sharing case studies of other countries as lessons-learned, and provide information on the pro and cons of latest in-use technologies in the field of irrigation and agriculture. The TMT could also highlight the challenges in the policy implementation, and developing pragmatic policies. Climate change and its impacts on irrigation and agriculture, as well as ways and means to address them could also be covered by the TMT.

The following subjects should be addressed in this TMT:

1. Efficient Irrigation Water Management
2. Introduction to the state of the art on-farm irrigation
3. Irrigation water resources modelling
4. Evapotranspiration and crop water requirements
5. Coping with climate change in agriculture
6. Water balances (outflow=inflow+change)
    1. Effective project management
7. Project design and execution
8. Monitoring and evaluation
9. Key-stakeholders management
0. Decision supporting tools implementation
    - Review of feasibility studies conducted for large scale new irrigation schemes


1. Analysis of environmental and social impacts assessment</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">Reporting is an important management tool which is used to inform relevant government officials and other stakeholders about the results being achieved by individual projects and the programme as a whole. 
For project partners, it is compulsory to use the prescribed Orange Knowledge annual report format in order to report on project achievements. The annual report also provides valuable data on the financial situation of the project. Based on an analysis of the project performance in relation to the project output(s) and expected outcome(s), a revision of the project work plan may be suggested by the project partners. The consequences of a possible revision on the project work plan and budget must be made clear in the annual report.
Nuffic monitors outputs and outcomes and not activities. Therefore, the main focus of the annual report must be on the achievement of the project&#x2019;s output(s) and planned outcome(s). The information provided in the annual reports of the projects is used by Nuffic to monitor the progress of the project and to inform the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and other stakeholders about the output(s) and outcome(s) being achieved by individual projects and the Orange Knowledge programme as a whole. 
Please note that if project progress is in accordance with the original planning, reporting requirements are minimal. Only in case of deviations from the planning, more elaboration is demanded.
In the Grant Obligations and Conditions, the obligatory dates for submission of the annual/additional reports are mentioned. The final report must reflect on the entire project period.</narrative>

     <actual value="In Afghanistan efficient water use for agriculture is of utmost importance to improve the economic use of the scarce water resource. The Directorate of Irrigation and Natural Resources - Ministry of Agriculture, Irrigation and Livestock (MAIL) has requested to the Orange Knowledge Programme to financially support a tailor-made training on the topic of Efficient Irrigation Water Management. The training participants were young and relatively inexperienced with using new innovative  technologies and tools in efficient irrigation water management. Also they were not able to effectively train stakeholders and develop and implement tools in this field to ensure that farmers in rural areas have constantly and properly access to water for irrigation. Our training intended to address this capacity gap and enable the target group in use of modern spatial tools for improving irrigation efficiency. The training consist of four phases: a base line study, Training on Effective Project Management, training on Efficient Irrigation Water Management and finalized by follow up training by MAIL training participants to other staff members and stakeholders. 

Unfortunately due to the outbreak of the corona-virus the original plan and time schedule could not be adhered to. The training-date on efficient irrigation and water management was postponed several times and finally the decision we made to transfer the course to an online mode and host the course in Kabul, Afghanistan. 

The training focused on introducing participants on the latest developments of Using Earth       Observation and dedicated software programmes to monitor, assess and improve Water Management in Irrigated Areas. The course combined online presentations with offline exercises. Data and Software  made available in the cloud from which it was downloaded and installed locally. Local trainer were are available to support software related issues and assist participants in practical and group work. We used CANVAS as platform to share data, images and other relevant tools relevant for this subject matter. The participants downloaded data in advance so we will not faced any kind of internet burdens. Furthermore, after the training the participants got assigned with follow-up actions to ensure that the gained knowledge is internalized. 

**Evaluation &#x2013; remarks **

Based on the feedback it can be concluded that the workshop largely met the expectations of the participants. The sessions on Google Earth Engine and Aquacrop were appreciated the most. 

The participants were satisfied with the organisation of the course, the venue, the balance between the theoretical and the practical sessions  as well as with the support from the local host and facility provider. 

The background knowledge of most of the participants was sufficient to follow the course content. All participants stated that they gained valuable knowledge and skills during the course which they can apply for further use in their projects and for their daily work. 

Most of the participants indicated they will be using the software skills and knowledge for their upcoming activities. It would be very much appreciated by all participants to have another dedicated training on irrigation efficiency in the future in order to further develop practical skills on applying the gained knowledge."></actual>

     <actual value="Has described in the proposal we had the intention to organise 2 trainings and we are glad that we have also completed the 2 trainings has it was proposed. We have provided the following training subjects:

**Effective project management (face to face)**

- Project design and execution 

- Monitoring and evaluation

- Key-stakeholders management 

- Decision supporting tools implementation 

&#x200B;

**Training on Efficient Irrigation Water Management (online and face to face)**

- Introduction to the state of the art on-farm irrigation 

- Irrigation water resources modelling 

- Evapotranspiration and crop water requirements 

- Coping with climate change in agriculture 

As aforementioned the biggest bottleneck which caused deviation from our original proposal plan was the fact that COVID-19 pandemic occurred in 2020. Due to the lock-down both in the Netherlands and Afghanistan caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, we were not able to organise the last training on Efficient Irrigation Water Management under the TMT project as it was planned and mentioned in the TMT joint proposal. On top of that, due to travel restrictions and negative travel advise by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, our Dutch trainer were not able to travel to India (where part of the training had to take place) to provide the training. The training-date was postponed several times and finally we made the decision to transfer the course to an online mode and host the course in Kabul, Afghanistan In this regard we asked Nuffic for a Budget Neutral Extension because we needed more time. We provided blended learning training consisting of online and offline sessions. Our Dutch trainers provided their part of the training online and our local trainer provided his part of the training face-to-face taking COVID-19 restrictions in to account. Finally we managed to deliver the desired outcomes and reaching the training objectives has it was described in the proposal plan. 

The trainees gained knowledge on the latest developments of using Earth Observation and dedicated software programmes to monitor, assess and improve Water Management in Irrigated Areas. Dedicated software to obtain climate (meteorological) data, assess irrigated water demand, water productivity (dry yield/m3) and land cover monitoring was introduced. With the gained knowledge the participants can develop and integrate their own irrigation management knowledge and skills with new geospatial tools to acquire, monitor and assess relevant water resources data and information."></actual>
