   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The longer term impact will be on food security and poverty levels of communities
        in South Sudan where OPEN is active. Medium term impact is the improved capacity of OPEN to
        guide farmers in improving their food security and income levels. The outcome of the TMT
        will be a workforce of OPEN able to guide farmers in their working area in improving their
        dairy production improving the food security and income levels of OPEN farmer target groups.
        Concrete outputs are: -15 trained extension workers, including 8 females, competent to train
        local farmers in improving dairy production and develop farmer training programs targeting
        male as well as female farmers. -Farmer training programs -Improved farmer training

     <actual value="Almost the entire team of trainers/ extension workers currently active for PLYC in agricultural/ livestock development programs participated in the training. Working in very difficult, challenging and sometimes dangerous conditions extension staff of PLYC is involved
in the implementation of various livestock development programs. PLYC staff, mainly young graduates with various educational background, lack a lot of knowledge, skills and experience necessary for proper implementation of agricultural/ livestock programs including experience in the technical aspects of analysing dairy value chains and setting up and managing a small scale commercial dairy farms.
During the training it became quickly clear that every topic and the approach used to transfer knowledge and skills were &#x201C;eye openers&#x201D; to all participants. For most it was also a special experience to work in teams comprising of men and women on assignments. It was clear that mixed teams in this kind of work has great advantages in order to address the needs of male and female small holder farmers. At the end of the training all participants informed the trainers that their way of working in the future would change completely after this training. During the Module on dairy value chain analysis and development students were made aware of the concept of (dairy) value chains. They are able to describe and analyze existing dairy value chains, the role of actors, service providers, administration(s) and policies (local, national and international). They are able to link these issues to their own situation. Attention was also given to quality control in the Dairy Value Chain and sensoric evaluation of dairy products.
Participants are enthusiastic about the Value Chain concept, however, they understand that small holder farmer can only participate successfully in value chains if they have the basic knowledge and skills to run their farm as a business.
During the Dairy Farm Management Module the principles of dairy farm economics, management and entrepreneurship were explained and exercised. Use of key performance indicators for assessing/ analysing the technical and financial performance were explained and used in various, initial theoretical, exercises. Various categories of dairy farmers were visited (small scale, emerging farmers, commercial farmers, male as well as female farmers) and students were assigned to analyse the technical as well as financial performance of these farms in groups and develop plans for improvement of the technical as well as the financial performance based on their observations and information collected from the farmers during the visits. Also gender related issues were included in the assignment. Each group was assigned a specific dairy farm for their assignment and present their findings and recommendations.
Also attention was given to dairy cattle nutrition management, young stock rearing, health management, fertility management and housing.
In the last Module attention was given to &#x201C;Training of Trainers&#x201D; topics. Principles of competence based learning, developing short training programs for farmers/farm workers (in his/her area of expertise), developing a lesson plan (one training session) and implementation of the lesson plan developed.
At the end of week 3 student were given the assignment to develop a short farmer training program in a step wise approach (in groups) which was monitored by Aeres. In week 4 feedback was provided to the work done and individual training performance assessed.
During the evaluation of the Course all participants acknowledged that they had learned very much and that their way of training of emerging young commercial dairy farmers would change and improve a lot. Greenhouse gas emissions on dairy farms received special attention during the Course. Awareness was raised that particularly in Asia GHG emissions per kg milk are very high due to the low efficiency and poor quality of feed available to dairy animals. Measures to mitigate the impact of climate change and measures to reduce GHG emissions on dairy farms were discussed thoroughly. Ideas have been used by the participants and they intend to incorporate this information into their own curricula over time. Given the very low level of knowledge of local farmers and the very low level of development of the dairy sector in the working area of PLYC it is currently not the most pressing issue. The training has certainly contributed to the institutional capacity in curriculum development, technical knowledge and skills and M&amp;E system of training programs. Accreditation systems were briefly touched upon (the system in place by Aeres (NVAO)was explained). PLYC was advised to establish contacts with the Agricultural University in Faisalabad for establishing a system for accreditation of their training programs.
For gender see the output below.
All of the above will certainly have an impact in the way trainees/ PLYC will develop and implement training programs in the future. A total of 7 female extension workers participated fully in the training and discussions, participating side by side with their male colleagues as equals. Various training sessions and exercises involving gender issues were included in the training raising awareness.
In the training of trainers Module attention was given on how to develop curricula which were gender sensitive. Trainees represented various ethnic groups and age varied from 22 to 35 years."></actual>
