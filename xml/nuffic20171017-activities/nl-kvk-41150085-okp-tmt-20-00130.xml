    <narrative xml:lang="EN">Reporting is an important management tool which is used to inform relevant government officials and other stakeholders about the results being achieved by individual projects and the programme as a whole. 
For project partners, it is compulsory to use the prescribed Orange Knowledge annual report format in order to report on project achievements. The annual report also provides valuable data on the financial situation of the project. Based on an analysis of the project performance in relation to the project output(s) and expected outcome(s), a revision of the project work plan may be suggested by the project partners. The consequences of a possible revision on the project work plan and budget must be made clear in the annual report.
Nuffic monitors outputs and outcomes and not activities . Therefore, the main focus of the annual report must be on the achievement of the project&#x2019;s output(s) and planned outcome(s). The information provided in the annual reports of the projects is used by Nuffic to monitor the progress of the project and to inform the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and other stakeholders about the output(s) and outcome(s) being achieved by individual projects and the Orange Knowledge programme as a whole. 
Please note that if project progress is in accordance with the original planning, reporting requirements are minimal. Only in case of deviations from the planning, more elaboration is demanded.
In the grant award letter, the dates for submission of the annual reports are mentioned. In case of a three-year project, between 5-7 reports are obligatory.
The first report (0) is a very short report which focuses on specific conditions and/or recommendations in the grant. There is no need to report on progress in achieving outputs and outcomes, which is done in the first annual report. As annex to the report 0, the consortium agreements between the partners should be submitted.
The final report must reflect on the entire project period.</narrative>

     <actual value="The training&apos;s post-evaluation with both the participants and the leadership of FUN shows that we have successfully designed interventions and implemented to address the knowledge and skill problems at FUN. This is also reflected by the letter of appreciation which we received from the leadership of FUN. For many participants, it was the first time attending such tailor made and practical training&apos;s.  In terms of effectiveness of the training we can concluded that it has contributed to capacity development of FUN beyond what was proposed in the proposal. This is especially due to the added value of the training on Sustainable Agribusiness Management which was organised in Ghana to expose the participants to regional best practices. As for the efficiency of the project, we have managed to finalise the project within the deadline and budget. In fact, we we are able to organise an additional training on project management and a training abroad since our trainers couldn&apos;t travel to Liberia."></actual>

     <actual value="_**Output 1: Sustainable Agribusiness Management**_**
**In order to achieve this output, we have organised a Tailor-Made-Training in Accra, Ghana. This way the participants were exposed to regional best practices and enabled to expand their network (see attached training program). The important milestones and outcomes are:

- The participants have improved their knowledge and skills in sustainable agribusiness management, with a focus on:
    - Functioning of agro-food systems and supply chains
    - Market-driven production and supply chain management
    - Sales (and export) development, based on
    - Identification of potential products and markets for sales and export
    - Market trends, developments and requirements (conditions, standards)
    - How to realise market access (find buyers and come to sustainable business) 
- FUN has reviewed the cooperative model and has options for adjustment 
- FUN has made a foundation for business planning, in relation to its strategy and organisation development ambitions (making use of Business Model Canvas
- FUN has reviewed its training approaches / methods / curriculum and has options for adjustment
- FUN is as follow-up to this training working on a project to make lucrative Liberian agriculture projects export ready
- FUN has signed an agreement with potential partners in Ghana
- FUN has signed an agreement with ministry of Agriculture in Liberia to promote agricultural sector growth

_**Output 2: Strategic Planning**_
To achieve this output, we have conducted an additional need assessment to better understand the current organisational challenges of FUN. Based on that we have developed and implemented a Hybrid training to address the following important challenges on organisational and individual levels: 

- Database design
- Lobby and advocacy
- Fund raising and generating revenue
- Effective goal setting

The important achievements are that FUN is now more aware of how an NGO needs to be organised and managed to achieve it&apos;s ultimate goals. As follow-up to the training a Masterplan is developed within which these topics are included as sub-projects to be implemented by the participants and leadership to improve the organisation. 

_**Output 3: Impactful Advocacy, Lobbying and Influencing
**_Please see output 2. 

_**Additional output: **_In addition to the above outputs, we have achieved and additional output. As follow-up to the training on Strategic Planning an Effective Project Management training was implemented to train FUN staff in in project management. The project management is improved which enables FUN staff to work more effectively and efficient on projects."></actual>

     <actual value="The capacity gaps analysis, which was carried out during the inception phase, revealed that the staff members of Farmers Union Network (FUN) were in need of both, personal and professional development in order to be able to work more effectively and contribute to a sustainable growth of FUN and it&apos;s members (small and medium sized farmers). Therefore, the training content was integrated and experiential learning approaches applied to address effectively their knowledge and skill gaps. 

The training evaluation shows us that the trained staff are empowered in the following fields:

**Personal development**

- The trained staff have developed a more enterprising attitude which was reflected by the fact that they have taken the ownership of follow-up assignments and delivered on that.
- The trained staff have learned to use more often interactive brainstrom techniques instead of unproductive discussions in order to come up with creative solutions for the challenges faced within FUN and by their members.
- The trained staff are better aware of their personal attributes such as; autonomous ability, self-confidence, action orientation, commitment and determination to perform their jobs. This also reflected by their active participation in the 2nd and 3rd training. 
- The trained staff are networking more actively.  This is reflected by their behaviour during the 3rd training which was held in Ghana. To enable them to make contact with potential export partners, networking sessions and a field visit was organised during the training. 

**Professional development**

- The alumni have gained new knowledge on effective lobby &amp; advocacy. As they were assigned with a follow-up assignment to develop and implement a lobby &amp; advocacy strategy for FUN, they have also improved their skills in this regard.
- The trained staff members have improved their knowledge and skills in fundraising and generating revenue to sustain the financial situation of FUN. 
- The alumni have improved knowledge and skills in database design and farmers record keeping to serve their members more effectively. 
- The trained staff have improved their knowledge and skills in effective project management. As a result, a project management system is developed and implemented.
- The trained staff have improved their knowledge and skills in sustainable agribusiness management. As follow-up to the training they are currently working on a project to make several Agri-products export ready. Please see attached training program.
