     <actual value="**Reflect on how the training has contributed to addressing the capacity needs as described by the requesting organisation in the proposal form.**

In the months before the application for TMT, Embedding Impact had identified that the field of Social Impact Management (incl. Measurement) would be exponentially growing, both nationally in South Africa and globally. A quick analysis of the professionals in this field would learn that (a) the vast majority is at a senior level; and (b) the majority is based in Europe, UK or northern America.

Both are problematic, as the build-up of the available professionals in any industry would be considered with a balance between entry-level graduates, juniors and up to seniors and executive level. A specific training trajectory was necessary to address this aspect, as Social Impact Management currently is at best a standard course within a field of study at universities and not (_yet_!) a major.

Whereas the majority of development funding from Europe and the US &amp; Canada finds its way to Africa, the evaluation of the impact of these funds is largely left to specialists from these countries. From a Social Impact Management perspective, it would be essential to behave impact informed by those that experience it, and therefore having Social Impact Management specialists that intrinsically understand the plight and circumstances of beneficiary communities would be quintessential. 

In the context of South Africa, which was experiencing the highest level of youth unemployment at the time of starting the TMT (which has been made worse by Covid-19), the question of employability stands out as one of the reasons why many of our young people struggle to secure long-term employment. Our solution goes well beyond addressing these two components, as work readiness is a key component of our training programme to develop a holistic talent with grit, a field that our partner The Experience Factory specializes in. Furthermore, we created an avenue to create jobs.

By completing this programme we have successfully contributed to all these challenges and aspects, although we would have liked for most graduates to be permanently employed upon completion. This is however only going to be a matter of time.

From an Embedding Impact perspective, as one of the implementing partners, we have been approached in the period July 2021 till mid-September 2021 (the date of submission of this report) for and by:

a) Development of a sector-wide SIM Graduate Programme for the Renewable Industry

b) Assistance for development of the basic elements for SIM for 15 commercial consumer brands, and how to execute the measurement in due course

c) Addressing the needs of medium-to-large size NGOs that are desperate to understand what Social Impact means and are at a loss on how to measure and manage it

d) At least three impact investment funds that are in need to understand social impact and how to incorporate the measurement into their metrics for evaluating investments (pre-funding and post-funding).

As a result, we have offered 3 of the graduates of the programme a temporary contract to assist in alleviating the most pressing pressures in our organisation.

In addition to all of this, the completed programme _also_ had a specific focus on the environmental development space, based on the model of the Environmental Sustainability Agency (ESA). It was foreseen that funding developments for and by ESA would have yielded success by the time of closure. And as much as it has been confirmed, the actual funding has not yet been reflected and such the graduates can&#x2019;t be employed, as much as everyone wants it. As a sub-sector within the SIM industry, which is by all accounts also growing globally, the programme will add to an increased understanding of what social impact means and how to effectively measure it.

**How effective and efficient has the TMT+ been in reaching the desired objectives? **

The assistance of TMT couldn&#x2019;t have come at a more relevant and apt time. As small but growing businesses, Embedding Impact, The Experience Factory and Environmental Sustainability Agency, did not have the ability to divert revenue into the execution of a training module such as we did. TMT provided the essential support that allowed all project partners to participate and take an acceptable investment risk without jeopardizing the future of any of the businesses.

The investment in this small but dedicated programme allowed us to have a holistic approach to development, both a nuclear level with each of the graduates, but also at a macro level by addressing systemic challenges within the eco-system of social impact management services and within natural resource management. All these objectives have been met. 

Notwithstanding the fact that not every graduate that started the programme managed to complete it, all of them at least have fully participated and benefitted from a personal development programme. Some of them concluded that Social Impact Management will not be their profession. And whilst this doesn&#x2019;t directly contribute to the objective of having more SIM professionals available, it is a result in itself. For those graduates, it is a tool to sharpen their own exes, as knowing what you don&#x2019;t want is an important element in knowing what you want. But it also helps us in sharpening our own axes when it comes to recruitment and selection of candidates going forward.

**Please formulate lessons learned and recommendations for the post-project period.**

1. Teams of recent graduates would need experienced and daily/weekly in-situ supervision/management; relying on self-management leads to free-rider tendencies, developmental delays and sub-maximum delivery on project objectives.

2. The curriculum is effective and relevant, as is demonstrated by the fact that the graduates are of value to host organisations during the graduate programme, but also directly afterwards.

3. Deployment of graduates in remote/rural areas would require that their work equipment is up to standards. Relying on second-hand laptops and not having a reliable internet connection brings a level of unnecessary risk of losing the graduates during the course of the programme.

4. Working with three partners that all deliver a different yet equally important element of the curriculum, would require more detailed planning of the training programme and more effective communication between partners. 

5. To effectively manage the graduates and the implementing partners, a dedicated manager, who has knowledge of all three aspects, would be recommended.

6. The sourcing, recruitment and selection of eligible candidates require at least 6 weeks, but preferably 8 weeks. 

7. Graduates with a degree that has direct touchpoints to Social Impact Management seem to be a better match. These are for instance Development Studies; Environmental Management Studies; Sociology; Development Finance; 

Graduates with a background in other studies, with no touchpoints, need more time to understand certain matters. But also seem to be easier swayed to leave the programme when other opportunities arise.

8. It would however be good for the Social Impact Management profession to have a better understanding of how other professions can be incorporated, by means of clarifying those aspects of SIM that are of relevance to them.

9. In particular, the technical aspects of Social Impact Management, with a focus on understanding somewhat more advanced mathematical calculations and economic concepts, seem to be a huge hurdle for some of them. It would be recommendable to see to what extent the programme can be split into a more technical approach and an approach whereby the social aspects of interacting with communities are at the forefront. Both aspects are equally important, but giving graduates a choice in this would potentially lead to broader interest and uptake."></actual>

The training was designed to develop grads understanding of the current socio-economic and environmental situation at each site to inform the baseline studies to be conducted at community sites they live, to learn and apply their knowledge.

Training  entailed:

- Improved understanding of Natural Resource Management and the Wildlife Economy
- Corporate literacy
- Social Impact Measurement (SIM)

The end goal was to see the graduates being absorbed permanently in any organization partners and contribute meaningfully to the development of their communities by measuring the impacts these initiatives have to their communities.

**SIM Graduates working  at sites**

- Graduates were deployed to work for Environmental Sustainability Agency and Property point sites to apply the Social Impact Methodology on the projects allocated to them. the Social Impact Methodology including: Stakeholder Mapping, Data Collection and Data Analysis, as well as Social Value creation. 

**SIM Graduates coming from host Communities **

- Graduates that were deployed to Environmental Sustainability Agency  were coming from the 3 host communities,  Mayibuye Community, Baphiring Community and Barokologadi Community.

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">08-11-2021: We have had in-depth interviews and discussions with 8 out of
                the 9 graduates that completed the Corporate Literacy Programme. Although we know
                that the 9th person appreciated the CLP and learned as much as the others, he left
                the programme too early into the work to claim the changes of new knowledge and
                skills.</narrative>
