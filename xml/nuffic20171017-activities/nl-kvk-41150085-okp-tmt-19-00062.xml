   <description>
    <narrative xml:lang="EN">Reporting is an important management tool which is used to inform relevant government officials and other stakeholders about the results being achieved by individual projects and the programme as a whole. 
For project partners, it is compulsory to use the prescribed Orange Knowledge annual report format in order to report on project achievements. The annual report also provides valuable data on the financial situation of the project. Based on an analysis of the project performance in relation to the project output(s) and expected outcome(s), a revision of the project work plan may be suggested by the project partners. The consequences of a possible revision on the project work plan and budget must be made clear in the annual report.
Nuffic monitors outputs and outcomes and not activities . Therefore, the main focus of the annual report must be on the achievement of the project&#x2019;s output(s) and planned outcome(s). The information provided in the annual reports of the projects is used by Nuffic to monitor the progress of the project and to inform the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and other stakeholders about the output(s) and outcome(s) being achieved by individual projects and the Orange Knowledge programme as a whole. 
Please note that if project progress is in accordance with the original planning, reporting requirements are minimal. Only in case of deviations from the planning, more elaboration is demanded.
In the grant award letter, the dates for submission of the annual reports are mentioned. In case of a three-year project, between 5-7 reports are obligatory.
The first report (0) is a very short report which focuses on specific conditions and/or recommendations in the grant. There is no need to report on progress in achieving outputs and outcomes, which is done in the first annual report. As annex to the report 0, the consortium agreements between the partners should be submitted.
The final report must reflect on the entire project period.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">08-02-2021: I have filled in this document at the end of the project and actually everything has been said already. To conclude this project I express the hope that the Covid-19 crisis will be over soon and that we can start working on the activities as described in the MOU. Besides that I hope that we will find sponsors for future activities with the training centre. This appears to be quite a challenge, but we are not without hope. 
The least we can do is start an online project between Aeres students and students from Sanskriti Samvardhan Mandal. That, of course is the advantage of being a member of the big Aeres family in which we have several institutes for lower, intermediate and higher vocational education.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">15-12-2020: Definitely the income has increased per bird due to --
1) Better feed conversion ratio, use of quality inputs.
2) Reduction in mortality due to bio security measures used by the farmers
3) Better management has also resulted in better gain in weight therefore the resulting effect of gain in income from Rupees 15 to rupees 25 it has been achieved by most of the participants.

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">15-12-2020: During the training in which several teaching methods were adopted where the learning of the training had to be used by the participants in their field.
In the period between the two trainings they had to assess and evaluate a Poultry farm from their nearby area, so has to implement these learnings on that farm.
During the period emphasis was given to hands on training. Trainees were doing all management practices inside and outside of the shed.
Plenty of group discussions were conducted during the training which has also helped participants to apply the learning in to their real life situation. Such types of cross learnings helped trainees to clarify all complex issues.
Participants were asked to present the assignment in terms of training the farmers, in terms of evaluation of poultry farm. It has helped in better learning and understanding of the technical content by the participant.
During the training we visited few poultry farm. We could personally see and discuss the impact of the technology, we could discuss the shortcomings, and it&#x2019;s strong and weak points that were also a good learning.
Videos -- several videos were shown to the participants who give us advance knowledge in poultry industry.
