   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The development impact of the proposed project could be summarized as follows:  - Contribution to economic growth and support to Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) to Syria:  The main objective of this proposed project is to work closely with leading financial institutions from the GCC and Pakistan to support their expansion into the less developed economies of MENA.  This strategy is expected to speed up the economic growth of these less developed economies such as Syria. This will be achieved by improving the banking sector which is one of the major sectors contributing to economic growth.  The proposed project is expected to promote FDI which will lead to revenue generation, employment and skill transfer which will bring better services to these economies.  - Access to Knowledge and Capacity Building:    By helping establish a new financial institution in Syria, IFC would be helping to expand bring best practices and new product development to a significant portion of the population.    - Employment creation:    The development of a strong financial institution, with the help of a strong technical partner will lead into the creation of jobs not only in the financial sector, but also in other sectors that it will support through its financing products.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project consists of establishing one of the first Islamic banking institutions in Syria (the Bank). IFCs proposed investment would be in the form of equity of up to 10-15% stake in the Banks equity.      The proposed project is expected to have a significant developmental impact on the Syrian economy as it will help further develop the still nascent private banking sector in Syria.  IFC is expected to partner with strong financial institutions from Kuwait and Pakistan in order to build a strong Islamic Banking Institution in Syria that will be offering products and services to the Syrian population.</narrative>
