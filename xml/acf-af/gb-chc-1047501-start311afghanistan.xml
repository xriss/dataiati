   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Action Against Hunger will directly implement a multi-sectorial response to the flood-affected communities in Helmand province. The ERM team have already provided timely response to vulnerable communities identified in Lashkar Gah, Nawa and Nahr-e-Saraj districts. However, ERM&apos;s modus operandi is very specific (strict criteria as regards IDPs) and Action Against Hunger&apos;s project, funded by Start, will enable holistic assistance to flood-affected people as a whole (IDPs that ERM is not in capacity to assist and non-IDPs that don&apos;t fall into ERM&apos;s criteria). As per Action Against Hunger&apos;s and other partners&apos; assessment findings, the following activities are proposed: water provision for drinking and other daily use through boreholes rehabilitation, distribution of hygiene kits, hygiene promotion at community level, multipurpose cash, distribution of NFI kits and shelter rehabiliation. Action Against Hunger plans to intervene in the same areas where activities are currently implemented through ongoing projects but currently there are needs and gaps. Outputs: 1. 200 HHs living in rehabilitated shelters 2. 200 of the HHs reporting that they have received NFI kits 3. 7350 people in the targeted areas reporting that they have access to clean drinking water 4. 300 HHs reporting that they received culturally appropriate hygiene kits together with hygiene messages 5. Number of HHs reporting that their needs of health, emergency and transportation are met.</narrative>
