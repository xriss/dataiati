   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In a year unlike any other in recent memory, the Pathfinders for Justice, with its many partners has:

&#x25AA; Developed and launched the Shared Strategy for Justice for All, which brings together a growing group of organizations to align their activities and work towards three agreed priorities in order to accelerate implementation of the justice-related goals and targets of the 2030 agenda over the next four years.
&#x25AA; Created a series of briefings and reports on Justice in a Pandemic with early analysis that helped articulate how people-centered justice is critical to pandemic response and recovery. The briefings proposed practical strategies for justice leaders as they respond to the COVID-19 pandemic.
&#x25AA; Strengthened collaboration among a core group of partners and thought-leaders on people-centered justice by developing the Justice in a Pandemic series in partnership with over 50 partners, policy makers, practitioners and academics.
&#x25AA; Helped spur the interest of countries and development partners on the importance of closing the justice gap and the potential of people-centered justice to build peaceful and inclusive societies. Engaged donors, such as USAID, to advance people-centered justice in their programming.
&#x25AA; Contributed to the increased spotlight on the widening justice gap for women and the need to mobilize broadly to defend previously won gains and progress for women&#xB4;s rights.
&#x25AA; Created the foundation for the different workstreams and partnerships at the core of the four-year Pathfinders for Justice program, through strategic discussions with different partners and by building the team in CIC as well as the broader justice team, which includes the core consultants.
&#x25AA; Maintained the momentum on Justice for All throughout 2020 with the organization of presentations and events and most importantly the regional meetings in West-Africa and the Asia-Pacific region and the Global Week for Justice.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Pathfinders for Peaceful, Just and Inclusive Societies is a member state-led, multi-stakeholder partnership that works to accelerate the implementation of the SDG targets for peace, justice, and inclusion (SDG16+). The Pathfinders was co-founded and is hosted by NYU&#x2019;s Center on International Cooperation. In September 2017, the Pathfinders launched the Roadmap for Peaceful, Just and Inclusive Societies.

Following publication of the Justice for All report, the Pathfinders for Justice program was created, a four-year effort that will translate the Task Force&#x2019;s recommendations into action, building on CIC&#x2019;s comparative advantage as a convener and a catalyst of the shift towards people-centered justice.

This narrative report covers our activities from January 1st - August 31st, 2020 as stipulated in the grant decision. This is a relatively short reporting period, because of the alignment of reporting requirements to NYU&#x2019;s fiscal year which runs from September-August. The grant decision was taken on May 18th, 2020.</narrative>
