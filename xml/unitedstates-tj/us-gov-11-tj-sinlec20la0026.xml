    <narrative xml:lang="EN">Tajikistan faces many developmental and security challenges, including chronic food and energy shortages, poor water management, a long and porous border with Afghanistan, widespread corruption, underdeveloped democratic institutions, and inadequate health and education systems. With the drawdown of U.S.~combat troops from Afghanistan, security along the Afghanistan border has become increasingly important. Tajikistan remains one of the world&apos;s poorest countries, with its fragile economy dependent upon remittances, mostly from migrant labor in Russia -estimated in 2014 at an amount equal to 50 percent of gross domestic product-and commodity exports to a limited number of trade partners, which makes it susceptible to global market fluctuations and to any downturn in the Russian economy. The goals of U.S.~assistance to Tajikistan include improving the effectiveness and accountability of state institutions; building the capacity and professionalism of the security services; enhancing the bilateral security relationship with the United~States; increasing outreach to business and civil society; expanding trade and markets; enhancing regional cooperation on energy and water; and increasing the quality of social services, including health and education. These goals support U.S.~foreign policy priorities, including regional security, regional connectivity, and economic prosperity. U.S. assistance will build resilience and reduce vulnerability to Russian aggression, increase European integration, and provide continued support for enduring programs.</narrative>
