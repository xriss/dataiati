    <narrative xml:lang="EN">FY 2017 U.S. foreign assistance resources for Maldives will be directed toward global climate change adaptation and the promotion of maritime domain awareness, maritime security, and counterterrorism capability. Growing political unrest, weak democratic institutions, and limited government presence in outer atolls have created space for extremist ideologies to grow. U.S. assistance will focus on maritime security - an area of particular concern due to significant threats posed by narcotics trafficking, piracy in the Indian Ocean, and sea-borne trade in illicit materials of potential use for terrorist activity. Moreover, because the entire island nation is less than 1.5 meters above sea level, Maldives is among the most vulnerable countries in the world to climate change impacts, which have the potential to significantly disrupt the Maldivian economy and way of life; as such, a significant portion of the U.S. assistance program will focus on climate change adaptation.</narrative>
