   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This award strives to conserve biodiversity and manage natural resources in ways that maintain their long-term viability and preserve their potential to meet the needs of present and future generations. Activities include combating illegal and corrupt exploitation of natural resources and the control of invasive species. This includes Project will support improved connectivity between protected areas of the Trifinio region by strengthening management and communication tools, and the ability of key stakeholders to use them, for the Montecristo Trifinio Trinational Biological Corridor. Project activities include working with local, national and trinational stakeholders and platforms to create a series of detailed maps (mapping of all 7 sub-corridors, land use changes, coverage maps by ecosystems to better identify ecosystem goods and services, and water supply and sources) in order to support decision-makers to carry out land use planning, identify priorities for conservation actions, and guide future funding decisions. Project will also design, carry out and evaluate a communication campaign directed towards local communities and governments about the critical importance of the biological corridor and the services it provides..</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">Foreign assistance funding in Guatemala addresses critical development challenges: high levels of violence and insecurity, pervasive poverty and chronic malnutrition, and extreme vulnerability to the impacts of global climate change, as well as the impacts of these challenges on increased migration. U.S. assistance will focus on improving security, justice for citizens, and governance. Assistance also focuses on enhancing agriculture and other private sector sources of economic growth and food security, in support of the President&apos;s Global Hunger and Food Security initiative, Feed the Future (FTF), which aims to reduce chronic malnutrition. In addition, U.S. assistance will provide access to health services and foster adoption of healthy behaviors at the household level; promote better educational outcomes; provide opportunities for out-of-school youth to decrease the desire to migrate; and improve natural resource management to mitigate the negative effects of global climate change. These activities will be provided through technical assistance, grants, and loans. By supporting targeted activities in these areas of intervention, U.S. assistance will also help address the underlying factors contributing to increased migration to the United States. In October 2014, the U.S. government launched the U.S. Strategy for Engagement in Central America (the Strategy), which complements the work undertaken by national governments and multilateral development banks, to support the priority objectives identified in the Plan of the Alliance for Prosperity in the Northern Triangle. The Strategy focuses on three overarching lines of action: 1) promoting prosperity and regional economic integration; 2) enhancing security through continued and expanded Central America Regional Security Initiative (CARSI) activities; and 3) promoting improved governance. Therefore, the Department of State and USAID&apos;s FY 2017 request of $750.0 million in bilateral and regional assistance for Central America - a part of the Administration&apos;s $1.0 billion whole-of-government request for appropriations and financing assistance to support the Strategy - includes and aligns the resources necessary to increase economic opportunity, reduce extreme violence, strengthen the effectiveness of state institutions, address climate change and food insecurity, and address challenges that have resulted in an influx of migration.</narrative>
