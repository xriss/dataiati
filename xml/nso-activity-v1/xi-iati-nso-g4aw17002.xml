   <narrative xml:lang="EN">From 2018, the SAT4Farming program will start developing a digital service that can prepare, manage and monitor Farm Development Plans for individual cocoa farmers in Ghana. The service will use satellite imagery and digital tools to make Farm Development Plans more accurate, impactful and affordable. For instance, technical staff and advisors will use data, sourced from satellite imagery, on the environmental conditions of the farm, such as soil conditions, vicinity of rivers or forests, and plant condition, even before visiting the farm. The digital service is expected to increase the efficiency and scalability of creating and monitoring tailored Farm Development Plans, as fewer field visits will be necessary and data informing the plans will be more precise.</narrative>

Sat4Farming will develop a financial sustainable digital information service that supports 240.000 Ghanaian cocoa farmers to increase their production, income and food security. For each farmer a Farm Development Plan will be created, implemented and monitored supporting an increase in yield of smallholder cocoa farms by up to 40% in the first three years. The program is supported by Mars and several large cocoa traders such as Touton, who are concerned about the low productivity of cocoa farms and a future sustainable cocoa value chain.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Ghana is the world&#x2019;s second-largest exporter of cocoa, but many of the country&#x2019;s cocoa farmers are poor, trees are aging and highly vulnerable to pests and diseases, and productivity is low. However, many of these farmers can significantly increase their yields by applying good agricultural practices and basic investments in their farms, if they can be given advice and support that is specific to their needs.</narrative>

  <description akvo:type="7" type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">SAT4Farming will operate in a B2B model with aggregators (cocoa traders or cooperatives) where users of the service are the aggregator&#x2019;s field agents and the beneficiaries of the service are smallholder cocoa farmers and their families. Aggregators pay for SAT4Farming services on a per farm, per year basis.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The implementation of geo-data based Farm Development Plans will help increase yield of smallholder cocoa farms, which in turn results in a more profitable and sustainable cocoa value chain for all stakeholders involved.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The primary target group for SAT4Farming services consists of smallholder cocoa farmers in 4 regions in Ghana, having an average farm size of 3.5 hectares. A key focus of the SAT4Farming program is on young and female farmers. Youth play a key role in the future of cocoa, especially because 56% of Ghanaian cocoa farmers are over the age of 50. The program&#x2019;s focus on women&#x2019;s empowerment through technology will strengthen their position in the cocoa supply chain and improve their incomes.</narrative>
