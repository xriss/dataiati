   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Angkor SALAD services will be offered to vegetable farmers using the Inclusive Business Model. The price for these services are already included in the selling price of farm inputs and equipment and will not require any succeeding payments. Vegetable farmers who buy farm inputs and equipment from Angkor Green will get the services via Voice, SMS, and App and as part of the purchase. Angkor green will credit the value of the service embedded into the farm input or equipment purchase as revenue for Angkor SALAD services. Vegetable Agricultural Cooperatives (ACs), producer groups (PGs), contract growers, vegetable buyers, NGOs, government and microfinance institutions can acquire Angkor SALAD services through the Direct Revenue (B2B) model, and pay Angkor SALAD directly.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Implementation of a geodata based information service in Cambodia to increase production, income, food security and reduce the inputs of water, fertilizer and pesticides. This service will provide irrigation advice, fertilizer advice, crop planning advice, market information and khmer gap compliance which is explained below.

1.	Irrigation Advice - Advice on the volume of water to irrigate, schedule and duration of irrigation, based on geospatial data and volume of water required by the vegetables depending on their stage in the cropping cycle.

2.	Fertilizer Advice - recommends what type and amount of fertilizer to apply in the farm, based on the soil analysis and the vegetables to be produced.

3.	Crop Planning Advice - advice on what vegetable and variety to plant and when to plant it, also based on variety trials of AVRDC for wet and dry season vegetable production. This farm advice is adapted to local soil and agro-ecological conditions and market demand, and contains information on planting, sowing and harvesting periods.

4.	Market Information - provides details on daily buying price at different levels of the chain, access to buyers&#x2019; profile, and estimate of associated logistic and transportation cost.

5.	Khmer Gap Compliance - Customized farm advice based on selected crop, farming system, location and present agro-climatic conditions and advice on how to produce safe, good quality vegetables. Also provides information on safe growing guidelines and practices, including safe use of farm inputs and a self-audit checklist for GAP compliance.</narrative>
