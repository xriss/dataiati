   <narrative xml:lang="EN">A contribution to the acceleration of agri-business performance leveraging geodata based information services in Angola for the benefit of smallholder farmers</narrative>
  </description>
  <description akvo:type="8" type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Mavo Diami&#x2019;s key business proposition: Informed decisions improve the performance of any agri-businesses! There will be different business models for different market segments.

**Direct revenue** will be created by selling the services (from the start of the project) to the larger commercial farms for which the business model will be a subscription model.

Additional revenue will be generated by allowing third party investors (such as agricultural input provides or other local businesses that want to activate or reach out to customers) to tap into the valuable farmer profiles and client base developed on the Mavo Diami platform. Third - the Mavo Diami data will be open for other service providers (outside the consortium) to build their own applications on. This is an extra way to generate revenue, as these service providers will pay for this via a **subscription model**.

The approach towards farmers will likely be a **freemium model**, whereby Mavo Diami will offer (part of) the service for free, or via certain free channels (such as radio). For the more tailored services also smallholder farmers will purchase the services via a **subscription model** for which they will start paying after a trial period.</narrative>

  <description akvo:type="5" type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The aim of this project is to improve the food and income security of more than 100,000 smallholder farmers by accelerating their agri-business performance through informed decisions supported by the Mavo Diami services built on weather, water, soil, and crop signals and other relevant data and indicators. The project is called Mavo Diami, which means &apos;my land&apos; in Angolan local language (Kimbundo).

With the help of various geodata services, farmers can make informed decisions to improve their harvests. This concerns mobile data and geodata based information in the field of weather, soil, water, crops and other relevant data and indicators. The most important questions that are answered based on the information are:

- What to plant?
- When to plant?
- When to irrigate?
- When to harvest?

The envisaged impact of the effective use of Mavo Diami product and services is strengthened resilience of smallholder farmers to climate change; improved soil sustainability and land allocation; and improved self-reliance of smallholder farmers due to sustainable food and income security. In turn, this will contribute to a more stable agricultural economy in Angola.</narrative>

  <description akvo:type="3" type="3">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project will focus on two key market segments: the **smallholder** **farmer** segment and the **large &amp; commercial farm** segment.

The project aims to develop products/services for the key agri users. The services will deliver decision support and information from different information products, being agri-weather services, agri-performance monitoring, land and crop suitability (all for both small and large and commercial farms) and irrigation support (for large and commercial farms).</narrative>
