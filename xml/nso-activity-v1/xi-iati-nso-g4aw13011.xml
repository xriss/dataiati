GIACIS is a public-private partnership, aiming at expanding financial service delivery to all smallholder farmers living in the highlands of Ethiopia. Focus is on a geodata-driven riskmitigation (insurance) products that offer a basic safety net to protect them against the occurrence of weather related perils.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Small farmers (80% &lt; 0.5 ha) in the rainfed cropping areas of the 4 key-regions of Ethiopia: Oromia, SNNPR, Amhara and Tigray, who cultivate Tef, Wheat, Barley, Maize and Sorghum. The 3-year target is to reach &gt; 7 million households, of which 1.6 million are expected to purchase the product offered. The insurance addresses the needs of Ethiopian farmers that operate at the lowest step of development and those that have moved somewhat up the ladder.</narrative>
  </description>
  <description akvo:type="10" type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The main value proposition of the project for smallholder farmers is that they can insure a taken credit amount to purchase and use agricultural inputs, against weather-related perils. It thus protects a farmer against risks that seriously impacts on their ability to repay credit taken. It modifies/unlocks the risk-aversion behavior of farmers towards farming that prioritizes optimization of long-term productivity, profits, and sustainability.

Kifiya will design a transaction fee structure to enable the development and delivery of the GIACIS product through technology and use of their agent network. The insured-credit product will be part of a basket of services that runs on their mobile financial services platform bringing an increasing value-content as a cost-effective value-proposition to farmers. By transaction, Kifiya is able to charge bottom-price costs; when achieving transaction volume, their business proposition is viable.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The purpose of the Public-Private Partnership is to expand financial service delivery to smallholder farmers in Ethiopia with a geodata-driven risk-mitigation (insurance) product that offers a basic safety net to protect them against weather related perils. In partnership with local financial institutions, the insurance product will be bundled with credit to purchase agricultural inputs. In combination with weather prediction services, the insured credit package will locally be made available through ICT infrastructure services (branchless banking). The project consortium will align to the rural finance strategy (RFS program) as managed by ATA. This allows for a systematic synergetic approach to provide financial inclusion, promote investment for agriculture, broker sustainable production methods and provide risk transfer tools. The followed system approach creates a suitable legal, institutional and organizational framework.</narrative>
