  <description>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Gabriel was three years old when his village in South Sudan was attacked and he lost both of his parents. While he was in a state of hopelessness, his story reached a group of people in Texas who committed to fully fund his schooling, and his new life began with fresh hopefulness. Today, he is a graduate of Moi University, and has committed his life to bringing the same hope he was given to today&apos;s South Sudanese orphans by providing them with the invaluable gift of education.</narrative>
