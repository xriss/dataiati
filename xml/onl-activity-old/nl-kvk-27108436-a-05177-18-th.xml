   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Overview
Over 750 million South Asians depend on the transboundary Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna (GBM) river basins alone for food, water, and energy needs. These rivers are not only worshipped and revered across the region, but also supports a wide varietyof ecosystems. However, the livelihoods and ecosystems the rivers support are under severe threat from riverbank erosion caused by unregulatedinfrastructure developments, unplanned land use practices and climate change.

Riverbank erosion is increasingin scale and intensity across South Asia. Climate change impacts such as high intensity rainfall, glacier melt, flash floods are intensifying riverbank erosion, and this is further exacerbated by unregulated sand and riverbed mining, large-scale infrastructure development, local conflicts, and the lack of cooperation amongst the rivers&#x2019; stakeholders leave the poor, marginalized riverine communities vulnerable

Accounts of riverbank erosion are frequently reported in the region. For example, in the Kutiyabar area in Mahakali region Nepal, wherethe Jogbudha river eroded 700 meters of land, intense rain over just a few days led to riverbank erosion, inundating settlements and putting tens of families at risk. Likewise, Bangladesh, which is home to 700 rivers spanning 24,140 kilometers in length, is facing unprecedented challenges that are threatening the communities living in its drought and flood-prone topography. Coastal residents in Bangladesh are losing their homes and farmland at an astonishing ratedue to riverbank erosion, which affects roughly one million people and displaces 50,000 to 200,000 every year.

In this context, Internews Earth Journalism Network and Oxfam Transboundary Rivers of South Asia (TROSA) project, are jointly organizing a webinar targeting journalists in South Asia to bring the issue of riverbank erosion to the attention to journalists and media, and strengthen their knowledge and understanding on this issue. This document outlines the Scope of Work of Internews Earth Journalism Network in the delivery of this webinar.

The registered office address (and principal place of business), is 43-51 New North Road, London, N1 6LU. In 2018, Internews Europe initiated the process of acquiring effective control of the French Non-Profit Association Internews International (RNA no. W751139592, SIRET no. 425 132 347 000 13 APE 913). As of 15 November, 2017, Internews Europe had successfully registered a new entity in Ireland - Internews Media Development (A Company Limited by Guarantee) with registered Company number 615323. Under the new structure, Internews Europe remains theParent Company, with Internews France and Ireland as Subsidiaries. As December 2018, there is a requirement to consolidate the reports of both Internws Europe and Internews International, as control of the latter was achieved in February 2018.Internews Media Development Company (registered in November 2017 in the Republic of Ireland), remained dormant in 2018.
lnternews Europe maintains a formal &apos;Strategic Alliance&apos; with lnternews Network; a US based non-profit organisation which was the first media development organisation to bear the lnternews name and brand. A Memorandum of Understanding to firmly establish  a strategic alliance was signed by the boards of both entities in September 2014

Internews Europe is an international charity whose mission is to empower people worldwide with the trustworthy, high-quality news and information they need to make informed decisions, participate in their communities, and hold power to account.

The primary objective of the Charity as expressed in the Memorandum of Association is &#x201C;The promotion of education and vocational training in the field of journalism in all its forms for the benefit of the public, in particular in countries experiencing conflict, civil unrest, or natural disaster.&#x201D;

The root of our strategy is to improve the health of information environments. Healthy information environments are defined by the presence of good, accurate, evidence-based information &#x2014; information thateveryone can access safely, that consumers know how to critically assess, and that is valued by communities and sustained by business models that work. In healthy information environments, governments and businesses are accountable for keeping it that way</narrative>
