   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Uganda Women#s Network (UWONET) was formed in 1993 as an advocacy network by Ugandan Women; 16 national women#s organisations, institutions and 9 individuals to steer women#s rights, gender transformation and equality agenda. The network was formed out of the East African Preparatory Conference held in Kampala in 1993 to spearhead Uganda women#s efforts which led to the participation in the UN World Conference on Women held in Beijing in 1995.  UWONET was formed to champion a untied voice and create space for women to collectively address and take action on gender based discrimination in spheres of social economic and political life of women in Ugandaat all levels. UWONET#s core mandate is policy advocacy, however for the past five years it has concentrated programmatically on specific thematic areas and focus i.e. Women#s Leadership and Democratic Governance, Women#s Rights and Access to Justice, Women#s Economic Justice and Empowerment and Institutional Development and Organisational Strengthening.
1. ACHIEVEMENTS

1. Reduced tolerance and vulnerability to Gender Based Violence and most especially Violence against Women and Girls as a result of a holistic approach to GBV service delivery.
2. Policy influencing at National, regional and International levels such as engendering the NDP II, pushing for the enactment ofgender bills, policies and laws such as the Land Amendment Act, the Gender Policy, and the Marriage Bill, 2017. UWONET has also utilised global and regional processes and mechanisms to follow up on Uganda#s commitment to fulfilling gender through the CEDAW reporting and UPRM processes.
3. Increased and Improved access to justice and GBV case management as a result of strengthened individual, collective and systematic capacity of human rights and JLOS institutions such as the Police. SGBV desks have been introduced within the Police structure.
4. Increased women#s voice and influence in democratic governance and processes as a result of women#s participation in taking up leadership positions at all levels.
