  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Empowering Citizens Through Alternative Education project for OHKs funding support focuses on providing alternative education modelusing REFLECT methodology to 240 beneficiaries (50% girls and young women), through which the beneficiaries would acquire basic reading and writing skills, enhanced awareness that both men and women have equal rights and opportunities (education, health, participation and access to resources and information, sexual and reproductive health rights), and engaging in income generation activities as a result of the skills acquired in the REFLECT circle (meaning class meetings).

The local implementing partner of this project will be NANA (Associacao de Apoio ao Desenvolvimento). They will support and monitor the day-to-day implementation of the project in coordination with relevant stakeholders in the 2 districts (Mocuba and Lugela) where the project is going to be implemented. NANA isnot for profit, national development entity which was founded in February 1998. It is a legalentity with administrative, financial and patrimonial autonomy. It is composed of 32 youth of both sexes. The organization has Zambezia province as its operational area and is implementing various projects on governance on agriculture, education for active citizenship, health and institutional development. It is recognized as a development organization bythe government at district, provincial and national level.

NANA has interventions in the districts of Mocuba, Lugela, Alto Mol&#xF3;cu&#xE8; and Maganja da Costa. Its activities started in the City of Mocuba by a groupof students from Mocuba secondary school who committed themselves to tackling environmental degradation that was increasingly becoming a cause for concern in the city.  Over the last few years, NANA has expanded its intervention areas to cover, beside tackling environmental issues, they have interventions on Health, HIV / AIDS, Education, child support and protection and Good Governance. NANAalso prioritizes, advocacy, networking and capacity building of other Civil Society Organizations at local level. They are an active member of 2 powerful civil society forums in education; FEDUZA (Forum for Civil Society in the Education in Zambezia) at provincial level and MEPT (Movement of Education for All) at national level.

NANA and its partners work to ensure that human rights are respected, protected and upheld as a primary responsibility of the state. NANA has a  5 year strategic plan for the period (2016-2020). This strategic plan embraced some changes that have been embraced within the organization.  They are focussing more on human rights basedinterventions that empowers local communities to be part of an inclusive and participative governance at all levels. Its main pillars are; 1. governance for citizenship, 2. alternatives to governance for agriculture and natural resources, 3. governance for health and 4.  institutional development.  The first and second pillars responds and aligns well with 2 Oxfam Impact goals of; 1.   Advancing accountable politics for better public services and increased food security and 2. Transforming social norms so that young women can flourish.  In partnership with NANA, OXFAM is empowering communities especially young women and adult women to claim and enjoy their rights as citizens through formal and non-formal education.</narrative>
