3. INSTITUTIONAL PURPOSE

Arua District Blind Women Association is a registered non-profit making group which has promoted, economic empowered for women with disability to live with dignity, unity, regular meetings, close monitoring have made us successful. We have learned that we have to stick together, share experiences and meet regularly, we are also guided by our Constitution.

Vision: #Independent and self-reliant blind women in Aura District#
Mission: #To promote livelihood and expose plights and potentials of the Blind Women of Arua District so as to receive support and recognition in thecommunities

Institutional objectives: What arethe principal changes the organisation seeks to achieve over the long term?
Arua District Blind women Association believes that investments in Blind women#s potential to spur social and economic development, shiftingsocial power relations, and assuringan enabling environment in order for the poor and blind women marginalized households to attainfood security and sustainable resilient livelihoods will empower and liberate disabled people from poverty.
In this regard, Arua District Blind women associationstrives for independent living Uganda seeks to contribute to sustainable improvements in the socio-economic and ecological conditions, as a basis of ensuring dignity, wellbeing and resilience of its membership.
Arua principally operates in all sub counties of Arua including the refugee camps.  The social actors benefiting from Arua District Blind Women Associationwork include; women, youth, People with disabilities, men who are marginalised and have their voices not heard in the development process.

4. STRATEGIC POSITIONING
Analyse the environment in which the organisation works? Who are the other relevant social actors,including government and business, and what roles do they play? #In this context, what is unique about the position of the organisation?

Arua District Blind women Association operates in a relatively stable political climate after post conflict, existence of Local Government structures right to the village level and improved security. However, the area has been affected by the influx of refugees from South Sudan of which there are refugees who are blind and need attention by the association.

Disability is a development issue because of its bidirectional link to poverty; disability may increase the risk of poverty, and povertymay increase the risk ofdisability. A growing body of empirical evidence from across the world indicates that PWDs and their families are more likely to experience eco&#xAC;nomic and social difficulties than able bodied.

The onset of disability may lead to poverty and reduced social and economic well-being. The process is often negatively determined by the adverse impact on education, employment, earnings, and increasedexpendi&#xAC;tures related to disability.

PWDs are more likely to be unemployed and generally earn less even when employed. Both employment and income rates appear to worsen with the severity of the disability. It is harder for people with disabilities to benefit from development processes and escape from poverty due to discrimination inemployment, limited access to transport, and lack of access to resources to promote self-employ&#xAC;ment and livelihood activities.

Children with disabilities are less likely to attend school, thus experiencing limited opportunities for human capital formationand eventually facing reduced employment opportu&#xAC;nities and decreased productivity in adult&#xAC;hood.

Uganda has an enabling legal and policy environment in relation to disability. The Government of Uganda has developed policies and enacted laws intended to ensure the human rights of PWDs as well as their participation in development programmes.

The Constitution of Uganda (1995) prescribes affirmative action to address the existing imbalances affecting sociallymarginalised groups # including PWDsas itprovides the basis for enactment of laws and policies that address their concerns. The Constitution enjoins fair representation of marginalised groups on all constitutional bodies and recognition of the rights of PWDs to respect and human dignity. Specifically, it has a provision for affirmative action to redress the imbalance faced by PWDs like sign language services for the deaf.

The rights of PWDs are also enshrined in a number of Acts in Uganda. Most importantly in the Personswith Disabilities Act from 2006 which prohibits discrimination of PWDs in terms of access to education, health and employment. In fact, the Act provides comprehensive legal protection for PWDs, aimed at eliminating all forms of discrimination as well as ensuring equal opportunities.
