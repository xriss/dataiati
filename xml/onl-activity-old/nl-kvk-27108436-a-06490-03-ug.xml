Our programmes focus is on trauma healing, peace building and reconciliation, assistance to orphans and vulnerable children and elders, delivery of health and sanitation awareness at community level, skills development, and small &lt;(&gt;&amp;&lt;)&gt; large-scale agricultural development and economic empowerment.

2. ACHIEVEMENTS
What have been the principal results in the past three years that contribute to significant, structural, sustained and positive improvement in the lives of men, women, girls and boys suffering from poverty, injustice, insecurity and exclusion?

Psychosocial support aimed to improve the psychosocial well-being of refugees and host communities to promote community co-existence through addressing individual experience and creation of positiveattitudes in the community at household level.

Leadership &#x2013; in order to build a bridge between tribal leaders&#x2019; groups within the refugees&#x2019; community, to develop strong leadership structures empowered to promote peace.  SSURA in 2018 created two peace programmes,the peace cells and the tribal leaders&#x2019; reconciliation forum both in Koboko and Arua. The peace cell was at a Division level aimed at solving DomesticandGender Based Violence within the community. The tribal leaders&#x2019; reconciliation forum discussions were based onsecurity and general issues which are experienced to have been the main causes of conflict between tribes in South Sudan and in thecamps.

Itis evidenced in the daily life of SSURA&#x2019;s members and Refugees communities in Koboko and Arua that the Psychosocial programme and the creation of peace cells and tribal leaders&#x2019; forum have enabled the refugees&#x2019; communities in Koboko and Arua to freely interact across all tribes at all age groups and gender.

SSURA has been supporting affected South Sudanese with devastating situations on trauma, medical referrals from the camp to Koboko, Arua and Kampala. Deceased refugees in Koboko and Arua with no relatives and means of corps, transportation and burial arrangements. Those in police custody and facilitation of new arrivals to OPM through OPM&#x2019;s office for registration. Reconciliation and mitigation of conflicts. SSURA is currently active in mobilizationand dissemination of information to the refugees&#x2019; community.

SSURA have settled 17 domestic violence cases and those families are living happily withtestimonies of SSURA&#x2019;s positive strategy to bring peace into families within the refugees&#x2019; households

As it is at the centre of SSURA&#x2019;s heart to scale up its emergency interventions with minimal resources, SSURA mobilised vulnerable refugees and host community Women and Youth in Koboko into 28 VSLAs groups in which 27 (Twenty-seven) are Women groupsand 1 (one) Youth group. 18 of the    groups are very active and have successfully loaned money to their group members who paid back with a 5% interest.
