   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Promoting Gender Equality in Labour Code</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Vietnamese public, in particular urban young people, is increasingly concerned about gender equality. Articles about the genderwage gap, sexual harassment, and workplace discrimination (among other issues) appear regularly in the printed and online media, and are a frequent subject of discussion among Vietnamese women both on- and offline. With the development of social media, the publichas become better informed about key political and economic issues relating to gender equality.
# Vietnamese civil society has experienced rapid growth in the past decades, despite an incomplete legal framework. Beyond the state-affiliated mass organizations, civil society groups working on gender and labour issues now include domestic NGOs, social enterprises, andinformal workers# networks.
# Combining the above trends, civil society space is shifting to include a greater role of social media and access to information about public issues. Ongoing development activities of NGOs are complemented by a broader rangeof social activism including social media and informal groups and individuals acting collectively on an issue-specific basis. The use of social media # interactive forms of information and communication technologies (ICT) that involve people in generating and exchanging content # has developed into a higher level of complexity and sophistication.
# The EU-Vietnam Free Trade Agreement (EVFTA), expected to be under final approval in 2018, is a new-generation trade agreement that goes beyond traditional trade issues. This would regulate non-commercial topics including sustainable development and protection of workers# rights. According to Vietnam#s 5-year roadmap, if Vietnam fail to deliver its commitments in Chapter 5 of the EVFTA on trade and sustainabledevelopment, severe trade remedies shall apply . Domestic businessesare under increasing pressure to compete with foreign-owned businesses and to continue to be #suppliers of choice# for multinational corporations (MNCs) . Such regulatory and business contexts will potentially strengthen the incentives for businesses to change their labour policies and practices.
Goal: Proposed Labour Code amendments enhancing women#s economic empowerment are incorporated into law and practice
Objective: Strengthened andbroadened alliance to increase public awareness and support for gender equitable provisions in the Labour Code, with a focus on: (i) equal division of labour, (ii) workplaces free of GBV and sexual harassment, and (iii) equal pay
Expected Outcomes:
Outcome 1: Urban female and male workers have increased voice to discuss gender equality issues and how gender discrimination can be addressed in the workplace
Outcome 2: Business leaders and industry associations support addressing gender equality in the workplace
Outcome 3: National Assembly delegates have increased understanding of the impact of gender discrimination in the workplace on Vietnam#s economy
The focus of the project will be Outcomes 1 and 2 as per the terms of reference. Outcome 3 will support the other two outcomes and link with IWI Component 3.</narrative>
