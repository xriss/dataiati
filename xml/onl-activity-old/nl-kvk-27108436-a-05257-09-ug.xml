   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Evidence And Methods Lab is a civic technology initiative duly registered under section 18(3) of the Companies Act of 2012, as a company limited by guarantee, registration number 80020000250362.

Evidence and Method#s Lab works in the generating and simplifying information around access to information, transparency and accountability, and social justice and to package findings/data in formatsthat enable users to easily access and use it i.e. mainly through attractive infographics. Evidence and MethodsLab strongly believes that access to information is critical to building a civically competent citizenry and responsive and/or accountable authorities, and contributing to social justice.

EML envisions a world where all research findings and data are shared more efficiently and through the utilization of the evolving technological platforms and where organizations are employing cutting-edge approaches and methods to generate evidence and to learn from their work. In the next five years, they hope theywill be the leading infographics for social impact initiative in East Africa, and we will have worked all major players
in transparency and accountability, and justice law and order sector to craft and share infographics with over 3 million people in Uganda</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">EVIDENCE AND METHODS LAB</narrative>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Evidence And Methods Lab was founded in May 2017 by three ambitious gentlemen with professional backgrounds in; Social research, M&lt;(&gt;&amp;&lt;)&gt;E, Data Science, and Visual Communication, with the idea to build synergies within these respective areas of expertise withthegoal to ensure that evidence that is generated by various players within the research and policy arena can be put to better use by effectively sharing it with the intended beneficiaries.
The organization was founded as a civic technology initiative working in theareas of access to information, accountability and collating what works in generating evidence.
We work with organizations and individuals that generate information (policy evidence and (or) research findings) for social benefit by packaging this information intoformats that enable intended users to easily access and use it i.e. using creatively crafted infographics # still and motion graphics that are shared to the public using online and offline channels depending on the target audiences.
The infographics are meant to supplement and complement the traditional formats like project documentation and reports that are posted on institutional websites or in their respective resource centers. The infographics are produced in appealing visualsand different languages to make them easily understood, and are made readily accessible to the public both via online and offline platforms.

After incorporation in May 2017,we sought partners working within our focus areas of Transparency and Accountability, and Social Justice with whom we held framework agreements to support the work that we do.

In September 2017, we applied and emerged winners for the US Embassy - Small grants for promoting transparency and accountability and received a grant ofUSD 20,000 to implement a project to #Promote transparency and Good Governance through Civic Technology#.

In November 2017, we also applied to join a challenge by the Hague Institute of InnovatingLaw (HiiL) # a challenge to adopt innovative solutionstojustice needs faced by Ugandan. From this challenge, we emerged as winner and we got seed funding of #20,000 to simplify, visualize and share the Uganda Land Laws and procedures to guide victims of Land injustice with the information on how to securetheiroccupancy on their properties.

Due to the growing volume of work, the organization has grown its capacity from the initial founding team of 3 people to an implementing team of 10 people who include 4 women and six men. Adopting two women membersaspartof the senior team of five. This team is guided by an advisory board which comprise members within the Transparency and Accountability, and ICT for Development domain.


2. ACHIEVEMENTS
What have been the principal results in the past three years that contribute to significant, structural, sustained and positive improvement in the lives of men, women, girls and boys suffering from poverty, injustice, insecurity and exclusion?

Our greatest desire is to demonstrate that all the work we are doing issolving some problems for our country and the world at large. We strongly believe that through our infographics we

can reduce land related injustices by simplifying the law for citizens. We also strongly believe that by making public budget andexpendituredata available to citizens in a simplified format, we are paving a way for greater transparency and accountability in our country.In the past years we have continued to make formidable progress towards achieving our goals, affected the livesof many Ugandans andoperations of various institutions in the following ways;
- Reached over half a million people with infographics on social justice and transparency and accountability primarily via our social media platforms.
- Produced simplified versions ofthenational budgets for the past three years and published them on various channels including social media, website, national television etc.
- We have contributed to increased awareness among young Ugandan citizens of critical budget informationso as to enable them to agitate for transparency and accountability
- We have increased awareness of key land and property rights issues hence contributing to increase in number of Ugandans who can ably engage with the issues, including fighting for their right toland and property.
- We have built the capacity of a number of organisations in transparency and accountability, and social justice sector in utilizing infographics to share research findings and budget and expenditure, and land and property informationincluding LANDnet, Avocats Sans Fronti&#xE8;res (ASF), Great Lakes Institute for Strategic Studies, Never Again Rwanda, Open Society for West Africa (OSIWA), Lady Ellen Women&apos;s Aid Foundation (LEWAF-SL) etc. These organisations have in the endbecome more effective in addressing the needs of their audiences through effective communication.
- We have grown our internal capacity as an organization that works more efficiently and effectively, sharpened our model and enrolled new partners in order to serve our target audiences better and achieve our vision.
