   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Globally the project contributes to the Oxfam global Strategic Plan on Goal 6; &apos;&apos;Financing for Development and Essential Services (i.e Fiscal systems must translate to quality essential services) and to  Goal 4; on Fair Share of natural resources. Nationally theproject contributes to Goal 1 of Oxfam in Uganda&apos;s strategic plan-on Governance and Accountability.

The project will concentrate on forms of exclusionary governance in both countries wherein decision-making spaces remain composed of, and accountable to only a small group of political and economic elite. These governance structures are at work at both the national and subnational levels. Based on the Oxfam&apos;s Fiscal Accountability for Inequality Reduction (FAIR) program theory of change, Oxfam proposes to work in both countries to catalyze citizen demands for greater fiscal justice i.e Fair tax policy and increased public spending on social sectors such as health and education as a necessary precursor for reducing poverty and inequality. In ourview, working with citizens toward greater fiscal justice means challenging elite capture, exclusionary systems of governance and decision making and shifting power relations so that citizens regain a seat at the table to have a say over the economic andfiscal decisions that impact them most. We believe that this sort of power redistribution based in increased direct citizen participation and citizen driven demands for greater accountability will help reverse regressive, unjust policies and practices that intentionally concentrate wealth and power in the handsof the few at the expense of the majority#essentially all forms of economic and fiscal governance that operate only by and for the political and economic elite.

The premise behind this rationale is based on our belief in the power of active citizenship#the ability of citizens to process information about the use of public resources and use these disclosures to organize together to hold duty bearersto account. Fiscal justice is about people having space, voice and agency to exercise their rights in order to monitor and influence fiscal systems to ensure that these are fair, mobilize greater revenue, and increase and improve spending for quality publicservices for all. Government policies on taxation and public spending are important tools in the fight for tackling inequality. This project aims to focus on increasing capacity within civil society to strengthen the collective space, voice and agencyof citizens to regain access to and power over these tools as important instruments for fiscal justice.

Based on lessons learned within both the FAIR and Extractive Industries Global Programs (EIGP) Oxfam proposes to address some of the structural causes of poverty, inequality and fiscal injustice in Kenya and Uganda by challenging power relations, norms, knowledge and tools for exclusion at the nationaland sub-national level. The project is aimed at catalyzing active citizenship, particularly that of women, in public financial management and petroleum revenues at national and subnational levels by strengthening civil society actors to fulfill their roles as critical change agents in efforts for greater fiscal justice. The proposed project will be anchored on applied political economic analyses that ensures constant reflection on how change happens. In this regard, Oxfam will work with civil society groups and individuals that have influence but are currently missing from discussions on revenue management including faith groups, women#s groups, academia and media influencers</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">1. HISTORY
Why, when and by whom was the organisation founded? Explain the principal stages the organisation has been through and the major changes it has undergone, including changes in integrating gender.
The Advocates Coalition for Development and Environment (ACODE) is an independent public policy research and advocacy think tank based in Uganda. Founded in 1999 as a Not-for-Profit Organisation, ACODE was inspired by the need to respond to policy analysis gaps and facilitate effective policy implementation through evidence -based advocacy. Since its establishment, ACODE has become one of the leading think tanks on the African continent in cutting-edge public policy research and analysis. ACODE#s work focuses on four programme areas: (i) Economic Governance; (ii) Environment and Natural Resources Governance; (iii) Democracy, Peace and Security; (iv) Science, Technology and Innovation. For the last seven consecutive years, ACODE has been ranked as one of the best think tank in Uganda and one of the top 100 think tanks in Sub-Saharan Africa and globally in the Global Think Tanks Index Report published by the University of Pennsylvania#s Think Tanks and Civil SocietiesProgram (TTCSP).
The organization is now implementing its third strategic plan-2019-2029. During the last one decade, ACODE has been progress on a number of fronts. It has advocated for gender sensitive budgeting and inclusion of women and youth in government programming. At the institutional level, ACODE has a gender balanced Board of trustees that has continued to engender the organisational programing.
ACODE is the Host institution for the Civil Society Coalition on Oil and Gas in Uganda (CSCO). The Civil Society Coalition on Oil and Gas (CSCO) is a loose network of 61-member organizations working towards sustainable governance of Uganda#s oil and gas resources so as to maximize the benefits to the people of Uganda.  The Coalition was founded in 2008 to nurture and harness a shared civil society platform for promoting and strengthening civil society coordination, networking and advocacy in the Oil and Gas sub-sector.
2. ACHIEVEMENTS
What have been the principal results in the past three years that contribute to significant, structural, sustained and positive improvement in the lives of men, women, girls and boys suffering from poverty, injustice, insecurity and exclusion?
In 2018, ACODE#s second strategic plan (2009 # 2018) that provided direction for programing of the Organization for a decade came to an end. Over this period, several achievements were made by the Organization. These include promoting budget transparency and accountability for improved service delivery; capacity building for local governments through the Score Card initiative and implementation of Civic Engagement Action Plans (CEAPS) to improve service delivery; running campaigns to save forests in Uganda from encroachment and degazettement for private use; informing policy formulation for governance of Uganda#s nascent oil and gas sector; and supporting regional peacebuilding processes among others. ACODE works contribute to attainment of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and Africa Vision 2063.
3.    INSTITUTIONAL PURPOSE
Mission: What is the current purpose of the organisation?
Our Vision is: Inclusive, sustainable and prosperous societies in Africa
Our vision speaks to the Africa we want as articulated in Agenda 2063, an embodiment of the aspirations of the African people.  Our vision is also informed by the Vision 2050 of the East African Community and reflects the aspiration of each of the six states of the East African Region.

ACODE#s Mission is to make public policy work for people.
Through Research and Analysis, ACODE builds new knowledge and innovative tools for governance and supports governments and international development agencies to expand the range of policy choices to confront challenging and sometimes controversial public policy problems.

Through policy outreach and advocacy, ACODE contributes to the formulation of public policies that support sustainable development, thereby expanding livelihood and income opportunities for poor people.

Through capacity building, ACODE empowers communities to demand for justice, and promotes public participation and citizens# demand for accountability in making decisions that affect their livelihoods and the environment.

Through Civic Engagement, ACODE empowers citizens to demand for accountability and henceshaping public policies that are just and equitable.


Institutional objectives: What are the principal changes the organisation seeks to achieve over the long term?
(i) Strengthen public finance management and increase economic opportunities for women, men and youth.
(ii) Strengthen democracy and security institutions.
(iii) Improve governance and sustainable management of environment and natural resources.
(iv) Strengthen institutional capacity and enabling policies for harnessing science, technology and innovation for sustainable development.
(v) Institutional Development of ACODE.



Field(s) of activity: What are the principal thematic and geographic areas in which the organisation works?  Who are the social actors that benefit from the work?
Economic Governance Program
The Economic Governance program aims at strengthening economic policies and institutions for achieving economic transformation of Uganda#s economy and the region. Economic growth of the past decade has only delivered meagre improvements in livelihoods in many African countries. There is need to improve effectiveness and efficiency of public expenditure as well as providing economic opportunities for all. The strategic objective of this program is to strengthen public finance management and increase economic opportunities for women, men and the youth.This will be achieved through:
# supporting reforms for greater transparency and accountability in Public Financial Management,
# building capacities of local governments to implement Local Economic Development
policies,
# Facilitating citizen participation in formulation and monitoring the implementation of trade (including regional) policies.

Environment and Natural Resources Governance Program
The Environment and Natural Resources Governance program is driven by the fact that most African countries are dependent on natural resources. In the last decade, there has been renewed efforts by multi-national companies and African governments to exploit natural resources especially petroleum and mineral resources to meet the growing international demands and national development needs. Consequently, there has been increasing massive land acquisitions that have left communities especially women and youth more vulnerable. There has also been limited transparency and accountability in the generation and utilization from natural resources wealth. At the same time, climate change and its consequences pause a serious threat to achieving the UN Sustainable Development Goals. There has been increased occurrence of disasters such as extreme weather and hunger related to climate change. Thestrategic objective of the Natural Resources Governance program is to improve governance for sustainable utilisation of environmentand natural resources. This will be achieved through:
# strengthening governance frameworksand improved practices that support sustainable management and utilization of environment and natural resources,
# empowering communities to demand for transparency, accountability and equity in the management of environment and natural resources.
Science, Technology and Innovation Program
Globally, therole of Science, Technology and Innovation (STI) as an engine of economic development has been underscored. It is widely acknowledged that the application of STI increases efficiency of production systems and enhances industrial competitiveness. In fact, what gives a nation competitive edge is the speed with which it can identify, utilize and diffuse new knowledge. Therefore, Africa must harness STI for economic transformation. The strategic objective ofthis program is to promote the application of Science, Technology andInnovation for sustainable development in the region and Africa as whole. This will be achieved through:
# increasing access to information on appropriate technologies in the agricultural sector,
# strengthening the legal and policy frameworks for STI in the agricultural sector.
Democracy, Peace and Security Program
The Democracy, Peace and Security programme is premised on the recognition that violent conflicts and political instability have undermined Africa#s economic development. The programme is underpinned by the nexus between peace and development on the one hand and democracy on the other. The strategic objective of this program is to strengthen democracy and security institutions in East and Southern Africa. This will be achieved through:
# building capacity of national political and administrative institutions,
# supporting democratic, legal and policy reforms,
# supporting security sector reforms, supporting regional peacebuilding initiatives.
ACODE#s programs are implemented at national and sub-national levels. At sub-national level, ACODE operates in 36 districts of Uganda.
The beneficiaries of our work include all citizens of Uganda and in particular communities that live within 36 districts of operation.
4. STRATEGIC POSITIONING
Analyse the environment in which the organisation works? Who are the other relevant social actors, including government and business, and what roles do they play? &apos;  In this context,what is unique about the position of the organisation?
For the last one decade, Uganda has been relatively stable. The country has registered considerable progress towards democracy also there have been limited space for political party activities. A combination of regime longevity and regime survival politics, poverty and general lack of civic consciousness are undermining citizens# abilities to hold their leader#s accountability in furtherance of democratisation and service delivery.

The economy whichis largely dominated with the state players has been growing at a slow pace, having shifted from impressive growth performance averaging 7% to a record low of less than 6% in 2017. While the country has witnessed significant improvements in public service delivery, major deficiencies remain. An impressive network of health centres built across the country has not led to qualitative improvements in the delivery of health care services. While Universal Primary Education (UPE) has enabled children to go to school, a combination of poor quality and poor transition rates are consigning the majority of Uganda#s children to the margins of the global economy. Corruption and breakdownin systems of accountability between leaders and citizens have severely undermined public service delivery in sectors such as roads, agriculture as well as the environment and natural resources sector.
Uganda has a vibrant civil society that has continued to build the civic consciousness of citizens to hold government and private sector players accountable. However, the majority of civil society organisations have limited capacity to generate data and independent policy ideas that can inform policy development and implementation. While political parties have the mandate to hold government accountable, they are poorly organised, underfunded and unable to do credible research to improve policy implementation. The private sector has played a significant role in establishing business investments and creating job opportunities and improving community livelihoods through investment in social infrastructure like schools, health facilities. However, private sector work is also affected by limited transparency and accountability within the institutions they work with or those mandated tofacilitate investments and poor road infrastructure.
ACODE#s speciality has been policy research, advocacy and institutional capacity building. Research has been used to provide empirical evidence on policy development and implementation gaps. ACODE hasunparalleled ability nationally to organise high level policy dialogues on contemporary issues that usually bring together policy makers, government technocrats, private sector and civil society. Community engagement based on civic engagement meetings and civicengagement action plans have been instrumental in holding leaders accountable and has improved service delivery. ACODE has also been able to craft partnerships and has executed a memorandum of understanding with several ministries and agencies that facilitate its work. ACODE has a memorandum of partnership with the Ministry of Finance Planning and economic Development, National planning authority, Uganda local Government Association among others.

The research, advocacy abilities and partnerships that ACODE has crafted over the years places ACODE in a unique position as a social actor in Uganda.
