   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Platform for Labour Action (PLA) is a registered Non-Government Organization founded in 2000 by a group of female activists in response to the absence of specific intervention to promote and protect the rights of undocumented women, youth and children inthe informal sector. It was founded and still operates on values such as professionalism, transparency, accountability, commitment, team work, respect for human rights and zero tolerance for corruption.

PLA has a theory of change and its overall is toempower communities through awareness raising on issues which affect vulnerable workers and vulnerable persons; provide free legal aid to enable access to justice; legal advocacy; policy engagement and social development sector budget monitoring, capacity development; and bridging thegap to access services including education, health, legal services among vulnerable target groups. We address the root causes of child exploitation and provide options to the vulnerable children through the rights based andlivelihood programmatic approach. These strategies result into protection of human rights and improved livelihoods of vulnerable and marginalized workers in Uganda. Our work is structured under three thematic areas namely 1) Rights Social Protection and Accountability, 2) Institutional Strengthening and3) Research Learning and Knowledge Management.

According to the Uganda National Employment policy 2011, Domestic workers are amongthe most vulnerable and marginalised workers in Uganda that need protection. Moreover, the Employment Act 2006 further exposes Domestic workers to conditions of abuse and exploitation by failing to regulate recruitment and employment of Domestic workers. According to 2017 PLA study, 93% of domestic workers are female and the majority of Domestic Workers majority 65% youths primarily from rural areas which exacerbates DWs vulnerabilities. The invisible and hidden nature of domestic work makes the DWs prone to abuses and marginalisation. Therefore an appropriate legal framework forms the basis on which domestic workers can claim their rights and begin to secure decent work. The Leaders of domestic workers (chosen by domestic workers group members to represent them) at a meeting heldin July 2018 at Kyebando Vocational Training centre unanimously agreed that the lack of a specific law on domestic work is the foundation of most of societal abuses and violations at the work place.

This project aims at promoting decent work for domestic workersin Uganda. This will be through influencing legal and policy reforms in the domestic work sector, strengthening networks of domestic workers that are able to demand for improved working conditions and increasing awareness for domestic workers and employers of domestic workers at the work place. This will result into improved quality of services rendered by domestic workers as they will carryout their work in an informed working environment.

Overall goal: To promote decent work for domestic workers in Uganda.

Objectives:
1. Strengthen networks of domestic workers influencing change in the domestic work sector.
2. Influence the enactment of the appropriate legal and policy mechanism for positive changes of their working conditions.
3. Facilitate  women and female youth domestic workers&apos; access to information</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The organization was founded in the year 2000 by three women activists due to the absence of a voice to advocate for the rights of vulnerable and marginalised workers. The organisation has since grown in terms  of  geographical  coverage  and  is  currently  operating  in  10  districts  of  Uganda  in  three  region; Eastern,  Central  and  Northern  Uganda  with  three  offices;  the  headoffice  in  Kampala,  filed  offices  in Lira  and  Iganga  as  well  as  site  light  offices  in  Amolatar,  Dokolo,  Kaliro.  The  organisation  has  had  the opportunity  to  appreciate  and  understand  the  gender  dynamics  of  the  target  groups  through a  gender mainstreaming   support   programme   that   was   provided   by   one   of   her   development   partners   the Democratic  Governance  Facility.  This  support  resulted  into  the  organisation  formulating  a  Gender Mainstreaming  strategy.    The organisation  has  had  four  board  chairperson  since  its  inception.  The founding  members  of  the  organisations  have  since  left  the  active  implementation  of  the  day  to  day operations  and  are  now  at  the  Board  of  Trustees  providing  overall  guidance  to  the  board  of  directors. We  have  changed  our  office  locations  for  the  head  office  three  times  andwe  are  currently  at  plot  14 off   Martyrs   Lane   in   Ntinda   Nakawa   division   although   it   is   important   to   note   we   have   never   left Kampala. Our mission has been changed once since inception.


2.   ACHIEVEMENTS
What  have  been  the  principal  results  in  the  past  three  years  that  contribute  to  significant,  structural, sustained   and   positive   improvement   in   the   lives   of   men,   women,   girls   and   boys   suffering   from poverty, injustice, insecurity and exclusion?


Our   advocacy   work   for   the   Expansion   of   the   Senior   Citizens   Grant   in   Uganda   resulted   into GovernmentofUganda  taking  a  decision  to  roll  out  the  Senior  Citizens  Grants  to  an  additional  40 districts  over  the  next  5  years;  and  greatly  informed  and  shaped  the  National  Social  protection  Policy that was approved in March 2016.

624  (313  girls  and  311  boys)  children  from  vulnerable  households,  at  risk  and  exploited  in  domestic work   and   gold   mining   were   supported   to   realize   their   right   to   education   in   vocational   training institutions   where   they   were   able   to   acquire   marketable   skills   that   they   are   now   using   to   earn decently.

93  vulnerable  household  heads  from  Kampala,  Bugiri  and  Moroto  district  are  now  able  to  provide  for their family especially the children to  attend  andstay school  as wellas meet  other family basic needs. This   was   a   result   from   supporting   income   generating   activities   (IGAs)   and   income   management training  feasible  with  their  abilities  and  the  opportunities  available  in  their  areas  of  residence  and provided start-up capital to each

PLA   has   generated   valid   and   only   data   on   the   situation  of   Domestic   workers   including   profiling Domestic work and  its contributions to the  house  and  economic development of the  country. This data has  informed  and  justified  recommendations  by  the  Uganda  Law  Reforms  Commission  to  amend  the current labour laws and regulate domestic worker.

PLA  has  influenced  Ministry  of  Gender,  labour  and  Social  Development  to  make  pronouncements  that domestic   workers   will   soon   have   a   standardised   employment   contract.   This   is   was   one   of   the commitments  made  by  the  Honourable  Minister  of  Gender,  labour  and  Social  Development  when  the
2017 study findings were presented to her.

The  Government  banned  and  halted  the  bilateral  agreement  with  Saudi  Arabia  to  send  Ugandans  to work  as  domestic  workers  following  Civil  Society  Organizations  including  Platform for  Labour  Action raising  concerns  including  maltreatment,  poor  working  conditions  and  abuse  of  the  women  in  Saudi Arabia to the Speaker of Parliament.

Our  advocacy  work  on  the  need  to  operationalise  the  industrial  court  the final  court  in  the  labour
related  matters  resulted  into  the  re-  opening  andoperationalised  of  the  court  after  8  years  of  workers not  access justice. As a result  of our advocacy activities on the  need  to  revise the  minimum  wage, the minimum  wages  advisory  board  was  appointed  and  asked  to  carryout  research  on  the  minimum  wage to  advice  the  government.    Accordingly  PLA#s  advocacy  activitiesin  the  social  protection  and  pension sector led to the currentand ongoing liberalisation reforms in the pensions sector.


3. INSTITUTIONAL PURPOSE

The  Vision:  A  society  where  democratic  values  and  social  justice  are  respected  and  observed  in  the world of work

Mission  Statement:  Promoting  and  protecting  the  rights  of  vulnerable  and  marginalized  workers through  empowerment  of  communities  and  individuals,  action  oriented  research,  policy  dialogue,  and legal aid in Uganda

4. STRATEGIC POSITIONING
Analyse the environment inwhich the organisation works? Who are the other relevant social actors, including government and business, and what roles do they play? #In this context, what is unique about the positionof the organisation?

Overall,  Uganda  has  registered  an  increase  in incomepoverty  in  the  last  three  years  from  19.7%  in
2013  to  27%  in  2017  (UBOS  2016/17  Uganda  National  Household  Survey  (UNHS))  with  the  eastern region experiencing thehighest incidences of poverty at 42%, followedbythe northernregionat39% . With
the  increase  in  the  income  poverty  levels,  poor  vulnerable  and  marginalised  persons  are  unable  to
access  justice  when  faced  with  legal  problems  due  to  the  costs involved  compounded  by  the  limited ability   to   articulate   legal   provisions,   technical   processes   and   procedures (JLOS   Fourth   Strategic Development  Plan  2017-2020).    Currently,  the  Ugandan  economy  can  only  absorb  about  15%  ofthe young  people  completing  post-primary education  and  released  onto  the  job  market  leaving  the  majority
unemployed. The employment challenge  has resulted  into 70%   (Uganda Labour Market Profile 2016) of the  labour  force  absorbed  in  the  informal  sector  which  remains  insufficiently  supported,  not  regulated and  characterised  with  noncompliance  with  the  labour  and  employment  standards  leading  to  multiple rights  violations  and  abuses  of  workers  in  this  sector  (The  Uganda  National  Employment  Policy 2011).The  unemployment  challenge  has  further led  to  increased  labour migration especially among  the youths
amidst  limited  access  to  information  on  safe  migration  options,  insufficient  job  orientation,  weak  legal and policy frame works, as well as the minimal and unpublicised government protection measures in the countries  of  destination  amongst the  migrants.PLA  is  the  only  legal  aid  service  provider  that  directly targets   informal   economy   and   low   income earnersand   with   14   years   of   experience   in   handling vulnerable   and   marginalized   workers#   issues,   simplification   and   translation   of   labour   related   laws, informing legislative and policy reforms in   the social protection and pensions sector.</narrative>
