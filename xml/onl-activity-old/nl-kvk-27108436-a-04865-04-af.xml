   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project falls under the thematic area Conflict and Fragility. Through our work Oxfam Novib and SOMO aim to achieve that more marginalized groups have a say in policies that affect their lives; governments and international institutions support inclusion of women and promote protection of marginalized groups in security and peace building; and the private sector contributes to peace and development.
.
ToC 1) Right to Food:
Oxfam Novib and SOMO aim to achieve that more small-scale food producers and agricultural workers, particularly women and their communities, benefit from local to global publi cand private sector policies that protect and promote their prosperity and resilience
ToC 2) Greater Responsibility in Finance for Development:
Oxfam Novib and SOMO aim to achieve thatmore women, youth and other citizens benefit from higher quality and quantity of finance for development, an enhanced fiscal systemand a sustainable and inclusive financial and corporate sector, tackling extreme inequality.
ToC 3) Conflict and Fragility:
Oxfam Novib and SOMO aim to achieve that more marginalized groups have a say in policies that affect their lives; governments and international institutions support inclusion of women and promote protection of marginalized groups in security and peace building; and the private sector contributes to peace and development.
Within this Theory of Change, this project in Afghanistan has set the following objective: Voices and needs of Afghan women affected by conflict are represented at sub- national and international levels to enhance protection of women in public spaces, prevent gender-based violence, and gender-sensitive undertaking of relief and recovery measures aimed at the most vulnerable women and girls.
The proposed project will aim to meet the following objectives to achieve the longterm outcomes;
1. To build the capacity of civil society organizations (CSOs) at the local (district) level through tailor-made training and mentoring on the policy process on NAP 1325#s Pillar 2 (Protection) &lt;(&gt;&amp;&lt;)&gt; Pillar 4 (Relief and Recovery).
2. To build the capacity of civil society organizations at the local and national levels on evidence-based advocacy.
3. To raise the awareness of non-state actors, particularly traditional community and religious leaders, at the local (district) level on NAP 1325 so to enable them to hold the government accountable on its commitments under NAP 1325.
4. To build the capacity of state actors on the policy process on NAP 1325 with a specific focus on Pillar 2 (Protection) and Pillar 4 (Relief and Recovery).
5. To develop an evidence-based mechanism for monitoring progress toward NAP objectives, with a focus on Pillar 2 and 4.
6. To strengthen state-CSO dialogue and cooperation on gender equality and women#s rights using NAP 1325 as the policy instrument, and building on structures and impacts resulting from Oxfam Novib#s Citizens First, Bayan, and RiC projects.
To achieve this long-term outcome in Afghanistan Oxfam and APPRO works together with the following Civil Society Organizations
1. Equal rights and sustainable development (ESD)
2. Independent cooperation for change
3. Pioneers Idea Generation
4. Pason legal Association
5. National process of justice and freedom
6. Afghan Women Organization for Women
7. Green Youth of Afghanistan
8. PEDO
9. Spring work
10. Afghan Women Network
11. Cooperating of Disabled and Poor People of Afghanistan (CODPPA)
12. NDWO (Naji Development Welfare Organization)
APPRO is contributing to the joint effort through &lt;(&gt;&lt;&lt;)&gt;Baseline, Training and Mentoring, Monitoring, Outreach and Advocacy.
 APPRO will work closely with Oxfam Novib and PTRO to implement the activities for National Action Plan (NAP) 1325 and have the responsibility for baseline and regular annual monitoring National Action plan 1325, capacity building of provincial Advocacy committees (delivering Trainings) in Daikundi and Balkh while atnational level APPRO will have the responsibility of mentoring the national advocacy committees (NAC). In addition to that outreachand advocacy at the provincial and national level will be based on the findings of the regular monitoring of NAP 1325 and will be carried out by the PAC and NAC with the support from APPRO.

APPRO will work closely with Oxfam Afghanistan and APPRO#s regional offices to implement the activities of #Citizens for 1325#, reporting to Oxfam Afghanistan about these activities. APPRO, through APPRO-Europe, will work closely with Oxfam Novib in The Hague to feed into and coordinate outreach and advocacy activities outside Afghanistan.
1. By 2018, 30 Afghan CSOs (including Women#s Organizations) have increased thematic and operational capacity and formed a stronger alliance to engage in advocacy trajectories, and hold the Afghan government accountable on its commitments to Pillar 2 (protection) and Pillar 4 (relief and recovery) as stated in the NAP 1325 adopted in June 2015.
2. By 2018, the CSOs and WOs involved in this program have become structurally involved in the monitoringand proper implementation of Pillar 2 and 4 of the NAP 1325, based on the voices of women in the target areas through a new monitoring and advocacy mechanism, which fosters both critical and constructive engagement with the relevant authorities at the Provincial level

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Afghanistan Public Policy Research Organization (APPRO) is an independent social research organization with a mandate to promote social and policy learning to benefit development efforts in Afghanistan and other less developed countries through conducting social scientific research, monitoring and evaluation, and training and mentoring. APPRO is registered with the Ministry of Economy in Afghanistan as a non-profit non-government organization and headquartered in Kabul, Afghanistan with regional offices in Mazar-e Sharif (north), Herat (west), Kandahar (south), Jalalabad (east), and Bamyan (center). APPRO and its individual researchers have undertakenprojects in Europe, Central Asia, Pakistan, India, Africa, China, and Turkey.

APPRO is also a founding member of APPRO-Europe, a network association for disseminating applied research findings from conflict environments, conducting training on the policy process, and carrying out evaluations.

APPRO#s mission is to facilitate critical dialogue on development policy for less developed, in- and post-conflict countries. This mission has two components. The first component is to measure development progress against strategicreconstruction objectives and provide insights into how to improve performance against the milestones set by the national governments and their international donors. The second component is to train and mentor a pool of national researchers to conduct applied research, practical training with a focus on the policy process, and evaluations consistent with internationally recognized standards. Findings from APPRO#s research and evaluations are disseminated to address existing and pressing knowledge gaps in the policy makingprocess and to advance the learning of researchers, academics, and decision and policy makers at all levels.
Approach to Research, Monitoring and Evaluation, and Training
APPRO#s key strength is its ability to work under difficult operating conditions while adhering to the highest standards in social scientific inquiry. APPRO conducts research, monitoring and evaluation, and training on the crosscutting themes of Human Security, Political Economy, Governance, Aid Effectiveness, and Natural Resource and Environmental Management. The focus of APPRO#s work is to promote dialogue and collaboration between parties with varying or competing agendas who share a focus on reconstruction. APPRO recognizes that in any policy environment, intended solutions create new and unaccounted for problems. As a result, research at APPROis focused on a close examination of the interface between new and pre-existing forms of organization. Particular attention is paid to identifying and mapping autochthonous, or organic, structures and optimal ways through which policy solutions can be absorbed by these structures.

The approach to social research, monitoring and evaluation, and training at APPRO is, in essence, #institutionalist# and policy-oriented. In its work APPRO employs a notion of institutions that encompasses allmanner of social, economic, and political structures through which a given locale or territory is governed. This broad spectrum of institutions includes habits, customs, and religious values as well as social networks based on ethnicity, economic interest, or politicalallegiance, and formal rules, regulations, and government structures. Understanding how the process of development is governed, therefore, requires taking a full inventory of the institutions through which development intervention can be provided.

Sinceits founding in 2008 APPRO has conducted research, designed and implemented monitoring projects, carried out evaluations, and conducted policy training at numerous Afghan ministries for a variety of donors including the Government of Afghanistan, WorldBank, Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs, UNICEF # Afghanistan, CIDA, CARE # Afghanistan, UNDP, Cordaid, GiZ, Cordaid, and Oxfam Novib.
Research
APPRO#s research is supported by the strong academic credentials of its experienced senior research staff whichensures compliance with internationally recognized standards for rigorous and applied social scientific research. Because of the academic affiliation of its senior research staff, APPRO is in a unique position to remain informed of the latest thinkingon a variety of development issues. This affiliation also enables APPRO to utilize the latest methods for, and innovations in, social scientific inquiry in an applied manner and in challenging operating environments such as Afghanistan. The key areas of research are:

Political Economy: This theme explores the organization of economic activity in rural and urban settings at the macro-, meso- and micro-scales of analysis. APPRO views the political economy as a product of the interactions between variouseconomic actors with vested interests constrained or enabled by different contextual factors. Effecting change in the political economy thus requires in-depth understanding of the physical and material conditions, demographic features, and the manner in whichpolicy decisions are made. To date, APPRO has carried out a number of research projects on informal labor markets, business climate, micro enterprises, urban economic development, service provision in urban areas, rural economic development, migration and economic development, climate change and rural food security, domestic and international trade, women in business, corruption, and value chain analysis of agricultural products.

The scale of analysis ranges from organizational, e.g., enterprise production, to sub-national, national, and international. At all scales of analysis a value chain approach is adopted to map and analyze processes in their entirety to establish where efficiencies can be incorporated into the system, how equity in production and resource use can be increased, and how adverse environmental and social impacts can be eliminated, minimized or managed. To date APPRO has applied this approach to examining the impact of climate change on agricultural production, gender and agricultural production, micro foundations of value chains, realignment of domestic products# markets, and the agricultural innovation systems of selected products. These studies have focused on the innovative capacity, coping strategies, and system resiliencies and potential for expansion and growth. See Publications for sample reports.

Governance: This theme examines the dynamics of societal and organizational transformation toward a legitimate, democratic, inclusive, and sustainable mode of governance, payingparticular attention to the formal and informal institutions through which governance is exercised, changes that result in a more legitimacy for the government, and efforts likely to increase general consent about and legitimacy of the governing bodies. Studies under this theme place particular emphasis on the linkages between governance and its institutions, both formal/tangible and informal/intangible, and the trade-offs that need to be made between social, economic, and political considerations and priorities. Governance is researched at multiple jurisdictional scales descriptively (i.e., governance of X) and normatively (i.e., governance for X). Based on this holistic view of governance, APPRO provides training on the policy process and institutionalanalysis to governmental and non-governmental bodies. Given the demographics of less and least developed countries, governance research at APPRO pays particular attention to the role of youth and women in governance. See Training for more information.

Human Security: This theme examines socio-economic, civil and political issues from a human rights perspective. There are a number of international conventions promoting social and economic, civil and political rights to which governments of less and least developed countries have signed up. Research under this theme aims to enhance understanding and appreciation of the numerous barriers that prevent the signee governmentsfrom meeting their human rights commitments. The research also aims to increase consensus on how national and international donors can work more strategically and coherently to integrate human rights in development aid programming. To date, APPRO has carried out a number of research projects on material and rights protection issues including access to health, education, and justice. Related research under this theme includes critical analysis of anti-corruption programming, public service provision including sanitation, and employment. See Presentations for highlighted findings under this theme.

Aid Effectiveness: Work under Aid Effectiveness is intended to inform the government, civil society, and the international development community about successes and pitfalls of development aid intervention through a systemic examinationof the flows, processes, outputs, and impacts of intervention. APPRO has evaluated a large number of programs and projects implemented by national and international organizations. While the findings from these evaluations remain confidential to APPRO#s clients, theevaluations have provided in-depth insights into operational issues and challengesassociated with development aid provision in a variety of contexts including humanitarian aid, women#s rights, vocational training,security sector reform, access to justice, access to health and education, natural resource management, and agricultural development. The learning from these evaluations has provided APPRO with a rich reservoir of knowledge for designing applied social research, monitoring systems, evaluations, and training. See Training for more information. See Publications for sample reports.

Natural Resource and Environmental Management: This theme focuses on how the sustainability of resource use and environmental management can be increasedthrough adopting a mix of traditional and modern (technological) approaches. APPRO#s research under this theme emphasizes the crucial linkages that need to be made between modern approaches to natural resource management and generations-old and (often) sustainable resource use and coping strategies. The scale of analysis ranges from organizational (e.g., enterprise production) to sub-national and national. At all scales of analysis a lifecycle approach is adopted to map and analyze processes to establishwhere efficiencies can be incorporated into the system, how equity in resource use can be increased, and how adverse environmental impacts canbe eliminated, minimized or managed. APPRO has applied this approach to examining the impact of climate change on agricultural production, gender and agricultural production, and the agricultural innovation systems for selected products.

All research reports areplaced in public domain through APPRO#s website at: www.appro.org.af
Monitoring and Evaluation
To date APPRO has conducted over 30 evaluations of donor funded programs and projects on education, health, humanitarian aid, food for work, food security, vocational training for women, access to the legal system for women, and access to services in urban areas. APPRO has also developed monitoring systems for tracking changes in women#s conditions in the context of transition of security responsibility from international to national security forces and the conditions of women in the Afghan National Police.

Whilethe findings from evaluations remain confidential to APPRO#s clients, the evaluations and monitoring projects have provided APPRO with in-depth insights into operational issues and challenges associated with development aid provision in a varietyof contexts including humanitarian aid, women#s rights, vocational training, security sector reform, access to services, natural resource management, and education. Based on the learning from evaluations and monitoring programs, APPRO provides training modules onthe dynamics of the policy process and program / project design.
Training
APPRO#s training in policy development and implementation is supported by the strong academic and professional credentialsof its senior researchers. In policy analysis training,APPRO#steam of trainers has provided guidance to ministerial officials on how to conduct baseline assessments and develop policy dialogue, design policy, develop policy implementation plans, design monitoringsystems, develop usable indicators,and analyze outcomes to inform policy revision. As part of this training, the participants are also familiarized with Logical Framework development and analysis, the role of research as an integrated component of development policy design and implementation, the role of advocacy in policy formation, and the role of civil society in good governance.

To date,APPRO has conducted policy analysis training courses for the Ministry of Economy, Ministry of Education, Ministry of Rural Rehabilitation and Development, Ministry of Counter-narcotics, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Interior, Ministry of Agriculture, Irrigation, and Livestock, and Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Afghanistan. From July 2016 APPRO will commence a certified policy analysis training course in Kabul for Afghan professionals selected from governmental entities and civil society. Successful participants will receive official university certificates and ECTS credits from Ghent University, Belgium.
Technical Capacity
APPRO is staffed byAfghan national and international personnel with many years of collective experience in various facets of development and scientific research including research and program design, planning, implementation, and monitoring and evaluation. APPRO has reciprocal arrangements with researchers in Europe and North America through its associations with British, Dutch, German, and Canadian universities and institutes. Additional affiliations are continually being sought with research and policy institutions in other countries, particularly in Central, South, and South East Asia. Please see Appendix 1 for a list of selected reports and papers.

Qualifications of Staff and Office Facilities: APPRO#s senior staff members have qualifications from internationally recognized academic institutions in Europe and North America. APPRO#s Directors are Ahmad Shaheer Anil (Executive Director) and Saeed Parto (Director of Research), supported by a team of 6 Research Project Managers, and 10 researchers. There is also a dedicated evaluations team of 4 researchers. APPRO maintains a pool of trained national and international research consultants for short-term evaluations and rapid-assessments.

Ability to Design Projects and Develop Proposals: APPRO as an organization and its key staff as previous members of other organizationshave designed and developed proposals for numerous projects and programs complete with methodology, personnel requirements, budget,timeline, and deliverables.

Expert Consultations: APPRO is frequently invited to participate in expert policy consultations and presentations organized by governmental authorities and international embassies in Kabul, Afghanistan, Europe Parliament and embassiesof European Union members in Brussels, and internationaldonors on key development policy issues such as civil service reform, gender mainstreaming, corruption, security sector reform, food security, rural and urban economic development, and sub-national governance.

International Work: APPRO actively pursues opportunities for research, evaluation, and training in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa, drawing on the cumulative and collective experience of its core team of researchers in conducting research, evaluations, andtraining in conflict environments.

Partnerships: APPRO and APPRO-Europe continuously seek partnerships with national and international entities and institutions. In Afghanistan APPRO has Memoranda of Understanding with a number of key ministries such as the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Education, Ministry of Agriculture, Irrigation and Livestock, Ministry of Labor, Social Affairs, Martyrs, and the Disabled, and Ministry of Public Health. Internationally, APPRO has partnerships with a number of academic institutions in Europesuch as RuhrUniversity of Bochum in Germany, Ghent University in Belgium, and University of Waterloo in Canada.</narrative>
