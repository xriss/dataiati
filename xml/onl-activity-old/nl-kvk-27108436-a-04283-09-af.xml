   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Bayan, meaning to #express oneself# in the official languages of Afghanistan, Dari and Pashtu, is a programme designed to link national influencing and awareness raising to the important issue areas of inclusive security and political participation of women. The two-year programme, implemented by three Dutch non-profit international development organisations (INGOs) and seven Afghan Women Organisations (WO) and Civil Society Organisations (CSOs), will leverage innovative public outreach and awareness platforms; policy influencing and advocacy at the central level in Kabul, across provincial governments and CSOs, and on an international level in The Hague, Brussels and at the United Nations Commission on the Status of Women in New York; and capacity building interventions with partners and programme target participants to promote women#s rights in accordance with the Dutch NAP 1325. This proposal builds on the success and lessons learned from the one-year Bayan pilot, #Bayan: Connecting Afghans for Women#s Rights#, which established a dedicated, indigenous social media platform # Bayan # and created the foundation for a cohesive partnership between the respective Dutch INGOs and Afghan WO and CSOs around the engagement and influencing power of educated Afghan youth.
However, where the Bayan pilot project was concentrated around an SMS and Facebook platform, the new programme consists of a broader, more structural approach that links policy influencing and awareness raising activities with the existing mechanisms, policies
4
and practices that have been put in place in Afghanistan to broaden the role of women in the security sector and in politics. As such, this programme will directly engage with the process of the Afghan National Action Plan 1325 and with relevant gender units, committees and other structures withinthe Afghan government that have been set up to promote women&#xB4;s rights.The programme&#xB4;s long term outcomes consist of 1) a contribution to an increasingly responsive security sector; 2) increased public awareness and community support on inclusive security, protection and political participation of women; and 3) a higher number of, higher qualified female politicians by the end of 2016. The aimis that this will indirectly contribute # next to efforts through other organisations and programmes # to a reduction of violence against women and effective political participation of women.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Institute for Women Peace &lt;(&gt;&amp;&lt;)&gt; Security # Afghanistan (registered with MoE)

WPSO  is a woman-led initiative conceptualized following the Peace Consultative Jirga in 2010 and established in 2011 to focus on increasing women#s inclusion and leadership in the effort to bring peace and security to Afghanistan. WPSO seeks to build on and strengthen the advocacy campaigns carried out by many other women#s organizations in Kabul to ensure a coordinated and collaborative effort. The unique aspiration of theInstitute is toengage Afghan women and advance their strategic participation to improve social cohesion, restore war-torn communities, and rebuildrelationships at the grassroots and national levels.

The rationale for the establishment of RIWPS is the-overall belief that Afghan women at the grassroots and community levels have important contributions to make to stability and peace, both in their traditional and emerging roles. Those contributions need to be documented and promoted for local and national peace &lt;(&gt;&amp;&lt;)&gt; security efforts to be sustainable. RIWPS will document those contributions of women leaders at the grassroots, empower them with community mobilization and advocacy efforts and connect them to find and negotiate their spaces at the local governance structures as well as national governance structures.

Vision: To advance a new paradigm for peace and security in Afghanistan that is inclusive of women#s perspectives.

Mission: To leverage the knowledge of women leaders in grassroots movements, strengthen capacities, and support research thatwill increase women#s security and the gender-responsiveness of peace building policies, programs and institutions.

Strategic Approach: Research &lt;(&gt;&amp;&lt;)&gt; evidence building on women#s contributions to peace &lt;(&gt;&amp;&lt;)&gt;security; Advocacy through knowledge sharing; Training &lt;(&gt;&amp;&lt;)&gt; empowerment; coordination with WPS stakeholders.
