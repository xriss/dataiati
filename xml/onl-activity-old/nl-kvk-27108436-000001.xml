  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">My Rights, My Voice (MRMV) is an innovative three-year global programme, engaging marginalized children and youth in their rights to health and education services in eight countries # Afghanistan, Georgia, Mali, Nepal, Niger, Pakistan, Tanzania and Vietnam. The belief behind the MRMV initiative is that children and youth have a right not only to access good quality and free health (including sexual and reproductive health) and education services, but also to voice their needs, hold their governments to account to deliver on these provisions effectively, and ultimately to be listened to as members of society and rights-holders: as #active citizens#.

Children and youth living in poverty # especially girls and young women # are among the most marginalized and voiceless within society. Almost half the world#s population are under the age of 25 and almost 85 per cent of those live in developing countries. Despite this, young people are rarely central to decision-making processes affecting their lives and do not always have the relevant information about their choices or rights. The MRMV country projects see children and youth as active agents of change, rather than passive recipients of aid, services, and decision-making. As such, MRMV is working through partner organisations and directly with marginalised children and youth, their allies and duty-bearers around the world to engage these groups in ways that strengthen and support young people#s voices and ability to claim their rights to health and education. Tackling gender inequality and promoting girls# rights is an intrinsic and non-negotiable part of this approach. To create change at scale, local activities in the country projects are linked to regional-level activities and from there to national- and global-level change processes.

MRMV has four key objectives:

# To increase children and youth&apos;s awareness of their rights to health and education services.
# To strengthen children and youth&apos;s and their allies&apos; skills and capacity to claim these rights.
# To facilitate opportunities for children and youth to engage with duty bearers (e.g. health and education ministries, teaching and medical professionals, religious leaders) which lead to specific actions delivering better access to and quality of health and education services.
# To strengthen Oxfam and our partners&apos; capacity to work on youth agency and support our global campaigning force to facilitate youth claiming and accessing better health and education.

The Pakistan and Mali country projects are fully implemented by Oxfam Novib while the Afghanistan country project is jointly implemented by Oxfam GB and Oxfam Novib. The other projects are implemented by Oxfam GB with the exception of Niger which is jointly implemented by Oxfam GB and Oxfam Quebec.</narrative>
