   <narrative xml:lang="EN">COMMUNITY EMPOWERMENT AND REHABILIT CERID</narrative>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Community Empowerment and Rehabilitation Initiative for Development (CERID) was established in 2016, under the NGO Act. The organisation was established as a response to community need to have their prioritized needs directly addressed especially the wide spread poverty among women and youth and concerns with health, environment and education. We are a demand driven organisation depending on what the communities we work in seek to have tackled in real time. We aim through our mission to promote and empower communities with Life Skills for self reliance and sustainable Development.

Since our establishment, we have been able to legalize our existence with the National NGO Board and authorities in Koboko District, officially inaugurated our board of Governors, recruited several key staff and volunteers as well as achieved partnerships with donors such as World Wide Fund for Nature, Uganda Country Office (WWF # COU) through Rural Initiative for Community Empowerment # West Nile (RICE-WN) for the renewableenergy project. However, most outstanding achievement to date has been our steady and first progress in institutionalizing key CERID functions with the aim of achieving international organisation operational and management standards especially in areas of program management. We have as such worked closely with a top organisation development and management consultant to ensure CERID arrives at the top of in terms of its organizational capacity and capabilities by the time it is 1 year old. Additionally, as an organisation that has special consideration for women empowerment, we have ensured that at each organisation function, a lady is part of the top leadership as head or assistant. We believe that women empowerment starts within CERID before we extend it to communities. We have ladies as our salaried employees or as volunteers.

Our activities include women and youth economic empowerment to ensure income generation through the creation of Voluntary Savings and Loan Association (VSLAs) managed by the women and youth. The initiative to setup CERID was thought best to have an avenue of redress of issues affecting community members especially poverty, bad hygiene practices, poor leadership skills, environmental degradation characterized by practices that lead to climate change.

2. ACHIEVEMENTS
What have been the principal results in the past three years that contribute to significant, structural, sustained and positive improvement in the lives of men, women, girls andboys suffering from poverty, injustice, insecurity and exclusion?
CERID has been in operation for a period less than 12 months. However, we have vigorously endeavoured to create various opportunities for the majority power in communities to escape the grip of poverty that has engulfed them. We understand poverty to have various ways in which it emerges, manifests and impacts on those it eventually renders most of the time helpless and less hopeful for a better standard of living, health, education and prosperity. We have since our inception worked with communities to tackle issues of climate change and economic empowerment through our project with RICE that provides women with access to use of renewable energies that contributes to safe guarding their environment as well as a source of income where they are able to trade in our renewable energy stoves. This income though small in amount when put together by various women in Voluntary Saving and Loan Associations has provided them loans to start up business that have opened up a path to lessen poverty in their lives and acquire improved standards of living, afforded better health services and an education for their children besides better nutrition and improved family wide wellbeing.

4. STRATEGIC POSITIONING
Analyse the environment in which the organisation works? Who are the other relevant social actors, including government and business, and what roles do they play? #In this context, what is unique about the position of the organisation?

CERID has positioned itself as an initiative that focuses on issues affecting communities with a strong element of ensuring that its activities are demand drivenrather than proposal that are generated outside community involvement and desire. This is our unique position and differentiating point, that ensures relevance, buy in and sustainability of our interventions. Our activities in effect reflect the actions that communities want to see being taken to transform their setting. We work with local government authorities for instance Koboko Municipal Council on issues of waste management and attract women, men and youth into actions that foster a harmonious working relationship and responsibility as well as accountability between all social actors in the community for the actions being taken.</narrative>
