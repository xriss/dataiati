  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project falls under the thematic area Conflict &lt;(&gt;&amp;&lt;)&gt; Fragility (C&lt;(&gt;&amp;&lt;)&gt;F). Through our work Oxfam Novib and SOMO aim to achieve a stronger voice for marginalized groups in policies that affect their lives; governments and international institutions support inclusion of women and promote protection of marginalized groups in security and peace building; and the private sector contributes to peace and development.

Within this Theory of Change, this project in Yemen has set the following long term objective: needs and voices of Yemeni women affected by conflict in Yemen are represented at sub-, national and international levels in conflict to ensure inclusive and gender-sensitive peace building through a strengthened and effective civil society and community based initiatives.

Oxfam Yemen together with AWAM Foundation for Development and Culture  and  Yemeni Leadership Development Foundation will ensure the voices of Yemeni women are heard in the peace and security processes and new alliances are built to sustain coordination and inclusive gender responsive policy development. They will do this through capacity support to civil society, engagement with governmental authorities and informal leaders and engagement with the international community.

About 30 local civil society organizations andtheir leaders will be supported to become change agents on national level and who will initiate women#s platforms in 3 districts (Sana#a, Taiz, and Aden) with the aim to influence peace and security processes  such as peace building policy development so that these reflect women&apos;s needs. The main strategies employed will be training, alliance building, international and national campaigning, and addressing interests of women affected by conflict at the grassroots and conveying this through national and international platforms. From this leadership position the organizations will also be able to offer advice to government, especially at the governoratelevel, on gender mainstreaming and gender sensitive conflict prevention and peace building.

In order to strengthen the alliance, the project partners will closely collaborate with Yemeni Women Pact for Peace and Security, Women Partners for Peace as well as International Support Group on Women#s Participation in theYemen Peace Processes (ISGWPY) and other actors such as UN Women Officer of Special Envoy, donors and governments to contribute to setting up common agendas and joining resources in advocating for women#s rights in peace and security.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Oxfam&#x92;s vision is a just world without poverty. We envision a world in which people can influence decisions which affect their lives, enjoy their rights, and assume their responsibilities as full citizens of a world in which all human beings are valued and treated equally.

Oxfam GB is a development, relief and campaigning organisation dedicated to finding lasting solutions to poverty and suffering around the world. Oxfam GB&apos;s principal objectives as stated in its statutes are &apos;to relieve poverty, distress and suffering in any part of the world&apos; and &apos;to educate the public concerning the nature, causes and effects of poverty&apos;. Oxfam GB, with a view to achieving greater impact on poverty and suffering, has joined seventeen other international affiliates around the world to form Oxfam International. Oxfam GB is a member of Oxfam International, a confederation of 17 affiliates from different countries registered in Europe, the Americas, and Asia.

Oxfam GB&apos;s purpose is articulated by its five Strategic Change Objectives. Oxfam believes everybody has the rights to: Sustainable Livelihood, Life and Security, Essential Services, Being Heard, Equity (gender equality).

Oxfam GB works in seventy countries across the world. Oxfam GB&apos;s global programme is delivered by six regional centres and by a seventh team responsible for an anti-poverty programme in the UK. Regional programmes, while contributing towards achieving Oxfam global objectives, are shaped by the particular nature of poverty in that region and by the strategic opportunities available for impacting upon sustainable poverty reduction.

Oxfam&apos;s continuous presence in Yemen for over three decades dates back to 1983 when we provided emergency humanitarian assistance to thousands of victims of the Dhamar governorate earthquake.
Since then Oxfam presence has grown, enabling us to repeatedly respond to humanitarian needs throughout the country while developing a solid reputation for delivering quality programming within often challenging environments.

Over the past 5 years, Oxfam has scaled up its humanitarian and development programmes, responding to the growing needs of an increasingly impoverished population. Oxfam&apos;s Yemen programme is one of the largestbeing implemented by Oxfam globally, and had a total budget of over &#xA3;11.5 million for FY 2015. This large investment in Yemen reflects the huge needs in-country, as well as Oxfam&apos;s commitment to responding to these needs.

Prior to the recent escalation of the crisis, our robust network of long established field offices located throughout the country as well as the dedication of our skilled and experienced staff have enabled Oxfam to consistently provide quality humanitarian and development programming across seven  governorates - Sa&apos;ada, Hadramout, Aden, Taiz, Hodeidah, Hajjah, and Abyan. Furthermore, through our field offices in each of these governorates, Oxfam has developed strong community based roots with target beneficiaries and a positive working relationship with key stakeholders and decision makers who are familiar with our work, reputation and the positive change we bring. Oxfam&apos;s humanitarian programme focuses on meeting the basic needs of the most vulnerable, which includes access to safe and clean water, support on hygiene and sanitation, screening and referrals for malnutrition, cash transfers and livelihoods support.

Since Operation Decisive Storm began on 26 March 2015, Oxfam has been able to respond to meet the urgent needs of the humanitarian crisis; initially through remote programming, and since June, direct implementation of a scaled up response including the opening of two new field offices in Khamir (Amran governorate) and Shafer (Hajjah governorate). Oxfam&#x92;s operational areas currently include Amran, Hajjah and Hodeidah, with support also being provided to the Aden local water corporation. A recent assessment has been concluded in Taiz, where we will start our response once the security situation allows, and a further assessment is planned for Aden in August to determine how we can expand our response. Our office in Sa&#x92;ada remains closed and access in the governorate has been classified by OCHA as the worst in the country. The situation will be reviewed around whether work can be re-started in the governorate, as well as conducting intention surveyswith beneficiaries to ensure that our response is aligned with their plans for return.

Oxfam has a full team of highly motivated staff already based in Hajjah and Amran, consisting of Public Health Engineers and Public Health Promoters as well as an a contingentof long serving programme support staff. Oxfam is one of the few agencies who have scaled up in this response and who has permanentinternational staff in country.</narrative>
