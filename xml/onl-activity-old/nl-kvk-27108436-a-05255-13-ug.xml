   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Women Nutrition &lt;(&gt;&amp;&lt;)&gt; Sanitation Project (WNSP) is women-led organization founded in 2010 as a community based initiative to workhand-in-hand with local communities towards improvement of their well-being through raising level of awareness as well as advance innovative grassroots initiatives to recognize, empower and support the vulnerable and marginalized groups (especially women and the girl child).

Women Nutrition and Sanitation Project (WNSP) was initially registered with Lira District Local Government in 2010 as an indigenous Community Based Organization (CBO) with registration number LDLG/2011/15. In July 2011, WNSP registered as a Non-Governmental Organization (NGO) with registration Number LDLG/2011/033.

WNSP works closely with women and girls, WNSP has designed a strategy that inclusively involves rural communities (women and girls as priority) to solve their problems, WNSP believes that the solutions mainly lie with the community members themselves. Once empowered and equipped with necessaryknowledge, the community can make significant positive strides.

Goal: To support the empowerment of 30 vulnerable and marginalized groups, especially women and girlsin three sub-counties of Lango sub-region through enhancement of their agricultural productivity, financial capabilities and firming of their self-esteem by the end of the project.

Outcome:
Thirty groups are socio-economically empowered, ate benefiting from local government interventions and act as promoters of women empowerment.

Objectives:
1: Foster women empowerment through systematic fiscal capacity building: Work with vulnerable groups to increase their food security, income generation and self-sustenance by strengthening their capacity on savings and finance management coupled with increased agricultural productivity through sustainable local agricultural practices.
2: Firming women self-esteem: Work with communities to countermand bad cultural practices that dis-empower women, and support women to overcome stigmatization and domestic violence. Provide guidance and counseling to stigmatized community members as a means to raise their self-esteem and foster hope for a brighter future.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Northern Uganda experienced a spate of insecurity for over 23 years ranging from cattle rustling, armed conflicts, civil strife, domestic violence and floods. The affected population were forced into protected Internally Displaced Peoples (IDP) camps andliving insqualid conditions. This in-and-out conflict situation in Northern Uganda predisposed the population to a high degree of poverty and vulnerability resulting from destruction of social fabric and morals, social services and economic viability. The atrocities reduced northern Uganda to a life of dependence. Diseases (HIV), death, rape, domestic violence and marginalization of women and girls, malnutrition, poor hygiene, hopelessness and lawlessness became commonplace.

Since 2008, most people are getting resettled in their traditional homes arising from improved security, however, due to the destroyed social fabric and morals, there is a challenge of rebuilding lives and wellbeing. Women and girls have become victims of marginalization due to moral decadence and abuse of culture, they have totally been locked out of decision making both at household and community level, for example, it is a common phenomenon that women work on farms and yet have no decision making powers when it comes to marketing and selling of the produce. Women barely participate in governance in communities. Women are further marginalized basing on natural occurrences such menstruation, bareness, loss of spouses, not marrying and acquisition of diseases such as HIV/AIDs among others. Some women have been excommunicated from theircommunities based on these. Globally, women represent about half of the global population, produce the majority of world#s food supply, and perform 60% to 80% of the agricultural work in emerging economies, yet women own or have significant influence over less than 20% land.

Women Nutrition &lt;(&gt;&amp;&lt;)&gt; Sanitation Project (WNSP) is women-led organization founded in 2010 as a community based initiative to work hand-in-hand with local communities towards improvement of their well-being through raising level of awareness as wellas advance innovative grassroots initiatives to recognize, empower and support the vulnerable and marginalized groups (especially women and the girl child).

2. ACHIEVEMENTS
What have been the principal results in the past three years that contribute to significant, structural, sustained and positive improvement in the lives of men, women, girls and boys suffering from poverty, injustice, insecurity and exclusion?

WNSP was founded in 2010, and during the first six years, WNSP#s focus was majorly on livelihoods support towomen and girls. In early 2017, WNSP conducted a study in Lango and the results were quite shocking. Provision of livelihoods support alone has little to do withempowerment, it is more like feeding someone and not offering them knowledge on how to plough and growfood. The study suggested that for sustainability, there needs to be work on advocacy and systemic changes especially at district and sub-county level,because these are the institutions that are closest and which the community members directly access and interactwith. In as much as it is paramount to engage national level institutions in advocacy, they barely interact with local communities,also there are lots of national level laws and that are barely implemented at local level.
WNSP has decided to focus most of her advocacy and systemic change initiative at sub-county and district level because Uganda#s constitution provides for decentralization which devolves administrative and legislative powers to district and sub-county administrations. This means these lower administrative units have a role to enact their own ordinances or revise national level legislation to suite their local context. It isthis nichethat WNSP wants to take advantage of and work with local communities to influence this local level administrative authorities to adopt and implement initiatives to empower women especially in decision making and governance.
Socio-economic empowerment coupled withenabling systems at local level is way to go if women are to be fully empowered socio-economically both at local and national level.
In as much as WNSP focused more on livelihoods and less on advocacy and systemic change, WNSP stillrecorded significant outcomes amongst the direct beneficiaries of the project. Below is a list of some outstanding outcomes registered;

# Since inception, WNSP has so far supported 20 women groups in Lira and Oyam on VSLA, all the groups (each group withan average of 30 members) are already sustainably saving and borrowing amongst themselves, fostering socio-economic empowerment. The 20 groups are saving an average of 4,000,000UGX (1,600USD) annually, the group members borrow from this pool of money forinvestment at a very low interest rate of not morethan 10%. This amount including that realized through the interest rates collected from the borrowed money is then distributed backto the group members as a saving at end of the year. This initiativesaves the group members from the high interest rates provided by financial institutions as well reduce risk on collateral attached to loans. Of the 20 women groups, 4 groups were of people livingwith HIV/AIDS. The members were supported to open up and appreciated the fact of positive-living while still being a productive member of society.
# WNSP has also supported 6 groups (2 in Oyam and 4 in Lira) with oxen and ox-plough to increase agricultural production and group income generation, the groups are now using the oxen to plough their gardens for improved agricultural output as wellhiring out the oxen to neighbouring communities to plough their gardens at a fee. The groups have registered significant income from renting out of the Oxen (the oxen are hired at least 10 times in a year and each time the oxen are hired an average of 80,000UGX (31USD) is earned). WNSP also encouraged group members to grow food security crops like cassava, maize and potatoes, the groups were also supported with soya beans for seed multiplication.
# As an initiative to reduce domestic violence and improve household hygiene, WNSP trained 15 women groups on Menstrual Hygiene Management (MHM and reusable pads), WASH, liquid and bar soap making. 2 Groups in Loro and 1 in Minakulu Sub-Counties, Oyam District have so far reached out to 2 nearby Primary schools to talk to young girls on Menstrual Hygiene and hand washing with soap campaign. MHM ensures the girl child is able to attend all school days without having toskip some days.Studies have linked MHM to domestic violence, women how are able to maintain excellent MHM are likely not to be victims of domestic violence. The women groups were also trained on how to make local reusable pads and are now selling cheaply fellow women and young girls and urging and campaigning for girls to remain in schools. Six tailors were trained to take up making of reusable sanitary pads as a business. Three groups in Loro sub-county were the best in the sub-county campaigns with exceptional hygiene standards. This led to the group members being identified by Samaritan#s Purse (another NGO operating in the area) as beneficiaries for bio-sand filters. With support from World Vision Oyam-Kole cluster in 2017, WNSP also trained and supported; 300 noneschool goinggirls, 150 women and 90 cultural, religious and local leaders on menstrual hygiene management, making of reusable sanitary pads andliquid soap making. WNSP also engaged the Oyam District leadership and Loro, Kamdini and Oyam Subcounty leadership in campaign, promotion and advocacy on MHM.
# Formed 10 young, older Adolescent groups, newly married, and newly parenting groups under the Gender Role Equality and Transformation (GREAT) project. The group members were supported to appreciate and respect the different gender roles in society, adolescent sexual reproductive health, gender based violence, early marriage and school dropout. They now are ambassadors and campaigners for gender based equality. This has led to reduced gender based violence in the project areas.
# With support from Gulu University, in 2018, WNSP trained a total of 4 farmer groups in refugee resettlement camps in West Nile Region of Uganda. The training focused on oyster mushroom cultivation and adoption of the practice for improvement of livelihoods through agribusiness. Each group comprised a total of 30pp each (18women and 12 men).

3. INSTITUTIONAL PURPOSE
The Vision: A healthy man in a healthy environment

Mission Statement: To support socio-economic empowerment of vulnerable and marginalized groups, especially women and girls in Lango sub-region.

Mission: To improve the well-being of local communities, through raising level of awareness, advancing innovative grassroots initiatives to recognize, empower and support the vulnerable and marginalized groups (especially women and the girl child).


Institutional objectives: What are the principal changes the organisation seeks to achieve over the long term?

WNSP adopted a strategy that inclusively involves rural communities (women and girls as priority) to innovatively design solutions to their problems. Once empowered and equipped with necessary knowledge, communities can make significant positive strides. Below are the four core areas/objectives WNSP focuses on to empower marginalized groups and eliminate vulnerability and exploitation;
1. Objective 1:Advocacy/working with relevant institutions on women and girls# inclusion: Work with communities to legally empower women and girls, remedy domestic violence and marginalization through sensitization on gender roles and responsibilities. Conduct advocacy at Sub-county and district levels to cause systemic change that ensures women and girls# inclusivity and empowerment. This includes raising level of awareness on relevant legislation and demanding that women become active leaders taking up key roles on leadership committees and are able to influence decision making both at local and community/Sub-county level.
2. Objective 2: Social Empowerment: Work withcommunities to countermand bad cultural practices that disempower women, tag women and girls to successful leaders for mentorship, and support women to improve household hygiene and sanitation (WASH) and menstrual hygiene management (MHM) which is closely linked to stigmatization and domestic violence.
3. Objective 3: Economic Empowerment: Work with vulnerable groups to increase their foodsecurity, income generation and self-sustenance by strengthening their capacity on savings and finance management coupled with increased agricultural productivity through sustainable local agricultural practices. Economic empowerment strengthens their capacity toengage with other groups on matters around governance and decision making.
4. Objective 4: Guidance and Counselling: Provide guidance and counselling to stigmatized community members as a means to raise their self-esteem and foster hope for a brighter future.

Field(s) of activity: What are the principal thematic and geographic areas in which the organisation works?  Who are the social actorsthat benefit from the work?
WNSP#s geographical scope of work is Lango Sub-region, Northern Uganda. Currently WNSP is working in a total of six sub-counties in the Districts of Lira and Oyam.
1. In Lira Dsitict,WNSPis working in Adyel Division and Lira Sub-counties/Division.
2. In Oyam District, WNSP is working in Oyam, Kamdini, Loro and Minakulu Sub-counties.

4. STRATEGIC POSITIONING
Analyse the environment in which the organisation works? Who are the other relevant social actors, including government and business, and what roles do they play? #In this context, what is unique about the position of the organisation?
WNSP#s focus is on advocacy and initiatives that foster systemic change at sub-county anddistrict levels because Uganda#s constitution provides for decentralization which devolves administrative and legislative powers to district and sub-county administrations. This means these lower administrative units have a role to enact their own ordinances or revise national level legislation to suite their local context.
Yet these localinstitutions are struggling to effectively ensure socio-economic transformation of the local communities. Women and girls continue to face marginalization and are rendered voiceless when it comes to decision making in society, they hardly take up leadership rolesexcept for the ceremonial #women representative# roles on local community committees. Also, some abusive cultural practices seek todemean women. They have been reduced to belong to gardens/farms/fields and the kitchen. In Lango, women till the land for householdfood and income yet are discriminated on during decision making. Reduced productivity by men forces women to take up the mantle if their children are to feed let alone going to school. This results in domestic violence and further marginalization of women and girls. As women fight to produce food and income for the family, men instead fight to retain dominance over decision making. This has led to escalation of domestic violence, divorce, stigmatization and further marginalization of women. The Uganda Demographic and Health Survey (UDHS) of 2011 shows that in Northern Uganda, 58% of women had experienced violence.
Lango sub-region has recorded rampantalcoholism amongst men making them less productive, Daily Monitor, a national newspaper has repeatedly reported (#Crackdown on alcohol in Lango# # July, 20th 2015. #Lango leaders to ban sachet waragi# # 24th November 2016. #Lira alcohol ordinance in offing# # 19th July 2017). It is evident that the local leadership and local government structures are indeed interested in working with local communities to ensure socio-economic development and empowerment but lack necessary strategies to do so.
It is this niche that WNSP wants to take advantage of and work with local communities to influence their local level administrative authorities to adopt and implement initiatives and local legislation that will empower women especially in decision making and governance.
Socio-economic empowerment coupled with enabling systems at local level is way to go if women are to be fully empowered and actively participate in decision making and governance both at local and national level.</narrative>
