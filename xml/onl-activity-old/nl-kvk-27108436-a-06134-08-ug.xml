  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">We will select 3 companies to enter into a dedicated scale-up trajectory; 1 company per country. The pilot will be running in Somalia, Egypt, and Uganda. The goal of the trajectory is to professionalize their (international) growth strategy and where possible to help find (international) partners, in supply, trade or investment.

Objectives
The primary objective of the competition is to accelerate societal (innovative) impact through SMEs and start-ups &lt;(&gt;&amp;&lt;)&gt; job opportunities for youth. The secondary objective of this pilot is to get the best examples of impact-driven SMEs in our countries and understand what it takes for them to scale-up, both their business and impact. This will allow us to improve our programme further by including working with superstar impact SMEs into our approach. Thirdly, we can use these #superstars# as best examples of the kind of companies we want to support, so to use it in our communication towards donors, investors, other Oxfam countries and other stakeholders.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">We founded Open Capital Advisors (OCA) in 2010 to unlock growth and investment in East and Southern Africa.  The creation of OCA was driven by a core gap our founders observed between businesses and investors in the region.  We saw many small growing businesses (SGBs) with massive potential and opportunity for scale, but who struggled to find financing to support their growth.  At the same time, we encountered investors who had available capital, but were unable to find sufficient businesses they deemed #investment ready#.  The investors required a higher level of formalization and strategic planning than the businesses they currently encountered in the market.
To bridge this gap OCA provides high-quality, intensive support to help our clients adapt to rapidly changing and growingmarkets, including co-designing strategies, implementing best practices, and raising external funds to drive growth and impact. We take significant risk alongside our SGB clients, typically deferring a portion of fees onto a successful capital raise. This approach allows us to work with businesses that would otherwise be unable to afford support. We have developed innovative programs with impact investors, USAID, and others to defray risk and work with even earlier-stage companies.
We target SGB clients looking to raise between $500K - $5M USD. These SGBs are trying to solve the toughest problems in their local markets, including agriculture, renewable energy, financial inclusion, and more. We select SGBs where our work will help them transform markets, create new jobs, and innovate products and services.
Today, Open Capital Advisors has offices incorporated in Kenya and Uganda with our team of 42 full-time professionals spread across Nairobi and Kampala.
Our approach to integrating gender has evolved and expanded in focus over the maturation of the firm.  We view our gender agenda as having two prongs: internal and external.
Internally, we focus on hiring, training and retaining highly talented employees, especially women.  As laid out in greater detail in our organogram below, over half of our entire team is female, and 50% of our senior management team (including 1 of two founding partners) is female.
In 2015 we hired a dedicated head of Human Resources who has studiedgender equity in the workplace.  She has helped us formalize our practices on gender equity, including updating our HR procedures and introducing a gender policy.
Externally, we work with and support promising entrepreneurs, many of whom are female.  Historically, 30% of the founders we have worked with have been women and we continue to focus on increasing this ratio.  Further, we work with many pro-women businesses, that include empowering women # in their workforce or throughtheir products / services# as a core component of their business model.</narrative>
