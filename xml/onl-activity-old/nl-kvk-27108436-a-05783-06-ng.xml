Kebetkache#s mission is to contribute to the achievement of good governance, and sustainable development through capacity building, advocacy for quality health, respect for women#s human rights, peace &lt;(&gt;&amp;&lt;)&gt; security, equal opportunities and environmental justice.

Kebetkache is committed to strengthening the efforts of community organizers, advocates and scholars who are working to improve the conditions of women; Providing information resources and collaborates on community based project aimed at developing women leadership;defending and promoting human rights and the advancement of democracy and social justice as well as quality service delivery as it relates to maternal health, community development activities,  peace &lt;(&gt;&amp;&lt;)&gt; security, environment, and HIV/AIDS.
Kebetkache Women Development &lt;(&gt;&amp;&lt;)&gt; Resource Centre is one  of the Oxfam local partners implementing the Financing for Development (F4D) under the Strategic Partnership Programme. The SP-F4D aims to change fiscal and financial systems to increase finance for development, and empower citizens to monitor how resources are spent.  Kebetkache aims to ensure the inclusion of community members, particularly women  in budget processes.  Kebetkache#s role in the SP-F4D in Nigeria is to build the capacity of community men and women on taxation, community needs assessment, influencing and participatory budgeting. Thus, the focus of the organization has been outcome area  four onIncreased Citizens# voices contributing to the long term impact of the project, which is more Nigerians particularly women are empowered to participate in decision making, contribute to Nation building as active citizens and benefit from better living standards through increased availability of essential services.
Over the past 3 years, Kebetkache#s activities of  research, community mapping,consultation with community gatekeepers, capacity building and networking in four states target to build a critical  mass of informed Nigerian citizens actively demand fair taxation practices and participatory  budgeting towards enhanced transparency and accountability.  The project has built the capacity of over 800 community women and men in Delta, Rivers, Enugu and Cross Rivers states.  Those trained have been formed into budget advocacy groups. About 21 budget advocacy groups were formed within the first phase of the project in Rivers, Bayelsa, Akwa Ibom, Delta, Enugu and Cross Rivers states. Some beneficiaries in Enugu have embarked on monitoringthe implementation of government budget in their localities, some beneficiaries have conducted step down training to other community members.  Some beneficiaries in Rivers state havemonitored implementation of  Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC) projects in their communities.  Trained community members linked to the tax Justice and governance platform in their states.  In Rivers state the Ministry of Women Affairs have committed to ensuring that  they will incorporate women/community needs into the budget, the director for women affairs  during advocacy meeting  and the training in Port Harcourt in 2017 and 2018 encouraged Kebetkache to ensure that community women submit reports of their needs assessment to the Ministry. The Ministry of Budget and Economic Planning in Rivers state has also committed to ensuring that community participates in budget processes in the state. In Enugu state, the Directorateof Visit Every Community (VEC) has committed to working with communities to ensure their needs are given priority during the budgetprocess. Project beneficiaries are therefore encouraged to take advantage of the opportunities offered by the project to influence relevant Ministries and department to ensure their voices are heard in promoting fair taxation and participatory budgeting.

The KEBETKACHE Women Development and Resource Centre is one of the partners that will continue with the implementation of the F4D SP in Nigeriain phase II, contributing to the Outcome on Increased Citizens Voice. The desired change is to achieve womens active role in governance and in holding government accountable in budgetary and fiscal issues and to ensure that their voices are heard in termsof decision making. To this end, community leadership has strong influence. Women need to influence the community leadership to gain support for women inclusiveness and participation in local governance.
Some activities have been planned to achieve these desired objectives mentioned above. KEBETKACHE will continue to work with existing community women groups in all the project states, as mapped in phase I. This will be done through scheduled visits to states and communities. Meetings will be held withidentified women leaders, and key informants in target states. Kebetkache will also access information on existing women groups from other CSO partners workingon the project in the various states. Kebetkache targets to map 100 community women groups acrossthe project states.  The exercise will identify the existence of the organization, registration status, leaders, mission, activities, impact over the years and capacity gaps/needs.
KEBETKACHE will continue to use extract from its Gender Context Analysisto engage stakeholders through town hall meetings and other media. The aim of the exercise is to provide context for the quantitative and qualitative content analyses of gender roles that are to be included and address by the project. This is necessary to support feminist claims, predict effects on target audiences, identify areas to effect changes in behavior, mindset, address stereotypes.
To empower communities, there is need for exchange visits to Link Communities with relevant Platforms. Community members will be linked up with existing relevant platforms for citizens participation and engagement with the government. Existing platforms will be identified during the mapping exercise and linkages will be created between the project beneficiaries and these platforms. These linkages will be created in the form of training, mobilization, exchange visits, peer review, cross movement dialogue as well as solidarity meetings, or collaboration with Kebetkache with other CSO partners during the course of the project. Some of these platforms are networks and coalitions that are focused on addressing transparency issues with budgetary and fiscal issues. Exchange visits and cross movement dialogue will be held for trained women and men to discuss, plan engagement, share knowledge, experience, information, strategies and ideas. Each engagement forum withplatforms will last for one day.
There will be Advocacy Initiatives to create necessary linkages. This will entail local actions and initiatives undertaken bytrained groups to promote transparency and hold government accountable on issues of budgeting, taxation and other fiscal issues. The project will provide support for the groups to mobilize and initiate their actions. There will be variedactions based ontheinterest and audience the groups seek to engage with. Examples of actions are interactive sessions with policy makers or local government officials; advocacy meetings with elected officials or any identified stakeholder; radio discussion; radiojingle; production of stickers; mass action or direct engagement; town hall meetings; public enlightenment; rally; monitoring of budget implementation. Groups will be encouraged to be pro-active.
