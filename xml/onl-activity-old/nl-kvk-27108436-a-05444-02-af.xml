   <narrative xml:lang="EN">WPS is one of the strategic themes of Oxfam intervention in Afghanistan. Currently, Oxfam is implementing 3 long term projects, under its Gender Justice pillar, that mainly focuses on WPS and NAP 1325 related topics, such as inclusive security and justice, inclusive peace, inclusive participation, protection and relief and recovery. Oxfam currently implementing these 3 major projects in Kabuland other projects around the topics of WPS and NAP 1325. This project should support, complement and improve theinterventions of these projects and at the same time contribute strategically to promotion of Oxfam#s influencing priorities. This project should start as soon as possible and should be ended by March 2018. Based on the following concept, an action plan and a budget should be developed:
1. To complement the works implemented under these projects and to strategically engage in active influencing, advocacy and communication, Oxfam aims to allocate extra budget in this regard. Through partnership with WPSO, and through collaboration with otherstakeholders and actors, aspire to contribute to the operationalization of NAP 1325, address some of the capacity and coordination gaps in implementation of WPS agenda, and actively engage in policy advocacy and influencing around WPS. Oxfam would like to produce2 policy papers one on inclusive peace and another on inclusive security this year, capitalizing on the previous works in this areas. The papers will outline the progress and provide specific recommendation and roadmap towards inclusive peace and inclusive security in Afghanistan. to extend the debate beyond the capital Kabul, Oxfam would like to conduct provincial debates, discussion and advocacy works in major provinces, in order to localize the WPS agendaand contribute to the culture of peace and equality. Conferences,events, press conferences and meetings with stakeholders, media, government bodies, and local communities will be considered under the project.

2. At the same time, Oxfam would like to improve its communication and visibility of its work within afghanistan and also within Oxfam federation. In particular, photography and communication trainings for Oxfam staff and partners, developing communication strategy, developing promotional materials, report and paper publications, improving digital and social media presence and engaging with grass root organizations through innovative cultural and social activities and interventions that promote Oxfam#s visions and missions and contribute positively towards change, especially gender and peace. The communication component and the advocacy/influencing component should complement and reinforce one another. We appreciate innovative and effective approaches, plans and interventions based on this concept.
WPSO In cooperation with OXFAM in order to advocate the implementation and operationalization of 1325 can carry out the following advocacy activities
1. Regular advocacy meetings: Conducting three regular advocacy meetings with Women#s Affair Commission of Parliament and MoFA and other stakeholders.

2. Using Social Media for digital advocacy: Social media helpsamplify advocacy efforts by potentially reaching more people, in more places, faster than ever before. To use social media effectively



3. Organizing three Roundtable discussions with different stakeholder to analyze and discuss specific critical issues toward operationalization of NAP 1325.

4.  Publishing and dissemination of print media such as posters, progress reports</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Institute for Women Peace &lt;(&gt;&amp;&lt;)&gt; Security # Afghanistan (registered with MoE)

WPSO  is a woman-led initiative conceptualized following the Peace Consultative Jirga in 2010 and established in 2011 to focus on increasing women#s inclusion and leadership in the effort to bring peace and security to Afghanistan. WPSO seeks to build on and strengthen the advocacy campaigns carried out by many other women#s organizations in Kabul to ensure a coordinated and collaborative effort. The unique aspiration of theInstitute is toengage Afghan women and advance their strategic participation to improve social cohesion, restore war-torn communities, and rebuildrelationships at the grassroots and national levels.

The rationale for the establishment of RIWPS is the-overall belief that Afghan women at the grassroots and community levels have important contributions to make to stability and peace, both in their traditional and emerging roles. Those contributions need to be documented and promoted for local and national peace &lt;(&gt;&amp;&lt;)&gt; security efforts to be sustainable. RIWPS will document those contributions of women leaders at the grassroots, empower them with community mobilization and advocacy efforts and connect them to find and negotiate their spaces at the local governance structures as well as national governance structures.

Vision: To advance a new paradigm for peace and security in Afghanistan that is inclusive of women#s perspectives.

Mission: To leverage the knowledge of women leaders in grassroots movements, strengthen capacities, and support research thatwill increase women#s security and the gender-responsiveness of peace building policies, programs and institutions.

Strategic Approach: Research &lt;(&gt;&amp;&lt;)&gt; evidence building on women#s contributions to peace &lt;(&gt;&amp;&lt;)&gt;security; Advocacy through knowledge sharing; Training &lt;(&gt;&amp;&lt;)&gt; empowerment; coordination with WPS stakeholders.
