   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Strategy and action plan will be designed using the existing project and will be consolidated during the project discussion with the community in Pursat Province. From field experience we were informed that farmers in the target areas are still effected by: labor shortages event we have the agriculture service team, because the number and size of those service team not yet cover to all target which project planned; limited  sources of capital still the challenges; insufficient water sources for rice production and other crop and poor medium and small irrigation systems; In addition farmers still lacked of capacity for :  small scale processing; limited access to capital/finance for agriculture inputs at acceptable interest (interest rates are too high). The proposed project will address the problems by enabling farmers to increase their food production and diversify incomes and use labor replacement for other income sources, use agricultural techniques which improve quality and reduce costs of production; also the vulnerable smallholder farmers possess secured finance against the shock.  Women#s# issues are a major problem which the project will take into account, such as women living in poverty, landless and domestic violence.  The project also provides farmers with an understanding of business concepts, and the agri-business market.

The proposed project will address these problems by enabling farmers to increase their food production and diversify incomes and use labor replacement for other income sources. The introduction of improved agricultural techniques will improve quality and reduce costs of production.  Vulnerable smallholder farmers will be able to secure finance during times of drought against the shock.  Women#s# issues are a major problem which the project will address, including women living in poverty.  The project also provides farmers with an understanding of business concepts and the agri&#xAC;business market.

The proposed project will compliment a previous project already implemented by continuing to work with 30 villages, 9 communes 3 districts in Pursat province. Within three years project the overall objective of this project plan: to empower smallholder farmers to improve livelihoods and self-reliance to meet climate and economic change in Pursat province.</narrative>

VISION
Farming communities and community development workers must have the capacity, rights and ownership in making decision on any issues that are relevant to sustain their living.

MISSION
Srer Khmer, in recognition of farmers&apos; rights and community development workers to learn, use and manage theirown community resources and participate in any decision related to their livelihood, is committed to providing farmers opportunities to gain knowledge and strengthen their capacity to lead and manage their lives through participatory learning approaches which build on understanding the fundamental relationship between agriculture, environment and rural societies.

The FAO project started in Cambodia in 1996 and ended in late 2001, therefore, to continue the activity of community based integrated pest management (IPM) Farmer Field Schools, a proven approach to successful ecological learning and farmer networking, Srer Khmer was the response to the need to further build on the work of FAO and facilitate the work of farmers-led activities.
