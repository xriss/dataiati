  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In Turkey, 28 renewable energy cooperatives have been established since 2013. Within these 28 cooperatives only one of them has concluded its investment and started to produce electricity out of solar energy. It is a big move but there is still long way to go. Inthese 28 cooperatives male partners are predominant.  At this point, it is very important to encourage women#s participation in renewable energy cooperatives and increase the impact of women#s in renewable energy transition in Turkey. This project developed jointly by Foundation for the Support of Women#s Work (KEDV) in Turkey aims to develop a community organizing model around renewable energy with the leadership of women to supply the community#s energy need and create income from the external power they produce. This contribution will be used for a feasibility study. The report will include selection of project locations for a project on women-led renewable energy investments.</narrative>
