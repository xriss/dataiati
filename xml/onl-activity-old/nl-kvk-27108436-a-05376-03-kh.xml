   <narrative xml:lang="EN">the project title called Saving Together to Advance Women&apos;s Economic Empowerment ( STAWEE) is going to implement in Pursat provincewhere is the fourth biggest province of Cambodia. It locates in the western part of the country and borders clockwise fromthe northwith Battambang, the Tonle Sap Lake, Kompong Chhnang, Kompong Speu, Koh Kong, and Thailand. It has 6 districts namely Bakan, Kandieng, Krakor, Phnum Kravanh, Veal Veaeng, and Pursat town. Pursat is a poor province among other provinces in Cambodia (reference: NCDD database) Pursat is listed as the fifth poorest province in Cambodia, at 34%, according to the ID Poor classification system developed by Ministry of Planning (Asian Development Bank 2014 p. 27). They still face common problems such asvarious diseases, water shortage, unsafe and unhealthy learning school, lack of technical support of animal raising and vegetable growing, gangster, domestic violence, gambling and lack of irrigation system.

Though with the presence with some credit providers mentioned above, the communitypeople still face a lack of capital (money) to start or to expand their business.  mainly provide credit but they also firstly, it is hard for them to access to loan from their banks and MFI due to their limited knowledge of the financial procedures and in most instances, they are required to put forward their collaterals such house, rice field land and other valuable assets. This is impossible for the poor. Loan with high interest rate is also a barrier preventingpeople from accessing capital for investment.

This Project is designed to tackle the issues above. In the long term running, the Project aims to empower vulnerable small-scale farmers, especially women in Bakan District of Pursat Province to participatein the economic opportunities for their better life. In the course of three-year exercise, the project will commit to deliver the specific expected outcomes as below:
# Women in the selected area increased income through agricultural and non-agricultural production;
# Women are empowered to actively exercise their rights in socio-economic development.

To meet the expectation, the project will mobilize farmers, especially women to access financial services andimprove their financial management throughforming 90 new Saving for Change groups as well as support 30 existing groups to learn and apply SfC Principles so that 70% of SfC household will have reserve fund to cope with shock with increasing their saving amount at20% annually. The project willalso build capacity building to 450 SfC members on how to operate their small business at the communes by apply Commune-Based-Enterprise Development model, which designed by ILO. As the result of C-BED intervention, it is expected 70% of the C-BED trainees will have enough knowledge to develop business plan and 300 SfC members will be able operate business activities and three video documentaries will be captured regarding to stories of women entrepreneurs.
To ensure that SfC members have skill set for livelihood activities, the project will provide vocational training on non-agriculture and agriculture to 600 SfC membersbased on the results of training need Assessment which is conducted within the target communes. The project will empower 300 women farmers and entrepreneurs to access to more market information by organizing 6 collector/ producer forums where they could discuss and share the information regarding price, demand and supplies in the markets. Moreover, project will train 70% of SfC groupleaders on women leadership so that they will be able to exercise their rights in socio-economic development, especially they will be able toparticipate and share their concerns in the public forums in their communities.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">FLD was established in on 28 August 2002, when SCALE Program of the International NGO created by Southeast Asia Outreach, was localized. SCALE was a fish-focused security project that began in 1991. FLO envisages communities where people Interact with integrity and empathy to improve and sustain their livelihood activities, and solve their own problems through justice and democracy. FLO aims,&quot;to enable poor rural households (farmers, women and children) to consistently secure their income and food supply&quot;. The FLO focuses on, food security initiatives, income generating activities, raising farmers&apos; voice to gain better support services for farming techniques and marketing of farm produce, and climate change adaptation to sustain livelihood activities.
FLO worked with 103 Village Saving and Loan Groups (VLSG) in 7 districts, 20 communes, 89 villages in Kompong Speu, Siem Reap, Oddar Meanchey, and Preah Vihear provinces. As of November 2014, there were 2928 members (2326 female) had kept savings with their group. The groups accumulated in that month at 58il714ooRiel (or US0145542) as group&apos;s fund to lend to members for income generating activities. The accumulated savings had been able to provide access to 1695 members who were in&apos; need for micro credit.The number of loan had thus revolved at 3740 times which was a really effective source for providing convenient access of loan to rural ultra-poor. Since the project in Oddar Meanchey was concluded in early 2015, FLO handed over the groups to be managed by themselves. FLO has kept working with those groups inKompong Speu, Siem Reap, and Preah Vihear in cooperating with another FLO Program, TUNKAKSEKOR, now MITKAKSEKOR.</narrative>
