   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Lao Community Participation and Communication Support Programme or in short, the Community Radio (CR) programme that UNDP initiated since 2006 is a significant achievement in terms of promoting the grass-roots engagement and participation through providing rural communities better access to relevant information and bottom up communication channels allowing their voices to be heard. It builds on the pilot experience from the Khoun Community Radio, community media practices (i.e. community radio and village broadcast systems in combination with new technologies) will be scaled-up to additional poor districts in the country.In 2009, the pilot programme was being reviewed with very positive outcomes.
CR is now implemented in 4 communities: Khoun, Thateng, Dakchueng and Nong Het. In Khoun and Thateng the programme is most advanced: the stations are fully functional and the foundations for community ownership have been laid. In Dakchueng the station has been built and they are already in the testing phaseto develop programmes in 3 languages and they are applying for the license and frequency. In Nong Het, the location for the station has been identified, the building is being designed and the equipment is purchased. Besides the geographical and infrastructure challenges, also the buy in of the local government is needed, also because they are formally the project implementers. UNDP is working closely with the authorities, at various levels, to increase their understanding and acceptation of the CR model:made by and for the community.

Khoung radio and Thatengradio serve both as resource centres to support the further development of the other two stations and to provide training in radio production and broadcasting. Furthermore, The UNDP is now in negotiation with the Ministry of Communication to attach youth centres to the radio station. A decision by the Ministry is expected later this year.
This programme seeks to achieve the following outcomes
&#x95; Increased mechanisms and opportunities to convey therights and interests of citizens, (young people and women in particular) to decision-makers through meaningful public participation.
&#x95; Increased and more equal public access to timely and relevant information,especially in rural and remote areas and among poor, vulnerable populations, particularly women, youth, and children;
&#x95;  Greater appreciation of the role and contribution of national civil society associations (CSAs) working alongside the government towards poverty reduction.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The United Nations Development Programme is the main body for coordinating the UN&#x92;s development work. Its global reach and management of more than US$ 4 billion (2005) annually makes it the largest provider of development grant assistance in the UN system. UNDP provides policy advice and helps build institutional and human capacity that generates equitable growth. UNDP helps developing countries attract and use aid effectively. It works with the public and private sector partners to make the best possible use of aid resources in confronting the challenges and opportunities offered by globalization. It is committed to promoting accountable governance at all levels of society and building coalitions for actions on issues critical to sustainable human development. An Executive Board,representing both developed and developing countries, governs UNDP.
As the leading advocate for the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), UNDP helps bring countries and the international community together to take these efforts forward. Working with existing national plans and poverty reduction strategies, UNDP assists countries with formulating practical MDG strategies.
UNDP prepares the annual Human Development Report that focuses the global debate on key development issues, providing new measurement tools, innovative analysis and often-controversial policy proposals. It is guided by the belief that development is ultimately a process of enlarging people&#x92;s choices, not just raising national incomes.
At the country level, UNDP provides support to publish National Human DevelopmentReports (NHDR).  More than 140 countries have now published NHDRs that have served to invigorate local policy debates.
In all activities, UNDP encourages the protection of human rights and the empowerment of women, and all activities are undertaken in close collaboration with the Government, sister UN agencies and other development stakeholders.
Lao PDR has been a member of the United Nationssince 1955 and UNDP has worked in Laos since 1957. The first National Socio-economic Development Plan (NSEDP) was launched in 1975 and currently Lao PDR is preparing its 7th NSEDP for 2011-2015. UNDP works together with the government of Lao PDR on the preparation of the 7th NSEDP in order to support the government&#x92;s efforts to reach MDGs by 2015 and to graduate from Least Developed Country status by 2020. UN in partnership with Lao PDR has published its first MDG report in 2004 followed by the second report in 2008.
Since 1983 the Lao PDR has been participating in the Round Table Process, with the support from the UNDP. The Round Table Process servesas the primary platform for in-depth dialogue between the Government of Lao PDR and Development Partners on key development issues.From 1983 until 1997, the process was focused on the tri-annual Round Table Meetings which were held in Geneva. In 1999, following a global review of the Round Table Meeting, the Government of Lao PDR, UNDP and the international organisations agreed to turn the RTM into a continuing dynamic process held in-country, rather than just a one-off meeting every three years. The Government of the Lao PDR has been taking the lead in managing the Round Table Process, through the roles and responsibilities outlined in the Prime Minister&apos;s Official Development Assistance Decree no. 75/PM.
An independent country-level evaluation conducted by the Evaluation Officeof UNDP in Lao PDR in 2007 found that UNDP has contributed significantly to policy development and dialogue, including incorporation of the MDGs and pro-poor concerns into national planning. Through the National Human Development Reports and other initiatives, UNDP has contributed to capacity development in the government to carry out high-level policy and strategic research on key issues, such as regional integration and human development. In the important field of governance, UNDP has gained the status of a trusted partner of the government. During the years UNDP has increased its support to democratic governance and participation. In the areas of environment and sustainable development, UNDP has supported the country&apos;s efforts to fulfil its obligations to the international environmental agreements it has ratified. Given the importance of natural resources to the Lao economy, UNDP has emphasised the need to incorporate related issues into policy dialogue in order to optimize the sustainable use of natural resources for the benefit of thecountry. UNDP has also succeeded in establishing more efficient planning for operations related to UXO, thus ensuring continued international support to the effort.</narrative>
