   <narrative xml:lang="EN">ADOL#s #Promoting Women Rights in Abim District, Karamoja Sub-region# project intends to address the bride price induced women#s rights abuse, bride price which are normally paid to seal a marriage and address the ignorance about their rights and survival strategies. Although women they contribute to over 95% of the labour force in garden work, they are discriminated against in the equal sharing of household resources like land, harvest and sharing of incomes generated from crop production and other domestic activities. And so, there is need to for women to undertake human rights awareness activities to address the inequalities.

The project will train 80 women as community trainers in Gender Based Violence for improved service delivery and; will empower 2 Human Rights Activists# groups with skills to convey human rights and peace building messages to the communities through music, dance and drama. Training 80women as trainers in the observance, protection and promotion of human rights and gender-based violence. The 80 trainers will then train the rest of the other 550 women at community/household level; Conducting Music, Dance and Drama (MDD) in Human Rights and Gender Based Violence: 2 MDD groups facilitated with costumes and instruments to compose music, dance and drama on service delivery gapsand women rights.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">ACTION 4 DEVELOPMENT OF LOCAL COMMU ADOL</narrative>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Communities# destabilization by the Karimojong armed warriors through cattle rustling and road thuggery prompted the formation of ADOL. These armed Karimojong raped and forcefully married women, defiled girls, looted property and killed with impunity. Asa result,women were left impoverished with no alternative means of livelihoods. Some elderly women committed suicide because they lacked resources for themselves and for raising up grandchildren/orphans. Others have continued to survive on food aid supplied by relief agencies. These abuse and violations have continued because women lack knowledge on their rights and skills to demand for redress from government.
Over time, ADOL started consulted women on their development challenges for possible interventions. Women often enumerated their problems and prioritized projects for their benefit. In order for them to own the process, ADOL involves women in the planning, implementation and monitoring of the projects. Women do select direct beneficiaries through a democratic process. ADOL#s mandateamong others is to empower women for self-reliance. They always constitute project management committee for reinforcing ADOL technical team in planning.

Women are fully represented in the Board of Directors.

3. INSTITUTIONAL PURPOSE
The Vision:
The vision of ADOL is, #all communities in Karamoja have skills, knowledge, resources and technologies to free themselves from poverty and sustainably improve their socio-economic status.
Mission Statement: #ADOL exists to efficiently and effectively provide, support, promote and implement integrated community development interventions that enhance the knowledge, skills and rights of the poor mainly in Karamoja to sustainably utilize the available resources and services.

Mission: What is the current purpose of the organisation?
To supplement government efforts in addressing the development challenges in Karamoja through research and projects implementation in the areas of Human Rights, Economic Empowerment, Good Governance, Education, Health and Agriculture.
Institutional objectives: What are the principal changes the organisation seeks to achieve over the long term?
Empower Communities on Constitutionalism &lt;(&gt;&amp;&lt;)&gt; Rule of Law: Limited provision of civic education in Karamoja has created wide knowledge gap on understanding the implication and the application of the Constitution for improved service delivery. The Karaimojong leaders do not understand utilization of the constitution to perform their roles. ADOL intends to empower them to use the constitution as a tool fordelivering services to their people as well as promoting good governance at community level.

Low levels of Women &lt;(&gt;&amp;&lt;)&gt; Youth Participation in Governance and Political Processes: In Abim, women and yiouth participation in governance and political processes stops at elections of leaders until after 5 years when they resurrect to elect again. Issues of monitoring performances of their leaders, participation in generating and prioritizing projects and demanding for accountability is lacking. This is because they are ignorant of their governance roles. ADOL plans to train them on their political and governance roles. They will be facilitated with the constitution, local government act, list of duty bearers, equal opportunity act and human rights &lt;(&gt;&amp;&lt;)&gt; governance training manual.

Marginalization of Women from Accessing Services: Women are still being discriminated from accessing services and equal share of resources as they are referred to as special groups. They are often ignored and denied the opportunity of participating in political and economic activities. ADOL will empower women on affirmative action and equal opportunity Act.

Constrained Access to Justice: The rights of women and youth have continuously been abused and violated due to their ignorance of the law. Most have suffered in policecells for weeks without bail even over simple civil cases. ADOL will train women representatives and youth leaders on all types of offenses including bail. They will also be trained on procedures of handling cases of human rights violations and abuses for redress.

Field(s) of activity: What are the principal thematic and geographic areas in which the organisation works?  Who are the social actors that benefit from the work?
Human Rights, Economic Empowerment, Good Governance and Capacity Building are the main thematic areas of ADOL being implemented in the geographic region of Karamoja sub-region of North-eastern Uganda.

People with disability, women, youth and the elderlyare the social actors who benefit from ADOL#s work:
People with Disabilities: They have been traumatized by misuse of illegal small arms in Karamoja. They were beaten, abandoned in homes/Manyattas during cattle rustling and denied rights toexplore their skills and abilities and also to enjoy their status. They were killed/injured in cross fire or burnt in houses. Thosewho survived were exposed to all forms of abuse, hunger and starvation. People with disabilities are now more vulnerable to povertyandforced into unethical labour for income.
Women: Marginalization and neglect of Karamoja has greatly impoverished women, renderedthem widows and sole bread earners supporting many orphans and extended families. They as well as girl children were exposedto sexual abuses (i.e. rape, defilement and indecent assault) and sexually transmitted infections (HIV/AIDS, syphilis, and gonorrhea among others). Women were burnt in huts and many died in crossfire between the cattle raiders.
Youth: Due to the armed cattle rustling, economic and development activities were greatly constrained making the youth unemployed, idle and frustrated. Most are now involved in petty crimes consuming alcohol and leading promiscuous lives. In the case of girls, they are exposed toearly pregnancies, early marriages and sexually transmitted infections (STI) with dire consequences to their generation.  ADOL targets both the youth at schooland out of school while the disarmed youth are supported with psychosocial activities and counseling.

Elders: The elders have beenthoroughly impoverished. They saw their long life savings: livestock, granaries, houses and other property vanish in thin air overnight. They lost sons and daughters through abductions and killings. Some have had toraise grandchildren without resources. Others were so traumatized that they committed suicide. The very weak and disabled were abandoned in the villages and starved to death.


4. STRATEGIC POSITIONING
Analyse the environment in which the organisation works? Who are the other relevant social actors, including government and business, and what roles do they play? #In this context, what is unique about the position of the organisation?

Karamoja sub-region where ADOL operates is the least developed in Uganda. All socio-economic development indices (education, health, infrastructure, energy, production, governance and decentralisation practices) are below national average. Critical analysis of the development gap pointed to two issues: the then insecurity in the region due to possession and misuse of the illegal guns (cattle rustling &lt;(&gt;&amp;&lt;)&gt; road ambushes), which scared away service providers from Karamoja; and the creation of Ministry of Karamoja Affairs, which made the sectoral ministries to relax from extending services to Karamoja on account that her responsible ministry would do so. Ministry of Karamoja Affairs was created to double efforts of the mainstream mandatory sectoral ministries in delivering services in Karamoja.

ADOL networks with other development partners like Abim District NGOs Network, MADEFO, ChildWay, Church of Uganda-North Karamoja Diocese, Farmers groups Peace and Human Rights Activist groups, Village Savings and Loan Association groups, Functional AdultLiteracy Classes, and other International NGOs.

What is unique with ADOL is that when Parliament of Uganda resolved  in 1997 that the Karimojong be disarmed because of the insecurity, destruction and destabilization caused by the gun to the Karimojong and its neighbors, ADOL conducted a research on how a peaceful, participatory, feasible and sustainable disarmament of the Karimojong. This was because the Karimojong had panicked and wanted to flee with their guns to Kenya and South Sudan. ADOL calmed them down to avoid loss of lives and property and to stop the Karimojong from escaping with the guns since they would still return with them and continueto cause insecurity. The project involved the army, police, churches, elders, women activists, people with disabilities, businesscommunity, kraal leaders to convince the Karimojong stay home and voluntarily hand over their guns.

After voluntary and forceful disarmament, ADOL integrated economic development to peace building in Karamoja for self-reliance. ADOL also introduced Functional AdultLiteracy for skills development.</narrative>
