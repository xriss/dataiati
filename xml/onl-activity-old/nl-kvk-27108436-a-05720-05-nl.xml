   <narrative xml:lang="EN">LIW / ICN would like to participate in the negotiations for the Agriculture and Horticulture covenant, based on the specific knowledge that we have around the seeds theme. In recent years we have regularly reported on child labor, violation of labor rights and non-payment of minimum wages in the seed sector in India. This concerns both cotton seeds and vegetable seeds, the latter having a direct link with agriculture and horticulture. Many Dutch seed companies are involved in this seed production. The Netherlands is one of the leaders worldwide when it comes to the production of vegetable seeds.

India is an important country when it comes to seed production. Following the recent report &apos;Remedies for Indian seed workers insight?&apos; we have been asked by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to provide input for the Agriculture and Horticulture covenant. We will gladly continue to do so in the coming months, together with the other parties, to see whether specific attention could be paid to the seed sector in the future covenant.

Our expertise is therefore mainly in the seed sector in India, where we have local contacts with NGOs and researchers. We have issued reports on thissector in the past and will also present new research in the coming year.

LIW /ICN has experience with covenants. We are a party to the Clothing and Textile Covenant and are involved in the negotiation of the natural stone covenant. We are an active NGO participant in both covenants.

Our expertise lies primarily in the social effects of production chains, particularly in India and other South Asian countries. Child labor, forced labor, caste discrimination, gender discrimination: these are themes that we as an organization deal with. In addition, we also have experience with thetheme of access to remedies. Under the Clothing and Textile Covenant there is currently a joint project in South India with a number of companies and a local organization &apos;#Remedies towards a Better Workplace #. We can also use this experience and share itwith the participants in the Agriculture and Horticulture Covenant. In addition,we do research, publish reports and work on influencing policy towards government and a social dialogue towards companies, togetherwith local organizations. Our local network is extensive: we have many contacts with local NGOs, trade unions and research organizations.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The National India Working Group (LIW) is a human rights organization that defends the interests of the lawless and marginalized groups in South Asia. The LIW does this through social and political advocacy and (policy) influence, research, information, publicityand publicity campaigns. She works closely with local organizations in India and organizations in the Netherlands, Europe and internationally.
The four core themes of the LIW are:

Child Labor and Education
Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) in sectors such asclothing, natural stone, seeds and tea
Dalits / Kastelozen
Human rights: Indian policy and practice
These themes have been at the heart of the LIW&apos;s work for 15 to 20 years. A small organization can only be effective if it makes a long-term commitment to one or more themes and as a result builds up a great deal of expertise, a good network and strong coalitions. In the past it was mainly national together with a few Indian organizations, now it is increasingly in European and international coalitions.
Over the years, moreand more cross-connections between our themes have emerged and therefore more opportunities for action and influence. Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR), for example, also plays a major role in banning childlabor and caste discrimination. In addition, we specifically look at child labor and access to education of Dalit children and use that knowledge in our CSR activities.

The geographical focus of the LIW is shifting from India to South Asia. The political-economic relations of India with countries in the region havebecome more important. In addition, our themes are not limited to India but also very relevant to other South Asian countries. Discrimination against Dalits occurs throughout South Asia andlabor rights violations in the clothing and textile industry are a regional issue.

The LIW cooperates with a wide range of organizations that are committed to global justice. Collaboration with local organizations is of great importance to gain insight into human rights and labor rights violations in India / South Asia and to take action together. Based on the expertise that has been accumulated over the past 40 years, the LIW from the Netherlands contributes to solutions for the problems identified by local NGOs.</narrative>
