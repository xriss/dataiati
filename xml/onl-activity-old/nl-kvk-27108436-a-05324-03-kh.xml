   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Lack of safe water and good sanitation is one of the biggest issues affecting the health of children and women across Cambodia, particularly those who live in the countryside. Too many women and children are still denied the most basic rights to safe water. The consequences for children are severe, as high occurrences of diarrhoea, skin diseases, respiratory illnesses such as pneumonia, intestinal and other waterborne and excreta-related diseases cast a shadow over children health and in many cases, and can resulting in death. High incidences of diarrhoea related diseases alone account for one fifth of the deaths of children age five and under in Cambodia, and an estimated 10,000 overall deaths annually, largely owing to lack of good sanitation and poor hygiene practices.
Cambodiahas one of the lowest rates of access to improved water and sanitation in the region; it is very unlikely that the Cambodian Government will reach their target of 100% coverage by 2025. Some 3.9 million of 6.3 million Cambodian cannot access to safe drinking water and live in rural areas. Without safe water and adequate sanitation and hygiene, children (41 per cent of the population) are especially vulnerable to water-borne diseases.
The safe drinking water situation in Pursat province not much difference from other countryside. In the dry season, most population in the total rural area lack of access to natural water resources especially accessing toclean drinking water because during the dry season the limited of water resource such as pond, well become contaminated and/or limited, forcing families to drink unsafe water. More than that, each family also face the challenges timing, having limited fuel to boil water and/or having a lack of funds to purchase clean water. The Sustainable Communities on Water Sanitation and Hygiene (SC-WASH)will collaborate with the existing agriculture cooperative (AC), saving for change (SfC) group, and/or women led agriculture service (WLAS). The project will seek to achieve two main objectives such as (1) provide access to clean, safe drinking water for people in the target areas at an affordable price all year around and (2) reduce in health issues and fatalities associated with water-borneillnesses within families in the community.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Background and Capability of Srer Khmer
Srer Khmer means Field of Cambodia, a local NGO dedicated to the support of sustainable socio-economic development through research, training, education and community development by promoting participatory learning, farmer-led activities, farmers networking, sustainable agriculture, and natural resources management.
VISION
Farming communities and community development workers must have the capacity, rights and ownership in making decision on any issues that are relevant to sustain their living.

MISSION
Srer Khmer, in recognition of farmers&apos; rights and community development workers to learn, use and manage theirown community resources and participate in any decision related to their livelihood, is committed to providing farmers opportunities to gain knowledge and strengthen their capacity to lead and manage their lives through participatory learning approaches which build on understanding the fundamental relationship between agriculture, environment and rural societies.

GOAL

To achieve this mission and goal, Srer Khmer works in close cooperation with relevantfarmers groups, government institutions and other NGOs based on the values of honesty, equity, positive encouragement, gender equity and responsibility. Specially, Srer Khmer works with Farmer Trainers as main partners in developing broad farmer-to-farmertraining activities in the areas of ecological agriculture and livelihood related issues. Farmer Trainers have played an important role in organizing farmer meetings and follow-up training activities. Key government district IPM trainers have been contacted to support these activities as a technical advisor to Farmer Trainers.

Establishment, Legal Status and Award
Srer Khmer was established and registered with the Ministry of Interior of the Royal Government of Cambodia and the local authorities on January 9, 2002 by a group of former staff of FAO Community IPM Program. The FAO project started in Cambodia in 1996 and ended in late 2001, therefore, to continue the activity of community based integrated pest management (IPM) Farmer Field Schools, a proven approach to successful ecological learning and farmer networking, Srer Khmer was the response to the need to further build on the work of FAO and facilitate the work of farmers-led activities.

Srer Khmer is certified by NGO Code Compliance Committeeof NGO Good Practice Project (NGO GPP) to award the NGO good practices project certificate. This award meant that NGO GPP recognizes and appreciates Srer Khmer&apos;s efforts in complying with all standards and being role model NGO in Cambodia. To learn moregoto www.ccc-cambodia.org.
