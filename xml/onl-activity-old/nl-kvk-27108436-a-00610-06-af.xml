  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Building Afghan Peace Locally programme is a multi- partner programme combining different approaches on the basis of ongoing programming funded by Oxfam Novib into one integrated programme implemented by six partner organisations; ADA, AWSDC, CHA, CoAR, CPAU/PTRO, and SMO. The programme has been developed in order to submit to a EC call which was granted. The total amount of the programme(&#x80; 958,539) will be covered by EC and the remaining by Oxfam Novib. Oxfam Novib will coordinate the project from the Country Officein Kabul.

Objective: to strengthen civil society capacities in  4 Afghan provinces in effectively resolving and mitigating conflict whilst enhancing the status and inclusion of women and opening a national debate on peace and conflict resolution.

Envisaged results are
1. In 8 districts across 4 provinces, local civil society and governance actors have established effective and socially inclusive peacebuilding structures. This service will be in reach for aprox. 835,000 people living in the districts.

2. In target districts, the role of women in local peace and conflict issues has been systematically addressed and gender equality has been improved

3  . Research and documentation of models has promoted best practice in linking state and non-state actors in peacebuilding, illustrating how women can play an active role in civil society and particularly in peacebuilding

4. Lobbying based on practical experience, research and popular mobilisation has helped bring about changes in policy and practice of the Afghan authorities:


Spin offs:
-       Currently the Afghan government&#x92;s main focus is on the reconciliation process with little recognition of the role local conflict play in the national conflict. This programme with its strong advocacy and campaigning component will be able to inform and disseminate divers programme experiences to both afghan government and public, which can lead to the Afghan government recognizing the need for local peace building and enforcing a national strategy.
-       The programme will strengthen local mechanisms for conflicttransformation ensuring inclusion of women (both as victims as actors) and minorities. These groups in the past have often been negatively affected by local level conflict resolution mechanisms. Especially girls and women are used to reconcile between households in conflict. Further, the recognition within communities as well as at government level the specific circumstances women were and are affected by conflict isan important milestone to further integrate women in conflict resolution and peace building efforts.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Co-ordination of Humanitarian Assistance (CHA) was founded in 1987 by a group of motivated Afghans involved in the provision of emergency relief to desperate populations in Western Afghanistan. The organisation quickly began to work on reconstruction andsustainable development. This took place in villages where hardly any developed had happened as a result of the war, and to support vulnerable groups in society, such as returning refugees.
In its twenty six years of existence CHA has implemented projects in all sectors ofrelevance to rural development: agriculture, cattle raising, basic healthcare, and water supply, rural infrastructure (irrigation, roads and public buildings). CHA has developed approaches for every segment of the population, includingwomen. Its most important tool is working with the village council Shura or Community Development council (CDC), which kicks off processes at the local level.

CHA has been involved in improvement of formal and informal education system extensively. Through it#s Galaxy training centers, CHA provided training to girls in languages, science, computer, internet and fine arts to provide growth and development opportunities for young children. It also provides training for young adults preparing them for jobmarkets. It was a partner in large education programs such as Education Quality Improvement Program EQUIP and The building education support system for teachers (BESST) to support teachers so that they are able to deliver quality education for children.

Oxfam Novib has been supporting projects since 1992. In 1998 it began to support a wider program of providing services at the regional level. Vocational and supplementary education courses have also been given in several towns. This was often to supplement the many rural programs. CHA has regularly become involved in distributing emergency relief aid. Within the organisation the importance of such relief aid is subservient to that of long-term development; it is provided to save lives.

After 2001,CHAhas grown into one of the largest and most important national NGOs in Afghanistan working in the fields of rural development, education, health and is an important implementing partners of the Ministry of Rehabilitation, Reconstruction and Development (MRRD) in its community led rural development National Solidarity Program (NSP) and in the Afghan National Development Strategy (ANDS). CHA has actively and independently engaged in and initiated innovative projects like awareness raising through the radio,targeting the marginal poor, including women, in a program focusing on the improvement of the value chain of trade in natural plants, working with Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR), the establishment of an Afghan Education Watch, and more recently it hasincorporated popular campaigning in its intervention strategies.

In 2011, Oxfam Novib launched a pilot project - an innovative distance learning model that improves quality and accessibility of education for students, especially girls, within the frameworkof the vision of the Ministry of Education. CHA was an implementing partner for Oxfam Novib. The pilot phase was completed in Feb 2013 and was able to develop a model that improved the performance of girls and boys in 21 schools in Parwan and reducedropout rate. It was also very successful in improving teachers# capacity to deliver quality education in schools.</narrative>
