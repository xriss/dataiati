   <narrative xml:lang="EN">GLOBAL FORUM FOR DEVELOPMENT GLOFORD UGANDA</narrative>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">GLOFORD Uganda was first conceived by a young professional who had experienced and seen the suffering of his people in Northern Uganda. Morris Chris Ongom had lived through the political volatility in the region and felt the need to contribute to the change and transformation that was needed in the attitudes and mindsets in the region to guarantee sustainable post war development of the region after the guns went silent from 2006. It was the year 2008 when Morris conceived this idea. In Mid-2009, Morris contacted his youthful professional friends who had just finished in different disciplines across the different public universities in Uganda. Eleven of them came together including his young wife and Morris convinced them that it was important not only to desire change but to use their expertize to contribute to the development of Northern Uganda staring from Lango sub region where they were born. In early 2010 on April 7th, GLOFORD Uganda was first registered as a Community Based Organization with Lira District Local Government in the name of Global Partnership For Holistic Development. In 2015, a decision was reached to register GLOFORD as a national Local Organization and as a result GLOFORD was successfully registered on 27th March 2015 with Uganda Registration Services Bureau as company limited by guarantee and finally as a local NGO as required by law. This time, GLOFORD#s name slightly changed because there were some name conflicts hence becoming Global Forum For Development effective 27th March 2015.

Of the 11 founding members, 6 were females and 5males. Currently, GLOFORD has 9 members of the Board of Directors with 5 females and 4 males.
GLOFORD#s programs target both women and men. However, GLOFORD seeks to understand inherent injustices meted against women in target communities and GLOFORD responds by designing interventions that directly target and empower women as agents of change. This is also done for women inclusive in school girls.

Since GLOFORD directly focus on youth empowerment, more attention is put on ensuring that young women are at the center of community development through all interventions while emphasizing inclusion of Youth with Disabilities and strengthening youth-adult partnership for sustainability.
b) ACHIEVEMENTS
What have been the principal results in the past three years that contribute to significant, structural, sustained and positive improvement in the lives of men, women, girls and boys suffering from poverty, injustice, insecurity and exclusion?

GLOFORD started effective community engagements from around 2013 when the organization started accessing small grants which enabled the institution to start building capabilities to design, implement, monitor and evaluate different programs as guided by the Core Strategic programme Areas (CoSPAs).

Currently, GLOFORD is making development work for the youth and themost vulnerable populations and groups in Lango Sub region, Northern Uganda. We are now in 4 districts, Oyam, Lira, Alebtong and Dokolo.

GLOFORD#s core work is based on empowering communities to shape the destiny of their society by investing in young people. GLOFORD#s unique youth interventions are a value addition to address youth issues in Uganda as GLOFORD empowers youth and communities toaddress root causes of poverty and social injustices in Lango sub region, Northern Uganda where poverty rate is reported to have increased to 84% according to Poverty Assessment report of the World Bank December 2016.

Specific highlights of achievements to date
________________________________________
Organizationally, in 2015, GLOFORD was registered as a local NGO with mandate to operate country wide for five years. By 2017, GLOFORD had expanded from one district in 2010 to four districts where different interventions were implemented.
From 2015 to December 2017, GLOFORD supported and strengthened the Operation and Maintenance of 500 rural water points serving at least 125,000 people in three district in Lango sub region in partnership with SNV Netherlands with funding from Austrian Development Agency. Seventy seven (M=67, F=10) VHTs and 194 (M=113, F=81) sub county political leaders were mentored on rural WASH governance management of the WASH system/facilities. And as a result the communities# attitude toward payment of water user feeimproved, functionality of the rural water sources increased as many broken water sources were repaired and downtime has reduced since routine checks (preventive maintenance) were being carried out by the Hand pumpmechanics. Furthermore, a total of 320 water sources registered and were remitting 80% to established 12 sub county water boards. 50 water points have been rolled out on monthly preventive maintenance. Twelve Sub County Water Supply and Sustainable boards were jointly established with the three district local governments as recommended by ministry of water and environment. The boards are mandated to work together with water user committees, water users and sub county local government to establish mechanismof ensuring regular flow of sub county rural water facilities.

In2017 GLOFORD also partnered with World Vision Uganda to run a short advocacy for improved WASH in 13 schools of Oyam district whichcontributed to improved access to good sanitation andhygiene practices for improved health of school going children. The short campaign iincreased equitable access to improved sanitation facilities in the 13 schools with focus on investing on inclusive sanitationand hygiene facilities for boys, girls and children with disabilities. The campaign also iincreased adoption of key hygiene behaviours at school level among children and teachers. This one month project specifically contributed to the following specific intermediary outcomes which the voice project will build on:
# Increase knowledge and use of basic sanitation facilities such as latrines, wash rooms, toilet paper among boys and girls.
# Increase practice of hand washing with soap including creation of School Health Clubs(SHCs) and training to make liquid soap.
# Increased knowledge among boys and girls in menstrual hygiene management, including skills in making sanitary pads and liquid soap.

# Increased participation and involvement of School Management Committees (SMCS) and Parents Teachers Association in protection,management and maintenance of school sanitation.
# Increased participation, support and planning for School WASH and education of thegirl child by elected leaders at sub county and district levels.
Overall, the advocacy targeted school going children,teachers, SubCounty and district elected and appointed leaders and community in the catchment of the targeted schools.
In 2017, GLOFORD partnered with Kagumu Development Organization and The Aids Support Organization (TASO) to provide clinical health services, out reaches, prevention and management services to the community of Barr and Lira sub counties, Lira district.

GLOFORD was empowered by Enventure through capacity building of its team to launch sustainable clean energy enterprise. In the market, GLOFORD is dealing in products like clean energycooking stoves, briquettes and solar latent which were identified through the market survey and analysis for the products. GLOFORD seeks to expand this initiative to support conservation of the environment in the region already highly depleted by the charcoal business.

GLOFORD implemented Youth in Governance and Leadership project funded by USAID GAPP  program from the year 2015 to March 2017. Through this project, GLOFORD established and made functional 6 youth parliaments of at least 150 youths who were mentored and worked with GLOFORD to advocate for and expanded Youth Friendly Health Services in 6 health centres in Lira district as well as amplified the voices and participation of youth in community development and political activism in the district. Overall, the project empowered at least 5,000 young people and 500 adults in the 6 different sub counties. Significantly, 15 youth from the 6 youth parliaments were among those who contested for elections at various local government levels and were elected to different offices. They are now serving and working with GLOFORD to champion young people issues among others.

Between 2013 and 2014, USAID Northern Uganda Health Integration Services funded GLOFORD and two other NGOs (Lira NGO Forum andWomen Peace Initiative) and implemented Community Health Advocacy project which mobilized, empowered and increased participation of communities in Lira district to access improved health services especially at Health Centre IIIs.
