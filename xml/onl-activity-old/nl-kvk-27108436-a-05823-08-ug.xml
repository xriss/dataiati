   <narrative xml:lang="EN">AHEDI- UG is an Organization formed by young university graduates in the field of law and social work in July 2008 to promote, defend and protect rights of every citizen regardless of tribe and nationality; #Justice for All#. The organization has mainstreamed itsactivities in the area of GBV/VAWG, PHA victims, Women and children in conflict with the law, Land rights, Legal and social consultancy for Local governments (on Policy and legal Issues) and other vulnerable persons, working towards improving the legal framework and awareness on human rights and fundamental freedom, land and property rights.
AHEDI-UG delivers holistic and citizen friendly programs with particular emphasis on GBV/VAWG,HIV/AIDs, emergency response to humanitarian issues, land rights/property ownership, psycho-social support, legal and social consultancy that leads to  sustainable development and livelihood.
AHEDI-UG works with a number of partners in the execution of its mission including political and technocrats at the districts of west Nile sub region and Uganda at large, members of parliament (MP), traditional leaders, central government representatives, other NGOs, CBOs and Faith base leaders among others.
The turning point in the development of this Organization came in 2010 when West Nile civil society organizations identified the Organization to Coordinate We Can Campaign Project Funded by Oxfam in West Nile, (thus bringing all West Nile GBV actors together both state and none state Actors) a program that ran for 6 years in which AHEDI-UG mobilized and brought together 169 state and non-state GBV actors and with them, recruited 16,000 charge makers across all the districts of West Nile Nile. Although the project ended, AHEDI- UG  has managed to sustain this members through various advocacy engagements resulting to enactments of 7 (seven) district level ordinances to address a base line campaign findings carried in 2013 under Oxfam funded We Can Campaign.
To date, AHEDI- UG has continued to build on this coalition to address GBV issues in the region and now, the Organization is, in Partnership with EU, implementing 923,730,000/ project to empower Women Market vendors in Arua District to end GBV, a project that arose out of We Can Campaign Base line survey supra.

The same partnership is with the districts of Maracha and Koboko on Education, Food security and Local Council Court Committee Development Training. This is an achievement for us in the area of Policy and legal support to Local Governments to address issues of GBV policy gaps.
AHEDI-UG continued to work with ELNHA members to address emergency refugee issues in the settlement, with a support from Oxfam through CEFORD and played amajor role in the period when host communities rose against the relief aid workers in Oriama, Imvepi and Rigbo sub counties. This was successful interventions that restore peace and harmony among the actors. This intervention achieved AHEDI-UG strategic objectiveforpeaceful resolution of conflicts as opposed to court litigation and war in the region of operation

While significant strives will have been made in observance of the rights of women and girls, and to bridge the gap in implementation of Domestic laws and policies in protecting, promoting and defending the rights of women and other vulnerable persons in the community, there will be an ongoing push for community inclusion and participation.
