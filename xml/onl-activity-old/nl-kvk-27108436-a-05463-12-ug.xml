   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Civil Society Budget Advocacy Group (CSBAG) is a Coalition of Civil Society Organisations formed in 2004. It was created out of a desire to collectively influence government and effectively participate in setting national budget priorities and it was formed by a group of NGOs led by 4 CSOs including Uganda Debt Network (UDN), Uganda National NGO Forum, and Forum for Women in Democracy (FOWODE) and Oxfam in Uganda. To date CSBAG has 75 members who operate in over 80 districts in Uganda including the 5 core districts of Abim, Agago, Sheema, Kibuku, and Kibaale.

In 2012, CSBAG members resolved to establish an independent Secretariat and this became fully operational in April 2013 hosted by FOWODE. To date the organisation has a staffing of 21 (9 women) staff both at national and local level.
1. ACHIEVEMENTS
What have been the principal results in the past three years that contribute to significant, structural, sustained and positive improvement in the lives of men, women, girls and boys suffering from poverty, injustice, insecurity and exclusion?
CSBAG has managed to have some impact through its work. The impact of CSBAG#s budget work over the past few years can be assessed in two main areas: (a) general awareness on budget issues, and (b) shifts in government policies and processes.

2.2 Building general awareness of budget issues
CSBAG#s success in building budget awareness is confirmed by the increasing interest that other organizations are taking in budget-related issues. In 2004, when CSBAG was formed, it had only four civil society organizations as members. However, by 2013, the group had more than 33 individuals and 21 organizations and by December 2015 CSBAG had a membership of 73organizations. The extensive media work and public dialoguesboth at local and national levels means that the potential audience forCSBAG ideas and proposals is larger and the level of citizen awareness of budget and public expenditure has increased substantially, which is proven by the interest of many people andCSOs to join the group.

#Demystifying# the complicated language linked to budgets and poor policy choices as ways of campaigning for just budgets meant that CSBAG messages were very accessible to people with limited knowledge of budget issues. Since 2010, CSBAG has produced an impressive stream of publications and materials, which range fromthe yearly budget analysis to contributions to the budget process, from technical, thematic briefs to newsletters and informative materials, including short documentaries.

While producing more straightforward budget analyses, which highlight the main budget policy issues in terms of revenues and expenditures, sectoral allocations, and so on, CSBAG is perhaps more known for its media work andits campaigns, whereit focuses, for example, on the budget implications of supplementary spending in terms of funds foregone for social sectors such as health. CSBAG being a network of individuals and organizations has probably allowed for faster and more effective dissemination of material and knowledge, as network members have easier access and more ownership of CSBAG#s analysis and budget proposals.

ON FINANCE FOR DEVELOPMENT PROJECT: CSBAG is leading the implementation of advocacy on public spending on essential services. Focus is also influencing budget planning, monitoring and advocacy.  CSBAG works closely with other national and subnational partners for increases spending on social sectors and essential services in the fight against economic and gender inequality.</narrative>
