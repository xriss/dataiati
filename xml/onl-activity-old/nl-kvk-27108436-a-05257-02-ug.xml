4. STRATEGIC POSITIONING
Analyse the environment in which the organisation works? Whoare the other relevant social actors, including government and business, and what roles do they play? #In this context, what is unique about the position of the organisation?

SORAK works within her mandate and legal framework established by governmentOf Uganda. Her programme areas work within theframe work of government of Uganda laws, policies and regulations.
Our programmes have been aligned to national and international development and legal frameworks for instance the National Development Programme (NDP11), the National Gender Policy, the Children statute, the disability Act, the UNCRP, CEDAW among others.
The key actors in SORAK day to day programming include;

The primary targeted beneficiaries including women, men, youth, girl#s children,PWDs and key population.
Others include; the government agencies and representatives like the national women council, the relevant ministries, and the subnational and local governments. These are represented by both the technical service implementers and policymakers.
SORAK also relates with private, business and CSO actors. Here SORAK is able to relate as both an active coalition member and a beneficiary of the services provided by private business actors.

Each of the above actors plays a uniqueand respectiverole. For instance the primary actors contribute and participate greatly in programme designing and implementation. They are active players in the entire programme cycles SORAK programmes.
Government agencies and representative play a conducive programme management setting role. They help is setting up a regulatory operational environment .They also provide the badly needed support supervision and monitoring and also participation in programme implementation which are crucial for sustainability of SORAKprogrammes.

On the other hand, whereas SORAK would be eager to play active role in rights promotion and protection, some limitations inhibit the successful conduct of our programmes.
For instance failed and poor accountable service delivery and failed democratic governance. This is further illustrated by the recent legislation of repressive laws on freedom to assembly and associate.
There are also laws and policies that hinder free exercise freedoms and rights like SRHRs. For example right to safe abortion, rights for one to choose a sexual and reproductive life to live among others.
The environment is further becoming restrictive to imposed taxation to social media like face book, WhatsApp, etc. This is seen as an intended ploy to failfreedom of communication.

The position of SORAK is unique in the way that she has been able to position herself to the extent of winning acceptance from both the primary, secondary and tertiary actors.</narrative>
