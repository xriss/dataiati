   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Gulu Women Economic Development and Globalisation (GWED-G) is a women rights organization founded in 2004 as a non-profit, non-partisan and non-governmental organization.  It implements long term sustainable development programs in line with women rightsempowerment and advocacy, peace building, health, activities, for youths and young people, economic and social empowerment, research and advocacy. GWED-G is a local organization in Uganda, with strong presence in Northern Uganda, covering four districts of Gulu, Amuru, Nwoya and Omoro with head office in Gulu.

GWED-G considers that exclusion of women from development process is systemic, both formallyand informally. According to records from 10 selected sub-counties in Gulu, Omoro and Nwoya districts,participation of women in development planning and other public spaces was estimated at 43% only. This means that the district development plans do not reflect and take care of women#s development priorities. This gap is exacerbated by quality and effectiveness of representation of women#s voices in councils at district and sub-county levels. According to  the  record  from  Gulu  and Amuru  district  Clerks to  Council,women  councillors# participation was rated at less than 33% for Gulu and 28% for Amuru districts respectively. This implies that women councillors have limited capacity to effectively engage issues of development, influence outcomes of debates to improve the social and economic circumstances of women and other vulnerable groups.

Overall, Objective of the project will enhance enjoyment of women#s rights in the targeted districts. This broad anticipated change will be triggered by expected immediate results including improved gender sensitive plans and budget allocations at the district and sub-county levels. This will influence decision of councils on special needs of women in local development discourse. More women joining leadership at grass root, District and National level, more women articulating women#s concerns on the floor ofcouncil and other public forums and women living a life free from gender-based violence. GWED-G will work with community structures including the Role Model Men, Rapid Action Team (RAT) and Human Rights volunteers, women groups to stimulate demands on women leadership at district and sub-county levels.
To contribute to enhanced enjoyment of women human rights in post conflict Acholi Region

Project Objectives:
1.  To increase women#s effective participation in political decision making processes.
2.Toincrease women#s leadership skills in community based organizations.
3. To strengthen GWED-G#s institutional capacity.</narrative>
