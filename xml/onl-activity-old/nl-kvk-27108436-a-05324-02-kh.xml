   <narrative xml:lang="EN">As to fulfill the gap of the target communities especially on Water Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) issues, we extend our specialty and experiences to set up another project called Sustainable Communities on Water Sanitation and Hygiene (SC-WASH). The aim of the project is to develop sustainable community safe and clean water enterprise in 10 villages of two communes, 2 districts (Treang and Koh Andeth), Takeo province, Cambodia.

The SC-WASH will collaborate with the existing agriculture cooperative (AC), saving for change(SfC), or women led agriculture service (WLAS) after its closely studying their needs and interests. The project will seek to achieve two main objectives such as (1) provide access to clean, safe drinking water for people in the target areas at an affordable price all year around and (2) reduce in health issues and fatalities associated with water-borne illnesses within families in the community.
In the first objective, Rachana will seek for two appropriated places to install two sustainable community safe and clean waterenterprises managed by its elected and well-trained committees. The project team will work in cooperation with private sectors and local authority to provide sufficient water supply facilities to community people inthe selected target areas. On the other hand, wewill provide capacity building to women water management committee technical skills, water quality control skills, and entrepreneurial skills so that they are able to manage water supply units effectively.

In the second objective, we will conduct awareness raising activities in order to enable community to get safe water for health improvement. The existing health centers# (HC) peer educators are built the capacity on WASH and let them share to the target communities as to reduce the rate of water-borne illnesses within families in the community. The project team also conducts the village-based events on advantages of drinking clean water by using microscope as our affective experiences so far, and as well conducting annual community events on advantages of drinking clean water.</narrative>
