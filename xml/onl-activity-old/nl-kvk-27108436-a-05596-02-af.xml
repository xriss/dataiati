   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Aiming to provide immediate income opportunity and rehabilitate the community infrastructures, the project will facilitate cash forwork (CFW) activities. The priority will be given for selecting of community infrastructures which can benefit the whole community members and alleviate the negative effect of potential drought. Potential infrastructure works may include irrigation canal construction or rehabilitation, karez cleaning, water saving technologies (rain water harvesting ponds).
The project will also provide emergency, unconditional cash for food of 18,000 AFN for 192 most vulnerable households who have no family member to work due disability and age issues.
Proposed response
Usually in case of drought (dry spell season), affected people, communities need of emergency, early recovery and longer-term support from Government and Aid agencies.  Oxfam is proposing to use 83,048 EUR from Oxfam Novib#s 2018-2019 discretionary funding to launch the emergency cash assistance in Daykundi. Oxfam#s local partner NGO, Afghan Development Association (ADA) has operational office in Daikundi. Supporting ADA for this emergency response is in line with the requirements of OxfamNovib#s discretionary funding utilization and contributes to Grand Bargain commitment in localization of the aid. Considering FSAC members joint assessment report recommendations and funding limitation, this project will cover Ashterlay district of Daykundi province. Oxfam and ADA will continue to explore additional external funding opportunities for drought response. The activities proposed in the framework of this project include the following:
1. Vulnerability assessment and beneficiary selection
a. Communities selection
In consultation with provincial and district authorities, cluster of Community Development Councils (CDCs), ADA will identify up to 10 communities which are most vulnerable to the upcoming drought. Key criteria for communities# selection include: lack or limited availability of income generation opportunities, higher number of population versus limited available natural resources (land, water, pasture), degradation of natural resources, predominantly agriculture areas, no other similar projects in the community to avoidoverlap. ADA will coordinate the target communities# selection with other International and local NGOs to avoid the overlap.
b. Household vulnerability assessment and beneficiary selection
Through consultation with selected communities CDCs, ADA will develop the preliminary list of vulnerable households. All CDC members will be explained by ADA about the vulnerability criteria (see below in the document) for beneficiary selection, project goals and planned activities. As a second step, ADA staff will conduct an independent assessment of households from the preliminary list. To avoid fraud cases in targeting of vulnerable households, ADA field team will be trained and guided by ADA Kabul office and Oxfam on beneficiary targeting principles, processes. ADA will use smart phones for data collection with Mobenzi software which will be funded by this project. ADA team will be trained by Oxfam on how to use the datacollection tool. In consultation with FSAC, Oxfam decided to use SFSA household vulnerability assessment questionnaire. See annex 2# Household assessment questionnaire.
Based on households# assessment database in Mobenzi, Oxfam and ADA will select the list of final beneficiaries using the selection criteria listed below in the document. Due to limited resources, the selection criteria will not be targeting people based on their status but based on their vulnerability which may include the following:
1. Female Headed Household;
2. Child Headed Household;
3. Disabled Headed Household;
4. Elderly Headed Household;
5. Households with children under 5 with Severe Acute Malnutrition (SAM) or Moderate Acute Malnutrition (MAM);
6. Vulnerable Households with more than 3 children under five years old and/or pregnant women and/or lactating women;
7. Very Large Family (7 members or more);
8. Very Poor Families # household monthly income of no more than 5000 AFN;
9. Families with Chronically-ill members or having other pressing vulnerability;
10. Families with only one male members;
11. The families having high score in reduced Coping Strategy Index (rCSI) and low food consumptionscore (FCS).
Aiming to reduce the risks of fraud in beneficiary targeting, ADA Monitoring and Evaluation team will conduct pre-distribution monitoring by calling at least 10% of selected households. Furthermore, ADA will conduct awareness raising among all targetcommunities, CDCs, beneficiaries about Oxfam#s beneficiary feedback and complaint mechanism. The project will aim to target as muchas possible vulnerable female headed households and promote women#s participation. To achieve this, ADA will implement the project in a gender and culturally sensitive manner. ADA will have at least 50% female staff among all project staff members and provide training to all project staff in community, beneficiary targeting process, accountability, transparency, humanitarian principles, beneficiary protection and effective communication techniques.

2. Emergency cash assistance
Aiming to provide immediate income opportunity and rehabilitate the community infrastructures, the project will facilitate cash for work (CFW) activities. The priority will be given for selecting of community infrastructures which can benefit the whole community members and alleviate the negative effect of potential drought. Potential infrastructure works may include irrigation canal construction or rehabilitation, karez cleaning, watersaving technologies (rain water harvesting ponds). To increase the communities and beneficiaries# ownership ADA will encourage target communities to contribute with tools for CFW activities and use limited project funds for cash assistance. Aiming to ensure the quality of the community infrastructure works, ADA will employ one qualified engineer, who will train and work with target communities in site selection, BoQ (bill of quantities) development, planning and implementation of the CFW technical works. Through this project, Oxfam and ADA will provide 86 vulnerable households with conditional cash assistance of 18,000 AFN for their 36 days of work (average 500 AFN/day including 350 AFN unskilled and 650 AFN skilled labor).  The project will also provide emergency, unconditional cash for food of 18,000 AFN for 192 most vulnerable households who have no family member to work due disability and age issues. This 6000 AFN is based on the standard FSAC package of one-month food basket calculated for a household of average 7 members, providing 2,100 Kcal/person/day. Hence, 18,000 AFN will cover 3 months food needs as per FSAC recommendations. ADA will use cash in envelope orlocal hawala for cash delivery mechanism considering the feasibility and risk assessment. Cash distributions will be made monthly. To avoid local market prices inflation, ADA will conduct weekly monitoring of prices for main food items in Nili, Ashterlay markets and will share the findings with Oxfam. Based on FSAC data, at this stage the assumption is that the local markets continue to function well with stable prices mainly due to supplies from major markets (Ghazni, Kabul and Kandahar markets).
Through this project, ADA will provide cash assistance to 278 households with 1,390 total individuals including 300 men, 370 women, 342 boys and 378 girls</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Afghan Development Association (ADA) was established in 1990 with the purpose of improving agricultural productivity in rural Afghanistan. Agricultural areas have suffered considerably as a result of almost 24 years of civil war in the country. Theirrigation system of canals and karezes (small water tunnels), on which large parts of agrarian land depend, were damaged or destroyed, or goneinto disuse after years of neglect. The consequences of the civil war include the displacement of large numbers of people and severe disruption of the economy and livelihoods of numerous poor families.
ADA has concentrated its efforts in the southern and western regions of the country. Given the relative security and stability in these areas during Taliban rule,thedisplaced and refugee population of the region has been gradually returning from surrounding areas and countries.
The drought prevailing for the last three years has, however, slowed down the repatriation process to some extent. The returning populationis in need of continued support to facilitate their re-integration.
ADA has developed a multi-sectoral, integrated rural development package that includes the rehabilitation of irrigation systems, horticulture development, agricultural inputs (such as fertilisers, improved seed varieties, tools), veterinary training, health education, vocational training, and environmental conservation.
Oxfam Novib has provided support to ADA for Integrated Rural Development Projects for several years entailing thefollowing aspects of development: encouraging and facilitating return of refugees; rehabilitating and developing rural infrastructure including farm activities; creating employment and livelihood opportunities; facilitating socio-economic reintegration; and ensuring the participation of local communities in the rural rehabilitation activities.
Major components covered with Oxfam Novib support have included: the rehabilitation of rural infrastructure; food security; water supply; and vocational training.
Theprojects have served tens of thousands of families. All these services were found useful in the direction of accomplishing broader objectives of alleviating poverty and fostering peace in Afghanistan.</narrative>
