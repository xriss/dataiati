   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Globally the project contributes to the Oxfam global Strategic Plan on Goal 6; &apos;&apos;Financing for Development and Essential Services (i.e Fiscal systems must translate to quality essential services) and to  Goal 4; on Fair Share of natural resources. Nationally theproject contributes to Goal 1 of Oxfam in Uganda&apos;s strategic plan-on Governance and Accountability.

The project will concentrate on forms of exclusionary governance in both countries wherein decision-making spaces remain composed of, and accountable to only a small group of political and economic elite. These governance structures are at work at both the national and subnational levels. Based on the Oxfam&apos;s Fiscal Accountability for Inequality Reduction (FAIR) program theory of change, Oxfam proposes to work in both countries to catalyze citizen demands for greater fiscal justice i.e Fair tax policy and increased public spending on social sectors such as health and education as a necessary precursor for reducing poverty and inequality. In ourview, working with citizens toward greater fiscal justice means challenging elite capture, exclusionary systems of governance and decision making and shifting power relations so that citizens regain a seat at the table to have a say over the economic andfiscal decisions that impact them most. We believe that this sort of power redistribution based in increased direct citizen participation and citizen driven demands for greater accountability will help reverse regressive, unjust policies and practices that intentionally concentrate wealth and power in the handsof the few at the expense of the majority#essentially all forms of economic and fiscal governance that operate only by and for the political and economic elite.

The premise behind this rationale is based on our belief in the power of active citizenship#the ability of citizens to process information about the use of public resources and use these disclosures to organize together to hold duty bearersto account. Fiscal justice is about people having space, voice and agency to exercise their rights in order to monitor and influence fiscal systems to ensure that these are fair, mobilize greater revenue, and increase and improve spending for quality publicservices for all. Government policies on taxation and public spending are important tools in the fight for tackling inequality. This project aims to focus on increasing capacity within civil society to strengthen the collective space, voice and agencyof citizens to regain access to and power over these tools as important instruments for fiscal justice.

Based on lessons learned within both the FAIR and Extractive Industries Global Programs (EIGP) Oxfam proposes to address some of the structural causes of poverty, inequality and fiscal injustice in Kenya and Uganda by challenging power relations, norms, knowledge and tools for exclusion at the nationaland sub-national level. The project is aimed at catalyzing active citizenship, particularly that of women, in public financial management and petroleum revenues at national and subnational levels by strengthening civil society actors to fulfill their roles as critical change agents in efforts for greater fiscal justice. The proposed project will be anchored on applied political economic analyses that ensures constant reflection on how change happens. In this regard, Oxfam will work with civil society groups and individuals that have influence but are currently missing from discussions on revenue management including faith groups, women#s groups, academia and media influencers</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Civil Society Budget Advocacy Group (CSBAG) is a Coalition of Civil Society Organisations formed in 2004. It was created out of a desire to collectively influence government and effectively participate in setting national budget priorities and it was formed by a group of NGOs led by 4 CSOs including Uganda Debt Network (UDN), Uganda National NGO Forum, and Forum for Women in Democracy (FOWODE) and Oxfam in Uganda. To date CSBAG has 75 members who operate in over 80 districts in Uganda including the 5 core districts of Abim, Agago, Sheema, Kibuku, and Kibaale.

In 2012, CSBAG members resolved to establish an independent Secretariat and this became fully operational in April 2013 hosted by FOWODE. To date the organisation has a staffing of 21 (9 women) staff both at national and local level.
1. ACHIEVEMENTS
What have been the principal results in the past three years that contribute to significant, structural, sustained and positive improvement in the lives of men, women, girls and boys suffering from poverty, injustice, insecurity and exclusion?
CSBAG has managed to have some impact through its work. The impact of CSBAG#s budget work over the past few years can be assessed in two main areas: (a) general awareness on budget issues, and (b) shifts in government policies and processes.

2.2 Building general awareness of budget issues
CSBAG#s success in building budget awareness is confirmed by the increasing interest that other organizations are taking in budget-related issues. In 2004, when CSBAG was formed, it had only four civil society organizations as members. However, by 2013, the group had more than 33 individuals and 21 organizations and by December 2015 CSBAG had a membership of 73organizations. The extensive media work and public dialoguesboth at local and national levels means that the potential audience forCSBAG ideas and proposals is larger and the level of citizen awareness of budget and public expenditure has increased substantially, which is proven by the interest of many people andCSOs to join the group.

#Demystifying# the complicated language linked to budgets and poor policy choices as ways of campaigning for just budgets meant that CSBAG messages were very accessible to people with limited knowledge of budget issues. Since 2010, CSBAG has produced an impressive stream of publications and materials, which range fromthe yearly budget analysis to contributions to the budget process, from technical, thematic briefs to newsletters and informative materials, including short documentaries.

While producing more straightforward budget analyses, which highlight the main budget policy issues in terms of revenues and expenditures, sectoral allocations, and so on, CSBAG is perhaps more known for its media work andits campaigns, whereit focuses, for example, on the budget implications of supplementary spending in terms of funds foregone for social sectors such as health. CSBAG being a network of individuals and organizations has probably allowed for faster and more effective dissemination of material and knowledge, as network members have easier access and more ownership of CSBAG#s analysis and budget proposals.

ON FINANCE FOR DEVELOPMENT PROJECT: CSBAG is leading the implementation of advocacy on public spending on essential services. Focus is also influencing budget planning, monitoring and advocacy.  CSBAG works closely with other national and subnational partners for increases spending on social sectors and essential services in the fight against economic and gender inequality.</narrative>
