   <narrative xml:lang="EN">EWB-USA will provide technical support for challenging locations in Imvepi, Rhino and Omugo in Arua and Kyaka II in Kyegegwa District that do not fit within the parameters of the standardized design and technical advisory as requested for engineering that lies outside of the parameters of the Ministry&apos;s current capacity. Optimization of existing systems installed in refugee affected areas will be facilitated through this program in collaboration with implementing agencies and coordinated with the UNHCR. New systems installed will be assisted through the provision of this set of standards and guidelines offering design and material recommendations to all the WASH sector stakeholders that will permit consistency and reliability in the water supply. Additionally, Oxfam and partners will work with the Ministry of Water and Environment and Engineers Without Borders (EWB-USA) on a review of existing solar powered water system designs with an eye both to optimizing the systems installed, and building a single cohesive set of standards and recommendations. Once design standards are in place, installation guidelines will be created, a section on design variables included, and an O&lt;(&gt;&amp;&lt;)&gt;M package in alignment with the MWE-led consultancy on O&lt;(&gt;&amp;&lt;)&gt;M results, disseminated tofacilitate the sustainability of the systems designed. Training will be conducted across the sector and on an ongoing basis through technical support from the MoWE and partner institutions. EWB-USA has been invited in the end of 2018 by UNHCR, OPM and Ministry of Water and Environment to conduct a thorough review of existing systems in refugee settlements with a focus on optimization and standardization amongst water scheme design and installation. Though currently based in Kampala, EWB-USA is establishing field offices in Arua to supervise its technical capacity building work in refugee hosting districts.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In April 2000, Dr. Bernard Amadei, professor of civil engineering at the University of Colorado Boulder, visited a community in SanPablo, Belize, to assess their water supply. He learned that the 950 Mayan Indians living in the heart of the Belize jungle lacked clean water and sanitation infrastructure, and that most of the community#s children did not attend school because their time was dedicated to collecting water from miles away.
While the community had the natural resources and motivation to build a reliable water supply system, they lacked the technical skills to design a lasting solution. Professor Amadei went home and consulted colleagues onpotential solutions, then returned to the community with a prototype and fourteen of his students to put the plan into action. The team installed a clean water system supplied and powered by a waterfall a quarter-mile from the community. This simple and low-cost solution was the first EWB-USA project!
Dr. Amadei continued to harness the power of professional and student engineers to complete similar low-tech, high-impact projects in other developing countries by officially founding Engineers Without Borders USA in 2002. Since then, EWB-USA has grown from a handful of passionate individuals to an organization of more than 14,100 passionate members working on hundreds of engineering projects across the globe.
2. ACHIEVEMENTS
What have been the principal results in the past three years that contribute to significant, structural, sustained and positive improvement in the lives of men, women, girls and boys suffering from poverty, injustice, insecurity and exclusion?
Well Repair in Arid Ethiopia
In 2016, Ethiopia#s Afar and Bale regions suffered a severe drought due to the effects of El Ni&#xF1;o. Hundreds of thousands of livestock died from lack of food and water, leaving communities food-insecure, malnourished and vulnerable. In collaboration with Project Concern International, ESC provided technical assistance to the Ethiopia Emergency Drought Response and Rehabilitation (ENDURE) project. Over the course of one month, volunteer engineers repaired 35 wells and restored water access to more than 100,000 people.
Water Access for Expectant Mothers in Rural Malawi
It is illegal to give birth at home in Malawi -- a law that was put in place in 2007 to lower the country&apos;s maternal mortality rate. In rural Malawi, mothers-to-be spend their final weeks of pregnancy at maternal waiting shelters near health clinics. These shelters are key elements of a safer environment for women to give birth, but often lack basic infrastructure. In summer 2017, ESC partnered with Freshwater Project International to improve the water systems at six health centers. Volunteer engineers designed and implementedsustainable solutions including solar-powered pumps and new taps, providing health workers and pregnant women with reliable, easy access to life-saving water.

Building Climate Resilience Through Innovative Technology
As climate change continues to stress water tables across the world, communities in India are digging deeper wells to access water. These deeper wells are often contaminated with toxic levels of minerals, including harmful levels of fluoride. ESC has partnered with the IKEA Foundation and the Clinton Health Access Initiative on a climate adaption project. Our engineers will identify the best technology to filter out harmful levels of fluoride and assist in the construction of water ATMs. This project provides the communities of Dhar, India, with fluoride-free water and entrepreneurs with a business model to generate income.
Highlights
Household Connections in Ghana
More than 10 million people in Ghana lack access to clean water. Safe Water Network requested the technical expertise of ESC to launch a water system with household connections in the Tongor and Ashanti regions. Household connections are critical; they improve water quality for families, increase the amount of safe water consumed, and strengthen the financial proposition of water supply by increasing revenue. This collaboration will also build local NGO capacity, equipping more organizations to implement household connections across tens of thousands ofhouseholds in Ghana.

3.    INSTITUTIONAL PURPOSE
Mission:

EWB-USA builds a better world through engineering projects that empowercommunities to meet their basic human needs and equip leaders to solve the world#s most pressing challenges.

Institutional objectives:

# Increase EWB-USA#s impact by increasing the number of communities served, domestically and internationally, while still ensuring quality outcomes.
# Establish lasting partnerships with the critical stakeholders in the communities where we work: community leaders, community-based organizations, local government organizationsand non-governmental organizations.
# Build collaborative relationships with the larger development and engineering communities: universities, industry professionals, corporations, donors, non-governmental organizations and governmental organizations

Field(s) of activity: What are the principal thematic and geographic areas in which the organisation works?  Who are the social actors that benefit from the work?
EWB-USA works in 47 countries around the world, with 3 established country offices in the core regions of central America and East Africa. We aim to strengthen our work in these core regions with a particular focus on East Africa over the next 3-5 years. Engineering solutions are relevant across most sectors however our work focuses on WASH, Energy, Environment, Structures and Agriculture.
Our work aims to reach communities identified as having the greatest need for development interventions defined by poverty indices and agreed upon by the development community at large. In Uganda we aim to reach People of Concern in refugee affected areas as well as in the under-developed area of Karamoja Region. As our work is heavily weighted towards capacity development our partners and actors who benefit from our work include the Ministry of Water and Environment and its relevant departments in regional and local governments, as well as the WASH sector at large through our training programs.

4. STRATEGIC POSITIONING
Analyse the environment in which the organisation works? Who are the other relevant social actors, including government and business, and what roles do they play? &apos;  In this context, what is unique about the position of the organisation?

EWB-USA in Uganda aims to provide technical support and institutional strengthening to the WASH sector through the Ministry of Water and Environment. EWB-USA only works where capacity gaps are identified, offering technical expertise and knowledge transfer.

5. FUNCTIONAL ORGANISATIONAL CHART (include below your organisational chart)
How are authority and responsibilities structured ? For each operational unit, indicate the job titles, number of people in each position, and if they are men or women.
EWB-USA is led by a staff of 28 women and 12 men under the leadership of Cathy Leslie.</narrative>
