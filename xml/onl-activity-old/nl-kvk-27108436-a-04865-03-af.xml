Oxfam Novib and SOMO aim to achieve that more marginalized groups have a say in policies that affect their lives; governments and international institutions support inclusion of women and promote protection of marginalized groups in security and peace building; and the private sector contributes to peace and development.
Within this Theory of Change, this project in Afghanistan has set the following objective: Voices and needs of Afghan women affected by conflict are represented at sub- national and international levels to enhance protection of women in public spaces, prevent gender-based violence, and gender-sensitive undertaking of relief and recovery measures aimed at the most vulnerable women and girls.
The proposed project will aim to meet the following objectives to achieve the longterm outcomes;
1. To build the capacity of civil society organizations (CSOs) at the local (district) level through tailor-made training and mentoring on the policy process on NAP 1325#s Pillar 2 (Protection) &lt;(&gt;&amp;&lt;)&gt; Pillar 4 (Relief and Recovery).
2. To build the capacity of civil society organizations at the local and national levels on evidence-based advocacy.
3. To raise the awareness of non-state actors, particularly traditional community and religious leaders, at the local (district) level on NAP 1325 so to enable them to hold the government accountable on its commitments under NAP 1325.
4. To build the capacity of state actors on the policy process on NAP 1325 with a specific focus on Pillar 2 (Protection) and Pillar 4 (Relief and Recovery).
5. To develop an evidence-based mechanism for monitoring progress toward NAP objectives, with a focus on Pillar 2 and 4.
6. To strengthen state-CSO dialogue and cooperation on gender equality and women#s rights using NAP 1325 as the policy instrument, and building on structures and impacts resulting from Oxfam Novib#s Citizens First, Bayan, and RiC projects.

PTRO works closely with Oxfam Novib and APPRO to implement the activities for National Action Plan (NAP) 1325 and have the responsibility for baseline and regular annual monitoring National Action plan 1325, capacity building of provincial Advocacy committees (PACs) by delivering Trainings in Ningarhar, Hirat and Takhar and coordinating with APPRO  to build the strong linkages between PACS and  national level Advocacy committees (NAC) to carry over the advocacy and outreach interventions from provincial to national level. In addition to that outreach and advocacy at the provincial and will be based on the findings of the regular monitoring of NAP 1325 and will be carried out by the PAC and with the support from PTRO.

PTRO will work closely with Oxfam Afghanistan and APPRO to implement the activities of #Citizens for 1325#, reporting to Oxfam Afghanistan about these activities. PTRO and APPRO will carry out monitoring as an ongoing basis through sub office with quarterly report cards produced for each of the target provinces. There will be two report cards per year to report on measurable progress made toward meeting NAP 1325 Pillar 4 (Relief and Recovery) objectives.There will be one annual report at the end of each year synthesizing the findings from the bi-annual reports.
1. By 2018, 30 AfghanCSOs (including Women#s Organizations) have increased thematic and operational capacity and formed a stronger alliance to engage inadvocacy trajectories, and hold the Afghan government accountable on its commitments to Pillar 2 (protection) and Pillar 4 (relief and recovery) as stated in the NAP 1325 adopted in June 2015.
2. By 2018, the CSOs and WOs involved in this program have become structurally involved in the monitoring and proper implementation of Pillar 2 and 4 of the NAP 1325, based on the voices of women in thetarget areas through a new monitoring and advocacy mechanism, which fosters both critical and constructive engagement with the relevant authorities at the Provincial level

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Peace Training &lt;(&gt;&amp;&lt;)&gt; Research Organisation (PTRO) Established in 2010 is a non-profit, non-political research and training organization based in Kabul and operational throughout Afghanistan.
PTRO&apos;s vision is an Afghanistan which is at peace and stable at both national and sub-national levels, where the people have access to good governance and the rule of law.

PTRO s work focuses on four main areas;
1) Conflict resolution and peace building,
2) Linking informal and formal justice mechanisms,
3) Research toinform policyand programming, and
4) Promote participation in governance.

Through community based peace building programmes and the promotion of good governance PTRO aims to transform conflict that is contributing to local insecurity. We aim to build local capabilities in conflict resolution by providing training to established conflict resolution mechanisms such as shuras, jirgas, religious actors and informal court systems.
By linking formal and informal justice mechanisms PTRO aims to promote the rule of law in Afghanistan. By working to promote unity between government and non-government actors we aim to support a more collaborative environment between the sub-national government and the local population.

In research PTRO&apos;s mission is toinform policy and programme debates using analysis from accurate, detailed field studies in areas which are often insecure and where the flow of information and understanding of the local environment is poor. This in-depth, contextually sensitive researchand analysis will help inform policy and programming in Afghanistan resulting in more meaningful, sustainable and long-lasting results from interventions across the country.</narrative>
