A. Inequality Campaign #
# Oxfam in Asia region has initiated #Even it up# campaign to address rising inequality in region among countries and within countries of Asia.  Oxfam country programmes in the region are working through their programmatic interventions to address multiple inequalities. Meantime Oxfam wants to engage in long term public campaign and advocacy for bringing structural changes to address inequalities. Regional Platfrom-Asia team jointly in collaboration with partners, country programmes, affiliates co-created a regional campaign strategy focussing on following four objectives:
a)Build strong Asia narrative on rising inequalities, its drivers and solutions to shape the future discourse in the region
b) Promote fiscal justice by pushing for progressive tax policies, prevent tax avoidance by corporation and rich individuals, and ensuring that tax revenues are used to expand essential public services
c) Governments and corporations in Asia introduce policy and practices reforms for fair/living wages and working conditions including reducing gender wage gap and employment
d) Facilitate in strengthening citizens# alliances and platform, especially women, urban middle class to challenge multiple inequalities and rising rich-poor gap

# Support the publication and dissemination of an Asia Inequality book focused on inequality solutions that have succeeded in Asia.  Oxfam in Asia objectives are to build a strong narrative on rising inequality, its drivers and solutions to shape policies in theregion.  A key strategy is to get mainstream academics to talk about inequality and their solutions. The book is written by our academic#s consortium coming from six countries in the region (Thailand, South Korea, Pakistan, Philippines, India, China) and the ADB. The book will be launched this Nov 29-Oct 1 in partnership with the Chulalungkorn University of Thailand.  The discussion will focus on how Asia can meet the SDG 10 goals, by building on the policy solutions discussed in the book. We are targeting about 100 people for the conference, with academics, govt officials and CSO reps.
# Support advocacy engagement of partners to the ASEAN.  Building on the successful engagement with WEF ASEAN last year, we plan to again engage in this year#s ASEAN events that focus on the role of business in addressing inequality in the region.  Our Future of Business paper got major traction last year, and spurred interestfrom the Government of Vietnamaswell as ASEAN on how what businesses can do to change the way they operate and contribute to betterlives for workers as well as addressing climate change.
# SAPPE:
Inequality Campaign has an ambitious objective. Therefore, Oxfam would like to collaborate and build alliances with likeminded organizations working on similar issues and having strong presence in many of the countries where Oxfam is working or not working. In the year 2018-19, Oxfam regional platform entered into partnership with South AsiaAlliance for Poverty Eradication (SAAPE) to implement a project titled influencing SAARC countries to address inequalities. This collaboration will continue in the current year.

B.  ADB Engagement
# Support our ADB advocacy engagement.  The Asia Development Bank (ADB) is a key target for the region as its finance continues to exert a strong influence on the development policies of country governments.  Oxfam in Asia#s ADB Strategy has four key objectives advocating for ADB#s policies and investmentsonsafeguarding mechanisms that ensure communities access to productive resources (land and water), preventing climate change and empowering women.  This will support partners to participate and engage in the ADB#s Annual General Meeting (AGM).</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Oxfam International was formed in 1995 by a group of independent non-governmental organizations. Their aim was to work together forgreater impact on the international stage to reduce poverty and injustice.
The name &quot;Oxfam&quot; comes from the Oxford Committee for Famine Relief, founded in Britain in 1942. The group campaigned for food supplies to be sent through an allied naval blockade to starving women and children in enemy-occupied Greece during the Second World War.
As well as becoming a world leader in the delivery of emergency relief, Oxfam International implements long-term development programs in vulnerable communities. We are also part of a global movement, campaigning with others, for instance, to end unfair trade rules, demand better health and education services for all, and to combat climate change.
Today, there are 19 member organizations of the Oxfam International confederation. They are based in: Australia, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Great Britain, Hong Kong, Ireland, India, Italy, Japan, Mexico, The Netherlands, New Zealand, Quebec, South Africa, Spain and the United States.
The Oxfam International Secretariat is based in Oxford, UK. The Secretariat runs advocacy offices in Addis Ababa, Brussels, Geneva, New York and Washington DC.</narrative>
