  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Community organization for Rural Enterprise Activity Management (CREAM) is a local professional, not-for-profit, non-denominationalNGO operating in all the 9 Districts of West Nile region with its Head Office in Arua.
It is a member- based organizationdully registered with the National NGO Board (Reg: No.8666). It was formed in July 2000 by Community Business Advisors (CBAs) who worked with Joint Encouragement of New gainful Activity (JENGA), a project of CARE International in Uganda. The formation wasmotivated by numerous reasons. First, the West Nile region is the poorest in Uganda with over 6 in ten people living below US$ 1 a day. Second, many development interventions excluded the poorest people in the communities and the business advisors felt they could continue providing Business Development Services (BDS) in all the Districts in the Region. In the face of difficulty in accessing financial services for poor people, this organization provided hope and sustainable solutions to local people#s problems.
The organisation believes in the fact that the poor have the strength and will to get out of poverty and indeed this region can, and should, develop at a faster pace; and that any meaningful development is endogenous and is an integral function ofboth improved well-being and people#s economic empowerment.

 Since its formation in July,2000 with support of CARE International in Uganda, the organization registered a number ofsuccesses and transformed the lives of many poor people especially therural and peri-urban poor women and girls through partnering and implementing livelihood projects with a number of Partners and donors as indicated below;
