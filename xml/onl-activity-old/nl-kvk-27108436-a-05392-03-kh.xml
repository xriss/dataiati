   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project also worked to increase positive changes of gender perception in the families and communities. As project report in February, 2016, 201 women became community leaders, women and men joined decision making in the communities increased from 56%to 64.86%, men reported to stop their wives from participating in public activities decreased from 31% to 27.03%, and women felt afraid of her husband decreased from 74% to 59.46%. The project is working with 57 couple of Gender Road Map families.

In this proposed action,the project will use the saving for change (SfC) and agriculture cooperative (AC) as platform to revolve their existed saving fund sources as inputs to start up their integrated farming system (IFS) in the families. The project also supports some starting up inputs to the poor families as its criteria selection. As to assure sustainable, the committees of SfCs and Agriculture Cooperatives will play important role to link the products produced by farmers to access to the market and aswell value chain. Cambodia Community Innovation Center (CCIC), Facebook, page, and youtube are also the tools used by them to market their products and do research.

Assure food security and increase incomes of the poor and poorest farmers especially women in the communities, the project forms them into groups of Women Led Agriculture Service (WLAS). They are well-trained on skill to apply the system of rice intensification (SRI), and vegetable/cash crop growing activities in order to sell services to other farmers to earn incomes. These activities also help topromote sustainable SRI and vegetable/cash crop application in time that is lacking of labor force in the communities. More than selling the agriculture services, they are also well-trained to apply the vegetable/cash crop growing, livestock, and food processing to increase incomes.

In continuing to help the small holder farmers, the project also collaborates with commune councilors, villagechiefs, and farmer promoters to extend the application of system of rice intensification (SRI) adapted to serious drought which occurred in the target areas since these couple years. We will use selective ways to achieve it such as SRI hand-planting by using ricestems, SRI hand-plating by using direct riceseeds, roller disk drum seeder, local drum seeder, and recently with Agri-smart machinery seeder. Niek Srer is also another tool that will be promoted among the target communities especially the chemical free SRI farmers who are willing to produce chemical free rice for selling. As increasing trust among target farmers, the field demos, SRI fields day, and direct coaching are also being used, and they are encouraged to share challenges, lesson learns, and experiences to their neighbors. More than SRI application, the farmers also train well, share some inputs to grow adaptive vegetable/cash crop in the rice fields before and after the rice cultivation, livestock especially chickens and black ducks, and off-farming to earn additional incomes.

In order to increase the positive changes of gender perception in the GRM families and communities, the project will work withfamilies who committed domestic violence by applying gender road map (GRM) as a tool. The selected couple will be invited to attendtraining on how to set up the GRM annual operation plan to change behavioral practices. The plan focuses on the change of gender practices in the families and promoting to apply the integrated farming system (IFS) in the families to increase incomes. They are closely coached every month and reflected their activities every three months. The internal/external study tours are also used as toolsto achieve the annual plan as well.</narrative>

They have shared the lesson learned and experiences about the farming system and vegetable production to the neighbored families in the communities.
# The Community based organizations (CBOs) gained the empowerment, competencies and ownership. The approaches were applied to farmer-based association, social equity fund, rice bank, credit and saving groups.
