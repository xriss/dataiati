   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Gaps between rich and poor are not inevitable &#x2013; they are the consequence of political and
economic choices. The consortium partners of the Power of Voices Partnership FAIR for All are Oxfam Novib, SOMO, Huairou Commission and Third World Network-Africa.They will implement this programme with civil society organisations in 13 countries across the South East Asia and African regions and the Netherlands. THey share a strong belief that value chains can be FAIR for ALL, distributing power equally and enabling all stakeholders to share in profits and benefits. This requires achieving systemic change: challenging
underlying power structures and relationships that inform policies and practices &#x2013; and which are often designed to benefit the few and not the majority. Active citizens and a strong, rooted and diverse civil society play a crucial role in driving this fundamental shift. Citizens &#x2013; activists, grassroots women, workers, farmers, thought leaders - are already proposing alternative models which are based on principles of agency, shared value and equal relations of power. Their organizations challenge belief systems that put profits before people and planet and hold companies and investors accountable for rights abuses in their supply chains. They activate citizens to monitor public spending and advocate for governments to bring in trade and tax reforms that will contribute to more equal sharing of wealth that is created in value chains.

The main focus of the FAIR for ALL programme proposal is to support and strengthen CSOs to play their diverse roles; as educators, mobilizers, creators and watchdogs to make trade and value chains FAIR for ALL. Supporting CSOs today is more crucial than ever as their space to keep duty bearers accountable is more andmore being compromised. Activists, human rights defenders and journalists are increasingly harassed, and their organizations increasingly face restrictions and struggle to secure sufficient funding. With proposed programme the FAIR for ALL consortium aims to: 1 Demonstrate the viability of progressive approaches to business; 2 End land and labour rights violations which are particularly persistent across primarycommodity
value-chains; 3 Support trade and tax reforms to decrease over-reliance on primary-commodity earnings and
increase governments&#x2019; capability to mobilize domestic resources for social spending and investment in more resilient, locally owned economies; 4 Encourage mutual learning and knock on effects between countries with similar value-chain dynamics, market conditions and companies and investors participating in value-chains; and 5. Leverage Dutch private-sector relationships to influence companies and investors participating
in value chains.

The FAIR for ALL programme will be implemented in 13 countries: Brazil, South Africa, Mozambique, Ghana, Nigeria, Kenya, Uganda, OPT, India, Vietnam, Indonesia, Cambodia and Myanmar. The potential for large-scale impact and systemic, long-lasting change was a key consideration for selecting these countries. The consortium believes this change can happen through the transformation of agricultural and extractive industry value chains. Millions of people work in or depend on agricultural and mineral value chains, and many more are impacted by them &#x2013; through unfair competition, precarious work, low incomes, land evictions and climate
change. Supporting efforts to ensure respect for human rights and increase opportunities for women small-scale producers has the potential to uplift the livelihoods ofmillions of women, men, girls and boys.

FAIR for ALL will be implemented through a Theory of Change composed of four interlinked pathways for change. Pathways 1 and 2 aim to strengthen civil society to contribute to a more responsible private sector thatrespects human rights, women&#x2019;s rights and labour rights, prevents environmental harm and distributes gains from value-chains more equally. Pathway 1 encourages the development and promotion of business
practices which share value more equally and empower women; pathway 2 strengthens civil society to advocate for a more responsible private and financial sector.

Pathways 3 and 4 contribute to a more accountable public sector that protects and fulfils the rights of people working in, or impacted by primary-commodity value chains, and that invests in more inclusive and sustainable value chains. Pathway 3 strengthens civil society to advocate governments to effectively regulate the private sector; pathway 4 encourages fiscal and trade reforms that enable increased social spending and investment in economies that produce jobs and income for local communities.</narrative>
