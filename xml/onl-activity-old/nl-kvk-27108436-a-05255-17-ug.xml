   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Facilitation for Integrated Community Rural Development (FICRD) has worked in Uganda since 2006.  Initially FICRD focused specifically on issues that affect formerly abducted children during the two decade insurgency in Northern Uganda.

Lira District Union of Persons with Disabilities is an umbrella body of people living with disabilities from the district of Lira registered with the District Non Forum. FICRD and LDUPWA are working together on supporting the education empowerment initiatives of girls with disabilities.

Girls with disability here in Lango sub region are generally a marginalised group, where there is high preference for families to send boys than girls with disability to school. It is even gets worse in the sense that the higher the education ladder, the higher dropout rates for girls with disability than boys

The overall goal of the project is to reduce gender disparities in the enrolment, retention and performance of girls with disability in secondary schools in Lango sub region. The aim is for girls with disability to successfully claim their right to secondary education in Lira and Oyam districts of Lango sub region, Northern Uganda.

Goal: To have conduct lobby for the inclusion of girls in education plans and priorities that will result in the training and awareness raising approach.
Objectives
# Support the empowering initiatives of school girls with disabilities though rights awareness on education by building confidence, assertiveness, negotiation skills, increasing engagement with school management, teachers and students, and in taking action.
# Support awareness creation among 12 school boards, 12 female councils, 2 district councils of the national education policy and the importance of girl#s education, and trainthem on gender responsive budgeting in education, and the inclusion of girl#s education priorities.
# Support girls with disability, with a focus to an an all-encompassing environment and protected from harmful practices of sexual violence, early marriage and negligence.
# Ensuring girls# voices and needs such as sanitary pads are listened to and provided and that girls participate in decision-making concerning their education, as well as greater confidence and freedom to make decisions that affect their lives</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Facilitation for Integrated Community Rural Development was formed in 2006 by a group of 7 young Ugandan (4 men and 3 women) with the purpose of providing accessible and affordable quality SRH services and information to rural poor community in a sustainable manner in the fight to alleviate poverty in Lango sub region. Over the years, FICRD incorporated other key aspects of empowerment of women and girls with disability, youth(boys and girls) with entrepreneurship skills and Climate and environmental issues.

ACHIEVEMENTS
What have been the principal results in the past three years that contribute to significant, structural, sustained and positive improvement in the lives of men, women, girls and boys suffering from poverty, injustice, insecurity and exclusion?

FICRD focused specifically on issues that affect formerly abducted children during the two-decade insurgency in Northern Uganda. FICRD gained solid experience and understanding of the ethnic differences and the complexity of issues they faceespecially the girl child. FICRD has supported women and girls# rights since its inception, working with both the district local governments and NGOs through Participatory Learning Approach (PLA) and Community Empowerment and Right Based Approach on social service delivery such as educational projects, healthcare service and information, family planning and sexual and reproductive health rights. FICRD have led successful advocacy campaigns and by doing so secured 46,150 school drop-outs and, reduced SGBV, child protection, child marriage in schools and communities. We empowered them with skills that have enabled many to fend for themselves and participate in local decision-making processes. Generally, FICRD has economically empowered many youths in Langosub region and Uganda at large.
FICRD has experience of working in partnership with national and international donors including RHU, JCRC, UHMG, USAID, IPPF, WHO, UNICEF, UNPHA, CPAR Relief Canada, MSI, AIC including in education, health and community development projects. FICRD has experience of utilising a range of capacity building methodologies, training, research, impact assessments, developing monitoring systems and documenting and dissemination of information. We plan to have project management working group made up of staff, partners, trustees and volunteers that advise on project issues and assist with regional, national and global advocacy.

Uganda is a land locked country found in East Africa. It has a democratic political dispensation with devolved decentralized system of governance. By 2014, Uganda#s population was estimated at 35 million people with 88% living in rural areas; 33% being young people (10 # 24 years) (UBOS, 2014). The high population growth rate of 3.3% per annum and young populationhas set a stage for population momentum and demographic gift. The life expectancy a Additionally, FICRD has hired airtime on 1 FM stations to run call in radio program, as avenue for the public to be educated on existing programs and policies. The program also accords opportunity to the community to express concerns and engage leadership#s birth in Uganda is 50.4 years.

Uganda is one of the poorest countries in the world ranking 144/177 of the least developed countries. The national budget is 50% donor dependent. Her GDP per capita is United States $394 in 2006/7. About 38%of the populations live below poverty line, with poverty more marked in the North and East of the country. The rapid population growth rate is partly responsible for the escalating poverty and slow economic growth. (MDG Progress Report 2007).  About 89.6% of the populations aged 10+ years are self-employed in rural areas. The 2005/6 literacy rate for both gender aged 15-24 years is 84.1%, with improvement attributable to the Universal Primary Education Policy. Government has recognized all these challenges and has put in place national policies and strategies to deal with the poor state of socio-economic conditions in the country, including Poverty Eradication Action Plan (PEAP), National Population Policy for Sustainable Development etc.</narrative>
