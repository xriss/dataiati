   <narrative xml:lang="SV">Norska flyktingr&#xE5;det (NRC) har ans&#xF6;kt till Sida om finansiering med 30 miljoner kronor f&#xF6;r att genomf&#xF6;ra projektet &quot; St&#xF6;d till ungas &#xF6;kade m&#xF6;jligheter till f&#xF6;rs&#xF6;rjning i DR Kongo &quot;. Projektet syftar till att hj&#xE4;lpa ungdomar att bli aktiva och engagerade medlemmar i sina samh&#xE4;llen, och till att f&#xE5; st&#xF6;d i &#xF6;verg&#xE5;ngen till sj&#xE4;lvf&#xF6;rs&#xF6;rjning. Tre geografiska omr&#xE5;den &#xE4;r fokus f&#xF6;r projektet: Kananga (Kasa&#xEF; Central), Butembo (Grand North Kivu) och Uvira (Syd-Kivu). Det &#xE4;r ett tre&#xE5;rigt projekt som ska gynna 1 800 ungdomar direkt (50% kvinnor, 50% m&#xE4;n) och 10 800 f&#xF6;rs&#xF6;rjningsberoende och familjemedlemmar som kommer att kunna dra ekonomisk nytta fr&#xE5;n det faktum att deras unga familjemedlemmar utbildas. 

Projektet syftar till att st&#xF6;dja unga m&#xE4;nniskors m&#xF6;jligheter till anst&#xE4;llning genom att ansluta dem till utbildningscenter, privata f&#xF6;retag och mentorskaps- och entrepren&#xF6;rskapsm&#xF6;jligheter. NRC kommer att st&#xF6;dja utvecklingen av en milj&#xF6; som gynnar ungdomsanst&#xE4;llning. Detta inkluderar att fylla kunskapsluckor, ge praktiska utbildningsm&#xF6;jligheter och att ta itu med de strukturella utmaningar som ungdomar ofta st&#xE5;r inf&#xF6;r f&#xF6;r att f&#xE5; jobb eller starta egen verksamhet.

NRC kommer att fokusera p&#xE5; tre specifika m&#xE5;l:
1. Unga m&#xE4;nniskor utvecklar och anv&#xE4;nder grundl&#xE4;ggande, &#xF6;verf&#xF6;rbara, tekniska f&#xE4;rdigheter.  
2. Ungdomar anv&#xE4;nder sina f&#xE4;rdigheter i ekonomiska aktiviteter.
3. Utbildningspersonal har tillr&#xE4;cklig kunskap och f&#xE4;rdigheter f&#xF6;r att ge kvalitativ utbildning och st&#xF6;d.

NRC kommer att genomf&#xF6;ra detta projekt i samarbete med Kongolesiska F&#xF6;retagsfederationen (FEC) och ungdomsutbildningscenter (TVET) i Butembo, Uvira och Kananga. P&#xE5; provinsniv&#xE5; kommer NRC att samordna sina aktiviteter med Divisionen f&#xF6;r Sociala Fr&#xE5;gor (DIVAS), Ungdomsavdelningen (Divijeunesse) och Nationella Institutet f&#xF6;r Professionell F&#xF6;rberedelse (INPP).</narrative>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC)  has applied to Sida for funding of 30 M SEK to carry out the project &quot;Supporting Youth in Transitioning to Livelihood Opportunities in the DRC&quot;. The project aims to help young people become active and engaged members of their communities and receive support to make the transition to livelihoods. Three geographical areas will be targeted by the project: Kananga (Kasa&#xEF; Central), Butembo (Grand North Kivu), and Uvira (South Kivu), for a three (3) year project that will benefit 1,800 young people directly (50% women, 50% men) and 10,800 dependents and family members who will benefit economically from the training of their youth family members.

The project will support young people&apos;s access to employment by connecting them to training centers, private businesses and mentoring and entrepreneurship opportunities. NRC will support the creation of an environment conducive to youth employment. This will involve filling knowledge gaps, providing practical training opportunitiesa and addressing the structural challenges that young people often face in getting a job or starting their own business.

NRC will focus its efforts around three specific objectives:
1. Young people develop and use fundamental, transferable and technical skills;
2. Young people apply acquired skills in viable economic activities; 
3. Education professionals have the knowledge and skills to provide quality training and support.

NRC will implement this project in partnership with the Federation of Enterprises of Congo (FEC) and youth training centers (TVET) in Butembo, Uvira and Kananga. In addition, at the provincial level NRC will coordinate with the Division of Social Affairs (DIVAS), the Division of Youth (Divijeunesse) and the National Institute of Professional Preparation (INPP).</narrative>

Three geographical areas will be targeted by the project: Kananga (Kasa&#xEF; Central), Butembo (Grand North Kivu), and Uvira (South Kivu), for a three (3) year project that will benefit 1,800 young people directly (50% women, 50% men), and 10,800 dependents and family members who will benefit economically from the training of their youth family members. The project will have three cycles, with 200 young people trained in each geographical area each year of the project.
This project will support young people&apos;s access to employment by connecting them to training centers, private businesses and mentoring and entrepreneurship opportunities. NRC will help create an environment conducive to youth employment; this will involve filling knowledge gaps, providing practical training opportunities, and addressing the structural challenges that young people often face in getting a job or starting their own business.
To this end, NRC will focus its efforts around three specific objectives:1. Young people develop and use fundamental, transferable and technical skills;2. Young people apply acquired skills in viable economic activities; and3. Education professionals have the knowledge and skills to provide quality training and support.
This project leads to the short-term outcomes of literate youth with business skills and the knowledge necessary to create or access business opportunities and education professionals with the knowledge and skills to provide quality training and support to youth. This leads to medium-term results that enable young people to engage in viable economic activities, with the long-term result that young people become active and engaged members of their communities. To achieve this, NRC plans to support existing vocational training structures and establish a network of contacts between private companies and young people.
NRC will implement this project in partnership with the Federation of Enterprises of Congo (FEC) and youth training centers (TVET) in Butembo, Uvira and Kananga. In addition, at the provincial level NRC will coordinate with the Division of Social Affairs (DIVAS), the Division of Youth (Divijeunesse) and the National Institute of Professional Preparation (INPP).
Conflict resolution in Tanganyika
The project aims at restoring social cohesion, preventing and addressing disputes that have constituted a major factor in opposing communities and that have caused displacement for several years in Tanganyika. The&#xA0;province is affected by a historical conflict between the Twa and Bantu communities, worsened by forced displacement. Violence between farmers and herders on the one hand, conflicts between Twa and Bantu pygmy communities on the other, as well as disputes between IDPs and host communities are recurrent.
NRC seeks to address to the extent possible some of the root causes of these conflicts between communities and of the disputes between individuals with a tailored intervention methodology based on an in-depth understanding of the conflicts and disputes.
The main objective will be: NRC intends to contribute to the humanitarian efforts to stabilize the Tanganyika region by offering services that promote social cohesion, improve living conditions and enhance livelihood opportunities in the places of return for IDPs.
The project will be implemented during June 2021&#xA0;to May 2022&#xA0;and aims to capitalize&#xA0;on good practices and lessons learnt from the 3-year Humanitarian Mediation (HM) Sida-funded project implemented in Kasai, Tanganyika and Ituri (ending in March 2021). The project seeks to promote peace, dialogue and social cohesion through various methodologies as deemed appropriate after conflict analysis.
Method and capacity support through INGO forum&#xA0;
INGO-forum in the DRC is an independent forum of INGOs, working to address the needs of the vulnerable people in the DRC and provide a platform for its members to strengthen the coordination, share information and expertise, and address key issues of common interest via collective advocacy action, notably related to humanitarian access, humanitarian and development nexus, visibility/funding for the DRC.&#xA0;
The support from the Swedish Embassy will contribute to further reinforcing the impact and efficiency of humanitarian and recovery aid delivery in the DRC through INGO&#x2019;s enhanced coordination and common positionning, where nexus coordination will be an important component. In addition to Sweden, the INGO forum is also&#xA0;funded by ECHO,&#xA0;SDC and INGOs.
Sweden intends to support INGO forum during the period of June 2021 to May 2022.</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">Some efforts have been made concerning the Congolese education system. For example, the free school system set up by the new President of the DRC, Etienne Tshisekedi, in accordance with article 43 of the Constitution which stipulates that everyone has the right to school education. In January 2019, the President of the Republic affirmed that two million five hundred thousand children of school age have returned to school thanks to the program of free basic education in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC. These are huge advances for the DRC.This measure affected the NRC project a little, as some young people returned to school to continue their primary education.From the exchanges that the Embassy had with the authorities in Kasai, during field visits, encouraging examples were highlighted: former children associated with armed forces and groups who have become employers by creating their micro-enterprise thanks to to the DDR program.
But it should be noted that despite the efforts made, much remains to be done.Professional training adapted to prevent young people from going easily to find refuge in militias and other armed groups. The deployment of training and education offers is very uneven across the country.
The education system has difficulty meeting the employability needs of learners because the programs are generally focused on theoretical knowledge. Whether primary, secondary or academic, training does not lead to professional skills that allow you to be immediately employable.
Regarding the project, this first has not yet produced the expected results but has enabled the project to set the scene to facilitate the implementation of the project in all 3 intervention zones. This in terms of recruiting and deploying the team, setting up accountability and transparency mechanisms, market research for identifying markets and targeting young people.
The actual training program started late, in September with a total of 600 young people targeted. But 559 including 318 young girls started the training process. The project recorded a dropout rate of 7% of young people as of December 31, 2020. Most have returned to primary school following the measure on free education.The participation rate of young girls is 56% against 44% of young men.
A total of 6 agents, including 3 officers and three assistants, were recruited and deployed in the three intervention zones: Butembo, Uvira and Kananga in less than 3 months.
A total of 18 processionary training centers were selected on the basis of the professions identified by the study.
In order to increase the quality of its interventions, NRC began by training its team on the youth intervention approach and ASER methods of identifying young people.The transparency and accountability mechanisms put in place by NRC enabled the project to be anchored in the three intervention zones. These are demonstrated by (1) holding a workshop to provide feedback on the results of targeting young people to authorities and community leaders, (2) posting of lists of preselected young people to district offices, setting up a accountability and complaints with an NRC number (47 66 66) already functional for this first year, Collection and handling of complaints related to the display of lists.To prevent conflicts, NRC involved local communities, local authorities, local leaders, business corporations and micro, small and medium enterprises and craftspeople as well as vocational training centers throughout the project implementation process. . For example, holding a launching workshop in the three intervention zones. This allowed the community to learn about the project and take ownership of it.Communities and all stakeholders were involved in defining criteria and targeting strategies for beneficiaries using a community approach.Volunteer targeting committees were set up and made it possible to target several young people. 600 young people were selected, including 200 per intervention area.With the help of NRC, communities have established complaint management committees and established complaints mechanisms in each neighborhood.Three studies promoting the start of the project were carried out in the three intervention zones, namely:- Conflict-sensitive analysis. These analyzes made it possible to detect the connectors and dividers that could influence the life of the project.- Protection analysis (Do No Harm analysis) in Butembo. This facilitated the integration of protection aspects in the conduct of activities.- Market analysis by Key Aid Consulting (KAC) identifying promising trades.</narrative>
