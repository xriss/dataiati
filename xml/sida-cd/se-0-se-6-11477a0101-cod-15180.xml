   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The contribution focused on a support for UNFPA in the DRC for the purpose of procuring an evaluation of donor-funded programs/projects against sexual violence in the Democratic Republic of Congo during the period 2005-2017. The evaluation aimed at generating knowledge and identify good practice of what has worked or not in the context of international support for projects and programs against sexual violence in DRC. Furthermore, the evaluation was expected to identify gaps in the preventive work including support to survivors of sexual violence, which in turn was expected to feed in to both donors&apos; future efforts and government policies in the fight against sexual violence.Sweden supported the evaluation financially together with Canada and the United Kingdom (DFID).</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">After significant delays, UNFPA finally transmitted the final report in September 2019.On 29-10-2019, the Embassy held a meeting with UNFPA to discuss the results of the evaluation and the report. The evaluation points out some major breakthroughs in the response to sexual violence in the DRC, but also found challenges and therefore formed a series of recommendations that need to be prioritized to ensure maximum prevention as well as timely and effective assistance to victims of sexual violence and other forms of gender-based violence.
After reading the report and meeting with UNFPA for a debriefing on the final report, the Embassy noted some interesting results. Despite the lack of consultants, UNFPA staff have taken good care of the results of the evaluation.The final version of the report and the exchanges with UNFPA provide the following:The dialogue with the technical and financial partners and the humanitarian funds has enabled DR Congo to adopt a national strategy. Until 2015, collaboration between partners was good and many partners funded the response to sexual violence issues, especially for stabilization in the east of the country.
After 2016, a decrease in support was observed. Donors were expecting more of this joint assessment and they wanted their investments to make an impact. On the other hand, humanitarian donors have filled the gap by continuing to finance the issue at hand. More than USD 800 million was spent in the sector.When analysing the impact of sexual violence to find out whether partner support has helped to change something about the response to sexual violence, the Embassy noted the following:State awareness of the issue of sexual violence and a strong commitment through laws. A specific law on sexual violence was adopted in 2006 and the family code was revised in 2016.
The outgoing presidential advisor, Mrs. Mabunda, currently Speaker of the Lower House of Parliament was very engaged in the field and has left a void. DRC was taken out of the Black list regarding recruitment of child soldiers to FARDC, and actions are taken to fight impunity against the FARDC.This demonstrates a level of awareness at all levels: government, community, civil society, most visible at government level.A little improvement on the governance is monitored; the Ministry is more engaged as a spokesperson, the &#x201C;16 days of activism&#x201D; is institutionalized, a national campaign &quot;break the silence&quot; was implemented with results in certain areas, relative impact.There is progress on the SDGs. Impact on reproductive health services including &quot;one stop center&quot;, women&apos;s participation at the political level, improving the functioning of the judicial authorities, in the practice of law, improving the lives of young girls.There have been advances on the pacification of the Great Lake that have had an impact on conflict-related violence. The issue of violence is no longer a taboo.Commitment of donors. Some donors have strengthened their commitments to the civil society, especially Sweden and Canada. More and more joint funding mechanisms assist management and facilitates the outcome. However, the evaluation shows a decrease in support since 2015.Private sector: It is clear from the study that there has been a lot of support in from the private sector, in particular by mining companies and through the rehabilitation of roads and infrastructure, but no strategy of commitment as such with the private sector.</narrative>
