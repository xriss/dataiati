   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Asya Port Liman Isletmeleri A.S. (Asyaport or the Company) is developing a greenfield container terminal (the Project) with an expected annual handling capacity of 1.9 million twenty foot equivalent units that will mostly serve as a transshipment hub to the Black Sea via the Bosphorus.</narrative>
  </description>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Project will help facilitate trade between Black Sea countries, and Mediterranean and further afield countries, by developing a much-needed new, modern and efficient deepwater transshipment container terminal. This is particularly important given the strong growth forecasts for Black Sea countries, especially Turkey. The project will improve the port infrastructure to facilitate Turkey&apos;&apos;s growing share of international trade. In addition, the Project will help Turkey realize future gains from developing water transport, which, when compared to road transport, has lower freight rates, more capacity, lower social costs from less road accidents, and less environmental impact. The Project will also create direct and indirect employment opportunities and increase revenues for the Government of Turkey through increased economic activity and higher tax payments, and royalty and lease payments.</narrative>
