   <narrative xml:lang="EN">-     Improved private-sector efficiency: Software development and IT services play an increasingly important role in supporting domestic growth and efficiency. ERP software solutions, such as the ones developed by Logo, are changing the manner in which businesses operate making them more efficient by enabling them to automate functions, analyze historical trends, make effective forecasts and create added value.   -     Improving SME Business Practices: Whereas international players like SAP, Oracle and Microsoft have a strong presence with large enterprises Logo has focused on the SME segment. It provides them with ERP solutions, at reasonable prices, that result in improvements in their business practices in areas such as accounting, internal controls and financial reporting. Because of its high penetration rate amongst SMEs, Logo is the largest ERP vendor in Turkey, in terms of total number of subscribers, and by expanding its product offering, this project will enable the Company to reach a wider spectrum of Turkish companies. The wider adoption of ERP solutions by SMEs will help improve compliance with the requirements of Turkish commercial, labor and tax laws, and support the Government&apos;&apos;s effort to grow the formal economy.     -     Employment: The IT sector creates employment for highly skilled staff. Logo offers graduates the opportunity to apply their training in the development and support of ERP software both directly and through its business partners in Logo&apos;&apos;s eco-system. Logo grooms these business partners through training and structured programs such as the Logosphere conferences.</narrative>
