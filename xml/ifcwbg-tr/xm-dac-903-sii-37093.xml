   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Project constitutes an integral part of MMI&apos;&apos;s transportation master plan with the main goal of improving urban mobility and connectivity through an integrated, efficient and environmentally-friendly public transportation system that aims to eventually shift, from the current 13%, up to 48% of the total daily trips to rail transit by 2019. A more efficient public transportation will reduce travel times and contribute in the long run to higher productivity and economic growth in Istanbul. By alleviating congestion on the urban road network, the Project is also expected to lead to a significant reduction in CO2 emissions.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Project is an IFC A/B Loan of up to EUR 110 million to support Metropolitan Municipality of Istanbul (MMI) to finance the construction and electromechanical works of the 5.3 km Kabatas-Mecidiyekoy metro line including three stations. The metro line will be constructed on the European side of Istanbul and will establish an important east-west public transit axis running through seven northern districts of Istanbul and interconnecting four existing tram/metro lines. Construction of the metro project would help MMI to reduce road congestion and promote alternative environmentally-friendly modes of public transportation in Istanbul.</narrative>
