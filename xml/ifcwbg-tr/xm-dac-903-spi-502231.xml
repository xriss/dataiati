   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Summary Of Project Information (SPI)    Project NameTURKEY: Izopoli - MP (Montreal Protocol) ProjectRegionEurope   Sector    Project No502231   Projected Board DateOctober 2, 1998   Company NameIzopoli Yapi Elemanlari Taahhut Sanayi ve Ticaret Ltd. Sti.        Technical Partner and/or Major Shareholders    	Kiroglu Group, Ankara   	Polypag, Switzerland (50-50 JV for canister foam production)     Project Cost Including proposed IFC investment    	USD 2,760,000 (USD 1,141,500 provided as a MP grant via IFC)    Location of project and Description of site    	The project will be undertaken at Izopoli&apos;&apos;s manufacturing facilities located in Bolu - about halfway between Istanbul and Ankara.    Description of Company and Purpose of Project    	Izopoli is the third largest Turkish manufacturer of metal clad insulation panels for the construction and cold storage industry, but the only producer in Turkey making panels with the highest possible grade of fire protection.  Izopoli is also one of the largest provider of spray-foam services in the country and is the only producer of one-component canister foams.  This project will facilitate the replacement of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) as the foam blowing agent in the manufacture of canister foam, spray foam and pour-in-place operations, and production of rigid polyurethane foam panels.  The project is expected to cost-effectively phase out nearly 300 tons of CFC-11 per year.  The purpose of the project is to assist the company in complying with the requirements of the Montreal Protocol and to help Turkey meet its obligations under the Protocol of freezing CFC use in 1999.    Environmental Category and Issues    	The project has been classified as Category B.  The project will eliminate CFC use by Izopoli and will avoid the use of nearly 300 tons of CFCs per year.  Use of CFCs will be replaced with (i) n-pentane in panel production, (ii) HCFC-141b (and ultimately other ODS-free agents) in spray-foam operations, and (iii) HFC-134a in production of canister foams (already complete after an interim switch to HCFC-22).  Use of pentane will involve appropriate storage and piping, installation of proper ventilation &amp; safety measures, and worker training.    The  is  August 28, 1998 from the InfoShop.   Date SPI sent to InfoShop September 2, 1998    This Summary of Project Information is prepared and distributed to the public in advance of consideration of the proposed transaction by the Corporations Board of Directors.  It is provided for the purpose of enhancing the transparency of IFCs activities and should not be construed as presuming the outcome of IFC Board consideration.
