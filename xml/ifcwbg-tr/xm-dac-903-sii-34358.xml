   <narrative xml:lang="EN">- The proposed financing will improve infrastructure for public health services in Adana, a second tier city in Turkey, and adress the need for improved bed capacity and to develop underserved specialized areas. - Successful financing and implementation of this flagship project under the program is expected to lead the way for the rest of the projects in the program, most of which focused on second tier cities. - The project is also expected to provide better health outcomes through implementation of modern clinical and diagnostic services, better patient flow (with services consolidated in one campus) and reduced waiting lines. - Additionally, the proposed project will have a demonstation effect in the region and for other sectors (i.e. education), where PPP models are being investigated as an alternative to improve social infrastructure, and are expected to follow the example of the Turkish healthcare PPP Program.</narrative>
