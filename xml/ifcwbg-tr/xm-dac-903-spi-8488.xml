   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Summary Of Project Information (SPI)       Project Name    Turkey-Viking              Region    Europe        Sector       Project No008488   Projected Board DateNovember 30, 1997   Company NameViking Kagit ve Seluloz A.S.   Technical Partner and/or Major Shareholders    	None.    Project Cost Including proposed IFC investment    	US$25.0 million including an IFC senior loan of up to US$10 million.    Location of project and Description of site    	The project will be at the Companys existing facilities in Aliaga, about 60 km north of Izmir, Turkeys largest seaport. Aliaga is a small town which benefits from very good transportation and communication facilities.        Description of Company and Purpose of Project    		Viking, one of Turkeys leading industrial and tissue paper manufacturers, proposes a US$25 million expansion and modernization project.  The Companys total industrial paper production capacity is about 23,000 tons per year.  Viking also has a tissue paper conversion line of 12,000 tons per year.   The project would almost double the Companys total paper manufacturing capacity by adding a second paper machine of 25,000 tons (all for tissue paper) for a total paper production (industrial and tissue) of about 48,000 tons per year.  The existing machine would produce exclusively industrial paper.  The Companys main strategic objectives are to take advantage of a rapidly growing market in tissue paper and to maintain its position as one of the dominant manufacturers in the domestic industrial paper sector.  The goals of Vikings investment program are to: (i) increase its share of tissue paper in Turkey and develop exports of tissue paper to neighboring countries, (ii) maintain its share in industrial paper, (iii) strengthen its cost competitiveness through increased economies of scale, (iv) develop higher value added products, (v) upgrade and expand its environmental treatment facility, and (vi) broaden the Companys sources of long-term capital financing.  The project would be located at the Companys existing facility at Aliaga, 60 km north of Izmir, Turkeys largest seaport.      Environmental Category and Issues    	This is a category B project according to IFCs environmental review procedure.  Environmental issues include air emissions, liquid effluents, and solid waste disposal.  Occupational and safety issues include exposure to high temperatures and potentially hazardous aerosols. Viking Paper operates a wastewater treatment plant having both biological and chemical treatments.  The plant has a treatment capacity of 4000 m3 of waste water.  The treated water is discharged to the Guzelhisar River.  The effluent waste water meets World Bank water quality guidelines.  Based on its review of available information regarding potential environmental impacts and proposed mitigation measures, IFC concludes that Viking Paper proposed project will meet World Bank environmental, health and safety policies and guidelines and host country requirements.
