   <narrative xml:lang="EN">- Access to Finance: The proposed project will increase access to finance to underserved segments by on-lending to SMEs, pivotal to economic growth. - Development of the Sustainable Energy sector: The proposed project is expected to have high developmental impact as it will support the growth of sustainable energy projects undertaken by SMEs in Turkey. Energy efficiency potential for Turkey-based industrial SMEs is estimated at about 7% of their total energy consumption. Improvement of electrical efficiency of utilities (motors, light, heating, compressed air) represents a significant portion of this potential. Significant investments are needed to reach this economy potential in the mid- to long-term. - Cost Savings to SMEs: Contribution to the reduction of SMEs&apos;&apos; energy costs through improvement in utilization of sustainable energy resources. - Support Cleaner Environment: Improvement of the local and global environment through reduced emissions of greenhouse gases and other conventional pollutants and reduction of Turkey&apos;&apos;s dependency on imports of fossil fuel and natural gases.</narrative>
