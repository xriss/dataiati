   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Mersin Port</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Mersin International Port (MIP or the Company) is Turkeys largest container and general cargo port and is located in Mersin in the south eastern part of the country. The Group is looking to upgrade and expand its terminal cargo handling capacity to respond to changing needs of the market.</narrative>
  </description>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The proposed Project will help facilitate trade between the expansive hinterland of South-Eastern Turkey, the Mediterranean and the rest of the world by expanding MIP&apos;&apos;s modern, efficient port operation. The Company&apos;&apos;s proposed capital expenditure program will allow shipping lines to deploy larger container vessels, and therefore lower per TEU costs, benefiting shippers, shipping lines and consumers.  This would facilitate trade and assist in the continued economic development of the hinterland served by the port. The proposed capital expenditure program will also generate additional tax revenues for the Government of Turkey, as a result of increased revenues of MIP.    -	Demonstration Effect: MIP is proposing to issue the first project bond issued by a Turkish infrastructure company. The proposed transaction will have a significant demonstration effect, encouraging other Turkish infrastructure corporates to consider accessing international bond markets, which would be an important step in the development of a new source of financing for infrastructure projects. The Eurobond issue will allow MIP to maintain its leading position as a port by providing the financing to expand its capacity and deepen the draft of the facility.   -	Contribute to the development of the Turkish port sector: MIP&apos;&apos;s continued success will enhance competition and increase the available container capacity on Turkey&apos;&apos;s Mediterranean coastline. The expected increased container traffic and local cargo will enhance linkages with local businesses involved in transportation, warehousing, logistics, etc., many of which are small and medium size enterprises.</narrative>
