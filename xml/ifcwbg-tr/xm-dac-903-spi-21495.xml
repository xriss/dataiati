Ege Ports offers the following basic services to ships calling at the port:  
-  tugging, 
-  pilotage, 
-  sheltering, 
-  clean water supply, 
-  disposal of solid waste, 
-  underwater diving inspection, and

The proposed project comprises the operation and expansion of the Kusadasi Port, including the financing of the $24.3 million concession payment to the GOT;  construction of a new passenger terminal;  extension of the existing berths and purchase of equipment necessary for carrying out operations of the Kusadasi Port.  The proposed project will bring Kusadasi Port operations into compliance with the International Port and Facility Security (ISPS) Code.</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Kusadasi Port is located in the city of Kusadasi which is situated on the west coast of Turkey in the southern Aegean Sea, 90 kms south of Izmir.  Kusadasi is known as one of the most attractive cities in the Aegean region, and is only about 20 kms from the Greco/Roman City of Ephesus, the site of the Temple of Artemis (one of the wonders of the ancient world), the Basilica of Saint John (where Saint John is buried), the Isa Bey Mosque and the Museum of Sel&#xE7;uk.  In the nearby hills lies Merymana, reputed to be the place where the Virgin Mary died and a place of pilgrimage for Christians.  The area has numerous other historical and cultural sites.  

The existing port facilities consist of two parallel piers (the old pier and the new pier) separated by about 93 m and oriented in a North West  South East direction.  The old pier is smaller than the new one and has outside and inside berth lengths of 262 m and 158 m, respectively.  The new pier provides berths of 235 m on the inside and 258 m on the outside.   The piers provide drafts of 9 m near the shore, increasing to 14 m at the ends.  There is a small terminal building which is used for entry and exit of the passengers to the port.  There is also a bus staging area located within the port area with a capacity of 50-60 buses.</narrative>
