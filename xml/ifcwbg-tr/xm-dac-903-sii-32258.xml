   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Gama Enerji Anonim Sirketi (Gama Enerji or the Company) is a private power and water company headquartered in Turkey with operational assets in Turkey and Jordan.   The purpose of the Project is to invest in secondary shares of Gama Enerji and to subscribe to share capital increases of the Company in order to provide equity for the pipeline projects that are expected to materialize in the next 2-3 years.</narrative>
  </description>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The expected Development Impact of the Project includes:  i) Equity contribution: Securing sufficient equity is a critical issue for Turkish sponsors in becoming owners/operators of infrastructure assets. IFC&apos;&apos;s involvement in the Project would help achieve this not only directly but also facilitate a potential future equity raising by Gama Enerji / an IPO.  ii) Demonstration effect: IFC will be supporting the Government of Turkey&apos;&apos;s (GoT) comprehensive strategy aimed at insuring the power sector&apos;&apos;s financial viability through increased private sector investment in the sector. Through privatizations and creating a liberal market environment, the GoT is aiming to attract more private investments to the power sector.  iii) Economic impact: Given the strong link between growth and the consequent increase of power demand, Gama Enerji&apos;&apos;s investments will contribute to the country&apos;&apos;s infrastructure, and help meet the requirements of a growing economy as well as ensuring affordable electricity prices.   iv) Supporting the water sector in Turkey and in the near region: Only a portion of the population in the region is currently connected to adequate wastewater treatment facilities, and while a larger portion is served by public drinking networks there are still a number of people who are under-served.  At the same time, much of the existing water infrastructure requires rehabilitation and new water facilities are needed to keep up with urbanization, population growth and industrial water demands. While still at early stages of private participation, Gama Enerji is well placed to engage in water sector projects in Turkey and the region.   v) Promoting south-to-south investments: Based in Turkey, Gama Enerji envisages investments not only in Turkey but also in the near region. In this regard, the Company is expected to become an investment platform through which IFC will be supporting south-south investments.    vi) Lower carbon emissions: Gama Enerji envisages continuing to invest heavily in renewable energy projects which will help reducing GHG emissions. Additionally, compared to other energy sources such as coal and lignite, natural gas power generation presents a better alternative in terms of carbon emissions.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">The expected Development Impact of the Project includes:  i) Equity contribution: Securing sufficient equity is a critical issue for Turkish sponsors in becoming owners/operators of infrastructure assets. IFC&apos;&apos;s involvement in the Project would help achieve this not only directly but also facilitate a potential future equity raising by Gama Enerji / an IPO.  ii) Demonstration effect: IFC will be supporting the Government of Turkey&apos;&apos;s (GoT) comprehensive strategy aimed at insuring the power sector&apos;&apos;s financial viability through increased private sector investment in the sector. Through privatizations and creating a liberal market environment, the GoT is aiming to attract more private investments to the power sector.  iii) Economic impact: Given the strong link between growth and the consequent increase of power demand, Gama Enerji&apos;&apos;s investments will contribute to the country&apos;&apos;s infrastructure, and help meet the requirements of a growing economy as well as ensuring affordable electricity prices.   iv) Supporting the water sector in Turkey and in the near region: Only a portion of the population in the region is currently connected to adequate wastewater treatment facilities, and while a larger portion is served by public drinking networks there are still a number of people who are under-served.  At the same time, much of the existing water infrastructure requires rehabilitation and new water facilities are needed to keep up with urbanization, population growth and industrial water demands. While still at early stages of private participation, Gama Enerji is well placed to engage in water sector projects in Turkey and the region.   v) Promoting south-to-south investments: Based in Turkey, Gama Enerji envisages investments not only in Turkey but also in the near region. In this regard, the Company is expected to become an investment platform through which IFC will be supporting south-south investments.    vi) Lower carbon emissions: Gama Enerji envisages continuing to invest heavily in renewable energy projects which will help reducing GHG emissions. Additionally, compared to other energy sources such as coal and lignite, natural gas power generation presents a better alternative in terms of carbon emissions.</narrative>
