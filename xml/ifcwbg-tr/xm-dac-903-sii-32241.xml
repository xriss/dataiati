   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Project&apos;&apos;s development impact is expected to be high, as it generates a range of environmental and economic benefits related to the development of sustainable energy finance and related investments. Specifically, the Project would:  (i)	develop sustainable energy investments across all industry sectors;  (ii)	improve the competitiveness of the Turkish economy by increasing the number of sustainable energy end-users and lenders;  (iii)	improve the local as well as the global environment through reduced emissions of greenhouse gases and other conventional pollutants and reduce the country&apos;&apos;s dependence on imports of fossil fuels and natural gas; and (iv)	improve quality of life through reduced pollution and healthier living conditions.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project would expand access to sustainable energy finance (i.e. energy efficiency and renewable energy) by working with I Finansal Kiralama A.S. (Is Leasing or the Company), a well established partner that has reach and is keenly interested strategically in developing its sustainable energy portfolio.  In particular, this project would allow IFC to expand financing for energy efficiency and to have development impact on sub-scale renewable energy projects which are not feasible for direct IFC investment.  IFC was one of the founding shareholders of Is Leasing in 1988 along with Societe Generale and Turkiye Is Bankasi A.S. (Is Bank). Is Bank became the majority shareholder in 1995 and the Company was listed on Istanbul Stock Exchange in 2000.  Is Leasing is among Turkeys leading leasing companies (fifth in terms of total assets among 48 leasing companies in Turkey as of September 30, 2012) with a market share of around six percent in new lease volume for 2012. The Company has recently prioritized SME segment as an area of growth in order diversify its portfolio. New products such as sustainable energy and renewable energy financing are seen strategically as high growth areas.</narrative>
