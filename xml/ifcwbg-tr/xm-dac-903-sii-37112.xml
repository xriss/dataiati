   <narrative xml:lang="EN">1) Financial Inclusion of Underserved Segments: Turkey has an unbanked population of 23 million which represents 0.9% of   the world&apos;&apos;s unbanked population. Despite high growth, only 38% of loans to businesses in Turkey were channeled to   MSMEs. The proposed project will increase access to finance for MSMEs, as eligibility criteria on the use of IFC&apos;&apos;s proceeds   will focus on this segment.   2) Capital Market Development: By supporting the second DPR issuance by Finansbank, IFC will help mobilize additional   investment from other investors. This will help further develop the capital markets in Turkey where access to medium-long   term finance by financial institutions at commercially viable pricing is still very limited.   3) Job Creation: IFC&apos;&apos;s experience has shown that MSMEs can achieve higher job creation. MSMEs in Turkey grew faster   than the Turkish economy at the rate of 20% compare to economic growth of 8.5%, supporting economic growth and   employment creation.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Finansbank A.S. (Finansbank or the Bank) is the 5th largest private bank in Turkey and one of the fastest growing private banks in the country with a comprehensive network of branches, and a market share of 4.2% based on net loans as of December 2014. The bank is owned 99.8% by the National Bank of Greece (NBG) group. The balance is listed on the stock exchange.   The proposed Project is for IFC to make a second round of investment of up to US$100 million in Finansbanks new notes issuances of up to US$280 million from its existing Diversified Payments Rights (DPR) securitization facility.   IFCs proposed investment is targeted at increasing lending to MSMEs in Turkey, consistent with IFCs strategic priorities for the country. Although the MSMEs represent almost 80% of total employment in Turkey, loans made to MSMEs represent only about 38% of the total loans. Access to finance is perceived as the single most severe obstacle to growth by MSMEs, according to the 2008 enterprise survey conducted by the World Bank. The proposed Project would deepen IFCs relationship with Finansbank and help expand its footprint in financing MSMEs by supporting the development of its product and service offerings tailored to the specific needs of this underserved segment.</narrative>
