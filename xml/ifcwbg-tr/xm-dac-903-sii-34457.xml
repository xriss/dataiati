   <narrative xml:lang="EN">- Development of the hydrocarbon sector in Turkey: The Thrace Basin in Turkey is the country&apos;&apos;s largest gas producing province and gas produced in the region is consumed domestically. Being one of the main private E&amp;P companies in Turkey, TAP will help develop indigenous hydrocarbon resources and thus contribute to the country&apos;&apos;s goals of reducing energy dependency, and help displace other fuels with natural gas.  - Technology and know-how transfer: TAP is pioneering North American technology including hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling in Turkey and through the use of advanced development and production technology, is playing an instrumental role in the transfer of technology. TAP&apos;&apos;s activities enhance recoveries from and extends the lives of its fields in Turkey, leading to additional revenues to the government in the form of taxes and royalties.  TAP is also sharing knowhow with TPAO, the national oil company in Turkey, with whom TAP partners with in certain gas fields located in Thrace. This transfer of know how is highly likely to enhance recovery from other existing fields operated by TPAO and indirectly generate additional revenues to the government and help improve the energy balance of Turkey.  - Helping develop the nascent services sector in the region: TAP has significant drilling, 3D seismic and other development and exploration activities which are currently acquired from Viking Services (an IFC client), an oil field services company operating in the region. TAP is Viking&apos;&apos;s key client and will continue playing an instrumental role in the development of the services sector in the country. The availability of North American technology in the region is enhancing recoveries in other existing fields operated by other clients as well. TAP&apos;&apos;s expansion in Turkey will create and preserve local services jobs and provide training for local staff. TAP employs local technical staff to monitor and supervise activities such as horizontal drilling in Turkey. Local technical staff, which includes female drilling engineers, in many cases receive training in the United States.</narrative>
