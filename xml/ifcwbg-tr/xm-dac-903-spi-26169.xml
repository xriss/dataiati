   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project is expected to have multiple development impacts, including: 

- Promoting EE Finance: 

IFC support in development of leasing financial products for energy efficient and renewable energy equipment will help the end users to find proper financing and to raise awareness.  

- Reduced Energy Consumption and Reduced Pollution: 

The leasing sub-projects are expected to reduce energy consumption for the relevant industries i.e. light industries (textile, printing, food), power and heat generation etc.) as well as in industrial and commercial buildings. Reduced energy consumption is a global priority, as well as important at the national level in the interest of reducing dependence on imported energy.  Investments in energy efficiency offer a cost effective way to meet growing energy demand while reducing emissions.  Benefits to environment will result from reducing pollution emissions (as a result of reduction of energy use and materials).  Reduced pollution may result in improved health and living-environment quality for those in the vicinity of the plants. Reduced pollution, particularly CO2, will also contribute to efforts to mitigate the effects of global warming. 
 
- Increasing Access to Finance for SMEs: 

This project will help expand SMEs access to critically-needed term finance for non-EE projects as well.  Leasing companies have traditionally been one of the key providers of term finance for SMEs, and this project will help make term finance available to more SMEs by working with an SME-focused leasing company.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The proposed project has the dual aim of expanding SMEs access to finance and promote energy efficiency among SMEs in Turkey.  The proposed project is a loan of up to $50 million equivalent to Yapi Kredi Finansal Kiralama A.O. (YKL or the company), one of IFCs longstanding partners in Turkey with extensive reach, especially in the SME market segment.  The proposed project is IFCs first significant initiative to help develop Turkeys nascent market for Energy Efficiency (EE).  The loan will finance the expansion of YKLs leasing portfolio to SMEs with a special focus on financing EE projects. 

In addition, the German development agency, Kreditanstalt f&#xFC;r Wiederaufbau (KfW), is also considering to finance up to EUR30 million for EE related subloans on similar terms and conditions to IFCs financing. In this respect, the proposed project is part of a broader partnership between IFC and KfW to support the development of EE finance through Financial Intermediaries (FIs) in Central and Eastern Europe.</narrative>
