   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Improving Efficiency and Competitiveness:  

The project will allow Soktas to upgrade its capital equipment and shift into higher value-added products, due to the increased competition in Soktas export markets, caused by the elimination of the quotas. The project is therefore expected to improve the overall competitiveness of the company and hence its financial sustainability.  The expansion of its operation in India will also allow it serve a rapidly growing new market, which is especially important after the eliminations of the import quotas in its traditional markets.

South-to-South Expansion:

The project will allow Soktas to set up an operation in India, which is in line with IFCs South-to-South strategy, and the sector strategy, which supports expansion of manufacturing capacities in cost competitive environments.  The investment in India will reduce the overall manufacturing cost of the group and improve its access to its traditional markets.

Employment:  

The project will create new jobs in Turkey and India, which will benefit the local economies of both countries. It will also provide additional direct employment with a multiplier effect along the supply chain.

Transfer of Technology and Know-How:  

The company will use the latest state of the art technology in the Indian plant, which will require significant training of the Indian work-force.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Soktas Tekstil Sanayi ve Ticaret Anonim Sirketi (Soktas or the company), an existing and valued IFC client, and a leading Turkish manufacturer of high-end yarn-dyed and piece-dyed shirting fabric, has approached IFC requesting support for its first investment in India.  The proposed project consists of a $83 million Greenfield investment to produce 14 million linear meters of shirting fabric annually in Kolhapur in the State of Maharashtra in Western India; the project is expected to be implemented in two phases and completed over a 5 years period.  The company has requested IFC to consider providing a long-term loan of up to $18.25 million and an equity participation of up to $2.5 million equivalent (representing approximately 10% of the share capital) in the Greenfield investment in India.  The company has also requested a long term corporate loan of up to $25 million to the existing operation in Turkey.  The corporate loan will be used:
