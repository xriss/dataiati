Location of project and Description of site    	  There are two project locations: Izmir and Eski&#xBA;ehir. The Izmir plant was established in 1973 in the outskirts of Izmir. The Eski&#xBA;ehir plant is a newer plant, established in 1996.    Description of Company and Purpose of Project    	Pinar S&#xFC;t Mam&#xFC;lleri Sanyii A.S., established in 1973, is the leading dairy company in Turkey and an existing IFC client. The company is undertaking a modernization and expansion project in order to remain competitive in a changing market. During the last three years, multinationals such as Nestle and Danone have entered the Turkish dairy market, introducing new products and technologies. SEK, the state-owned dairy company, was privatized in 1997 and other medium-sized da  iries like Suta&#xBA; and Kay S&#xFC;t have enlarged their product range.    The main purpose of the project is: (i) to increase capacity in products where the demand has been increasing steadily; (ii) to improve efficiencies and quality, and lower costs; and (iii) to introduce new products.    The proposed project includes investments in yogurt, butter, cheese, fresh fruit juice, UHT products, mayonnaise, and whey filtration product lines. In addition, the company intends to increase the capacity of its milk cooling tanks and the number of distribution vehicles    Environmental Category and Issues    	This is a category B project according to IFC&apos;&apos;s environmental review procedure. The following potential environmental, health and safety problems of this project were analyzed: air emissions and wastewater treatment; solid waste handling; hazardous materials handling; plant hygiene; and general worker health and safety.  Upgrading is being done within the existing dairies located at Izmir and Eskisehir. No new land is being acquired, and no environmentally-sensitive areas are affected by this project. The Izmir plant purchases steam and electricity from an outside utility, and has no air emissions. The Eskisehir plant uses a natural gas-fired boiler to produce steam, and stack emissions from the boiler will be within World Bank Group guidelines. Both dairies have wastewater treatment plants for process effluents, and both discharge to downstream treatment plants which provide further treatment, meeting World Bank Group guidelines.   The dairies meet international standards for hygiene and occupational health and safety. Training is provided to staff in first aid, hygiene and sanitation and good manufacturing practices. Both plants are fitted with adequate fire safety and response equipment, including alarm systems, extinguishers and hydrants.    The  is  from the InfoShop.
