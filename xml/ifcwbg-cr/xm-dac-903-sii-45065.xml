   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Founded in Costa Rica, Corporaci&#xF3;n Stein (Stein or the Company) is a private, family-owned pharmaceutical group focused on the development, manufacture and commercialization of high-specialty generics. It has operating subsidiaries in six countries and sales in more than 20 countries across LAC, including all countries in Central America. Stein has a manufacturing facility in Costa Rica focused on the production of generics. The Company is also engaged in the commercialization of a diversified high-specialty portfolio that includes biosimilars, innovative products, and orphan drugs licensed from global pharmaceutical companies. The Company is focused on the institutional market with over 90% of revenues coming from the public sector.  The proposed IFCs financing aims to support Steins growth plan in LAC which includes expansion in the biosimilar, innovative, and orphan drugs segments through new licensing agreements and inorganic growth.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Patients: Increased
effectiveness of both the prevention and treatment of diseases. Biopharma drugs
are particularly effective with late-stage, difficult to treat, chronic
diseases such as cancer, diabetes, and hepatitis C, and immunological
disorders. Biologics are better than existing chemical alternatives because
they have higher efficacy outcomes and are more specific in targeting and
hence, have fewer side effects.&#xA0;   

 The Project responds to the gap
through investing in a Company with capacity to bring biosimilars to developing
countries where there is a low penetration of biologicals due to the high cost
of innovative products and lack of interest of biosimilars producers to go to
these markets.    

 &#xA0;   

 Competitiveness: Major
multinational pharma companies, which were once considered traditional pharma
companies, are now shifting into biotech on an unprecedented scale. However,
most low- and middle-income countries lack access to biopharma products, and at
the same time, face increasingly higher drug costs. Introduction of biosimilars
has helped reduce drug costs (ranging from 30% to 75%) and increase access to
treatment in several countries in Europe and EMs. Stein is planning to be one
of the first companies to introduce biosimilars upon patent expiration in a
number of therapeutic areas over the life of project, with a price discount to
the innovator in the range of 50-60%.</narrative>
