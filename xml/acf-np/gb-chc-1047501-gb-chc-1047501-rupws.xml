   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Following the two devastating earthquake in Nepal in 2015, Action Against Hunger started it&#x2019;s interventions in Nuwakot and Rasuwa districts. ACF&#x2019;s strategy on WASH was to meet the reconstruction needs in these districts to ensure that the poorest and most affected households (including nutritional vulnerability) are not left behind and have access to basic water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) facilities. ACF&#x2019;s approach is to bring in long term positive change in remote communities, with WASH reconstruction activities which further contribute towards reduction in undernutrition. During the first phase of implementation we supported more than 20,000 beneficiaries through 26 Community water supply schemes, 14 remote Schools, 5 Health facilities, 2 IDP camps &amp; 1 resettlement area. The second phase of this project will further cover around 20,000 beneficiaries in the same districts, through construction of 15 community water supply schemes and WASH facilities in 10 remote schools covering most vulnerable areas.</narrative>
