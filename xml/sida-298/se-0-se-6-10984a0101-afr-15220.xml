   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Joint Financing Arrangement for support to staff costs at the AU Peace and Security Department during 2018.

This is a program support to the AU Commission&apos;s Salary fund for the Peace and Security Department (PSD). The overall objective is to &quot;contribute to the full operationalisation of the the African Peace and Security Architecture (APSA) to achieve peace and stability on the African continent&quot;. It consists of funding through a Joint Financing Arrangement, towards salaries of 175 short-term staff to provide expertise in the implementation of the APSA in 2018. The Swedish contribution represents some 8% of the total budget of the JFA. 

Expected outputs relate to 1) Conflict prevention (such as improved accuracy of regional/sub-regional tools for early warning etc.), 2) Crisis/conflict management (such as operationalising the AUC/PSD Mediation Support Unit), 3) Post-conflict Reconstruction and Development (e.g. support AU/Regional Economic Commissions in SSR and DDR processes), 4) Strategic Security Issues (e.g. increased coordination and cooperation on transnational crime) and 5) Partnership and coordination (e.g. enhanced cooperation, policy and political dialogue between AU and RECs/RMs within the APSA framework).</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">This contribution represents the third and final phase of Swedish support to the &quot;Joint Financing Arrangement for the Support to AUC personnel implementing the Peace and Security Programme&quot;. Support was initiated in 2010, with the purpose of strengthening the institutional capacity of the AU in the field of peace and security on the continent by providing short-term staff/experts for the realization of the APSA and in line with the five overall objectives outlined above. The previous phase was aligned with the AU Strategic Plan 2013-2017 (contribution no.51000055; UF2013/76338, &quot;AUC JFA Salaries 2013-2017&quot;), but partners and PSD had started discussing already in March 2017, a cost-extension of this JFA to allow for ample time to elaborate a new JFA to be aligned with the expected new AU strategy. Discussions for this extension continued throughout 2017 and in the beginning of 2018 when the new results framework and amendments to JFA text were finalized. This is just a one-year contribution, as SNAO had reviewed the previous support during a mission to the embassy in November 2017, and recommended that a new assessment be made, even though this one-year support is tied to an extension of an existing JFA.&#xA0;
During 2018 and onwards, the programme management team (PMT) became fully staffed. This improved dialogue and contacts between PSD and partners (EU-AU took over from Sweden as lead partner from Aug 2017 to end of 2018, NL took over this role as of Jan. 2019). PSD is also the sole department at AUC with a detached/own finance unit. For funding to other AUC Departments, international partners are supposed to refer to focal points at the Strategic Planning, Policy, Monitoring &amp; Evaluatoin, Resource Mobilization (SPPMERM) department - but these staff are less aware of programming details, and the undersigned PM has appreciated rather dealing with designated PM:s at PSD.&#xA0;
The joint narrative report for 2018 had improved slightly from previous years, and reported on a number of good initiatives and activities under the five overall objectives. However, results reporting on outcome level can still improve. The &quot;conclusions section&quot; of the report is only one page and could further analyse and report at the outcome level. For specific results reported, see the Statement on joint narrative report.&#xA0;
The financial reports were submitted more or less on time and in accordance with the JFA conditions, with an internally audited report received with delay in July 2019.
The external audit by PwC was done on a semi-annual basis, first for the period Jan-June 2018, that took some time to be finalized (by PwC) and was not received until 22 March 2019; the audit for July-December 2018 received on 17 Sept. 2019. This delay in sending reports and notably in procuring/finalizing audits has unfortunately been recurrent for the JFA:s in support of PSD, and sometimes led to with-holding of (a part of agreed) Swedish funding, as disbursements are made dependent on submission and approval of audit for previous year&apos;s funds. The PwC audit noted that there were outstanding committments (insurance premium for staff), but these are eligible under the JFA as they were incurred during the year 2018. The audit also noted the delay in sending internally audited report. Finally, the JFA was agreed in order to pay salaries of 172 staff, but only 147 positions were filled, with 25 under recruitment. However, the Commission had decided to freeze recruitment pending on-gonig AU reform process, and any recruitment was done on a case by case basis.&#xA0;
Donor coordination as well as cooperation with the AUC in 2018 focussed to some extent on taking stock of previous support and planning ahead for new funding mechanisms and channels.&#xA0;In 2018, a mapping was done by a consultancy firm of all EU members&apos; support to AUC (procured by the EU) during the AU Strategic Plan&#xA0; period of 2013-2017 and resulted in an web page where all donors could access the extensive data gathered. (Internal estimates by the EU-AU Delegation came to the conclusion that the EU and EUMS together contributed some 75-80% of the total of AUC funding, an impressive sum.)
During the total of nine years of Swedish contributions to this fund, some topics have been recurrent over time and discussed in SC meetings, but tend to be &quot;forgotten&quot; and dropped as time passes, when the lead partner changes or international staff/focal points leave their posts. For the Salary Fund, previous points of discussion include the fairly high salary levels (that are transparently displayed in the salary lists for supported personnel, produced for reporting), the high levels of per diem, the fact that AUC staff almost always travel business class (partners have clearly expressed that their funding may not go towards funding business class tickets). During 2017, IP:s had clearly expressed the target to not fund GS staff (mailrunners etc.) and no junior SM nor P5 posts, to avoid contributing to a top heavy organization - but to only fund P3 ad P4-posts as the objective of the JFA was to strengthen technical capacity at the PSD. This request was being implemented in 2018. Equally the programme manager asked for gender disaggregated data and narrative reporting, and that salary lists include a column with M/F.&#xA0; IP:s asked in SC meeting in 2018 for a copy of the HR handbook, PSD PMT claimed this was available for partners, but we did not receive a copy.&#xA0;
It is interesting to note the &quot;administrative circular&quot; of 26 February 2014 addressed to all staff members of the AU, by then Chairperson of AUC Mme Zuma (attached as annex 1) regarding per diem levels (&quot;Daily Subsistence Allowance&quot;/DSA), indicating that as &quot;an exceptional measure&quot; these would henceforth until a new decision,&#xA0; amount to UN per diem rates - implying that these were lower than the AU rates, which we do not have access to, today.&#xA0;
However, international partners do receive salary lists of the positions funded including grades, steps, and names of incumbent. The undersigned therefore attempted to compare salary levels between the AUC and the UN, at the professional (P) level. In a conversation with AUC/PSD programme manager for the JFA for AULO:s, it emerged that the gross salary listed in the staff lists submitted to JFA partners, are the same sums/net salaries received by staff in their accounts. There is no &quot;post adjustment&quot; (depending on duty station/posting) as in the UN. However, unlike in the UN, staff do not pay internal fees nor taxes (and; for staff on fixed term contracts, there are presumably also additional benefits such as housing/school allowance, pension payments, separation payment for staff members leaving the organization etc.- these costs are not indicated per person in the salary lists but rather as outstanding committments in the financial reports). When comparing the salary level of a P2 step 5 at PSD in Addis Abebe, to that of a UN equivalent (P2 step 5 staff member on a fixed term contract) - the AU staff member seemingly makes about 1 300 USD more than the UN counterpart, and both are paid in US dollars (data from international civil service commission, ICSC Salary calcuator - calculation attached as annex 2). It is possible that the levels/package are similar, however, the AUC staff appear to have better conditions than UN staff - which appears as quite remarkable for an organisation that is not actually funded by its Members States but primarily from &quot;donors&quot; i.e. international partners.&#xA0;
In addition, in 2018, a couple of different consultancy reviews were carried out (commissioned by GiZ) for AUC respresentatives and international partners of the previous JFA:s, in view of elaborating a forthcoming funding mechanism of support for AUC. Findings were presented i.a. in a work shop with presentation/discussion in late 2018; with recommendations that included i.a. the AUC should be in the &quot;driver&apos;s seat&quot; and that the AUC should refuse funding through bilateral channels/if potential partners did not sign up to JFA:s, as the multitude of agreements/partnerships carry significant transaction costs and cause delays, and are contrary to aid effectiveness principles.&#xA0;
Work on developing a new funding mechanism was ongoing in 2018, but turned out to be prolonged and continued in 2019, with the aim of ensuring an inclusive process as well as an agreement and mechanism that would provide a good basis for both AUC and international partners to be able to support AU&apos;s &quot;Medium-Term Plan 2018-2023&#x201D; in the best way. For PSD, support should in addition aim at realizing the APSA Road Map (by 2020).</narrative>
