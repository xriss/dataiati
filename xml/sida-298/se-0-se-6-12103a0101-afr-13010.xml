   <narrative xml:lang="SV">Insatsen avser st&#xF6;d till African Population and Health Research Center (APHRC) f&#xF6;r insatsen &quot;Understanding the context of, and addressing sensitive sexual and reproductive health and rights issues in sub-Saharan Africa&#x201D; 2018-2022.

Insatsen fokuserar p&#xE5; de mest omtvistade delarna av SRHR-agendan, s&#xE4;rskilt r&#xE4;tten och tillg&#xE5;ng till s&#xE4;ker och laglig abort, ungdomars tillg&#xE5;ng till SRHR-interventioner, inklusive sexualupplysning, och m&#xE4;nskliga r&#xE4;ttigheter inklusive, yttrandefrihet och f&#xF6;reningsfrihet, samt tillg&#xE5;ng till sexuella och reproduktiva och andra h&#xE4;lsotj&#xE4;nster f&#xF6;r hbtqi-personer. Dessa tre delar av SRHR-agendan &#xE4;r mest eftersatta och m&#xF6;ter st&#xF6;rst motst&#xE5;nd p&#xE5; kontinenten.  

M&#xE5;let med programmet &#xE4;r att generera och st&#xF6;dja anv&#xE4;ndningen av lokalt f&#xF6;rankrad forskning och evidens f&#xF6;r att f&#xF6;rb&#xE4;ttra inkorporering och genomf&#xF6;randen av globala och regionala SRHR-&#xE5;taganden i nationell lagstiftning, policy och riktlinjer f&#xF6;r att p&#xE5; s&#xE5; vis &#xF6;ka tillg&#xE5;ng till s&#xE4;ker abort f&#xF6;r kvinnor, &#xF6;ka tillg&#xE5;ng till SRHR-interventioner f&#xF6;r ungdomar och motverka social exkludering av hbtqi-personer. 

Programmet f&#xF6;rv&#xE4;ntats bidrag till f&#xF6;ljande &#xF6;vergripande resultat:

&#x2022;	Regionalt och lokalt genererad policyrelevant forskning och evidens som kan ligga till grund f&#xF6;r st&#xE4;rkt beslutsfattande, resursf&#xF6;rdelning och implementering av policy och program f&#xF6;r SRHR, som n&#xE5;r alla populationer oavsett &#xE5;lder, k&#xF6;n, sexuell l&#xE4;ggning eller k&#xF6;nsidentitet. 

&#x2022;	Att kunskap och forskning i h&#xF6;gre grad anv&#xE4;nds som ett verktyg f&#xF6;r att p&#xE5;verka och informera beslut som leder till b&#xE4;ttre politik, smartare resursf&#xF6;rdelning, som m&#xF6;jligg&#xF6;r skalbara och replikerbara SRHR-l&#xF6;sningar f&#xF6;r f&#xF6;rb&#xE4;ttrad h&#xE4;lsa och v&#xE4;lbefinnande f&#xF6;r ungdomar och kvinnor som s&#xF6;ker aborttj&#xE4;nster samt hbtqi-personer. 

&#x2022;	Afrikanska institutionerna &#xE4;r b&#xE4;ttre p&#xE5; att generera, tolka och anv&#xE4;nda forskning och kan d&#xE4;rmed uppn&#xE5; st&#xF6;rre p&#xE5;verkan i politiska processer, implementering och ansvarsutkr&#xE4;vande kring SRHR &#xE5;taganden.  

Det f&#xF6;reslagna programmet integrerar tre kompletterande tillv&#xE4;gag&#xE5;ngss&#xE4;tt:

1) Policyorienterad forskning och kunskapssammanst&#xE4;llning i sju l&#xE4;nder samt p&#xE5; regional niv&#xE5;;
2) Gemensamma p&#xE5;verkansinsatser med nya och befintliga n&#xE4;tverk; 
3) Kapacitetsst&#xE4;rkande f&#xF6;r &#xF6;kad anv&#xE4;ndning och uttolkning av forskning och evidens inklusive evidens om p&#xE5;verkansinsatser f&#xF6;r att uppn&#xE5; f&#xF6;r&#xE4;ndring i lag, policy och praktik. 

Det regionala arbetet kommer att bidra till synergieffekter med befintliga insatser i det regional SRHR-teamets portf&#xF6;lj f&#xF6;r att st&#xE4;rka &#xE5;taganden, implementering och ansvarsutkr&#xE4;vande f&#xF6;r SRHR &#xE5;taganden inom de regionala ekonomiska gemenskaperna SADC i s&#xF6;dra Afrika, EAC i &#xF6;stra Afrika och kommer &#xE4;ven att utforska kontaktytor med den ekonomiska gemenskapen f&#xF6;r V&#xE4;stafrika (ECOWAS). 

APHRC kommer &#xE4;ven att implementera programmet i Burkina Faso, Kenya, Liberia, Malawi, Rwanda, Sierra Leone och Zambia. 

Insatsen innefattar ocks&#xE5; ett samarbete mellan APHRC och Guttmacher Institute, f&#xF6;r att f&#xF6;lja upp rekommendationerna fr&#xE5;n den nyligen publicerade Guttmacher-Lancet kommissionen om sexuell och reproduktiv h&#xE4;lsa och r&#xE4;ttigheter, med fokus p&#xE5; integrering av SRHR-insatser inom ramen f&#xF6;r allm&#xE4;n h&#xE4;lso- och sjukv&#xE5;rd (p&#xE5; engelska kallat universal health coverage eller UHC). 

Slutligen inkluderas &#xE4;ven en komponent f&#xF6;r att st&#xE4;rka APHRC egen kapacitet f&#xF6;r strategisk planering av policy- och p&#xE5;verkansinsatser samt uppf&#xF6;ljning och utv&#xE4;rdering av den samma. Kunskapen och kapaciteten kommer sedan anv&#xE4;ndas f&#xF6;r att st&#xE4;rka det regionala SRHR-teamets egen expertis och &#xE4;ven p&#xE5;verkanspartners f&#xF6;rm&#xE5;ga vad g&#xE4;ller ovan n&#xE4;mnda kompetenser.  

Insatsen bidrar &#xE4;ven till synergier med Sida/FORK:s st&#xF6;d till APHRC f&#xF6;r att bygga forskningskompetens, synergier till FORSK:s bilaterala st&#xF6;d i Rwanda, samt synergier till Global Socials st&#xF6;d till Guttmacher Institute enligt ovan. 

F&#xF6;r att s&#xE4;kerst&#xE4;lla att programmet relaterar till den nuvarande kontexten och att forskningsprioriteringarna styrs av tydliga strategiska m&#xE5;l, prioriterade b&#xE5;de baserat p&#xE5; analys av vilken kunskap och evidens som saknas och utifr&#xE5;n en policyrelevansbed&#xF6;mning, kommer insatsen att vidareutvecklas i en designfas d&#xE4;r insatsens m&#xE5;lgrupper deltar. Designfasen ber&#xE4;knas ta sex m&#xE5;naderna efter vilken ett uppdaterat resultatramverk, en detaljerad arbetsplan och utv&#xE4;rderingsramverk kommer att levereras och godk&#xE4;nnas.</narrative>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The contribution aims to support APHRC&#x2019;s programme titled &#x201C;Understanding the context of, and addressing sensitive sexual and reproductive health and rights issues in sub-Saharan Africa&#x201D; 2018-2022.

The contribution aims to address one of the slowest areas of progress in sub-Sarhan Africa,  namely tackling the most sensitive parts of the sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR) issues, particularly the right and access to safe and legal abortion, young people&#x2019;s access to SRHR interventions, including comprehensive sexuality education, and the human rights and freedom of expression and association, and access to sexual and reproductive and other health services among LGBTI people. These are the three &#x201C;most left behind&#x201D; SRHR agendas.

The overarching goal of the programme is to generate and support the use of evidence to drive change and improve domestication and implementation of policies at national and regional levels that increase access to safe abortion for women and SRHR interventions for adolescents, and mitigate exclusion of sexual minorities.
The programme aims to deliver the following three results: 

&#x2022;	Impact 1: An African-generated corpus of evidence is at the basis of policymaking, resource allocation and translation of policy into best practice in SRHR, reaching all populations regardless of age, sex or sexual or gender identity.
&#x2022;	Impact 2: Evidence is used as a tool to influence and inform decisions that ultimately result in better policy, smarter resource allocation, scale and replication of best practice in order to improve health and wellbeing outcomes for youth, women seeking abortion services and LGBTI people.
&#x2022;	Impact 3: African institutions (researcher, decision-making and CSO-institutions) are better generators, interpreters and users of research and are using those skills to achieve greater impact in policy deliberations and execution of better practices

The proposed programme integrates three complementary approaches for maximum impact:

1.	policy-oriented evidence generation
2.	collaborative advocacy with new and existing networks
3.	capacity strengthening in the use of evidence to achieve change at both the policy and practice levels.

The regional work will harness synergies with existing Sida-supported programming at the level of the Southern African Development Community, East African Community and explore entry-points to the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) in order to meet identified evidence needs for improved policy formulation, implementation and resourcing within those economic blocs. It will also explore how evidence can support the domestication and implementation of global and regional policy instruments.

At national level, APHRC will implement the program in Burkina Faso, Kenya, Liberia, Malawi, Rwanda, Sierra Leone and Zambia &#x2013; countries  identified as presenting realistic opportunities to evolve the policy environment and enhance service delivery for liberal policymaking and implementation to reach adolescents with targeted SRHR services; improve access to safe abortion; and minimize the barriers that prevent LGBTI people from accessing basic services for health, education, livelihoods and wellbeing. 

As a complementary adjunct to this objective, APHRC will collaborate with the Guttmacher Institute to develop an evidence-informed strategy to promote SRHR as a cornerstone of universal health coverage, using the $9 per person/year recommendation that emerged from the May 2018 report by the Guttmacher-Lancet Commission on Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights. This also links to the ongoing &quot;team Sweden&quot; policy initiative to integrate SRHR into the Universal Health Care agenda.

Internally, APHRC will strengthen its capacity in the monitoring and evaluation of advocacy &#x2013; both at the process level as well as at the impact level. Externally, APHRC will strengthen the capacity of a cohort of researchers through hands-on training in research methodologies such as evidence reviews, economic and financial modelling, knowledge translation and evidence-driven advocacy. The researchers will be identified from the seven selected countries and will work with APHRC staff to generate some of the evidence needed by policy actors in those countries.

APHRC will also strengthen the capacity of policy actors and civil society to analyze, synthesize, interpret and use evidence for policy development and advocacy.
To ensure that the programme is well situated in the current context, and to ensure that the research priorities are guided by clear strategic objectives, to enable prioritization both from a research gap and policy relevance point of view, the approach adopted to the implementation is through a co-creation process with an inception phase of the first six months by which an updated results-framework, detailed work plan and impact framework will be delivered.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The programme goal of the intervention is to generate and support the use of evidence to drive change and improve domestication and implementation of policies at national and regional levels that increase access to safe abortion for women and SRHR services for adolescents, and mitigate exclusion of sexual minorities.
The regional work will look to harness synergies with existing Sida-supported programming at the level of the SADC and the EAC, in order to meet identified evidence needs for improved policy formulation, implementation and resourcing within those economic blocs and how evidence can support the domestication and implementation of regional and global commitments.&#xA0;The programmewill also explore opportunities to engage ECOWAS.
As noted above, at national level APHRC will implement this program in Burkina Faso, Kenya, Liberia, Malawi, Rwanda, Sierra Leone and Zambia &#x2013; countries, identified as presenting realistic opportunities to evolve the policy environment and enhance service delivery for liberal policymaking and implementation to reach adolescents with targeted SRHR services; improve access to safe abortion; and minimize the barriers that prevent LGBTI people from accessing basic services for health, education, livelihoods and wellbeing.
The goal will be achieved through implementing three complementary approaches for maximum impact: policy-oriented evidence generation; collaborative advocacy with existing networks; and capacity strengthening in the use of evidence to achieve change at both the policy and practice levels. The three complementary approaches are articulated as three strategic objectives each with a corresponding impact result:
Impact 1: An African-generated corpus of evidence is at the basis of policymaking, resource allocation and translation of policy into best practice in SRHR, reaching all populations regardless of age, sex or sexual or gender identity.&#xA0;
Strategic Objective #1: By 2022, APHRC is a demonstrable leader in generating, consolidating, interpreting and sharing evidence to provide a solid foundation for improved domestication, implementation and resourcing of policy instruments that seek to overcome access barriers to contextual, appropriate and effective SRHR services to meet the needs of adolescents, sexual minorities and women seeking safe abortion services, within the context of national strategies to achieve universal health coverage.
Outcomes objective #1:
1. APHRC is go-to knowledge partner for decision-making bodies, development partners and civil society networks, meeting articulated evidence needs to achieve identified goals in enhancing delivery and increasing uptake of SRHR services2. Committed actors have a more comprehensive understanding of the bottlenecks and limitations in domesticating policy instruments to guide improved and equitable access to SRH services with a rights-based approach to their delivery
Generation of policy-oriented evidence - summary of activites: The overall objective of the research agenda is to provide a solid evidence-informed foundation for improved domestication, implementation and resourcing of policy instruments that seek to overcome access barriers to contextual, appropriate and effective SRH services to meet the needs of adolescents, sexual minorities and women seeking safe abortion services. A regional research agenda will be developed, co-created with a range of different partners at national and regional level, and informed by systematic reviews of published and grey literature.
Seven countries with a wide geographic, economic and political range (Kenya, Rwanda, Burkina Faso, Liberia, Sierra Leone, Malawi and Zambia) have been included in the programme for in-depth scoping and landscaping, to gauge the extent to which there was room to develop and drive an evidence-informed agenda to achieve change in policy and practice around each of the three issues of concern. Countries were selected based on a set criterion if they were considered to be at a tipping point: with ample civic space and possibility for political will to achieve tangible progress in ensuring access to SRH services for the populations in question within an enabling and rights-affirming environment.
The review identified countries where there is the potential to revise or rethink existing legislation to improve the protection of the rights of sexual minorities and to ensure access to quality SRH services including safe abortion &#x2013; but where there is divergence between the policy environment and actual practice.&#xA0;
Impact 2: Evidence is used as a tool to influence and inform decisions that ultimately result in better policy, smarter resource allocation, scale and replication of best practice in order to improve health and wellbeing outcomes for youth, women seeking abortion services and LGBTI people.
Strategic Objective #2: By 2022, APHRC has cultivated and nurtured alliances and partnerships with critical regional audiences and stakeholders including policymakers and implementers by engaging in existing communities of practice and networks, to contribute to the co-creation and sharing of relevant and timely evidence to inspire awareness, understand perceptions and foster social and legislative change to improve the health and wellbeing of young people, women seeking abortion services and sexual and gender minorities.
Outcomes objective #2:&#xA0;
1. APHRC is an integral partner within networks of change agents, sharing knowledge and technical assistance to translate that knowledge into policy recommendations at both the grassroots and policy development level2. Civil society networks are confident users of evidence as a lever of influence in their ongoing advocacy to drive change in policy and practice3. Decision-makers seek evidence-informed arguments to enhance their deliberation and provide a way forward for the execution of strategies to domesticate and better implement policies4. Stakeholders at the demand-generation and supply-provision levels can recommend how scalable solutions can be adopted or adapted to effectively respond to SRHR needs of women, adolescents and LGBTI people
Using evidence to advocate for change - summary of activites: APHRC will strategically cultivate and nurture partnerships with critical bodies including regional economic communities, implementers, professional unions and civil society organizations through the convening of, and participation in, communities of practice to co-create, share and use evidence to stimulate awareness, understand perceptions, and foster social and legislative change. This will include, but not be limited to, ensuring a rights-based approach to mitigate the exclusion of sexual minorities; and catalyzing commitments by governments to increased and sustained investment in provision of SRHR services that are contextual, targeted and responsive to the needs of adolescents, sexual minorities and women seeking safe abortion services.
Under this objective, APHRC will also develop a rapid-response mechanism for quickly providing information for use in policy-oriented discussions at both the regional and national level, for use by the key evidence users identified during the inception period. The rapid-response platform will allow for demand-driven evidence synthesis from existing, reputable databases of health and wellbeing indicators related to the three issues, packaged in a format that is easy to use.
As a complementary adjunct to this objective, APHRC will collaborate with the Guttmacher Institute to develop an evidence-informed strategy to promote SRHR as a cornerstone of universal health coverage, using the $9 per person/year recommendation that emerged from the May 2018 report by the Guttmacher-Lancet Commission on Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights. This also links to the ongoing &quot;team Sweden&quot; policy initiative to integrate SRHR into the Universal Health Care agenda.
Impact 3: African institutions (researcher, decision-making and CSO-institutions) are better generators, interpreters and users of research and are using those skills to achieve greater impact in policy deliberations and execution of better practices
Strategic Objective #3: To strengthen the capacity of academic institutions to carry out timely, policy-relevant and translatable research that can be used by a well-grounded network of civil society actors and decision-makers to achieve change in both policy and practice that improves health and wellbeing outcomes for youth, women seeking abortion services and sexual and gender minorities.
Outcomes objective #3:
1. The quality of research emerging from African institutions is of global standard and respected as a valuable contribution to the global corpus of evidence2. The comfort with which African decision-makers uses evidence prompts demand for more policy-relevant information for debate and discussion3. Civil society advocates predicate campaigns for change on a sound base of data, knowledge and evidence that can also demonstrate the consequences of inaction
Strengthening capacity to use evidence to achieve change - summary of activites: To strengthen the capacity of SRHR advocacy organizations and policy actors in sub-Saharan Africa to identify gaps that can lead to connecting evidence to action; document learning; catalyze change at the policy and resourcing level using evidence; and promote the adaptation or adoption of scalable solutions to effectively respond to SRHR needs of women, adolescents and LGBTI people. To deliver on this objective, the APHRC team will build both internal and external capacity.
Internally, APHRC will strengthen its capacity in the monitoring and evaluation of advocacy &#x2013; both at the process level as well as at the impact level. Externally, APHRC will strengthen the capacity of a cohort of researchers through hands-on training in research methodologies such as evidence reviews, economic and financial modelling, knowledge translation and evidence-driven advocacy. The researchers will be identified from the seven selected countries and will work with APHRC staff to generate some of the evidence needed by policy actors in those countries.
APHRC will also strengthen the capacity of policy actors and civil society to analyze, synthesize, interpret and use evidence for policy development and advocacy.</narrative>
