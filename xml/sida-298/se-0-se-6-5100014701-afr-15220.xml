    <narrative xml:lang="EN">FAS is a not-for-profit organization established in Switzerland in 1996. It received a total of SEK 15mn in Swedish funding during 2010-2012. The agreement under review was for the activity period 2013-2015 with an agreed total of SEK 15 mn for these three years, core funding, out of which 12.5 million were actually disbursed.
Norway and Finland had provided project funding for Great Lakes project focussing on supporting UNSC Resolution 1325. Norway and Finland financed a thorough audit for this project support via KPMG, concluded in August 2015, for the period 2011-2013. This was shared with Sweden. In discussion with Sida-S legal department, this was accepted as a systems audit, with findings that would apply to the Swedish contribution. Based on audits performed, Norway and Finland have re-claimed funds. In an e-mail from Norway in December 2017, information received that their claim remained; whereas Finland had converted their initial project funding to core funding, unclear whether this would improve FAS&apos; standing. No further up-dates have been received since. To note that the Norwegian Embassy in Addis Abeba has in the meantime decided to funds Mrs. Diop&apos;s (FAS chairperson/founder) current office (AU Special Envoy for WPS), presumably for political reasons (candidacy to UNSC).&#xA0;
The previous offices of FAS in New York and Geneva have been closed and the organisation today seems to exist more or less in name only, with an office in Dakar, represented by Mrs. Coumba Venn Fall (Mrs. Diop&apos;s daughter). In the meeting with two PM:s at Sida in December 2017, FAS (Diop/Awori) claimed to still carry out minor advocacy activities (GIMAC etc.). PM:s concluded from the meeting that the FAS representatives wanted to &quot;debrief&quot; and felt that they had been unfairly treated by donors, as FAS had indeed carried out the activities as planned.&#xA0;
Brief timeline of key actions in the case: &#xA0;
May 2015: Annual review meeting/check of FAS office conducted in Dakar. The business is assessed as not being up to standards.&#xA0;Letter to &#x201C;freeze&#x201D; the Swedish funding for the year, that had already been disbursed (2.5 million), until required reporting was sent and the precarious finanial situation showed improvement.
August 2015 FAS &apos;financial&apos; reporting by e-mail stated a balance of CHF 11&#xA0;596.
In 2015-2016 discussion was on-going for case management at the regional team that had taken over the case, including with legal and anti-corruption advisers at Sida Stockholm.&#xA0;
08.05.2017 Decision on re-payment of funds (2.5 million dibursed for 2015, for which no narrative/financial reporting nor audit had been provided, as per agreement - narrative report finally arrived in 2020).
27.06.2017 Letter for repayment of funds sent by DHL to FAS Geneva, no acknowledgement of receipt.
8 December 2017: Discussion with Sida-S legal department on way forward (e-mail in Swedish including a chronology of events up until that date), draft letter for re-newed request of repayment of SEK 2.5 mn. Shared by REG team. This process was put on hold following FAS request for meeting in Stockholm.
10 Dec. 2017: Request by FAS for meeting in Stockholm.
11 Dec. 2017: meeting with Sida-S Peace Unit PM:s. FAS representatives at Sida for discussion of case and way forward. Following this meeting, internal discussion whether it would be worthwhile to use one of Sida&apos;s call-off agreements for audits, to support FAS to carry out a belated audit to be able to fulfil the agreement condition. However, it was decided the cost/benefit for Sida did not warrant this support at a very late stage.&#xA0;
Jan. 2018 FAS (belated) e-mail request on a Saturday for meeting the following morning (a Sunday) in Addis; this meeting was declined by REG team - it also coincided with Ethiopian Timkat holiday.&#xA0;
Feb. 2019 : FAS (belated) e-mail request for meeting in Addis the following day, no follow-up from FAS on proposed times, FAS replied it would get back later and send reporting.
During this time, several internal discussions have been held at the REG team, and e-mails with FAS on how to proceed with the contribution.
11.06.2019 : Discussions with Sida-S Legal Department, concluding that claims for re-payment need to be repeated on an annual basis, as long as agreed reporting is not submitted (even if Sida knows that these letters for reclaiming funds will not be successful).
26.06.2019 Receipt of a basic audit for Sida 2015 funding.&#xA0;
09.07.2019 Discussion of case and the audit between HoS and PM : Noted that the ToR:s for the audit were not shared with Sida (as per agreement; however, concluded that against the backdrop of the KPMG audit and previous discussions with audit advisors at Sida-S (advising not to spend any more money on the case) the received audit is accepted for 2015.
Nonetheless, the final narrative report for 2015/Completion report was not received, which would be the minimum requirement to take the case forth for re-newed discussion with Sida Legal Department.
09.07.2019 E-mail to FAS requesting Completion report; followed by several reminders by e-mail.&#xA0;
2020.01.15 Narrative report for 2015 received. The report has been approved. The claim for repayment of funds relative to this missing report is thereby cancelled.&#xA0;
The relationship with FAS has been complicated, as documented in correspondence and CoP in the contribution. Given that the former chairperson/founder Mrs. Binta Diop became the AU Special Envoy on WPS, and that Sweden (REG team and FBA) have a mandate to support capacity building of the AU in this thematic area, relationships have been complicated to navigate. A &quot;FAS Board Delegation&quot; visited Scandinavia at the end of 2017. Dr. Thelma Awori/Mrs. Diop requested a meeting with then Foreign Minister Wallstr&#xF6;m during a visit to Stockholm, that was denied and she was refered to desk officers at MFA.&#xA0;
To conclude: the discussion during the latest meeting with FAS representatives at Sida-Stockholm in December 2017 seems to show that FAS did want to make good on their committments; and the fact that FAS/Coumba Fall Venn has belatedly submitted an audit in July 2019, and the narrative report for 2015 in January 2020, although resources are presumably gone, show this wish for closure.</narrative>
