   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The initiative is expected to achieve the main objective that regional organizations (ECOWAS, CILSS/AGRHYMET, Peri Peri U &amp; WASCAL, LCBC and AU) and national governments in the Sahel region have build capacities and have strengthened the operationalization of the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction and the SDGs DRR targets and indicators. This will be conducted by institutionalized and domesticated risk-informed development planning, programming and investment for resilience building. The geographical focus of the project will be Western Sahel (Mauritania, Mali, Senegal, Niger, Chad, Burkina Faso and Nigeria).This is expected to be achieved through 1) Increased capacity on tracking and monitoring progress on Sendai Framework and AU Program of Action implementation in the Sahel region through enhanced data collection, analysis and reporting system; 2) Strengthened regional and multi-country regulatory, policy and budgetary frameworks for translating disaster and climate data into risk informed development; 3) Enhanced regional recovery and resilience building processes that address underlying disaster and climate change risks and restore pathways to sustainable development in the Sahel Countries; 4) Enhanced Regional Capacities for Urban Risk Management in Sahel; and 5) Enhanced innovations and knowledge on risk informed development through Regional Dialogue and South-South exchange.During the inception phase of one year a validation workshop is planned with stakeholders in which a detailed work plan will be prepared for the inception phase (year 1). Moreover, several assessments and studies will be conducted based on which the project theory of change, Results framework and project priorities will be reviewed and a detailed work plan, budget and results framework will be prepared for the second year.</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">A workshop was conducted in Abuja , Nigeria during 29-30 October 2019.
The workshop was expected to deliver the following outputs:1. Enhanced understanding of all the partners involved in project implementation objectives and expected deliverables;2. Project management arrangements at country and regional level agreed upon;3. Project implementation modalities and procedures including planning, reporting, M&amp;E agreed upon; and4. Detailed 2019-2020 annual and quarterly project work plans for Q1 2019 and Q2 2020 drafted for the partners present at the workshop.
The workshop was attended by 19 participants. This included the representative from SIDA, representatives from the Project countries as well as those from the project partners &#x2013; AU, PERI PERI U, UN WOMEN, and CILSS /AGRYHMET Regional Centre.The Project Multi-Year Work Plan was revised to incorporate the inputs received from the project partners. The attendees agreed on that the workplan could still be work in progress as ECOWAS who did not participate in the deliberations may request for additional changes.&#xA0;
A focus of 2019 was to formalize the partnerships with the project Responsible Parties to facilitate implementation of project activities by them. Towards this objective, the partnership agreements with the African Union, ECOWAS, and UN WOMEN were drafted and shared for review and finalization. Status of the partnerships agreements as of August 2020 is:
African Union; Letter of Agreement between UNDP and AU was signed in June 2020. Based on AU request, UNDP is supporting AU in the implementation of the SFDRR assessment and recruitment of the Urban Risk Management expert.
ECOWAS: Signed Agreement from ECOWAS was received in August 2020 by UNDP and is currently under review by UNDP before being signed.HACT micro assessment of Department of Social and Gender Affairs in progress, coordinated by UNDP Nigeria Country Office.Based on ECOWAS request, UNDP is supporting ECOWAS in the recruitment of the Urban Risk Management and Disaster Recovery experts (advertised).
UN WOMEN:Agreement was signed in July and funds for the implementation of project activities in 2020 were transferred to UNWOMEN. Communication from UNDP was sent to ECOWAS Commissioner in August seeking ECOWAS support to UNWOMEN in the implementation of the project activities. Technical level meeting to be organized in September.
PERI PERI UAgreement is being reviewed by Stellenbosch University&#x2019;s legal department; Fund transfer will be initiated upon signing of the Agreement as HACT Assessment of Stellenbosch has already been carried out. Ongoing discussions with PERI PERI U on the project activities for 2020, including the capacity building initiatives for academia this year.
Lake Chad Basin CommissionThere is no separate Agreement with LCBC as the support will be provided through the UNDP supported Regional Stabilization Facility (RSF) of LCBC.Ongoing discussions since May to identify the activities in the RSF action plan that can allow the best use of the allocated funds in strengthening LCBC capacity in multi-risk information and analysis.
AGRHYMETA meeting was held with Director of AGRHYMET in early August 2020 to seek support in advancing the partnership. Technical discussion planned for September with the AGRHYMET focal point for the project to refine the planned project activities.
Two baseline studies will be finalised in 2020, namely, assessment of the implementation of Sendai Framework for DRR and Recovery. These assessments with regional and country-level analyses will contribute to the establishment of baseline on the status of DRR in the region and project countries, including refining the results framework with baseline information.
Project Manager Recruitment was completed in November 2019, however the duty station had to be changed from Abuja to Dakar until travel to Abuja is feasible.&#xA0;
Discussions have been held between UNDP and UNDRR technical experts in Africa, in line with the UNDP-UNDRR global commitment to jointly support countries in strengthening their DRR capacities. UNDP will continue to engage with and seek inputs from UNDRR experts on project activities related to Disaster Database, Sendai Framework Monitoring, DRR Strategies and Risk-sensitive budget reviews.
The Project will establish synergies with the World Bank Project on &#x201C;Building Disaster Resilience to Natural Hazards in Sub-Saharan African Regions, Countries and Communities: Formulation of Guidelines for Recovery Planning&#x201D;, implemented by UNDP, to support ECOWAS in systematic recovery/ reconstruction planning and implementation. UNDP-Project Team will continue to participate in the joint World Bank-UNDP-ECOWAS DRR unit consultations and provide feedback on key documents to ensure that Sahel Resilience Project activities in recovery preparedness are complementary to the World Bank project activities.</narrative>
