   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The long-term impact objective is: More credible electoral and democratic political processes in Africa
Programme outcome objective: Stronger and more effective democratic institutions with greater citizen participation at sub-regional and continental levels and in selected African countries
EISA will work toward these goals by providing technical support to Regional Economic Communities in Africa to strengthen their engagement in member states&apos; electoral processes and by conducting training in election-related issues to political parties. In addition, EISA works on national level - in Madagascar, Senegal and other countries based on needs and opportunities - to strengthen parliaments and to foster inclusive democratic culture, policy and practice.</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">During 2020 EISA conducted two International Election Observation Missions - to Tanzania (with funding from the program) and to C&#xF4;te d&apos;Ivoire (with US funding) - constituting the only independent&#xA0;international observer groups. Specific reports are annexed to the report. EISA experienced that while their quite critical messages and assessments were received with scepticism, they felt that them being an African organisation helped to be considered to provide constructive feedback, in good faith. They also experienced their added value in support of local observation groups. Citizen observation groups need to be linked up with international observer groups for synergies, learning, and moral support.&#xA0;
Beside these missions, EISA highlights support to ECCAS (Economic Community of Central African States) as a success story from 2020. EISA was supporting ECCAS in drafting and advocating for a policy framework for electoral processes in the region, building commitment from ECCAS towards increasing transparency and credibility of electoral processes.&#xA0;
Outcome 1: Capacity of continental and sub-regional institutions to assess or support elections enhanced&#xA0;
&quot;Partly behind schedule&quot;
Reporting per REC is focusing on activities, in line with the work plan. Some activities were pushed to 2021. This shows that even with the revised work plan for 2020, EISA was over-estimating the feasibility&#xA0;of the program to a certain extent. Neither EAC, ICGLR nor ECOWAS did&#xA0; prioritise development of methodology and knowledge products with EISA&apos;s support and election assessment several missions were cancelled due to lack or funding (at REC level) and risks posed by the COVID-19 context.&#xA0;
EISA faces challenges when depending on REC demand and planning. As for other institutions, funds were reallocated to COVID-19-related activities, resulting in cancellation of activities that EISA were prepared and resourced to support. EISA is considering to mitigate risks for ending up seeing planned activities cancelled in the future, by budgeting for some of the joint activities at EISA level. A &quot;mixed&quot; approach will be applied, to secure ownership at REC level.&#xA0;
In addition to the EISA EOMs to Tanzania and CdI, an Election Follow-up Mission was conducted to Tunisia in December 2020 to present findings and recommendations from the Election observation final report to the electoral commission, CSOs, and political parties.&#xA0;
Outcome 2: Capacity of key national stakeholders to play a constructive role in electoral processes and systems strengthened&#xA0;
&quot;On track&quot;
EISA report on training of poll watchers in C&#xF4;te d&apos;Ivoire (CdI), although opposition candidates were boycotting the presidential elections, and only the ruling party coalition participated (42 delegates). Consultative meetings with political parties in CdI were cancelled. Work on electoral justice was initiated by development of training content, to be piloted in two countries.&#xA0; The electoral justice work was delayed. The two pilot countries are yet to be defined.&#xA0;
Outcome 3: Capacity of legislatures to be effective and responsive strengthened
&quot;On track&quot;
This outcome is implemented in Madagascar. EISA reports training for parliamentary staff and on examination and analysis of the budget bill, and training for female MPs on bill drafting, resulting in two draft bills and one motion (passed by the National Assembly). While the report mainly reflects activities, for this outcome EISA reports on the lesson learned of the importance of combining external and internal knowledge and expertise when planning and conducting trainings.&#xA0; &#xA0;
EISA and Friedrich Ebert Foundation have facilitated the publishing of the National Assembly Magazine, with the purpose to increase public interest and engagement in the Parliament&apos;s business.&#xA0;
Through social dialogues, gender equality has been debated by MPs, traditional leaders, civil society, judicial branches and local authority officials, leading to reflection on how to best approach sensitive issues such as women inheritance&#xA0;rights, where the social norms and political decisions are not harmonised. Televised debates on SGBV were also part of the gender equality work.&#xA0;
Outcome 4: Capacity of political parties to be more effective, democratic and inclusive of women and outh strengthened
&quot;Behind schedule&quot;
The planned gender audit intervention for political parties in Madagascar was moved to 2021.&#xA0;
The planned political party diversity tool was applied in workshops with parties in Botswana, but there is no mention of Senegal and Madagascar under this heading. It was confirmed in the meeting that Senegal had fallen out of the planning.&#xA0;
The mapping of political party types in Africa was commissioned and a report was to be finalized early 2021 (not yet finalized 210505).&#xA0;
Outcome&#xA0;5: Capacity of civil society to mobilise citizen participation in public affairs and influence reforms strengthened
&quot;Behind schedule&quot;
Activities postponed to 2021.&#xA0;
Outcome 6: EISA&#xA0;is a professional well-managed, innovative , and influential organisation
&quot;Largely on schedule&quot;
Under this heading EISA&#xA0;reports methodology development on EOM follow-up and on internet&#xA0;governance and democracy, participation in international events, mostly as a list of activities. The annual symposium was cancelled.</narrative>
