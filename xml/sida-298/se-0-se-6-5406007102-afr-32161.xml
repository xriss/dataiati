    <narrative xml:lang="EN">The AECF Post Conflict Window (PCW) Window funded&#xA0;Sida was launched in 2010 with an objective to stimulate the private sector to invest in agribusiness enterprises that have an impact on the rural areas of post conflict states. The PCW portfolio companies showed a marginal increase in performance in 2018 compared to previous years. The difficult security environment in Somaliland was made worse by a severe prolonged drought that affected several companies during the period. AECF successfully transitioned from an AGRA programme managed by KPMG to a fully independent development institution taking on active management of the portfolio and direct interaction with the investee companies and donors. The change in institutional structure forms the basis for a more programmatic approach to private sector development that will enable a greater focus on impact, inclusion and the development of sustained partnerships with policymakers and other actors in the development space. Total disbursements to PCW projects in the reporting period were US$ 1,044,142 with cumulative disbursements amounting to US$ 11,349,642 representing 96% of total funding. The balance of funds will be disbursed as the projects meet the conditions in their funding agreements. The development impact estimates for the portfolio included a total of 57,634 households receiving an average net benefit of US$ 368 (a number of tree crop projects are yet to report household impact numbers so this number may increase in future). Overall, PCW reached approximately 288,170 poor people with a total benefit of approximately US$ 86.8M in 2017. Most of this benefit was generated by projects in DRC, Sierra Leone, Somaliland and Liberia (in that order). This data comes from the 2017 annual report, and it is expected that similar or higher&#xA0;benefit results would translate for 2018. To further increase the development impact of the projects, AECF requested in December 2018 a no-cost agreement amendment for activities to conclude in June 2019. This was particularly needed due to&#xA0;the increasingly deteriorating security situation in Somalia which has seen a delay in implementation of some of the projects, affecting the rate of disbursement for one company (Habo Tuna Fish) which still has a pending disbursement of US$ 100,000 that will be carried over to 2019 after fulfillment of disbursement conditions and verification of progress. Activities related to this disbursement have already been implemented by the company. This will therefore be a re-imbursement.</narrative>
