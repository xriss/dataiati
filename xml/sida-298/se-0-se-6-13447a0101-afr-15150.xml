   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Program support to African Peer Review Mechanism - an independent body within the AU, conducting Reviews of governance on country level. The support aims to strengthen and revitalize the mechanism in line with their strategic plan, and particularly in areas such as gender and youth, Corporate management and country-level implementation. 

APRM has, thanks to the full integration into the AU during 2019, as well as a broadened mandate to include measurement of develoments in Africa in relation to the UN SDG and the AU Agenda 2063, renewed opportunities to be a vehicle for democratic governance in AU&apos;s all Member States. 

An agreement is signed for the first year. An extension is foreseen for 2021-2022 to cover the full programme period.</narrative>

   <description>
    <narrative xml:lang="EN">According to the draft narrative report for the full period of implementation 1 Jan 2020 to 31 March 2021, the following results have been achieved:&#xA0;
STRENGTHENING YOUTH PARTICIPATION:
The main objective was to undertake a study on youth engagement in APRM process to inform the development and adoption of the APRM youth policy.&#xA0; This project entailed procurement of consultancy services to develop a study on youth engagement in APRM process as well as youth reporting on governance issues.&#xA0;The APRM Youth Study Report and The APRM Youth Policy have been drafted and await validation and launch which will take place later in the year.&#xA0;
STRENGTHENING CSOS&#x2019; PARTICIPATION
The main objective of the project was to invigorate CSOs participation and engagement in APRM processes. &#xA0;The key strategy was to develop a Civil Society Handbook that could easily be used by non-state actors in understanding the APRM and finding their way in working the APRM at national, regional, and continental level.
The APRM organised a civil society workshop series under the theme &quot;Silencing the Guns and Positioning the APRM as an Early Warning Tool for Conflict Prevention&quot; in Abuja, Nigeria, on 24-25 February 2020. The APRM partnered with about 70 civil society representatives to evaluate ways to participate in the APRM process, as well as to evaluate ways in which the APRM as an early-warning tool for conflict prevention in Africa could be operationalised.&#xA0;
The key output under this intervention is the APRM CSO Handbook which will be validated and launched by APRM later in the year.&#xA0;
STRENGTHENING GENDER PARTICIPATION &#xA0; 
APRM has developed a gender mainstreaming framework based on recommendations made in the UNECA study titled &quot;Gender equality and the African Peer review Mechanism&quot; of 2016. The framework led to the formulation of activities that aim at integrating and adopting a gender equality approach throughout APRM structures and processes.
The APRM Gender Toolkit was developed with&#xA0;guidelines for the administration of the questionnaire in review processes, and a proposal on how to mainstream gender indicators in the main APRM questionnaire.&#xA0;
The APRM Gender mainstreaming Guidelines were developed to be applicable to all APRM structures, processes, activities, and stakeholders. The Gender Mainstreaming Guidelines aims at providing APRM stakeholders (Member states, CSOs, media, partners, etc&#x2026;) steps and tools to integrate gender at all levels. Training and sensitisation has also been conducted.&#xA0;
A study on Governance, Gender and Peacebuilding in North Africa was conducted to complement previous similar studies in other African regions.&#xA0;
A Manual of Best Practiceswas was drafted to&#xA0;to synthesise and document the lessons learnt and good practices in the APRM Participating States, particularly in countries that have been reviewed. The manual will suggest how countries can close the gender gap by adopting the identified best practices. Validation and training is pending.
&#xA0;
AFRICA NETWORK ON CORPORATE GOVERNANCE OF STATE- OWNED ENTERPRISES (AFRICAN SOEs NETWORK)
The African SOEs Network has developed a report on the Size and Sectorial distribution of SOEs in Africa. The Study is completed and is awaiting member state validation.&#xA0; In addition, the Network has commissioned a study to develop an African Union Guidelines on Corporate Governance of State-Owned Enterprises. The network was unable to convene the 2nd annual Network meeting as it was initially envisioned. However, two webinars were conducted looking at topical matters related to post covid economic recovery.
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
The main objective of the project was the development of the African Guidance Note on Corporate Governance which will contribute towards the harmonization and greater enhancement of coherence of corporate governance practices on the continent, ensuring a better coordinated and seamless application of governance standards by the private sector regardless of the jurisdiction it operates within the AfCFTA. This is a fundamental aspect towards the success of the AfCFTA.
APRM procured consultancy services to consolidate guidelines for APRM experts and member states working group exercise. A virtual expert validation meeting was conducted from the 25th - 26th November 2020, which was attended by more than 50 experts in their fields in order to review the AU Guidance Note on Corporate Governance document and provide additional inputs and recommendations to ensure that it addresses African challenges and provides home-grown solutions while maintaining global standards.
DEEPENING THE REVIEW Enhancement of the APRM electronic questionnaire and piloting in member states
This enhancement project was necessitated as the technology utilised in the initial development in 2016 is outdated and APRM needed to get the tool enhanced to benefit from the additional functionality that the new technologies offer.&#xA0;Customisation and enhancement of the electronic tool based on interaction with various role players and specific expectations from countries; Expand on reporting requirements by scoping and developing additional functionality and reports through interaction and country specific requests; Support the ARPM during country visits to ensure the electronic tool fulfils the expectations of each country.
The enhancements of the electronic questionnaire tool were completed in accordance with the requirements of the TOR and delivered to the APRM during the month of March 2021. The enhancements were done in collaboration with the APRM project team and all functionality, existing and new, were demonstrated to the APRM project team for verification and as a result a number of suggestions in terms of additional functionality was proposed and incorporated into the tool. Training on the use of the tool was done as part of the handover. The functionality was also tested through developing a number of questionnaires that were piloted to test the enhanced tool. The project was completed and signed off by the APRM.
AFRICAN UNION GOVERNANCE CAMPUS (AUGC)
The African Union Governance Campus is a set of governance development training programmes that is being developed by the African Peer Review Mechanism (APRM), in collaboration with the Pan African University (PAU).
The Objectives of the AU Governance Campus are: a) To deliver multi-inter-transdisciplinary academic and executive programs on governance in Africa.b) To enhance multi-inter-transdisciplinary research on governance across Africa.
An Inception Report is issued with draft curricula,&#xA0;based upon desktop research, practical curriculum development experience, towards addressing the higher education sector need for academic and training programmes about multi-level governance on the African continent. An online mailing platform for correspondences with partner institutions regarding the AUGC is developed; as well as a database of over 137 Institutions including Universities, Schools of Governance, Schools of Government, Think Tanks and Technical Research Institutions to form a continental network of governance institutions to be engaged further on the development and implementation of the AUGC.
TARGETED REVIEWS
The theme for Review is based on cross-cutting issues, areas of possible conflicts and/or crisis, on issues that emerge during the Base Review or the AU Annual Theme of the year.&#xA0;
A Targeted Review Field Mission &#x201C;Health Governance and Covid-19 Response in the Republic of Sierra Leone&#x201D; was carried out.&#xA0;The Sierra Leon Targeted Review report was Peer-reviewed at the Forum of Heads of State and Government in March 2021
In addition, funds were used for printing of the Namibia Targeted Review Report, the Key-highlights on Youth Unemployment - in French and English.&#xA0;
In addition the Sudan Gap Analysis was conducted, and will be reflected in the final version of the narrative report.&#xA0;
AFRICA GOVERNANCE REPORT (AGR) 2021
The primary purpose of the AGR is to provide relevant, accurate and informative assessments and reports on selected and key governance areas in all the 55 Member States of the AU. Based on expert research and analysis, the AGR aims to present evidence-based, objective, and balanced reviews on the state of African governance, towards attaining long-term political, social and economic stability and development on the continent. The Report highlights best practices in governance for peer sharing, Identifies governance constraints and challenges; and, Makes recommendations for take-up and enhanced governance by AU member states.
The AGR 2021 is the second iteration of the Report, following the first AGR 2019 on the theme Promoting African Union Shared Values.
The main objective of the AGR 2021 is to present a set of scenarios depicting plausible African governance futures in the year 2063. The aim is to highlight a range of decision-making options for achieving the AU Agenda 2063 and the UNSDGs 2030, as well as specify policy and action intervention points for strategic implementation of the AGR 2019 recommendations.
The key output and result achieved is The Draft AGR 2021 Report which is yet to be adopted by the Heads of State during the Heads of State summit planned to take place later in 2021.</narrative>
