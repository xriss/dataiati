   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This is the the third phase of a support to regional electricity trading in the SADC region, that started alreay in 2003 (by Norway). Sweden has supported phase II (2008-2012) and three (2012-2021) with 12 and 20 million SEK respectively. Norways contribution has been 76 million NOK (phase I - 35, phase II - 23, phase III - 18). The third phase was in practice terminated in 2015 (which was the intended closing year from the beginning), but has stayed opened as there has been funds left in the agreement and Norway have choosen to keep it open. In practive, program activities were from 2016 taken over by the World Bank driven AREP program, which only was supported by Sida until beginning of 2021 when Norway rejoined.
The overall objective of the phase III support from Norway and Sweden program was to &quot;assist the SAPP in providing least cost environmentally friendly affordable energy and increased accessibility to electricity in Southern Africa&quot;. The development objective of the program was to &quot;implement an efficient regional electricity spot market in the SADC region that is least cost, and provides environmentally friendly, affordable, efficient energy, and is sustainable in the future&quot;.</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">A summary of the main program achievements documented by the end review were:
1. Establishment, development, and operationalization of the power trading markets
- The development of SAPP&#x2019;s own Market Trading Platform has resulted in a significant operational cost reduction and allowed the opportunity for additional markets to be added. The four operational markets on the platform are: i)&#xA0;The Day-Ahead Market (DAM) ii) The Forward Physical Market &#x2013; Monthly (FPM) iii) The Forward Physical Market &#x2013; Weekly (FPW) iv) The Intra-Day Market (IDM).
- The End Review assess the establishment of these trading platforms as key success factors for SAPP, and that extension these trading platforms would benefit other regions.&#xA0;
2. Traded volumes
- The targeted share of power traded in SAPPs competitive market platforms have exceeded expectations. The original target was for the competitive market to reach a share above 5% by the end of 2015. SAPP has revised the target upwards. In 2019/20 the competitive market share compared to bilateral trades was 21% against a target of 30% and 32% was achieved in 2018/19 against a target of 25%.
- The End Review assess the increase in trading volumes testimony of the acceptance of the trading mechanisms and rules by SAPP members. Opportunity for anonymous trade with guaranteed payments which removes the risk of non-payment is considered particularly important.
3. Market sustainability
- The revenues generated from the SAPP competitive markets should be adequate to meet at least 100% of the SAPP Market trading platform costs by end of 2015.&#xA0; A total of USD 145.8 million was exchanged on the competitive markets in 2019/20 compared to USD 106.9 million recorded in 2018/19. USD 4.0 million was generated for SAPP through administration charges. This was enough to cover the costs of supporting and maintaining the SAPP market trading platform and also supporting SAPP budget.
- The End Review notes that trading volumes are largely driven by utility traders that trade via physical markets. It suggests as an improvement potential that the SAPP markets can be made significantly more efficient by giving financial traders access to the physical markets. Furthermore, the End Review recommend introduction of financial power trading products to stimulate participation in the financial and physical markets driving liquidity and efficiency to even higher levels.
- The End Review caution that the roles and responsibilities SAPP Coordination Center have grown considerably. With increased levels of trade together with the expanding reach of the SAPP markets, SAPP CC&#x2019;s multiple roles (as system operator, market operator, system planner, market surveillance, rule changer, risk manager, project advisory unit, etc.) can be problematic and, in some cases, could be perceived as creating conflicts of interest. The End Review therefore recommend that consideration should be given to clearly separating the market functions to ensure independence and fairness.
4. Implementation of priority regional generation and transmission projects
- The End Review notes a significant increase in effort from SAPP to mobilize investment for generation and transmission projects. Efforts include update of the SAPP Pool Plan (regional master plan), implementation of the Project Development Readiness Assessment methodology, and support to fast-track project preparation. Despite all these efforts, transmission projects are still not progressing fast enough or reaching financial close.</narrative>
