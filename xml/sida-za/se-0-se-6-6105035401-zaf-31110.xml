   <narrative xml:lang="EN">FAO Strategic framework
The contribution will support FAO, in implementing its Medium Term Plan 2018-21 and Programme of Work and Budget 2018-19 (C 2017/3). The strategic objectives of FAO are:
Strategic Objective 1: FAO&#x2019;s contribution to the sustainable eradication of hunger, food insecurity and malnutrition gives stronger attention to country capacity for effective implementation of policies, strategies and investment programmes. All forms of malnutrition are addressed, including undernourishment, micronutrient deficiencies and problems of overweight, obesity and diet-related non-communicable diseases. The SO-level indicators comprise five indicators of SDGs 2 and 3 to track progress on reducing food insecurity and malnutrition in all its forms, with one more SDG 2 indicator adopted at Outcome level, to monitor progress on level of government financing.
Strategic Objective 2: FAO will focus on building a stronger dialogue and integration within and across sectors and stakeholders to sustainably increase production and productivity, address climate change, biodiversity and environmental degradation in agriculture, forestry and fisheries in the context of nutrition and gender-sensitive food systems. Support to enhance countries&#x2019; capacities to adapt to the adverse impacts of climate change, and to develop or implement national adaptation plan for Nationally Determined Contributions is very prominent. The SO-level indicators comprise 12 indicators of SDGs 2, 6, 14 and 15 to track progress in sustainable productivity, environment degradation and climate change adaptation by sector, and genetic resources conservation. Four additional SDG indicators (SDGs 13, 14 and 15) are included at Outcome level to monitor progress on climate change adaptation and mitigation, implementation of international instruments for fisheries, and level of financing for sustainable use of ecosystems.
Strategic Objective 3: FAO&#x2019;s contribution to reducing rural poverty will focus on support to broad, multi-sectoral pro-poor policies and strategies at country and regional level that target the diverse spectrum of livelihoods. This requires broadening FAO&#x2019;s engagement beyond traditional partners in Ministries of Agriculture, as well as efforts to embed FAO&#x2019;s technical work within the processes of rural poverty reduction policies at country level. The SO-level indicators comprise nine indicators of SDGs 1, 2, 8, and 10 and the Outcome-level indicators include seven SDG indicators (SDGs 1, 5, 8 and 14) to measure poverty and access to productive resources, income and decent employment, and gender equality.
Strategic Objective 4: In contributing to the development of agricultural and food systems, FAO supports countries in increasing their inclusiveness of small-scale actors and more vulnerable groups, while at the same time continuing to take advantage of opportunities for efficiency gains. Focus will be on enhancing countries&#x2019; capacities to participate in the formulation of international standards and trade agreements, to design and implement supportive policies and regulations, and in the development of value chain. The SO-level indicators comprise four indicators of SDGs 2, 12 and 17, and Outcomes include seven SDG indicators (SDGs 2, 8, 9, 10 and 14), on financing and investments, loans or credit, exports subsidies, tariff lines applied to imports from developing countries and implementation of international instruments on illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing.
Strategic Objective 5: To reflect the recent global political commitments, FAO&#x2019;s contribution to increasing the resilience of agricultural livelihoods and responding to threats and crises gives focus to climate change and induced extreme weather events, risks to ecosystem health, food chain threats and One Health, and damage and losses, conflict prevention, peace and stability and displacements. SO-level indicators comprise nine indicators of SDGs 1, 2, 11, 13, 15 and 16, and Outcome indicators include five indicators of SDGs 1, 5, and 13.
Sida Supported Subcomponents
As stated the contribution will have four components: Flexible multi-partner mechanism (FMM), Small-scale fisheries (SSF), Boosting decent jobs for youth, and International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture (ITPGRFA)
All the cooperation areas are priorities of the organisation and well integrated in the results framework. All FAO activities at HQ or in the field, funded with&#xA0;voluntary or assessed contributions are classified supporting specific FAO strategic objectives and sub-objectives.
- Flexible multi-partner mechanism (FMM), previously called FAO Multipartner Programme Support Mechanism (FMM);
The most flexible, least earmarked&#xA0;FAO&#xA0;voluntary&#xA0;funding window where so far Netherlands, Belgium, Flanders and Switzerland have done contributions. This is the third generation of FMM and the previous phases have been duly evaluated, and the&#xA0;present FMM is much improved.
The purpose, scope and general principles underlying the FMM are now:&#xA0;a) support to the realization of FAO&#x2019;s Programme of Work, alignment with the Organization&#x2019;s priorities and focus on results; b) flexible funding; c) contribution to corporate reporting; d) promotion of capacity development, e) policy advice and partnership; f) support to country level activities fully aligned with UNDAF and/or CPF; and g) fostering catalytic effect, innovation and transformative impact.
The programmes and sub programmes given priority were identified through the business development process, giving consideration to resource partners&#x2019; indicative priorities, and priorities that FAO considers to be important to achieving the SDGs and its Medium-Term Plan (2018-21). These six areas are as follows: 1. Evidence-based Policy and Global Instruments on FSN; 2. Climate Change (especially Climate-Smart Agricultural Approaches, and NDCs; 3. Generational Gaps and Decent Rural Employment (focusing on Women empowerment and Gender equality, Youth employment and Child labour issues); 4.Migration and Fragility; 5. Resilient and Sustainable Food Systems; 6. Oceans and Blue Growth (Fisheries and Aquaculture).
The final version of the Governance Document for the Flexible Multi-Partner Mechanism (FMM) has just been released so&#xA0;there is&#xA0;some further work on how to define the focus&#xA0;of our FMM cooperation, but&#xA0;a probable soft&#xA0;Swedish earmarking will likely be done towards: Support the FAO&apos;s work to follow up the 21 SDG indicators for which FAO are responsible; Sustainable productivity growth in agriculture; Activities in the framework of the implementation of Voluntary Guidelines for Responsible Land, Fisheries and Forest Management in the Field of National Food Supply (VGGT), and Responsible Investment in Agriculture and Food Systems (RAI); Gender, including strengthened women&apos;s economic empowerment; Strengthened capacity to address the positive effects of migration
&#xA0;- Creating an enabling environment for securing sustainable small-scale fisheries within, Enhancing the contribution of small-scale fisheries to food security and sustainable livelihoods under the FAO Umbrella Programme for the Promotion and Application of the SSF Guidelines (SSF)&#xA0;
Food insecurity and poverty in small-scale fishing communities is of a multidimensional nature and is not only caused by dwindling fishery resources and low incomes but also due to factors that impede full enjoyment of human rights including civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights. Small-scale fisheries tend to be inadequately addressed, both with regard to resource management and from a broader social and economic development perspective, including for food security and poverty eradication. The Voluntary Guidelines for Securing Sustainable Small-Scale Fisheries in the Context of Food Security and Poverty Eradication (SSF Guidelines), endorsed by the FAO Committee on Fisheries (COFI) in 2014, were developed to address this situation.
The project provides support to creating an enabling environment through the development of supportive policies, capacity, organisational skills and knowledge and it has a strong gender focus. It covers small-scale fisheries in both marine and inland waters along the value chain, including the postharvest sector. The expected impact of the project is &#x201C;Improved governance of small-scale fisheries contributes to the eradication of hunger and poverty, to sustainable development and to the sustainable use of the environment&#x201D;. Accordingly, the project will contribute to ensuring secure and sustainable small-scale fisheries for the benefit of small-scale fishers, fish workers and their communities as well as for society at large in the context of the Agenda 2030 and grounded in a human-rights based approach. Out of the planned total budget of 8,9&#xA0;Million USD, FAO will forward 3Million USD to fisherfolks organisation to facilitate their work and activities for the benefit of their members.
The programme&#xA0;is part of &quot;FAO Umbrella Programme for the Promotion and Application of the SSF Guidelines&quot; which is also co-funded by Norway.
&#xA0;- Integrated Country Approach (ICA) for boosting decent jobs for youth in the agri-food system;&#xA0;
Sida has previously supported FAO work within Decent rural employment (DRE), and has deemed the work as successful and relevant. FAO has cooperated with ILO in a good way. Sida have therefore the intension to earmark to this area, to safeguard sufficient resources for the good implementation.
The Integrated Country Approach for boosting decent jobs for youth in the agri-food system &#x201C;ICA project&#x201D; will support countries in adopting and implementing more youth-inclusive agri-food system development policies, strategies and programmes. Its ultimate objective is to reduce rural poverty and distress migration among rural young women and men by reducing unemployment and underemployment. With more than 70 million unemployed youth worldwide and 156 million young workers living in poverty, youth employment is a top policy concern.
Improving young people&#x2019;s access to productive resources, pursuing strategies aiming to make agriculture more productive and &#x201C;greener&#x201D; and helping small-scale producers and enterprises to cluster and shift into higher value-added activities in the supply chain can have significant potential to generate decent jobs and reduce poverty. Through this project, in collaboration with its partners, FAO will pool knowledge, expertise and resources to effectively catalyse a more programmatic response to the rural youth employment challenge and optimize the rural job creation potential of the agri-food system. The approach proposed will look at both the demand and supply sides in the rural labour markets. It will increase the employability and entrepreneurship capacity of rural young women and men on the one hand and promote youth-inclusive food system development on the other hand. The project proposes an integrated approach structured in&#xA0;main outputs:&#xA0;mappings and priority setting; Knowledge generation for evidence base policy development; Awareness raising and capacity development for youth-inclusive and employment-centred planning; Policy and programme development, with focus on agroterritorial processes of job creation; as well as&#xA0;Boosting FAO tools and internal capacity to promote youth employment in agri-food systems in a gender-sensitive manner
The project expects to directly benefit around 4,000 youth (of which 50% are young women) across 12 countries (Ethiopia, Senegal, Uganda, Rwanda, Nigeria, Tanzania, and/or Kenya; Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, and /or Paraguay; Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam) in terms of capacity building and access to employment and entrepreneurship support. In the long term, the policies, strategies and investments to be established through the project are expected to benefit a total of some 2 to 5 million youth.
The drivers and impacts of migration are intimately linked to FAO&#x2019;s global goals of fighting hunger and achieving food security, reducing rural poverty and promoting the sustainable use of natural resources. FAO has a unique role to play in reducing rural migration, in view of its experience in supporting the creation of better conditions and resilient livelihoods in rural areas. Together with its partners, FAO also commits to further expand its work towards strengthening the positive contribution that migrants, refugees and IDPs are bringing for poverty reduction, food security and nutrition, and resilience of rural households.
FAO has considerable experience in addressing migration in both developmental contexts and protracted crises. Agricultural and rural development can contribute to address the root causes of migration and build the resilience of both displaced and host communities, laying the ground for long-term recovery.&#xA0;
FAO works with relevant stakeholders to strengthen their capacities to provide viable livelihood opportunities in agriculture and rural areas in countries in protracted crises. It also protects the right to food of all people on the move, while fostering their integration and strengthening the social and economic resilience of host communities. Working with its partners and using resilient agricultural livelihoods as a key instrument, FAO plays an important role in: i) addressing the factors that compel people to move, especially those linked to natural disasters, conflicts over natural resources and environmental and livelihood deterioration in rural areas; ii) strengthening resilience of both displaced people and host communities and iii) harnessing the positive contribution of migrants and displaced people and fostering their integration.
The world population is young: 1.2 billion youth aged 15-24 live in the world today and almost 88% of them are in developing countries. Globally, nearly two-thirds of youth are found in a state of extreme, moderate or near poverty, reaching over 90% in South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. They increasingly perceive migration as the only opportunity to make a living: one third of all international migrants are youth in the 15-34 age group.&#xA0;
Although the world&apos;s youth population is expected to grow, employment and entrepreneurial opportunities for young women and men remain limited &#x2013; particularly for those living in economically stagnant rural areas of developing countries. Hence, creating more productive and beneficial jobs for the rural youth is particularly urgent. Rapid population growth and urbanization, as well as rising household income, will have a dramatic effect on the increased demand for jobs, food, energy, clean water, infrastructure, and social services.&#xA0;
Food and agriculture can contribute substantially to solve the youth employment challenge. There is a largely untapped reservoir of farm and non-farm employment opportunities in the agriculture sector and within food systems. Advancing decent jobs for youth in rural areas will also contribute to effectively achieving the Sustainable Development Goals by 2030, considering the strong links between employment, agricultural development, food security and poverty reduction. To be successful, an approach to promote decent rural employment at country level should aim to build synergies across different interventions, such as capacity development, institutional support, knowledge generation and partnership creation. For example, providing skills development for youth without facilitating their access to markets and credit may result in a failure. Each intervention should be tailored to the local needs and capacities. This is what FAO is doing through its Integrated Country Approach (ICA) for promoting decent rural employment. The last publication The State of Food and Agriculture (SOFA) 2018 had as an annual team Migration, agriculture and rural development, and gives extensive policy&#xA0;recommendations in areas like the need for policy coherence between migration and agriculture and rural development policies is essential to ensure safe, orderly, and regular migration. Policies should not aim to reduce or accelerate migratory flows, but rather to maximize the economic and social benefits while minimizing the costs to migrants and societies.
- International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture (ITPGRFA), Core Administrative Budget and the special fund for agreed purposes.
FAO&#x2019;s International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture aims to ensure that the wealth of the world&#x2019;s food crop diversity in conserved, shared and sustainably used so that farmers can continue to grow the food needed to feed our growing world population. The Treaty now has 144 Contracting Parties.
The International Plant Treaty provides a global platform for solution by enabling countries to access the plant diversity they need to develop new varieties so they can address future needs and withstand future challenges regarding food and nutrition security. Contracting Parties of the International Plant Treaty undertake to share plant genetic material, including seeds and vital information, under a common system and set of rules.
Main Components &amp; Mechanisms: 1. Encouraging conservation and sustainable use of the world&#x2019;s plant genetic material for food and agriculture (PGRFA), so that current and future generations can have the food they need.; 2. Multilateral System of Access and Benefit-sharing (MLS), providing Contracting Parties global access to germplasm from each other to further develop crops that are more resilient to pests, diseases and adverse climate conditions, and crops that produce more, taste better and are more nutritious.; 3. Global Information System, which allows Contracting Parties to share information plant breeders and scientists need to track PGRFA around the world.; 4. Funding Strategy for the implementation of the Treaty that includes the Benefit-sharing Fund, which supports agricultural projects dealing with PGRFA in developing countries.; and 5. Farmers&#x2019; Rights acknowledge the tremendous contributions of smallholder and traditional farmers as innovators and custodians of the world&#x2019;s crops. The International Treaty encourages Contracting Parties to take actions to ensure the protection of farmers&#x2019; rights, both in terms of national decision-making and in terms of ensuring their rights on their traditional seeds.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">FAO&#x2019;s overarching goals are: the eradication of hunger, food insecurity and malnutrition; the elimination of poverty and the driving forward of economic and social progress for all, as well as the sustainable management and utilisation of natural resources, including land, water, air, climate and genetic resources for the benefit of future generations. Based on these, FAO has formulated five strategic objectives: 1. help eliminate hunger, food insecurity and malnutrition, 2. make agriculture, forestry and fisheries more productive and sustainable, 3. reduce rural poverty, 4. enable inclusive and efficient agricultural and food systems, 5. increase the resilience of livelihoods to threats and crises. In addition, FAO has formulated a sixth horizontal objective focusing on technical quality, statistics and cross-cutting themes (climate change, gender, governance and nutrition). Sweden&#x2019;s part of the assessed contributions is approximately SEK 40 million per year. The total FAO budget for 2017&#x2013;2018 is USD 2.6 billion, and roughly 60 per cent is mobilised through voluntary contributions and 40 per cent comes from assessed contributions paid by members. The support from Sida to FAO programmes varies but is approximately SEK 150 million per year. The support presented here supports FAO in its implementation of its agreed Medium Term Plan 2018-21 and Programme of Work and Budget, and consists of four parts: Flexible multi-partner mechanism (FMM), max 37 Millions SEK per year; Small-scale fisheries (SSF), max 20 Millions SEK per year; Boosting decent jobs for youth, max 12 Millions SEK per year; International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture (ITPGRFA), max 1 Millions SEK per year.</narrative>
   <narrative xml:lang="SV">FN:s Livsmedels- och jordbruksorganisation (FAO), inr&#xE4;ttades 1945 med uppgift att trygga livsmedelsf&#xF6;rs&#xF6;rjningen f&#xF6;r m&#xE5;let en v&#xE4;rld utan hunger, och har 194 medlemsl&#xE4;nder och en medlemsorganisation (EU). FAO &#xE4;r en kunskapsorganisation och ett forum f&#xF6;r policydialog med ett normativt och standards&#xE4;ttande uppdrag. FAO arbetar med att samla in, analysera, vidareutveckla och distribuera information om jordbruk, skog, fiske, nutrition och livsmedel. Arbetet sker bl.a. genom FAO:s publikationer, statistikinsamling och publicering, informationsspridning och tekniskt st&#xF6;d. FAO har ocks&#xE5; en betydande humanit&#xE4;r verksamhet och bidrar till att utveckla synergier mellan humanit&#xE4;ra insatser och l&#xE5;ngsiktig utveckling. FAO utformar &#xE4;ven system f&#xF6;r att utrota, hindra och mildra effekterna av gr&#xE4;ns&#xF6;verskridande sjukdomar hos v&#xE4;xter och djur. FAO:s verksamhet finns i &#xF6;ver 130 l&#xE4;nder.

FAO:s &#xF6;vergripande m&#xE5;l &#xE4;r: utrotande av hunger, otrygg livsmedelsf&#xF6;rs&#xF6;rjning och undern&#xE4;ring, utrotande av fattigdom och fr&#xE4;mjande av ekonomiska och sociala framsteg f&#xF6;r alla samt h&#xE5;llbart bevarande och nyttjande av naturresurser inklusive land, vatten, luft, klimat och genetiska resurser f&#xF6;r framtida generationers gagn. FAO har utifr&#xE5;n detta formulerat fem strategiska m&#xE5;l: 
1) Bidra till att utrota hunger, motverka otrygg livsmedelsf&#xF6;rs&#xF6;rjning och feln&#xE4;ring
2) G&#xF6;ra jordbruk, skogsbruk och fiske mer produktivt och h&#xE5;llbart
3) Minska fattigdomen p&#xE5; landsbygden
4) M&#xF6;jligg&#xF6;ra inkluderande och effektiva jordbruks- och livsmedelssystem, samt
5) &#xD6;ka motst&#xE5;ndskraften vid hot och kriser f&#xF6;r att trygga f&#xF6;rs&#xF6;rjningsm&#xF6;jligheterna.
D&#xE4;rut&#xF6;ver har FAO formulerat ett sj&#xE4;tte horisontellt m&#xE5;l som tar sikte p&#xE5; teknisk kvalitet, statistik och horisontella teman (klimat, j&#xE4;mst&#xE4;lldhet, styrning och nutrition).

FAO:s totala budget f&#xF6;r &#xE5;ren 2017&#x2013;2018 &#xE4;r p&#xE5; ca 2,6 miljarder dollar, varav ungef&#xE4;r 60 procent finansieras genom frivilliga bidrag och resterande 40 procent utg&#xF6;r medlemsavgifter. Sveriges medlemsavgift &#xE4;r ca 40 miljoner kronor per &#xE5;r. Det svenska st&#xF6;d som kanaliseras genom Sida till FAO:s varierar n&#xE5;got men uppg&#xE5;r till ca 150 miljoner kronor &#xE5;rligen. Detta globala samarbete med FAO utg&#xF6;r mindre &#xE4;n 0,5% av den totala FAO-budgeten, men bed&#xF6;ms ha katalytiska effekter och bidrar till strategiska partnerskap med exempelvis andra FN-organ och civilsamh&#xE4;llsorganisationer.

Det beslutade st&#xF6;det kommer att st&#xF6;dja FAO i genomf&#xF6;randet av den &#xF6;verenskomna strategiska planen f&#xF6;r 2018-21 (Medium Term Plan - MTP -  2018-21) samt arbetsprogram och budget (Programme of Work and Budget - PWB) och best&#xE5;r av fyra komponenter: 
1. Den flexibla multi-partnermekanismen (FMM), max 37 miljoner kronor per &#xE5;r 
2. Sm&#xE5;skaligt fiske (SSF), max 20 miljoner kronor per &#xE5;r 
3. Anst&#xE4;ndiga jobb f&#xF6;r ungdomar (ICA), max 12 miljoner kronor per &#xE5;r, samt 
4. Internationellt f&#xF6;rdrag om v&#xE4;xtgenetiska resurser f&#xF6;r livsmedel och jordbruk (ITPGRFA), h&#xF6;gst 1 miljon kronor per &#xE5;r. 

Flexibel multi-partner mekanism (FMM)
Det mest flexibla, minst &#xF6;ronm&#xE4;rkta finansieringsf&#xF6;nstret till FAO &#xE4;r FMM, d&#xE4;r Nederl&#xE4;nderna, Belgien, Flandern, Schweiz och Sverige har st&#xF6;tt under tidigare faser. Detta &#xE4;r den tredje generationen FMM och de tidigare faserna har utv&#xE4;rderats vederb&#xF6;rligen. Nuvarande FMM &#xE4;r en tydlig f&#xF6;rb&#xE4;ttring bland annat vad g&#xE4;ller styrning, kriterier f&#xF6;r allokering av medel, och tydligare koppling till FAO:s resultatramverk. 

Syftet, omfattningen och de allm&#xE4;nna principerna bakom FMM &#xE4;r nu: 
a) St&#xF6;d till realiseringen av FAO: s arbetsprogram, anpassning till organisationens prioriteringar och fokus p&#xE5; resultat
b) Flexibel finansiering 
c) Bidrag till organisationsramverket 
d) Fr&#xE4;mjande av kapacitetsutveckling
e) Politisk r&#xE5;dgivning och partnerskap
f) St&#xF6;d till aktiviteter p&#xE5; landniv&#xE5; som &#xE4;r helt anpassade till FN:s landprogram (UNDAF) och/eller FAO:s landprogram (CPF), samt
g) fr&#xE4;mja katalytisk effekt, innovation och transformativ p&#xE5;verkan. 

FMM har inom ramen f&#xF6;r FAO:s strategiska ramverk (MTP 2018&#x2013;21), givit prioritet till f&#xF6;ljande sex omr&#xE5;den: Evidensbaserad politik och globala instrument relaterade till klimatf&#xF6;r&#xE4;ndringar; anst&#xE4;ndigt landsbygdsarbete (med inriktning p&#xE5; kvinnors egenmakt och j&#xE4;mst&#xE4;lldhet mellan kvinnor och m&#xE4;n, ungdomsarbete och barnarbete); Migration; H&#xE5;llbara livsmedelssystem; samt Hav och bl&#xE5; tillv&#xE4;xt. 

Sm&#xE5;skaligt fiske (SSF)
Livsmedelsotrygghet och fattigdom i sm&#xE5;skaliga fiskesamh&#xE4;llen &#xE4;r av multidimensionell karakt&#xE4;r och orsakas inte bara av minskande fiskeresurser och l&#xE5;ga inkomster utan ocks&#xE5; av faktorer som hindrar fullt &#xE5;tnjutande av m&#xE4;nskliga r&#xE4;ttigheter inklusive civila, politiska, ekonomiska, sociala och kulturella r&#xE4;ttigheter. Sm&#xE5;skaligt fiske tenderar att hanteras p&#xE5; ett otillfredsst&#xE4;llande s&#xE4;tt, b&#xE5;de vad g&#xE4;ller resurshantering och ett bredare socialt och ekonomiskt utvecklingsperspektiv, inklusive livsmedelstrygghet. Projektet ger st&#xF6;d f&#xF6;r att skapa en m&#xF6;jlig milj&#xF6; f&#xF6;r utveckling av kapacitet, organisatorisk f&#xF6;rm&#xE5;ga och kunskaper och det har ett starkt genderfokus. Den t&#xE4;cker sm&#xE5;skaligt fiske i b&#xE5;de hav och insj&#xF6;ar l&#xE4;ngs v&#xE4;rdekedjan, inklusive f&#xF6;r&#xE4;dlingsledet. L&#xE4;nder d&#xE4;r programmet kommer att fokusera kommer att utvecklas under en inceptionsfas. Projektets f&#xF6;rv&#xE4;ntade inverkan &#xE4;r, en f&#xF6;rb&#xE4;ttrad styrning av sm&#xE5;skaligt fiske som bidrar till att utrota sv&#xE4;lt och fattigdom, h&#xE5;llbar utveckling och h&#xE5;llbar anv&#xE4;ndning av naturresurser. Projektet kommer att bidra till att s&#xE4;kerst&#xE4;lla ett s&#xE4;kert och h&#xE5;llbart sm&#xE5;skaligt fiske till gagn f&#xF6;r sm&#xE5;skaliga fiskare, fiskeriarbetare och deras samh&#xE4;llen samt f&#xF6;r samh&#xE4;llet som helhet. Projektet st&#xE4;rker genomf&#xF6;randet av FAO:s frivilliga riktlinjer f&#xF6;r att s&#xE4;kra h&#xE5;llbart sm&#xE5;skaligt fiske inom ramen f&#xF6;r livsmedelss&#xE4;kerhet och fattigdomsutrotning (SSF-riktlinjer).


Anst&#xE4;ndiga jobb f&#xF6;r ungdomar (ICA)
Sida har tidigare st&#xF6;tt FAO: s arbete inom anst&#xE4;ndig syssels&#xE4;ttning p&#xE5; landsbygden (Decent rural employment, DRE) och har ansett arbetet som framg&#xE5;ngsrikt och relevant. FAO har samarbetat med ILO p&#xE5; ett bra s&#xE4;tt och Sida har d&#xE4;rf&#xF6;r en &#xF6;ronm&#xE4;rkning till detta omr&#xE5;de f&#xF6;r att s&#xE4;kerst&#xE4;lla tillr&#xE4;ckliga resurser f&#xF6;r ett gott genomf&#xF6;rande. Projektet &#x201D;Den integrerade landsstrategin f&#xF6;r anst&#xE4;ndiga arbetstillf&#xE4;llen f&#xF6;r ungdomar i livsmedelssystemen&#x201D; kommer att st&#xF6;dja l&#xE4;nder i att anta och genomf&#xF6;ra fler utvecklingspolitiska strategier, strategier och program f&#xF6;r ungdomsmilj&#xF6;utveckling. Dess yttersta m&#xE5;l &#xE4;r att minska fattigdomen p&#xE5; landsbygden och migrationsstr&#xF6;mmar bland unga kvinnor och m&#xE4;n p&#xE5; landsbygden genom att minska arbetsl&#xF6;sheten. Med mer &#xE4;n 70 miljoner arbetsl&#xF6;sa ungdomar &#xF6;ver hela v&#xE4;rlden och 156 miljoner unga arbetstagare som lever i fattigdom &#xE4;r ungdomssyssels&#xE4;ttning ett toppolitiskt problem.


Internationellt f&#xF6;rdrag om v&#xE4;xtgenetiska resurser f&#xF6;r livsmedel och jordbruk (ITPGRFA)
Det internationella v&#xE4;xtf&#xF6;rdraget ger en global plattform f&#xF6;r att g&#xF6;ra det m&#xF6;jligt f&#xF6;r l&#xE4;nder att f&#xE5; tillg&#xE5;ng till den v&#xE4;xtgenetisk m&#xE5;ngfald de beh&#xF6;ver f&#xF6;r att utveckla nya v&#xE4;xtsorter, s&#xE5; att de kan m&#xF6;ta framtida behov och klara av framtida utmaningar n&#xE4;r det g&#xE4;ller livsmedel och nutrition. De 144 l&#xE4;nder som &#xE4;r parter i det internationella v&#xE4;xtf&#xF6;rdraget &#xE5;tar sig att dela v&#xE4;xtgenetiskt material, inklusive fr&#xF6;n och viktig information, enligt ett gemensamt system och regler. M&#xE5;len f&#xF6;r f&#xF6;rdraget &#xE4;r bevarande och h&#xE5;llbar anv&#xE4;ndning av v&#xE4;xtgenetiska resurser f&#xF6;r livsmedel och jordbruk och en r&#xE4;ttvis f&#xF6;rdelning av f&#xF6;rdelar som uppst&#xE5;r till f&#xF6;ljd av deras anv&#xE4;ndning, i &#xF6;verensst&#xE4;mmelse med konventionen om biologisk m&#xE5;ngfald, f&#xF6;r h&#xE5;llbart jordbruk och livsmedelstrygghet (CBD).</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">The main results for each of the contributions four components are described below. 

Flexible multi-partner mechanism (FMM)

At the fund level, FMM continued to make a significant contribution to the mobilization of flexible financial resources for FAO, mobilizing a total of 20.7 million USD in 2020. The importance of this flexible funding has been even more evident in the light of the covid-19 pandemic, as it has allowed FAO to quickly respond to arising challenges and direct resources in cost-effective manner to where they are most needed.

Overall, results have been on track despite some challenges to implementation caused by covid-19. At the fund level, the two outcome indicators and ten output indicators were all on track (100 percent achievement or more). For the FMM programmes, the outcome indicators were also on track, with 87.5 percent achievement for programme 1 and 100 percent achievement for programmes 2, 3, 4, and 5. 

Examples of results achieved on subprogramme level include: 

1. Subprogramme 3.1 Strengthening capacity to harness positive effects of migration 

This subprogram supports the targeted countries (Nepal, Senegal and Uganda) in the adoption and implementation of policies, strategies and corresponding programmes that promote sustainable alternatives to migration for rural youth, support and protect family members that stay behind (with a focus on rural women), or enhance the positive impacts of migration for agriculture and rural development as ell as minimize potential negative impacts.

At a country level, this subprogramme delivered several concrete results, some of which are highlighted below. In Uganda, FAO joined the National Coordination Mechanism on Migration in charge of the implementation of the Global Compact on Migration at the country level. In the framework of the mechanism, FAO is supporting the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in finalizing the National Diaspora Policy and is actively involved in the development of the Global Compact on Migration Implementation Plan. In addition, through the setup of a multi-stakeholder technical working group, the project provided a platform for strengthening policy dialogue and coordination across key sectors to maximize the benefits of migration for decent employment and rural development. 

In Senegal, FAO is supporting the General Directorate for Senegalese Abroad as well as local municipalities, to mainstream agriculture and rural development in their migration policies and programme. Particular attention was given to the impact of COVID-19 on migration dynamics, including the surge of irregular migration and the increasing rates of return migration both from abroad and within the country.

2. Subprogramme 4.3 Gender equality and women empowerment in food and agriculture 

Through this sub-programme, great advancements have been made with regards to the institutionalization of Dimitra Clubs (Dimitra clubs are groups of women, men and young people who organize on a voluntary basis to bring about changes in their communities and resolve problems using their own resources). In 2020, 20 new Dimitra Clubs were established in Senegal (with a total of 600 members, at least 60 percent women), and 500 were established in Mali and Niger (with a total of 105 000 members, at least 60 percent women) in collaboration with other FAO projects. The programme had also planned for 20 new Dimitra Clubs to be established in Cambodia and Kenya. While this was not achieved due to covid-19 related delays and absence of country level expertise, progress is on track for completion by the end of 2021. 

Overall, the clubs have achieved high participation rates and enabled tangible results at the community level. For example, in Senegal, the clubs have facilitated a number of village sanitation initiatives; the building of public wash basins; creation of endogenous masks; efforts to address literacy for women; the setup of collective vegetable gardens; and efforts to challenge gender-discriminatory norms such as early marriage. In a pilot project in Niger, the clubs have successfully been used as a community and gender-responsive mechanism to reduce conflicts between herders and farmers. The clubs have also played a key role during the pandemic, facilitating communication between rural people and local authorities and health specialists through ICT solutions. 

Sub-program 5.4 Promoting coherence between disaster risk reduction, climate action and social protection in sub-Saharan Africa

Under this subprogramme, 80 farmer field school (FFS) groups have been formed in the Mwanza and Neno districts of Malawi, reaching 2 400 households. Through the FFSs, these households are provided with trainings on climate-smart agriculture, disaster risk reduction (DRR), natural resource management practices, nutrition education and business management. These trainings give the households increased capacity to enhance their agricultural productivity and to cope or withstand some of the negative effects of climate change, ultimately increasing nutrition and food insecurity. Capacities were also developed at the district level to implement a stronger resilience strategy that integrates climate change, social protection and DRR.  

Creating an enable environment for securing sustainable Small-scale fisheries (SSF) 

In relation to budget spending level, the project is slightly behind compared to what had been expected at this point in time although overall project implementation progress is satisfactory. Activities that had already been initiated through other projects or partners allowed for a head start with regard to continuing or upscaling of activities. However, the outbreak of COVID-19 has impacted the initiation or progress of some of the planned activities, in particular at country level and with small-scale fisheries organisations. Country level work has been supported by the recruitment of local project coordinators in key countries but some processes, including participatory work planning, have been delayed due to the pandemic. The preparation of publications are progressing overall as planned, and a number of awareness raising and training events could be organized despite the challenges. For instance, a series of briefs on the links between the SSF Guidelines and relevant instruments of the Committee on World Food Security (CFS) have been published and were presented in a side event on Exploring the application of CFS instruments to address gender, youth, inequality and data systems in small-scale fisheries in the 47th Session of the Committee on World Food Security in 2021. 

Integrated Country Approach (ICA) for boosting decent jobs for youth in the agri-food system 

The overall project implementation progress is considered satisfactory and output targets have been achieved as planned, with some delays and adjustments due to Covid-19. 2020 marks the second year of the ICA project, and brought advancements on the remaining inception activities which in some countries could not be completed during the first year due to government transitions, delayed project signatures and national coordinators recruitment. Project coordinators are finally on board in every country, partners are identified including youth organizations, and resources have been transferred to the five country offices through Field Budget Authorizations (FBAs) based on annual work plans. Only the component on task force establishment and formalization of technical working groups (TWGs) remains ongoing, since it is linked to the implementation of activities under the other outputs. Multiple bilateral partnerships were established in all countries, with two partnerships formalized: with EAFF (Implementation Agreement) for Eastern Africa and JR Farms (Letter of Intent) for Rwanda.

The Covid-19 crisis imposed new priorities in terms of assessing the needs and challenges of rural youth within the Covid-19 context, providing short-term support as needed, and facilitating youth participation in related policy dialogues. Field activities and trainings were inevitably delayed to comply with all rules and regulations that were issued by national and local governments regarding quarantine, public health, and/or the holding of public events and gatherings. However, a significant part of them, especially dialogues, could be maintained virtually or held by local project counterparts. 

International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture (ITPGRFA)

ITPGRFA is followed up through the reports to the governing body, and mainly based on the assessements done by the swedish representative from Minitry of Enterprise and Innovation. Next report will cover the period the years 2020-2021.

Support to Preparation of the CSF voluntary guidelines on gender equality and womens empowerment

Committee on World Food Security (CFS) has decided to carry out a project called Preparation of the CFS Voluntary Guidelines on Gender Equality and Women&apos;s Empowerment. The objective is to provide support to develop guidelines on Gender Equality and Women&apos;s Empowerment to overcome gender-based discrimination, promote women&apos;s and girls&apos; rights, and empower them as part of their efforts to eradicate hunger, food insecurity, and malnutrition. FAO is agreement partner for this support. CFS has during 2021 undertaken first regional consultations for the Voluntary Guidelines, and the process will continue in 2022, hopefully leading to good VGs.</narrative>
