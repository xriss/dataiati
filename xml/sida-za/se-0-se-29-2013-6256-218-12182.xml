  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In poor countries, people suffering from mental illness seldom receive the treatment they need and their human rights are often neglected. This is a serious, since mental illness increase risk of physical illness, abuse, risky behaviour and poverty. There is a lack of a more comprehensive knowledge about barriers to care both within the health care system as well as in the population. In this study we use a new conceptual model were we investigate barriers to care at structural and individual level through the lens of the right to health. We investigate this in one urban and one rural area in Eastern Cape in South Africa. The findings from the health system analysis (what is delivered) will be contrasted to the results from the population study (what is received and used). The result will clarify lack of care and inconsistencies that will improve health care planning in poor countries.</narrative>
