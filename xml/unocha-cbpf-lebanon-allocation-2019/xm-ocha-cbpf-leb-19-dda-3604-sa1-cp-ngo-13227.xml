   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Strengthening the legal protection through legal intervention with 300 boys and girls and training of 10 investigators in contact with children in T5 and Akkar governorates</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project proposes the following activities: 
1-Adequate response and follow up for medium to high risk cases in need of judicial protection.
Under this proposed project, more than 300 children at medium and high risk of abuse will benefit from case management referred to judicial pathway. As currently the team working in the Justice Palace is only composed of 2 social workers who responded alone to more than 340 cases in less than a year, this exceeded the maximum number of cases to be held by social workers as per the child protection minimum standards. 
The team is in urgent need of additional support to handle that number of cases who are in need of fast response as the child&apos;s life is at risk, but also in need of a significant level of investment, to cover assessments, home visits, reports, referrals and follow up. 
Through its mandate by the Ministry of Justice, himaya will be increasing its capacity to respond to cases in need of legal protection. Despite the number of partners in the north, the capacity is still low. Himaya&#x2019;s role with the MoJ in the North is essential as 43% of the cases are referred by UPEL, 17% by International NGO&apos;s, 10% by Juvenile Judge, 8% by Local NGO&apos;s and Member of the family, each. 5% by himaya office-Tripoli and Individuals, each 1% by General Prosecutor and MOSA, each
Three social workers will be covering the North region (T5 and Akkar) and responding to more than 300 cases (average of 100 cases per social worker), noting that covering both North governorates demands long field trips.  One senior case manager will be fully working on supervising and coordinating the team members, making sure the assessment is properly done, supervising the team, coordinating with the general prosecutor and judge when needed.
2-Adequate child friendly and inclusive space to rehabilitate in the Justice Palace &#x2013; Tripoli 
The second proposed action In line with ensuring minimum standards of safety, comfort and inclusion to children, is the rehabilitation of the Justice Palace office accessed by children and their families when in need of protection. One room that is being used to welcome children and families, will be refurnished to meet child friendly space requirements as well as to be suitable for children with disability. This room is often used to conduct assessment with children, or as a waiting room for some unaccompanied children, where the social worker tries to ensure their needs are met (food, safety, warmth, presence etc.) 
3-Capacity building for Internal Security Forces &#x2013; &#x201C;Roles and responsibilities of the judicial police when dealing with child abuse victims&#x201D; 
The exposure of children to police stations and investigations still lack minimum standards of child rights, ethics, safety and dignity. While himaya will work in 2020 on capacitating the ISF and Municipal police (based on its experience in training ISF in 2016 and 2017), 10 internal security forces investigators in both North governorate police stations will be trained urgently to respond adequately when dealing with children. Sessions will focus on topics such as nonviolent communication, child friendly context, ethical questions during investigations and standard procedures among other topics.</narrative>
