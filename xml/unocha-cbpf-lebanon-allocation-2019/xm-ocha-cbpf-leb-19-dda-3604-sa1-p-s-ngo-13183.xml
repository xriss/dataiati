   <narrative xml:lang="EN">the  proposed 12 months project aims to  Increase access to basic services and meeting basic and specific needs for the most vulnerable PRS and PRL elderly People in  7  Palestinian camps and gatherings through  Identification of specific needs through registration, recording, verification and profile for Displaced   PRS, and PRL elderly people aged 60 and above .  The proposed intervention is based on the current ongoing intervention that been proven its necessity towards enhancing the life of elderly people from a side and filling the gap resulted by service providers. UNRWA donor relation unit and the protection team have assisted Nabaa during the development of this proposal based on their figures and facts and due to the fact that most of service providers are still not able to reach out this category because of their limited resources , while it was very feasible for us in some locations the differences among elderly people whom are sheltering in two locations with a specialized organization dealing with their issues and challenges ( Naher el bared and Burj Barajneh). 
through this intervention Nabaa  seeks to upscale its intervention thought extending the project into new locations ( Ein EL Helwi , Badawi and Weevil camps ) in addition to the previous targeted camps ( buss , Rachidieh , Burj Chamali  camps and Qasmieh gatherings ) , while  improving its Cash transfer based on  UNRWA SOP/ Standard Operating Procedures in order to have one unified method taking place among-st the most marginalized community from a side and for better and effective coordination and follow up from the other side. 
The current proposal is considered as an extension of the previous one either within its location or within the type of services provided to elderly person. During the ongoing project ( 15th of January - 15th September  2019)  in four Palestinian camps Bass, Rachdieh, Borj Al Shamale, and al Qasmeye, while the proposed one is seeking to reach additional three camps  Ein El Helwi , Badawi and weavil camps .  The identified number of elderly person planned to be included within this intervention is 710 distributed in 7 locations, while the type of services provided to them are as follows 
-	377 elderly person will benefit  Through Shelter self-improvement ( categorized simple maintenance) while 18 will be able to maintain their shelters classified major rehabilitation .   
-	366 will be providing emergency cash  the selection of the elderly will be focusing on those  whom are dealing with a particularly difficult situation to decide whether or not we can provide them with cash.  The assessment measures the size and type of the shock that they are experiencing, and the existing resources they have to deal with it.  The amount of cash per case is vary between $300 - $500 aligned with the amount decided by UNRWA protection department and based also on the recommendation revealed by the elderly during the satisfaction survey carried out the last month . 
-	710 elderly person will be included within the package of PSS including referrals that  may be initiated directly by the beneficiary following provision of a general orientation or information session about available service providers in their area (&#x2018;self-referral&#x2019;), or may be facilitated by protection committee, group or individual who has had prior contact with the beneficiary but is unable to meet the need for which they are being referred.</narrative>
