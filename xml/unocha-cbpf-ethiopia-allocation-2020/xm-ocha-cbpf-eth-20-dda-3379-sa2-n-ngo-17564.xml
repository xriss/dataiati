   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Emergency Nutrition response in Hambela Wamana, Tselemti, and Teru woredas of Oromia, Tigray, and Afar Regions</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The mid-year review (MYR) of the joint Government and humanitarian partners&#x2019; 2020 Ethiopia Humanitarian Response Plan (HRP) prioritized multi-sector humanitarian needs targeting 15.2 million people with emergency food and non-food assistance, on this revision assessments reported that the impact of spring (mid-February-May) rains on the seasonal harvest, as well as on water and pasture conditions in pastoralist and agro-pastoralist communities in lowland areas. The revision also accounted the humanitarian impact of the ongoing desert locust infestation on food insecurity and livelihood loss, displacements due to flooding and localized instabilities, as well as disease outbreaks such as cholera. Moreover,  The anticipated below-average deyr/Hagaya season, slightly below-average Meher harvest, and continued lower than average access to income across much of the country is anticipated to continue contributing to high assistance needs. Having this in the account, MCMDO has proposed a continuation intervention in three drought and flood-affected woredas of the Tigray region,  Northwest Zone of  Tselmti , Afar region of Zone 4  Teru and Oromia region of West Guji zone of  Hambella wamena. MCMDO is operational in West Guji Zone Kercha and Hambela Wamena, Tselmti and Teru Woredas supporting with CMAM program from the funding source of EHF, As Humanitarian point of view, MCMDO strongly recommended to extend the project from November to May 2021 in the midst of concrete rationalization. The overall strategic objective of this project proposal is to provide lifesaving emergency nutrition response, there by contributing to the reduction of morbidity and mortality associated with drought and acute food insecurity among Under-five children and PLW in this selected drought affected woredas by Tselemti ,  Hambella Wamnea and Teru The targeted Woredas (IDPs) are highly vulnerable communities with who have limited access to nutrition services via Full CMAM and IYCF &#x2013;E intervention. The intervention is required to responds and supports the increased needs for early identification and treatment of acute malnutrition with tangible reasons
In Teru Only 40% of the woreda is accessible during the dry season and only 50% is accessible during the rainy season due to flood and fine silt that stuck the vehicle afterward. Very recently four kebeles of Teru were surrounded by flood and MCMDO accesses them through its MHN with rescue Military Helicopter while others left their village earlier and there are more than 3000 IDP which needs immediate humanitarian assistance. Since multiple shock is happening in the woreda and malnutrition The woreda is the most remote in the region where one pocket kebeles (Mebay) 341 Km from the center.
InTselmti:  Since the woreda is alienated into three and caseload beyond the capacity of the government to mange especially under five Children and PLW. 
In Hambella:  One of the indicators to people still are prone to shock is the number of SAM in the woreda is in rise. Both SAM and MAM cases  to in compression the situation is  significantly increased with the same month  of last in year in 2019, June, July, and August, it indicates that the nutrition demand among children is still high and needs focus and special attention. 
The goal of the project is to contribute reduce mortality and morbidity in related to malnutrition, improves access to life&#xAD;saving nutrition interventions for the most vulnerable populations of under five children and PLW, establish/strength multi-sectoral coordination for the management and response of malnutrition, increase the awareness of the community on malnutrition regardless of their nutritional status through IYCF-E  and Nutrition counseling for both IDPs and Host Communities in the proposed three woredas. The project will be a six months project and the proposed budget is USD 230,000.15.</narrative>
