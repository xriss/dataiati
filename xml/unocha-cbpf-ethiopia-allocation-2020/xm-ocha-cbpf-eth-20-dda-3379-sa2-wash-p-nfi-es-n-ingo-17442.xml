   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Life Saving Multisector Emergency Response for IDPs,Returnees and Host Communities living in Gimbi Woreda, West Wellega zone in Oromia Region</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The proposed project will be led by World Vision Ethiopia ( WVE)  as part  of consortium with Action for the Needy in Ethiopia(ANE). The consortium members, WVE and ANE are proposing an integrated multi sector emergency response to address the critical needs of vulnerable internally displace peoples (IDPs), returnees and host communities living in Gimbi Woreda in West Wellega Zone of Oromia Region from EHF 2020 2nd round allocation fund. The response will contribute to saving lives through integrated, equitable and safe assistance to host communities and IDPs displaced by inter-communal conflict and returnees in the targeted woreda. The overall objective of the project is to save and sustain lives and provide protection services for Gimbi woreda conflict &#x2013;induced displacement affected  communities. 
Following the death of four senior officials on 26 September 2018 from the Benishangul Gumuz region, while travelling back to Kamash zone after attending a consultative meeting with Oromia Regional Security Officials, the incident ignited inter-communal violence in the Kamashi zone of Benishangul-Gumuz region between the Gumuz community and the Oromo. The conflict resulted in death, injury, and loss asset, damage to public and private infrastructure. A total of 103,502 individuals and 19,642 households were displaced from West Wollega and East Wollega according to data from woreda and zone DRM offices. Recognizing the multi-dimensional nature of this humanitarian crisis, this response seeks to address core humanitarian problems through an integrated approach to increase access, awareness and coping mechanisms of IDPs, Returnees and affected host communities. The response will improve resilience of IDPs, Returnees and affected host communities through WASH,ES/NFI and protection  interventions. This response will provide increased access to sufficient and safe water and increased awareness of sanitary and hygienic practices The response is designed to be timely and prioritizing the most vulnerable and most severe life-threatening issues. The proposed project is a nine month  multi sectoral intervention  and will provide  response for WASH(25%) ,ES/NFI(25%) and protection(50%). The project will  rehabilitate  unimproved water sources and will  provide full shelter NFIs kit to target IDP households. The targeted households will be assisted on how to self-construct their own emergency shelter. The project provides timely protection, response and prevention services to secondary displaced  IDPs  and host communities facing protection risks and threats protect the needs of the most vulnerable secondary displaced  IDPs  that are identified through effective protection monitoring, reporting and response, including promoting safe movement and durable solutions and ensure vulnerable people affected by violence have the skills, opportunities and positive coping strategies required to return and reintegrate into their communities in safety and dignity.
WVE  implements protection and  ANE is responsible for WASH and ES/NFI intervention in the target woreda. ANE will promote and advocate for the IDPs so that they will receive rental subsidies from Government ready-for-rent houses in towns and benefit them through the social housing scheme in their locations. In addition, ANE field monitors will participate in a search for available houses to support vulnerable households will get houses and also council all IDPs so that they will have good relations with neighbors and host community and they can live longer peacefully with the host community. The field staffs will dedicate their time and conduct periodic post-distribution monitoring (PDM) assessments for the effectiveness of the cash transfer process and usage of the cash, check the quality of the accommodations and ensure the houses meet the SPHERE standards. They will identify any challenges the IDPs are facing and collect the IDPs opinion during house rental process their situations.</narrative>
