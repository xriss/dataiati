   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Multi-Sectoral Response in Mederesa IDP site of Bunno Bedele Zone of Oromia region &#x2013;Dedesa woreda</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">World Vison Ethiopia in collaboration with a local partner Fayyaa Integrated Development Organization(FIDO) is proposing an integrated multi sector emergency response for IDPs to address the existing dire needs of those displaced vulnerable individuals using EHF 2020 2nd round allocation fund to save lives. 
A recent analysis using WASH, Health, and Shelter indicators highlighted that IDPs in 56 sites live in overcrowded settings making social distancing nearly impossible and with inadequate hygiene facilities and lack of access to health services. Additionally, displaced populations tend to suffer disproportionately from poor health conditions due to the hardships of displacement that often lead to high malnutrition rates and other underlying health factors, making IDPs more susceptible to illnesses. Overcrowded living conditions are also known to increase exposure to GBV, particularly for women and girls. 
Climate induced hazards and impacts, intercommunal conflicts lack of basic social services and other humanitarian and protection related issues like GBV continue to affect the physical protection and the living condition of IDPs across several regions in the country. One of these IDPs site is in Dedesa woreda of Bunno Bedele zone in Oromia regional state. The IDPs first settled in the camps back in 2009 after arriving from Somali region and more IDPs arrived in subsequent years. Currently there are 19,052 individuals living in camps. The main cause of displacement is drought and conflict. 

Recognizing the multi-dimensional nature of this humanitarian crisis, this response seeks to address core humanitarian problems through an integrated approach to increase access, awareness and coping mechanisms of IDPs. The response will improve resilience of IDPs through Health, Nutrition protection, ES/NFI, and WASH interventions. This response will provide increased access to sufficient and safe water by rehabilitating existing water schemes increased awareness of sanitary and hygienic practices increased access to basic curative and preventive health services through facility-based and temporary outreach health services CMAM and IYCF-E interventions. As part of protection response the project also works towards improving child protection case management systems, access to psycho-social services and preventive intervention. Shelter/ NFI intervention will focus on the decongestion of overcrowded shelters through constructing separate emergency shelters for 840 targeted households in the areas where single-room shelters shared by multiple families which exposes the IDPs for the pandemic. The selection of these 840 hhs will be need based where Women at risk, Child headed household that need shelter, elderly headed hhs and people with critical health issue will get the priority. Regarding HLP, this will be addressed in consultation woreda administration. Temporary shelters will be constructed adjacent to the existing IDP camp and the land will be provided by the woreda. The woreda administration has already expressed its commitment to cooperate in this regard. 
In addition over the proposed project period, WV in collaboration with the sub implementing partner, FIDO, will provide technical and operational support to the woreda sector offices to ensure the delivery of full CMAM/IMAM packages by strengthening continuum of care for SAM-MAM case management in health facilities promoting optimal infant and young child feeding in emergencies (IYCF-E) and strengthening early malnutrition case detection and referrals. Woreda DRMC office, Water and mining office and women and youth affairs office are also the key partners to effectively deliver the promises of this project. 

WVE and the sub IP, FIDO, will implement this response by assigning full time humanitarian emergency specialists in the proposed sectors health, nutrition, protection and WASH professionals who have proven experience in emergency responses</narrative>
