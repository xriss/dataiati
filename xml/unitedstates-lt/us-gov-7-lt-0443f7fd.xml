    <narrative xml:lang="EN">U.S. assistance supports Lithuania&apos;s efforts to develop forces that are more capable of meeting the country&apos;s national security objectives and international military commitments. U.S. security assistance provides tangible benefits to Lithuania, an effective and reliable North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Ally, by helping the Lithuanian Armed Forces (LAF) deploy troops alongside U.S. and coalition forces in Afghanistan and as a member of the coalition to counter the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. U.S. assistance to Lithuania in FY 2017 enhances regional stability and improves Lithuania&apos;s interoperability and military cooperation with its NATO partners. U.S. security assistance to Lithuania not only addresses Lithuania&apos;s own defense needs but also helps build and sustain the LAF&apos;s capacity in out-of-area deployments in support of NATO- and U.S.-led operations. U.S. assistance will advance defense reform, build capacity, and strengthen partnerships in the region to more effectively counter Russian aggression and other emerging threats.</narrative>
