This document presents the progress from October till December 2021 on the activities for which DGIS contracted the Access to Nutrition Foundation (ATNF, Grant reference number - 4000000128). It is structured in line with the Objectives for the Access to Nutrition Initiative (ATNI) as in the funding proposal, including additional funding support (&#xA3;1,500.000) from FCDO that was approved April 2020. 

For 2021, ATNI has been granted a prolongation from DGIS to deliver the objectives in the course of 2021, due to delays caused by the COVID-19 crisis that started in 2020.
Progress on relevant objectives for October-December 2021

Core Objective 1: Global Indexes

Global Index 

On July 1, 2021, ATNI published its fourth Global Index, assessing the largest 25 global F&amp;B companies on their efforts on nutrition. 
After the successful launch, ATNI invited all companies assessed on the Index to online meetings to dig deeper into Global Index results and recommendations. These calls started in August 2021 and continued until December 2021. In total, 19 companies expressed an interest in joining these meetings. By December 2021, ATNI has conducted 16 of these calls including 2 calls with Board and Senior Executives of Nestl&#xE9; and PepsiCo. Also, two non-engaging companies of the Index, Suntory and Mengniu, reached out and expressed an interest in understanding ATNI&#x2019;s work. Overall, the response from all companies has been positive. Many companies have mentioned that ATNI&#x2019;s Global Index results and recommendations have been communicated to senior management within their companies.  
On October 5, 2021 the Global Index 2021 was launched in Japan through an online event co-hosted by ATNI, Nomura Asset Management and ESG consultancy firm Neural Inc. The event was supported by the Japanese Sustainable Investment Forum (JSIF). The event saw a wide variety of stakeholders, including company representatives, government officials, academics, institutional investors and members of trade associations, come together to discuss the findings of the Global Index 2021 and to reflect on how they are relevant to the Japanese market as well as to Japanese companies assessed in the benchmark. The event was well-attended both by Japanese and international stakeholders. 
Next steps: In the first quarter of 2022, ATNI will consolidate key outcomes of these discussions and suggestions for the next iteration of the Global Index in a summary report. 

Core Objective 2: BMS Marketing Policies and Practices

ATNI plans to assess the top 20 BMS companies in the next iteration of the BMS Index and increase the number of country assessments to 5-7 countries, to be able to capture all companies on the ground. In the last quarter, ATNI has been preparing internally for the consultation with input from the BMS Expert Group. Two working sessions with the EG took place in October and November and the EG will provide written feedback on the proposed consultation approach by January 2022. Following this, ATNI will review feedback internally and start planning more meetings with external stakeholders to understand what changes should be made in the consultation. 
Additionally, ATNI had a follow-up call with Danone to provide some further information on their assessment post-publication in November. 
ATNI is also in touch with other CSOs and UN agencies on the BMS Call to Action, and other related work. The last meeting took place in December where updates related to potential participation of BMS companies in the N4G Summit was discussed. Among the organisations participating in these regular calls are UNICEF, WHO, FHI360, HKI and Save the Children.
Next steps: In Q1 of 2022, ATNI will continue working on the consultation and plan meetings with external stakeholders, including CSOs, companies and other experts to review the methodology and approach for the next iteration of the BMS Index. 

Other BMS work

BMS Call to Action

ATNI has been assessing the responses and roadmaps of the companies to the Call to Action, especially in relation to the N4G Summit as the Summit took place in December 2021. Some Japanese companies that are interested to participate to the N4G Summit submitted roadmaps in the months prior to the Summit and followed up with ATNI; namely Megmilk, Glico, Morinaga and Meiji. ATNI engaged extensively with Meiji that showed continuous interest in complying in advance of the Summit. Despite the discussions, there was no company that was found eligible to participate in the Summit. 
Core Objective 5: Outreach Activities

Investors

Signatory Recruitment (current AUM is $16.6 trillion)

ATNI has continued to increase its signatory base. New ATNI Signatories who joined the coalition in Q4 of 2021 are the following: Apostle Funds Management (AU), Aikya Investment Management (UK), Mitsubishi UFJ Trust and Banking (JP), Socially Responsible Investment Coalition (US) and CZ (NL). The total number of Signatories at the end of December 2021 is 76 investors, representing $16.6 trillion in assets under management. 

Collaborative Investor Engagement

50 of the 74 ATNI Investor Signatories, representing $12.3 trillion in assets, are taking part in the Collaborative Investor Engagement facilitated by ATNI, based on the findings of the Global Index 2021. 
In July 2021, the investor letters with key company asks were shared with all publicly listed companies in the Global Index 2021 (i.e., a total of 20 companies) and all companies have been asked to reply in writing to set a date for a first engagement meeting. By the end of December 2021, investors have had a first meeting with 14 companies, have secured a date for a first meeting with an additional two companies and are in conversations with an additional three companies. Only one company has been non-responsive to investors thus far. Members of the ATNI Investor Support Team have attended these meetings in the capacity of note-takers. Meeting minutes have been regularly shared with the investors via the ATNI 
Investor Portal. 
Ahead of each engagement call with the companies, ATNI continues to provide an in-depth investor briefing about each company, to support investors in their engagement efforts and to ensure the investor engagement is successful. These briefings have been well attended by investors, who have provided positive feedback and indicated that they found the briefings useful in preparing for their engagement meetings with companies. 
To ensure the smooth and successful running of the engagement, ATNI also organized three in-depth teach-in sessions on topics of special interest to the investors:
&#x2022;	On September 9, 2021, the ATNI team, in collaboration with The George Institute for Global Health, provided an overview of the Product Profile 2021 and presented an in-depth analysis of two companies&#x2019; assessments. 
&#x2022;	On September 23, 2021, the ATNI team delivered a teach-in on the topics of responsible marketing and lobbying.
&#x2022;	On November 24th, 2021, with the ATNI team provided an in-depth presentation about ATNI&#x2019;s BMS / CF Marketing Index 2021. 
Next steps: The ATNI Investor Support team will continue to support investors in their engagement with companies and will continue to build the track record necessary for the impact report at the end of this engagement phase. ATNI will support investors in ensuring a first meeting is secured with all 20 publicly listed companies and in working towards scheduling follow-up meetings with companies that have shown a keen interest in continuing the dialogue with the ATNI Investor Signatories. 
Additionally, ATNI will continue to organize quarterly collaborative engagement calls to provide investors with a platform to share successes and difficulties encountered in their engagement with the companies. The next quarterly engagement call is planned for February 2nd. 
Considering the upcoming US Index 2022, the ATNI Investor Support Team will plan for the findings of this Index to be incorporated into the ongoing engagement, so that US companies can be engaged both on their global practices as well as on their US-specific Index results. 
ATNI is also in conversation with GAIN, WBA and NewForesight to co-organize an event to bring investors&#x2019; attention to the topic of workforce nutrition. The event would present findings of a paper by the Workforce Nutrition Alliance but also by the report published by ATNI in December 2021 (see next section). 

Investor Report

ATNI published a report outlining investor action on nutrition. The report Institutional Investors&#x2019; Approaches to Addressing Nutrition, Diets and Health was launched on November 30, 2021, during an official side event of the Tokyo Nutrition for Growth (N4G) Summit organized by ATNI in collaboration with Chatham House, Nomura Asset Management, Achmea Investment Management, Legal and General Investment Management, and Rathbone Greenbank Investments. The event was well-attended, and the report has been widely shared not only within the networks of ATNI&#x2019;s Investor Signatories but also with a wider range of nutrition stakeholders. The report, intended to help global non-investment sector readers understand the pivotal role that institutional investors play in driving better corporate performance on nutrition and health, includes eight case studies based on publicly available information and profiling members of the ATNI Investor Signatories group. The case studies outline how investors are tackling health and nutrition using strategies such as ESG integration, negative/exclusionary screening, norms-based screening, engagement and shareholder action, positive/best-in-class screening, sustainability-themed investing, and impact investing.

N4G and UNFSS Investor Mobilization

ATNI has been supporting investor mobilization at the two global Summits taking place this year. ATNI has drafted the N4G Investor Pledge, supported by 53 of its Investor Signatories representing $12.4 trillion in AUM. ATNI worked hard to ensure the Pledge could be presented during the Summit Plenary. The N4G Investor Pledge was officially launched on Day 2 of the N4G Summit, on December 8, by Akihiko Nishioka, President and CEO of Resona Asset Management. It was the first time that investors got engaged in such a way at a multilateral global event. This pledge represents a smart commitment from investors to use the framework of the Investor Expectations on Nutrition, Diets and Health in their engagement, analysis, and investment processes as well as a commitment to directly engage with all listed companies in the Global Index 2021. The full text of the Pledge, as well as a full recording of its announcement, can be found here. 
To ensure the Pledge received sufficient media coverage, ATNI contracted a Press Agency specialized in the investment sector. This resulted in several articles, most notably in Forbes (an interview with ATNI Executive Director Inge Kauer), Reuters, Nutrition Insight, and much more. 
ATNI continues to be in conversation with the Good Food Finance Network, launched at the UN Food Systems Summit, to ensure that the issue of nutrition is part of the Network&#x2019;s agenda as a relevant ESG issue.
Next steps: ATNI will continue to monitor progress against the Pledge by means of creating the necessary track record of the collaborative investor engagement, which will result in an impact report to be drafted in Q4 2022 / Q1 2023. 

Outreach &amp; Communications 

On October 26th, the ATNI team presented the findings of the UK Product Profile 2021 in a webinar organized by ShareAction, funder of the project, and titled &#x201C;Health Matters: Assessing food and drink manufacturers &#x2018;progress on health&#x201D;. The event was well-attended and saw ATNI members take part in a lively discussion focusing on the nutrition challenges and the relative corporate responses in the UK market. 
On November 10th, ATNI Executive Director Inge Kauer was invited to take part in a COP26 event on the topic of food safety.  With the UK hosting the 26th UN Framework Convention on Climate Change Conference of the Parties (COP26) in Glasgow in November 2021, this event represented a unique opportunity to bring together regulators, food and feed scientists, consumer groups, industry experts, and academics from across the food system to discuss how to respond to global food systems challenges. The event was organized by the UK Food Standards Agency and by Food Standards Scotland and included a presentation by ATNI.
Social media activity in November and December contributed to ATNI&#x2019;s burgeoning presence online and to the impact of key publications. ATNI&#x2019;s involvement in the N4G Summit was accompanied by a social media campaign designed to drive attention to the website and to the Summit official side events. 
ATNI played an active role as host, co-host or event moderator in nine official N4G side events. These have been shared with ATNI&#x2019;s stakeholders via the ATNI website, the ATNI social media accounts, through an N4G-specific newsletter, and via targeted stakeholder emails.
ATNI co-hosted two events on the topic of Workforce Nutrition together with the Consumer Goods Forum. The first event, on November 16th, focused on private sector commitments on supply chain workforce nutrition and saw ATNI Research Director Mark Wijne share findings from the Global Index 2021. During the second event, held on November 25th, ATNI Program Director Marije Boomsma shared preliminary findings from ATNI&#x2019;s report Workforce Nutrition Programs in Supply Chains: The Benefits of Addressing Malnutrition from Supply Chain Workers and How to Do So. The report was then officially launched on December 13th, 2021, and distributed widely within ATNI&#x2019;s networks. 
On November 23rd, in partnership with GAIN, the UN Food and Agriculture Organization, the World Food Programme and the SUN Business Network, ATNI co-hosted an event used to present learnings from various organizations supporting SMEs as well as case studies by some SMEs. ATNI&#x2019;s Nutrition Business Monitor tool was a key element of the webinar. The events were graphically summarized by a graphic illustrator, whose drawings can be found on the relative ATNI project page, here. 
On December 2nd and December 16th ATNI co-hosted two official side events on the topic of accountability for better nutrition, together with the Global Nutrition Report and with Results UK. The first event, which took place before the N4G Summit, focused on the role that accountability mechanisms can play in driving positive change within the nutrition space. The second event, which took place after the Summit, was used as an opportunity to reflect on the work that lied ahead after SMART commitments were made at N4G by governments, businesses, and civil society alike. 
The full list of all N4G Side Events organized by ATNI is provided below, and links to the recordings can be found on the ATNI website, here:
&#x2022;	16th November: SMART private sector workforce nutrition commitments: Leveraging the workplace to bring improved nutrition to millions of employees 
&#x2022;	23rd November: Scaling up the contribution of SMEs to nutrition &#x2013; tools and SUN Business Network case studies
&#x2022;	25th November: Private Sector Nutrition Action: New Data to Inform Private Sector Commitments on Supply Chain Workforce Nutrition
&#x2022;	29th November: Introducing the N4G Business Constituency Group: How business is stepping up to tackle malnutrition
&#x2022;	30th November: The Business and Investment Case for Nutrition
&#x2022;	2nd December: Accountability for action: Breaking down barriers to strong commitment making

&#x2022;	7th December: Building sustainable healthy diets and food systems: Aiming to improve nutritional literacy that leads to behavior modification
&#x2022;	16th December: Action on accountability: Lessons learnt and the way forward beyond the N4G Summit
The N4G Side Events not only helped ATNI gain new visibility and strengthen its position as the expert organization on corporate accountability for nutrition, but also helped ATNI grow its network and create new partnerships with a variety of stakeholders. 
 
Core Objective 6: Develop Action Research Activities

ATNI is conducting various action research activities to develop knowledge on nutrition topics relevant for its work.

Action Research on Complementary Foods

ATNI is currently working on finalizing the study on Commercially Produced Complementary Foods for Mexico and will be publishing it in Q1 2022. 

The work of COMMIT &#x2013; the consortium on Commercially Produced Complementary Foods in Southeast Asia led by UNICEF EAPRO &#x2013; is continuing and ATNI as a consortium partner is joining the regular calls and providing input as needed. ATNI will be using data from the consortium to develop a regional benchmark in 2022, as well as country briefings, looking at the 7 countries selected - Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Thailand, and Vietnam. ATNI is conducting this piece of work with new funding by Irish Aid. 

Action Research on Workforce Nutrition in Value Chains

ATNI has published a discussion paper titled &#x2018;Workforce nutrition programs in supply chains &#x2013; The benefits of addressing malnutrition among supply chain workers and how to do so&#x2019;, along with 6 company studies namely: Nature&#x2019;s Pride, Nestl&#xE9;, Twinings, Unilever, Olam and VF Corporation. 
The reports and case studies were published on the website and shared with selected stakeholders. ATNI also gave a preview of the results of this research project during an N4G webinar in November. This work will be instrumental in further strengthening ATNI&#x2019;s methodologies on workforce and supply chain nutrition. 

Action Research on Product Inequities

ATNI&#x2019;s latest Global Product Profile, undertaken as part of the Global Access to Nutrition Index 2021, assessed the relative healthiness of the product portfolio of the largest 25 food and beverage manufacturers globally across 25 countries. ATNI has written a short research paper to explore to what extent the healthiness of companies&apos; portfolios varies by country, as an add-on to the Global Product Profile 2021. 

 In 2018 it seemed high income markets had higher overall HSRs compared to middle income markets. However, this 2021 paper highlights that whilst there are differences in the mean healthiness (HSR) of product portfolios across all countries and categories assessed, no evident patterns across income level and/or geographic region could be identified. At company level, discrepancies were found in the mean healthiness of products in the same categories across different markets.
The main message from the Inequities paper is supporting the overall message of the Global Product Profile 2021, that companies should do more to increase the healthiness of their portfolios and ensure that consumers are offered products with high nutritional quality and similar levels of healthiness across all countries where companies sell their products. The Inequities paper was published on the ATNI website in December 2021, following the Nutrition for Growth Summit.   

Large Scale Food Fortification Scoping exercise

ATNI started designing the Large-Scale Food Fortification scoping project in September 2021. This action research is part of the 2021-2023 BMGF grant received by ATNI. The topic of Food Fortification is already embedded in a range of activities and accountability tools developed by ATNI. Building up on this knowledge ATNI will conduct a scoping exercise focusing on two countries where specific activities were implemented, namely India, for which two Spotlight Indexes were published, and Nigeria, where the Nutrition Business Monitor tool was tested. 
The objective of the exercise is to provide a better understanding of the components and actors of the Food Fortification value chains with a specific focus on Nigeria and India, and to identify knowledge and data gaps on the role companies play. The findings of the exercise will serve as a basis in defining the role that ATNI can play with regards to monitoring the role of the private sector in the Food Fortification value chain to drive positive change in fighting micronutrient deficiencies.
ATNI will produce a report presenting key findings from the scoping exercise including desk research and the outcome of the consultations. In addition, 3 to 4 case studies (focused on India and Nigeria) will be shared. These will be presented at strategic workshop held with the BMGF with the aim of agreeing on a scenario of integration of Large-Scale Food Fortification in ATNI&#x2019;s methodology. In the second year of the grant, ATNI will start implementing this scenario in either new or ongoing projects. 

Core Objective 7: Develop Monitoring and Evaluation

ATNI has hired a firm called Steward Redqueen to conduct an independent impact assessment and M&amp;E review of the organization. The draft inception report of this assessment was first shared in July. A desk review began shortly after. Interviews with external stakeholders were conducted through October. In total, 52 key experts including senior management, staff, funding partners, investors, industry experts, civil society partners and food &amp; beverage companies targeted by ATNI&#x2019;s accountability tools, were interviewed. Besides interviews, the evaluation was supported by in-depth review of key documents, analysis of performance data, a survey among staff. The four different types of sources allowed for robust analysis and triangulation of all data, opinions, and findings.
On December 16, the Steward Redqueen team presented the main findings and recommendations of the independent review to the Board. 
On the second day of the Board meeting, December 17th, recommendations were analyzed in more details. The decision was made to create two Board sub-committees focusing on Fundraising and Strategy and Organization. The enhancement of the M&amp;E system will be taken onboard by ATNI with support of Steward Redqueen in the first Quarter of 2022. The suggestions gathered in the Board meeting will serve as a basis to prepare the management response to the review. This response will include an overview of actions that ATNI intends to take to act upon the main recommendations of the report. 
Next steps: ATNI will share the report with its staff in January 2022. An internal workshop will be organized for Steward Redqueen to present main findings. This will give the opportunity to gather staff&#x2019;s suggestions to act upon key recommendations of the report. The Board sub-committees on Fundraising and Strategy and Organization will meet in January and February and present their proposed roadmaps to the Board in February 2022. 

Additional Objective 1: Developing indexes that assess the performance of other key segments of the F&amp;B industry, e.g., retailers, food service companies, fast food chains (not funded by DGIS, not part of prolongation)

ATNI UK Retailer Index

The UK Retailer Index is assessing 11 retailers in the UK on nutrition. The methodology for this Index was published in May 2021. The data input and engagement phase were finalized at the end of August 2021. 9 out of 11 retailers have engaged on the platform. ATNI has also engaged with several of the retailers in one-on-one calls to clarify outstanding points. All engagement so far has been positive. Four retailers have signed a non-disclosure agreement.
From September onwards, the platform has closed, the team has analyzed the input from the engagement phase, after which quality control checks were performed through peer review and review sessions. Meanwhile, we have tested the algorithm and multiplier effects.  
Next steps: Currently the team is drafting the report and scorecards, after which review, and further quality control checks will start. The scorecards will be sent to all retailers before the launch for fact-checking. Another meeting with the UK Retailer Expert Group will be held in January for expert input for elevating the findings. Publication is scheduled for Q2 2022.

UK Product Profile

Also, from the partnership with ShareAction, and funded by Impact on Urban Health, part of Guy&#x2019;s &amp; St Thomas&#x2019; Foundation, the UK Product Profile 2021 was launched on the ATNI website on September 23rd. The U.K. Product Profile 2021 is the second of its kind, following the first UK Product Profile published in 2019. The 2021 report assessed the nutritional quality of more than 4,000 products from 16 of the world&#x2019;s largest food and beverage manufacturers active in the U.K., using the data from the 2021 Global Access to Nutrition Index. The products analysed accounted for approximately 50% of total U.K. retail sales of manufacturer brands&#x2019; packaged foods and beverages in 2019. This report was launched on the 23rd of September, the day of the UN Food Systems Summit. The key messages from this report are included in previous quarter&#x2019;s report. The launch was jointly promoted across Twitter and LinkedIn by ATNI and ShareAction (see the Communications &amp; Outreach section of this report for further details on the social media campaign). On October 26th, ATNI presented the findings of the UK Product Profile in a webinar organized by ShareAction. 

Additional Objective 2: New Spotlight Indexes (not funded by DGIS, not part of prolongation)
US Spotlight Index 

ATNI began preparatory work on the second US Spotlight Index in 2021. Based on insights gained through a set of tools to test and improve clarity of indicators and answer options in the US Index methodology (a 15-min survey and cognitive interviews with 6 of the 11 companies of the US Index), adjustments were made in Q3 of 2021 to the US Index methodology. Specifically, lowered number of indicators, simplified answer options, integrated disclosure element within questions, integrated relevant information within questions, and reformulated questions to better link to company actions in the US. In the last quarter, ATNI had further consultations with the Expert Group and subject specialists on finalization of the methodology. Some key topics discussed related to the definition of priority populations in the US context and recent developments around federal assistance programs. After these consultations, the research team reviewed the adjusted methodology together to reach agreement on interpretation of final methodology. Data collection began in December.  

Next steps: ATNI plans to continue with the data collection in January 2022. Companies will gain access to their initial company assessment and will be able to respond with comments and additional materials in February 2022. The US Index is planned to be launched in Q2 of 2022.

India Index

Following on from the launch of the India Index earlier 2021, consultations for the next Index will begin first quarter of 2022. In Q4 2021, ATNI has aligned with the World Benchmarking Alliance and Food Foundation about a national benchmark pilot in India and is providing expert input as well as ensuring complementarity (see also below the section on WBA). Furthermore, the India Index team is aligning regularly with the Large-Scale Food Fortification team in ATNI to ensure findings and approaches are considered for the upcoming India Index 2023. 

Next steps: Consultations for the India Index 2023 will start in Q1 2022, including a field visit depending on the COVID-19 situation. After this visit, the methodology development will start, taking into consideration the findings of the Large-Scale Food Fortification scoping exercise. Pre-population will start in latter half of the year, followed by company engagement. Analysis of the results, reviews and chapter writing will be in Q4 2022- Q1 2023. 

Additional Objective 3: Further development of verification-type activities  (not funded by DGIS, not part of prolongation)

Nutrition Business Monitor 

The Nutrition Business Monitoring (NBM) project is dedicated to developing and testing a self-assessment for Small and Medium Enterprises to test opportunities for improving their impact on nutrition. The project is funded by GAIN and the tool has been tested in Nigeria and Bangladesh.

During Q4, ATNI worked on analysing the data from the company testing and working on the final project report that will be published in Q1 2022. The idea is to present the methodology and the findings from this project, including how the tool was developed, the results of the testing, as well as the capacity building element through a global webinar and in country.  ATNI is also working on an open access toolkit that will be published in its website, that will include the methodology and a description of the tool, as well as a generic version of the tool open for everyone to download and use. The project will end in March 2022. 
ATNI is in discussions with GAIN on how to take the NBM tool forward in the next years.

ATNI also presented the NBM tool in an N4G side event focusing on SMEs and their role on nutrition in November.
Next steps: ATNI is planning to travel to Nigeria and Bangladesh in February to hold the final national workshops to present findings and engage with stakeholders to discuss opportunities for rolling out the tool further to other countries where SMEs play a crucial role in diets.  

Responsible Lobbying Framework 

Responsible Lobbying

ATNI has acquired new funding by Irish Aid to conduct a new Spotlight on Lobbying with a focus on all Global Index companies. The project will start in Q1 2022, and the report will be published in Q3.  
&#x2003;
Extra activities 2020-2022  (not funded by DGIS, not part of prolongation)

The Nutrition for Growth Summit

After the many side-event that were organised a few weeks prior to the N4G, the actual N4G Summit took place on 7th-8th December. The first day included presentations from governments, private sector, and UN agencies on the commitments they made in the framework of the Summit. The second day focused on the 5 main themes of the Summit. There was an overarching session on finance and accountability as these are the two cross-cutting themes, and then three consecutive sessions on health, diets, and resilience. In-between the sessions, various stakeholders from governments, private sector and NGOs presented their commitments. 

Prior to the Summit, ATNI attended all Business Constituency Group (BCG) meetings as an observer/advisor. ATNI engaged bilaterally with the Government of Japan to define a clear process on the participation of BMS companies in the Summit. ATNI has been assessing the roadmaps of some of the Japanese companies that wanted to participate to the Summit. The basis for the assessments was the Call to Action (see page 8) which is aligned with the N4G Principles of Engagement. 
Together with GNR and Results UK, ATNI was co-leading the Thematic Working Group on Accountability which was revived - along with the other Thematic Working Groups &#x2013; two months before the Summit to provide input to the agenda of the Summit. The three co-leads, with input from the members of the working group, defined the agenda on Accountability for the second day of the Summit, as well as led the organization of 2 N4G side events on accountability. The first side event focused on focused on engaging all stakeholders in a discussion on the importance of accountability, specifically challenging the idea of accountability as a barrier to progress. Speakers representing the thematic working groups, as well as speakers from existing accountability mechanisms presented and discussed the importance of accountability for commitment-making and how accountability can be raised as the key element for enhancing nutrition policies. The second event aimed to be an opportunity to take stock of the commitments made - celebrating the tremendous effort from all participants - to discuss the key takeaways and learnings from the Summit and explore the future of accountability, engaging with key accountability mechanisms to understand the way forward for progress on nutrition and strengthened accountability (see also the section on Outreach above). 

Next steps: In 2022 ATNI will engage further with GNR on how to monitor accountability of commitments that were made at the Summit. Providing sufficient funding ATNI will monitor company accountability in this respect. A Technical Support group with representatives from different angels will be set up by GNR to lead in this.

WHO Global Monitoring Mechanism

This project includes an analysis on the levels of total fat, saturated fat, trans fats, industrially product trans-fat (iTFA) and ingredients to see how far companies have come in meeting their commitment to reduce iTFA in products. ATNI had a call with WHO, IFBA and the 11 IFBA companies being assessed in this project in July. Following the call, ATNI and WHO decided to proceed with data analysis. ATNI currently finished working on updating data for the public report with WHO. 

Next steps: ATNI and WHO will have a call to discuss an update on the projects progress on January 20th.  ATNI will also continue to work on the two reports and discuss with WHO about publication, launch date, and possible event and social media.  

Collaboration with World Benchmarking Alliance

ATNI will continue to collaborate and exchange with WBA and Food Foundation to align and strengthen accountability mechanisms for benchmarking the food industry. At the moment, ATNI is part of the Food Foundation&#x2019;s and WBA&#x2019;s coalition on national benchmarks and has been involved in the process of reviewing a toolkit developed by WBA and FF to inform national benchmarks. ATNI will continue this close collaboration and feed into the pilot benchmark in India to ensure alignment between ATNI&#x2019;s India Index and company accountability work and the pilot benchmark. Furthermore, WBA and ATNI collaborated on various side-events of the N4G, including workforce nutrition and accountability. 
Next steps: In January there is an exchange meeting planned with FF, WBA and the India team to exchange and support the India testing of the toolkit.</narrative>
