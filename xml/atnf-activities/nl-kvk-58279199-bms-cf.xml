   <narrative xml:lang="EN">ATNF continued the dialogue with FTSE Russell and BMGF to determine the role and measurements of responsible marketing of BMS for the next on-the-ground assessments and the 2020 Global Index. A proposal for supplement funding by BMGF for BMS was submitted and approved. Therefore, ATNF is ready to start with next in-country assessments, still using the Netcode protocol. What is new is the new role division between ATNF and FTSE and their implementing partners Westat and PWC. ATNF has agreed to sub-contract both Westat and PwC. Westat is the main service provider for ATNF&#x2019;s BMS studies since their inception and PwC will be sub-contracted to do part of the work as they did for FTSE previously. Additionally, PwC will prepare the FTSE final report. All the data collection will be done by Westat. The two countries for the in-country assessments have now been selected and during this reporting period ATNF worked out a detailed planning of activities. The process is still ongoing and the assess-ment of the first country should start during Q3. The BMS Marketing assessment methodology is now finalised; all forms and tables are being updated based on the new NetCode protocol and WHA 69.9. Additionally, ATNF included an extra control step in the research process to ensure high quality of results. Westat will do a 100% quality check on all the incidences of non-compliance and the companies will have access to ATNF&#x2019;s online platform to review the findings and provide feedback. ATNF is increasingly acknowledged as an outstanding independent party in the sector of BMS Market-ing and Code compliance. As such, ATNF was invited to attend and present its Thailand and Nigeria BMS marketing assessments at a WHO NetCode meeting in Geneva in April. In June, ATNF participat-ed in a &#x2018;deep dive&#x2019; session organised by one of the major baby food manufacturers.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">ATNI concluded the dialogue with FTSE Russell and BMGF and agreed on the roles and meas-urements of responsible marketing of BMS for the next on-the-ground assessments and the 2020 Global Index. ATNI has started with the preparations for the next in-country assessments, still using the NetCode protocol. Focus was given on setting up solid management and monitor-ing systems to make sure all processes run as smoothly as possible. The two countries for the in-country assessments were selected and during this reporting peri-od ATNI worked on finalising contracts with Westat and PwC. The contract with PwC is now fi-nalised and with Westat the preparatory contracts have been signed. Westat went on and re-cruited local partners in the two selected countries. Country names are confidential and will not be disclosed until the data collection is over. The process is still ongoing and the assessment of the first country should start in January 2020 and the data collection in the second one will fol-low right after in February 2020.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">ATNI is gearing up its preparations to undertake two further in-country assessments of BMS Marketing with Westat during 2019, to feed into the rankings of BMS companies within the 2020 Global Index. Moreover, we have been working to strengthen ATNI&#x2019;s position as the recognized assessor of BMS Marketing practices by becoming the provider of data from the in-country assessments we conduct for each Global Index to FTSE Russell for use in its FTSE4Good Indexes, instead of PWC which has provided such data previously. It has now been agreed that BMGF, which has funded FTSE Russell&#x2019;s assessments to date, will make ATNI the sole grantee for this work, transferring the funding allocated to FTSE Russell to ATNI. FTSE Russell will continue to sub-contract PWC to undertake certain tasks utilizing the data ATNI provides. We are in the final stages of finalizing the agreements with all parties. In March and April, ATNI will identify and agree the countries for two assessments in 2019 with FTSE4Good and our donors, and the BMS Marketing methodology will be reviewed. U.S. Spotlight Index &#x2022; Apart from the follow up with individual companies as described above (Core Objective 1, Progress Global Indexes) the cooperation with Partnership for a Healthier America to organize thematic meetings is taking shape. ATNF is organising a roundtable during the PHA Summit in Chicago early April. Companies have showed interest in topics like Marketing to Children and Affordability and Accessibility. Further planning of meetings is discussed during the summit. &#x2022; The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation has shown interest in a second iteration of a U.S. Spotlight Index for 2021. An initial proposal was discussed and reviewed by RWJF and will lead to an invita-tion to submit an official proposal in April. Nigeria Spotlight Index We are still exploring funding options for a Nigeria Spotlight Index, to be conducted in 2019 and pub-lished in 2020. We expect to know if funding can be assured by mid-April.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">To determine the role and measurements of responsible marketing of BMS for the 2018 Global Index, various roundtables, individual consultations and an online survey were held. Four companies (Nestle, Danone, FrieslandCampina and Abott) were actively engaged and participated in the online survey together with the International Special Dietary Foods Industries Association (ISDI). Overall, companies expressed their support for ATNF and are expected to stay engaged going forward. The BMS Expert Group (EG) collaborated with ATNF to assess responses. In May 2017, ATNF held consultation calls with its BMS Expert Group. The structure of the 2018 BMS assessment stays predominantly unchanged. To provide consistency between 2016 and 2018 results, no major changes are being made to the structure. BMS1 Corporate Profile &amp; BMS2 In-country BMS marketing assessments will carry rated equally (50/50) The same goes for each of the two in-country studies. The maximum deduction on a company&#x2019;s score can be 1.5 points. ATNF will be moving to using NetCode protocol instead of IGBM for the incountry assessments, and continually improving the methodology where possible. NetCode recently came into existence after a request was made by Member States to WHO, related to the need for practical and concrete guidelines and procedures for Code monitoring. ATNF&#x2019;s whole approach will be extended to cover products marketed for infants and young children up to 36 months of age in line with WHA resolution 69.9 of May 2016. Westat is ATNF business service provider for BMS in-country assessments and will be conducting BMS studies in two selected countries in 2017. Each Westat study will be published when finished, i.e. on a rolling basis, accompanied by an ATNF summary report. Both countries&#x2019; results will be reflected fully in Index reports. ATNF presented the Index and the BMS component to a wide range of stakeholders in one of the in-country assessment countries mid-June. ATNF received wide support for a BMS in-country study as it would provide a baseline against which to measure the impact of the forthcoming new national regulations. It is highly likely that NGOs will draw on ATNF material for advocacy work in the future. Globally, only 38% of babies are exclusively bre astfed for the first 6 months . (WHO) Just 1 in 5 children is breastfed for 12 months in high - income countries, while a third of children aged between 6 months and 2 years receive no breast milk at all in low - and middle income countries. (WHO) WHO has se t target of increasing the rate of exclusive breastfeeding in the first six months to 50% by 2025. (WHO) If all children were optimally breastfed by the age of two, 800.000 infant lives could be saved every year. (WHO) Studies published in The Lancet in 20163 confirmed that babies fed exclusively on breast - milk for at least the first 6 months have the best chance of thriving through childhood and adolescence. (The Lancet) FACTS ABOUT BREASTFEEDING August 2017 15 Future alignment with FTSE4Good At a stakeholder consultation meeting in June, ATNF and FTSE presented a proposal for FTSE4Good to draw on ATNF&#x2019;s NetCode studies from 2019. The FTSE4Good Index Series is designed to measure the performance of companies demonstrating strong Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) practices. FTSE will combine the results from these studies with additional research done by PWC to determine whether BMS companies can stay on the FTSE4Good Index. ATNF will continue to engage with FTSE4Good and PWC to discuss details regarding such a collaboration.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">&#x2022; After the Thailand in-country assessment was published in February, the Nigeria report was released in early April. &#x201C;We are pleased that ATNF has undertaken this important study with Westat and OPM in Nigeria. The Government of Nigeria is committed to improving the rate of exclusive breastfeeding while sustaining the high rate of breastfeeding and curtailing the inappropriate marketing of breast-milk substitutes.&#x201D; Dr. Chris Isokpunwu, Head of Nutrition, Federal Ministry of Health, Nigeria &#x2022; Local stakeholders showed their appreciation for the assessment done via responses in social media, as well as emails to the ATNF team. &#x2022; Discussions continue to take place with FTSE and PwC about future collaboration on these in-country studies. A detailed activity plan has been developed. &#x2022; To follow up the publication of the Global Index 2018, ATNF hosted a Webinar in partnership with US-based NGO 1,000 Days, which examined how we can best move forward with the findings from the BMS Marketing assessment. Civil-society organizations such as NCD Alliance, UNICEF, Save the Children US, Helen Keller International and others such as the World Food Program and American Society of Paediatrics participated in the webinar.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">&#x2022; July: In July, the research team prepared and pre-populated the platform to go online for the selected companies to work in. 2018 Surveys were developed and last updates on the methodology were incorporated. In-country assessments, including training and data collection started in Thailand during the month of July. ATNF visited Thailand for these trainings and organized meetings with local stakeholders. &#x2022; August: The BMS/Complementary Feeding (CF) Corporate Profile methodology was revised to incorporate feedback from stakeholders, and align to WHA resolution 69.9 that passed in May 2016. ATNF circulated in early August a comprehensive methodology document that explains the changes to BMS/CF1, as well as the full BMS/CF1 methodology, and the key elements of the BMS/CF2 assessment changes (e.g. NetCode). In-country assessments in Nigeria started in the month of August. &#x2022; September: ATNF organized a company webinar for the companies that are assessed on the BMS/CF methodology (companies in the Global Index and US Index that also produce baby food plus the largest formula manufacturers globally and in the US) to share final methodologies and training in using the platform. Data Collection was finalized in Nigeria and ATNF visited the country to conduct local stakeholder meetings in Abuja.</narrative>
