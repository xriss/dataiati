   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Access to Nutrition Foundation is currently in the process of a strategic review to study what the future of the Foundation should look like. Carnstone was appointed to conduct this review and has completed interviews with around 25 key stakeholders by the end of May 2017. ATNF has received the first draft of the report in mid-June and will discuss the full draft of the report with Board and funders on July 6th, in New York. Carnstone will finalise their report, based on feedback received, by July 20th. The report will propose potential business models for expansion of ATNF activities, for instance increasing the number of Spotlight Country Indexes or expanding the scope of the Index from F&amp;B manufacturers to other players in the food supply chain.</narrative>
