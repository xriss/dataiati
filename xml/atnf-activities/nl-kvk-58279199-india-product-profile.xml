Additional Product Profile activities in Q1 2018 have been: &#x2022; In early 2018, ATNF made a final decision on how best to integrate the Product Profile (PP) into the Global Index 2018 and the first draft of the PP chapter for the Global Index report was written. &#x2022; A comparison between PP assessment findings regarding percentages of healthy products per company and company self-reported percentages of healthy products was completed. Results of this comparison were included in the draft chapter on Category B, Products, of the Global Index report. &#x2022; The full-length report of the PP, prepared by The George Institute (TGI) in Q4 2017, was reviewed and arrangements were made to finalize it in Q1 2018 for publication in line with the Global Index report (in Q2). &#x2022; The PP Chapter and the pre-final full-length TGI report were reviewed by the ATNF Expert Group. &#x2022; The PP sub-analysis for the US Index report was postponed until Q2. Two additional and closely related verification-type activities were conducted by ATNF in partnership with TGI and Innova Market Insights, two organizations with historic nutrition label information databases. The objective was to perform two pilot studies to verify whether companies have made relevant progress in their efforts to reduce salt/sodium across their product portfolios. These assessments were set up and performed in Q1 2018, covering all companies assessed in the Global Index that were active on the Australian market between 2013-2017 in one study and all IFBA companies in four countries (Australia, India, US, UK) over the last decade. The objective was to add the results of these pilot studies to the PP chapter of the Global Index report.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Additional Objective 3 focuses on further development of complementary verification-type activities, such as the Product Profile assessments. Additional Product Profiling activities (not in the contract) in Q2 2018 have been: &#x2022; The nine-country Product Profile assessment was included within the Global Index 2018 on May 23. &#x2022; The Product Profile for the US Index report, a sub-analysis of the nine-country Product Profile, with additional detail on the results for the US Index companies, was undertaken in Q2 and the first draft was written for inclusion in the US Index report. &#x2022; An additional sub-analysis of the nine-country Product Profile, focusing on country-level differences in the average healthiness of packaged food and beverage products, was drafted and shared with the authors/editors of the Global Nutrition Report (GNR), in preparation of the GNR 2018 publication in Q4. Other verification-type activities completed by ATNF in Q1 2018 in collaboration with its research partners were assessments of the product reformulation targets of companies that are members of the International Food and Beverage Alliance (IFBA) as well as being included in the 2018 Global Index. In addition, historic evidence of sodium reductions in products on the Australian market during 2006-2017 was assessed. Reporting on these studies was finalized in Q2 and incorporated as case studies in the Product Profile section of the 2018 Global Index report. In June 2018, WHO invited ATNF to participate in a stakeholder consultation in London about its proposal to develop a new global mechanism to assess F&amp;B sector companies&#x2019; progress in meeting global nutrition targets at a global and country level. The briefing papers for the meeting heavily referenced ATNI&#x2019;s work. WHO envisioned that the mechanism would assess both the progress of F&amp;B manufacturers&#x2019; in meeting a set of food composition targets, which WHO would establish in consultation with government and non-government actors, as well as their policies and commitments on nutrition labelling, promotion to children and adolescents and product accessibility, compared to WHO-set benchmarks derived from established WHO recommendations.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Additional Objective 3 focuses on further development of complementary verification-type activities, such as the Product Profile assessments. Additional Product Profiling activities (not in the contract): &#x2022; July/August: The George Institute (TGI), that is conducting the Product Profile assessment for ATNF, extracted nutrition data for companies&#x2019; products in nine markets (if available), including the US. US is one of the nine markets in the Product Profile for the Global Index. Products of the ten companies in the US market have been assessed through the Product Profiling exercise. &#x2022; September: TGI nutrition content information was shared with companies to check or add to. A significant increase in company engagement was observed: 12 companies shared their own nutrition content data and another four responded in some way.</narrative>

Additional Product Profiling activities (not in the contract): &#x2022; October-December: The George Institute (TGI), that is conducting the Product Profile assessment for ATNF, analyzed collected data, together with sales data and started writing product profile reports, including a US market analysis. &#x2022; ATNF had discussions with TGI and other experts (Mike Rayner) about initial findings of the Product Profile research. &#x2022; In early 2018 ATNF will make final decisions on how to best integrated into the Global Index 2018 and will write the PP chapter for the Global Index report and the PP for the US Index report (Feb/March). Another verification-type activity that was conducted by ATNF in Q4, was an assignment on assessing company targets of companies that are also member of the International Food and Beverage Alliance (IFBA). Several companies that are assessed by ATNF in the Global Index are also member of IFBA. For IFBA these companies disclosed several reformulation targets. ATNF assessed the quality of these targets. The results will be published in the Global Index 2018 in the Category about Product reformulation.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Additional Product Profiling activities (not in the contract) in Q3 were; &#x2022; Finalizing the draft of the U.S. Index report chapter on the Product Profile assessment, which was a sub-study of the Global Index 2018 multi-country Product Profile assessment. &#x2022; Developing a project proposal for funding by BMGF to explore options for an improved Nutrient Profiling System with a micronutrient component and to incorporate it in future iterations of our Indexes. This project aims to objectively assess how company products can contribute to address-ing undernutrition, focusing specifically on micronutrient deficiencies. The proposal was submitted to and discussed with BMGF in Q3. &#x2022; Continued dialogue with GAIN on a cooperation to develop a self-assessment tool in Sun Business Network countries for small and medium scale enterprises.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">As planned for the Global Index 2020, the integration of the Product Profile results in category B (Products) of the Corporate Profile is first applied in this year&#x2019;s India Spotlight Index. The Product Profile assessment is performed by The George Institute of Public Health. In addi-tion, a collaboration with Innova Market Insights was started. Both The George Institute and Innova Market Insights have product databases with nutrition information in India. For this pro-ject, the relevant data in both databases is combined to have the most complete and up-to-date product information to start the assessment with. In August companies reviewed initial lists of product categories and individual products that AT-NI selected for the analysis (all distinct products in the top 5 -by sales revenues- product cate-gories for each company). Some companies added newly introduced products to the lists or re-quested to remove products that were no longer produced. In September The George Institute started the product profile research based on the adapted product lists.</narrative>

Stake-holders in India (including the companies) were further informed during the visit in March and largely supported this development. It will create one overall ranking of the companies instead of two separate rankings. A comparison with the results of the 2016 Product Profile assessment to show development over time will be part of the analysis. &#x2022; The Product Profile assessment will be done by The George Institute of Public Health like for the previous assessments. Companies will be informed about the product categories and specific prod-ucts that will be included in May (to review the lists).</narrative>
