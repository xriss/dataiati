   <narrative xml:lang="EN">1. Introduction The Access to Nutrition Initiative (ATNI), an independent non-profit organization based in the Netherlands, is dedicated to driving changes in the global nutrition landscape by tracking and assessing the food industry&#x2019;s attempts to tackle undernutrition, obesity and diet-related chronic diseases through designing and delivering a range of accountability tools. The organization influences the industries&#x2019; contribution to address global nutrition challenges, by objectively assessing the food industry and publishing Global and Spotlight Country Nutrition Indexes and by developing new accountability tools and studies to support this. ATNI aims to encourage companies both to increase access to healthy products and to responsibly exercise their influence on consumers&#x2019; choice and behavior. The organization in 2019 worked on a wide range and growing number of activities to drive the private sector&#x2019;s performance on healthy affordable diets beyond its flagship Global Index and Spotlight Country Indexes. To reflect the strategic choice to expand the scope of its benchmarking work and develop new accountability tools, a new name and branding (with adapted logo) was chosen and introduced in 2019: &#x2018;Access to Nutrition Initiative&#x2019;. The acronym ATNI coincides with that of the Access to Nutrition Index, well known by all stakeholders working with, or making use of the organization&apos;s products over the last six years. With a new design agency all the groundwork was done for the organization&#x2019;s new interactive website along with the new house style and branding to be launched early 2020. The organization&#x2019;s legal status as foundation and registration in The Netherlands as the &#x2018;Stichting Access to Nutrition Foundation&#x2019; does not change. Throughout 2019, the organization has done the necessary preparatory work such as industry engagement, data collection, and data processing, required for the launch of the second iteration of the India Spotlight Index in February 2020. Additionally, the preparatory work for the second US Spotlight Index has been started to facilitate the assessment in 2020 and launching the report in the second quarter of 2021. In 2019, ATNI has done an intensive revision of the methodology for the Global Index to adopt the most recent contextual changes and to incorporate stakeholders&#x2019; feedback for the Global Index 2020. Working with and supported by the Global Alliance on Improved Nutrition (GAIN), ATNI started the design and development of a self-assessment tool for small and medium-sized companies in countries with rapidly emerging food and beverage (F&amp;B) industries that have a national Scaling up Nutrition (SUN) Business Network. The tool aims to help small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to be aware of their role and opportunities to improve nutrition and benchmark their performance against their peers and larger companies. In Nigeria and Bangladesh, a total of 50 SMEs and civil society organizations and government agencies are helping to build this tool and make it as relevant as possible for the local context. A first draft version of the tool will be tested in these countries early 2020. ATNI took part in the preparations for the Tokyo Nutrition for Growth (N4G) Summit planned for 2020. The organization was invited to be part of different working groups (on data &amp; accountability and food systems) to set the agenda and set the stage for meaningful and specific, measurable, achievable, realistic, and time-bound (SMART) commitments by all stakeholders and specifically the private sector. Along with GAIN, ATNI has organized an international conference in The Hague to build business commitments for N4G. The World Health Organization (WHO) asked ATNI to help set up a global monitoring mechanism to track company reformulation efforts on salt and added sugar. In November, ATNI has published the UK Product Profile Report which revealed that some 18 largest F&amp;B manufacturers in the U.K need to increase their sales of healthy products to demonstrate that they are serious about making a meaningful contribution to consumers&#x2019; diets and public health. This should also help address the mounting business risks associated with poor diets, deal with or be prepared for regulatory intervention and the impacts on productivity among their workforces. In collaboration with ShareAction and with funding from the Guy&#x2019;s and St Thomas&#x2019; Charity, ATNI took first steps to look at the vital role the retail sector has to play in providing affordable, healthy diets to all consumers. To expand the scope of its work to this part of the food value chain, ATNI studied the UK food retail sector to shed light on the commitments and contributions of the ten largest UK food and drink retailers in regard to promoting healthy food and helping consumers to move away from high fat, salt and sugar products. The results will be presented in a report early 2020. After summer, ATNI has started action research to investigate two Index topics, namely 1: Access and Affordability of healthy food and 2: Nutrition quality of complementary foods for young children. In these categories, companies in general score low or international guidelines and standards are lacking. Since the launch of the first Global Index in 2013, more than 72 investment firms have become signatories to the Access to Nutrition Index Investor Statement, with over $7 trillion assets under management. We are pleased to mention that complementing the multi-year core funding that ATNI receives from the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, the Netherlands&#x2019; Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the UK Department for International Development in 2019 our organization has additionally received support from GAIN for the Nutrition Business Monitor project and the Guy&apos;s and St Thomas&apos; NHS Foundation Trust through ShareAction for the work on the UK Product Profile and the retailer study. At the end of 2019, ATNI also signed an agreement with Irish Aid to fund the development of new accountability tools to increase transparency around baby food companies&#x2019; lobbying and influencing of policymaking processes and with the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF) for the launch of the second U.S. Spotlight Index. Our team has grown steadily up to 12 by end 2019 and one additional staff member is to join the team in early 2020. Looking back at 2019, ATNI is increasingly recognized as an independent authority on benchmarking F&amp;B industry&apos;s efforts to contribute to better nutrition. Most of the companies assessed in the Indexes have been supportive and engaged during the research phase. Also, after the launch of the reports, they have actively communicated for validating the scores and followed up on the recommendations. Our engagement with companies for the upcoming Indexes has witnessed engagement, enthusiasm as well as a great commitment to improving their overall scores and contributions to tackle malnutrition. Our work is being increasingly recognized by the stakeholders engaged in the global nutrition landscape, including international organizations such as the World Health Organization (WHO) and UNICEF, civil society organizations and investors. Inge Kauer, Executive Director, Access to Nutrition Foundation &#x2003; 2. Global Index The third Global Access to Nutrition Index 2018, assessing the 22 globally largest F&amp;Bmanufacturers, has revealed that while the companies started increasingly emphasizing on their efforts to introduce better diets, still serious concerns remained on the healthiness of the product portfolios. ATNI, in 2018 and 2019, during the post-launch engagements shared this message with the companies which encouraged transformation and initiated changes. Listed companies (like Keurig Dr Pepper and Kraft Heinz) that did not actively engage during the Global and US Index 2018 research phase did show interest to discuss the findings of the 2018 Index and to actively engage in the iterations process for the upcoming Global Index 2020. In 2019, ATNI received some noteworthy recognition from the companies that it has assessed. Several companies, recognizing ATNI&#x2019;s Product Profile, indicated considering the Health Star Rating as an independent nutrient profiling system besides its internal system. ATNI&#x2019;s initiatives have been on the agenda of some companies&#x2019; Board meetings and influenced their strategy discussions. One company team indicated that the Index was a useful tool to drive their internal thinking and contributing to a portfolio with more &#x2018;nutrition positive&#x2019; products. Another company mentioned that ATNI&#x2019;s outreach at international fora and conferences was remarkable. In March 2019, Coca Cola&#x2019;s board reportedly opposed a shareholders resolution to report &#x2018;an assessment of risks to Coke&apos;s finances and reputation associated with changing scientific understanding of the role of sugar in disease causation&#x2019; as the Access to Nutrition Foundation, an independent nonprofit, already produces reports about Coke that address sugar and public health. ATNI continued consulting with all stakeholders, including the companies to gather feedback on the methodology review for the upcoming Global Access to Nutrition Index 2020. During the post-launch consultation process of Global Index 2018, ATNI received recommendations for the Index to reduce complexity and perceived duplications as well as incorporate vital changes and improvements that companies had initiated. Considering the feedback, in 2019, ATNI started a revision process for the Global Index methodology for the upcoming Global Index 2020. ATNI selected 25 companies in total for the Global Index 2020 iteration. The three new/additional companies are Keurig Dr Pepper (American company that was assessed for the U.S. Spotlight Index 2018, but not for the Global Index), China Mengniu and Yili (Chinese companies). In the last quarter of the year, ATNI went through a consultation process with all the companies to discuss the main changes and novelties of the Global Index methodology. The proposed main changes were also duly presented and discussed with the ATNI Expert Group and Board. Changes in Global Index 2020 Methodology &#x2022; In the Global Index 2018, the Corporate Profile and Product Profile were presented as separate outputs with different scores and rankings. The methodology review led to integrate the Product Profile results into Category B of the Corporate Profile to offer one overall Index ranking. For the Global Index 2020, these changes imply that the Product Profile being incorporated into Category B will carry 20% of the total Index weight. &#x2022; In the Global Index 2018, the company-wide actions for preventing and addressing undernutrition (among the populations at risk in developing countries) were assessed within an undernutrition section. The undernutrition indicators were not applied to companies that derived less than 5% of their F&amp;B revenues from non-OECD markets. In the Global Index 2020 methodology, the commitment of companies to specifically address the needs and key nutritional priorities for populations at-risk is considered relevant for both developed and developing countries. As a result, how comprehensively a company covers various forms of malnutrition, is based on the company&#x2019;s market presence and the specific micronutrient deficiencies/undernutrition issues in all markets. &#x2022; For the Global Index 2018 iteration, ATNI focused on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs); particularly with regards to reaching Goals 2 (zero hunger) and 3 (health and well-being for all). In the Global Index 2020 new methodology, ATNI has also incorporated indicators assessing companies&#x2019; efforts in reducing the per capita food loss and waste along F&amp;Bproduction and supply chains (from the post-harvest stage to the retail and consumer levels), in line with Sustainable Development Goal 12 (target 12.3). Stakeholders consultation and feedback on updated methodology Companies selected for the Global Index 2020 assessment were invited to take part in an online survey at the end of 2019. Overall, the stakeholders have received the revised methodology positively. Most of the companies that responded support the integration of the Product Profile into Category B (Formulating Appropriate Products). The consultation also involved investors as an important group of stakeholders in the overall process of the methodology revision. In December 2019, ATNI organized a webinar to collate feedback from the investors. The investor group has particularly appreciated the incorporation of the food loss and food waste concepts to the methodology. The combined stakeholders&#x2019; feedback was considered to finalize the Global Index methodology, which will be submitted to the Expert Group members for further review in January 2020. 3. Monitoring marketing of breast-milk substitutes and complementary foods Because of the importance of infant and young child nutrition (IYCN), each edition of the Global Access to Nutrition Index includes a breast-milk substitutes (BMS)/complementary foods (CF) Marketing sub-ranking that scores and ranks the world&#x2019;s largest baby food manufacturers&#x2019; marketing policies, and practices and disclosure. This analysis assesses the extent to which these companies market their products in line with the International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes (The Code) and subsequent relevant World Health Assembly (WHA) resolutions, including WHA 69.9 (together referred to as The Code) . We use a comprehensive, robust and published methodology to do so, developed with the advice of WHO, UNICEF and many other international experts and not-for-profit organizations dedicated to improving infant and young child nutrition (IYCN). ATNI&#x2019;s work In 2019, ATNI started preparing for the two assessments that will feed into the BMS/CF Marketing sub-ranking of the Global Index 2020. Whereas for the previous Index only six companies were included in this sub-ranking, for the next Global Index ATNI is extending its coverage to the ten largest baby food companies globally: Danone, FrieslandCampina, Kraft Heinz, Nestl&#xE9;, Abbott, RB/Mead Johnson Nutrition (RB/MJN), Pepsico, Feihe International, Inner Mongolia Yili Industrial Group and China Mengniu Dairy. Two emerging markets were selected in which NetCode studies will be undertaken to assess the extent of marketing of BMS and CF products. ATNI has again contracted Westat to conduct these studies. The BMS/CF Marketing assessment, including the two country reports, will be completed in 2020. New partnerships Additionally, ATNI partnered with FTSE Russell. In recent years, ATNI and FTSE Russell have conducted similar but separate in-country verification exercises of companies&#x2019; BMS Marketing. From 2019 onwards, ATNI will provide data to FTSE Russell from our in-country NetCode studies, to feed into its approach to determine whether BMS companies meet its criteria for inclusion in its FTSE4Good Indexes. ATNI will continue to apply its criteria and methodology as previously for its Indexes. For more information on the agreement between FTSE Russell and ATNI, please read the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs). How ATNI&#x2019;s work on BMS and CF Marketing is viewed and used ATNI is now widely recognized among key stakeholders that work on this topic as providing the definitive analysis of the major baby food companies&#x2019; marketing policies and practices. We publish a wide range of materials for use by stakeholders, including a dedicated chapter within each Global Index report, separate Scorecards for each BMS company, a summary report of each &#x2013; and in-country studies of marketing practices, as well as Westat&#x2019;s full technical reports of those studies. Some major institutional investors, such as Norges Bank Investment Management (NBIM) and BMO Global Asset Management, use our analysis to inform their engagement with these companies. The purpose of their engagement is to encourage companies to adopt policies and practices that implement The Code. ATNI has been approached by B-Lab, the organization that created B-Corp certification. B-Lab is planning to introduce new BMS Marketing standards, which any company wanting to become a B-Corp must meet. It is proposing to tie companies&#x2019; qualification for B Corp certification to a percentage score on our BMS/CF Marketing sub-ranking. Within the auspices of the N4G Summit, efforts are being made to encourage baby food companies to commit to full Code compliance by 2030, and to announce and take a major step forwards from their current policies and/or practices within 2020. Further, they are being asked to publish an action plan that sets out how they will achieve Code compliance over the next decade. ATNI has been proposed as the organization that will track companies&#x2019; implementation of those action plans. 4. India Spotlight Index, 2020 Company selection and engagement process Preparations for the second Access to Nutrition India Spotlight Index 2020, that started at the end of 2018, continued throughout 2019. The Index has built upon the analysis and the recognition that ATNI received from most stakeholders on the first India Index in 2016. The Index had been broadly recognized as influential in driving positive changes among Indian F&amp;B companies to emphasis on diet, nutrition and health issues. The Index also aimed to broadly complement the efforts made by other stakeholders, including the Government-led Eat Right India movement, to address all forms of malnutrition. ATNI research in 2019 mainly focused on the contribution made by the 16 largest F&amp;B manufacturers in India. The research investigated the companies&#x2019; policies, practices and disclosure related to nutrition uptake. The second India Spotlight Index covers the same topics and takes the same broad approach to assess, score and rank the companies as the first iteration. However, the methodology was updated to incorporate relevant feedback from companies, civil society stakeholders and a review panel of experts in India consisting of: &#x2022; Dr. Rajan Sankar, Director Nutrition and Vivek Arora, Senior Advisor, Tata Trusts; &#x2022; Rohini Saran, Deputy Lead Food Fortification Resource Centre, Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI); &#x2022; Dr. Avula Laxmaiah, Scientist &#x2018;G&#x2019; &amp; Head, Public Health, National Institute of Nutrition (NIN) Hyderabad, India; &#x2022; Devyani Hari, Director Programmes, Centre for Responsible Business (CRB); &#x2022; Rachna Sujay, Senior Technical Advisor Diffusion States, Alive &amp; Thrive; &#x2022; Dr. Antaryami Dash, Advisor Nutrition, Save the Children India; &#x2022; Shiva Mudgil, Vice President, RaboResearch Food &amp; Agribusiness, Rabobank India. Based on 2018 retail sales, the 16 largest F&amp;B manufacturers were selected for the India Spotlight Index 2020. These companies together accounted for 31% of India&#x2019;s packaged F&amp;B market share with a combined total retail sale of just over INR 1800 billion (approximately equivalent to EUR 21.89 billion). Eleven out of the sixteen companies have headquarters based in India and the other five are multinationals with headquarters elsewhere. Multiple stakeholders such as funders, nutrition experts, CSOs and Government bodies were consulted through roundtable meetings in early 2019. Eight companies and the industry association CII (the Confederation of Indian Industry) participated in a private sector roundtable, discussing the methodology and planning of the research. The ATNI team engaged with two more companies through separate meetings. Multi-stakeholder engagement The following civil society and public sector organizations participated in separate roundtables or were consulted separately on the methodology and during the research process. Research phase In May 2019, ATNI, organized webinars to inform companies on the use of the data gathering platform and further details on the India Spotlight Index research process and planning. Seven companies attended the webinars, and the rest of the companies were informed on the process through one-on-one meetings. Over summer, companies had the opportunity to access the online data gathering platform to see the first assessment and provide additional information or evidence. In August 2019, ATNI organized a visit to India for face-to-face meetings with senior management in some of the companies based in Kolkata, Chennai, Bangalore and Delhi. The main agenda of the meetings was explaining &#x2013; (a) the rationale and the mmethodology of the second ATNI India Index to the companies; (b) the importance for the companies to engage in the research process and the options to do so. Two new companies subsequently announced to participate in the research process actively. ATNI and its India-based communication partner AvianWe, also received remarkable attention from the print media with articles and interviews published in different local outlets during 2019 (see overview in the section outreach activities). End of August 2019, the Executive Director of ATNI, Inge Kauer was invited to speak at a National Nutrition Conclave in Delhi, organized by the Confederation of the Indian Industry&apos;s Food and Agriculture Centre of Excellence (FACE), and participated in a panel with industry and CSO representatives. Eight out of sixteen companies, selected for the second India Index, actively engaged during the research phase to provide additional information and evidence on organizations&#x2019; policies and practices. Four other companies that either participated in meetings (that the ATNI team organized to explain the methodology and research process) or met with ATNI staff individually, finally did not make use of the option to exchange information through ATNI&apos;s online data gathering platform in the research phase. The remaining four companies declined to engage due to other priorities. ATNI will further explore how best to encourage these companies to participate in the future Indexes. There was a substantial increase (from 3 in 2016 to 7 for the 2020 Index) in the number of companies providing data on their product lists for the Product Profile product assessments, which contributed significantly to the quality of the assessment. Analysis and launch preparation The subsequent analysis, quality checks and verifications and scoring of companies continued during the last quarter of 2019. Experts from ATNI&#x2019;s global Expert Group and in India from GAIN (Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition), CII (the Confederation of Indian Industry) and FSSAI (the Government Food Safety and Standards Authority), and Tata Trusts TINI (The India Nutrition Initiative)reviewed the main findings and messages. For each company, individual summary reports of main findings (the company scorecard) were drafted and shared with the companies for them to crosscheck any factual inconsistencies and disclosure of non-public data. This summary did not indicate how the companies scored and ranked in the overall Index. ATNI commissioned the George Institute for Global Health (The George Institute) to conduct the Product Profile assessment for the 16 companies selected in the India Index 2020. And they also analyzed changes in the nutritional profile of packaged F&amp;B products from 11 large companies in India over a three-year period. 1456 products marketed in India by the 16 companies were analyzed in the Product Profile assessment. Innova Market Insights (Innova), a commercial knowledge supplier for the F&amp;B industry, provided additional product composition data. Because of the extra efforts put in the company engagement and the consequently required longer research period, ATNI decided in consultation with stakeholders in India (Industry and Government) to postpone the launch of the second Index to February 2020. 5. Investor Engagement Collaborative Company Engagement by ATNI&#x2019;s Investor Signatories During 2019, ATNI continued to support a group of 31 of its 72 Investor Signatories that signed up to engage with the 18 listed companies included in the Global and US Indexes published in 2018. ATNI hosted quarterly calls with this investor group during the year to facilitate coordination of their work. Some of these investors requested briefing calls from ATNI before their engagement calls with companies, to ensure that they were entirely up to speed on their performance on the Index(es) in critical areas. Towards the end of the year, each investor leading the engagement with a company completed a tool to capture their discussions with the company, in order to be able to review the collaborative engagement process. A consultant was hired to undertake this review, which is due to be completed by April 2020. ATNI will use it to inform the ways in which we support our investor signatories. We hope to be able to substantially increase the number of investor signatories as our capacity to support them grows with the advent of new funding in this area. ATNI encourages major investors to engage with baby food companies about their BMS marketing In January, ATNI wrote to the ten largest shareholders in each of the five listed baby food companies that we assess and rank (Nestl&#xE9;, Danone, Abbott, RB and KraftHeinz). We outlined our comprehensive approach to assessing these companies&#x2019; BMS marketing policies and practices and enclosed the relevant materials. We offered each investor a briefing call on the performance of the companies they were shareholders of. While few responded, as we expected, one that did was NBIM. On a follow-up call with NBIM, it outlined its active engagement with ten BMS companies in which it had shareholdings. NBIM noted that it had used our materials, which it finds comprehensive and helped determine which questions to ask. Partnership with ShareAction on its Healthy Markets campaign Work also continued with ShareAction &#x2013; a UK based not-for-profit organization that campaigns with investors on nutrition issues &#x2013; to inform and shape investor engagement through its Healthy Markets campaign. On September 18th, ATNI published the first-ever Product Profile for the UK. This report presented an analysis of the nutritional quality of the product portfolios of 18 of the largest food manufacturers that sell their products in the UK. It found that 69% of more than 3,000 products analysed did not meet the healthy standard of a Health Star Rating of 3.5 and that 85% of the products were unsuitable to be marketed to children. The publication attracted a lot of social media activity. ATNI also posted a blog about it, and ShareAction authored a feature. ATNI started work to adapt its standard Index methodology used to assess manufacturers to retailers&#x2019; business models, with input from several UK experts. Once finalized, ATNI hired a consultant to undertake research on the reporting of the UK&#x2019;s ten largest supermarket chains on diets, nutrition and health. This research was completed by the end of the year. The consultant began to draft the final report, and preparations began to launch the report in Q1 2020, in close consultation with ShareAction and the funder of this work, Guys &amp; St Thomas&#x2019;s Charity. Support for Plating Up Progress Throughout the year, ATNI served on the advisory group for a new UK-focused initiative called Plating Up Progress, a collaboration between the Food and Climate Research Network based at Oxford University and the UK Food Foundation. Plating Up Progress is working to develop a set of metrics that investors can press food companies to adopt in their reporting, and to guide their policies and practices, to demonstrate their contribution to creating a sustainable, healthy food system. In January and March 2019, ATNI participated in two Plating up Progress investor workshops in London and provided comments on the two reports that were published during the year. Investor Portal Together with our website developers, a password-protected investor portal on our website has been under development during the year. This portal will allow ATNI&#x2019;s Investor Signatories to log in to access relevant ATNI documents, information about collaborative engagement and serve as a repository of investor-authored or investor-relevant reports on nutrition. The portal will be launched in 2020. &#x2003; 6. Development of new spotlight indexes and accountability tools Nutrition Business Monitor ATNI partnered with GAIN and the SUN Business Network (SBN) in the &#x201C;Nutrition Business Monitor&#x201D; project designed to develop and pilot a new voluntary self-assessment tool for SMEs in the F&amp;B sector. The tool aims to help SMEs review where they stand regarding their nutritional policies and practices and provide them with recommendations on how to improve. Along with the SBN in Nigeria and Bangladesh, ATNI organized a series of roundtables which were instrumental in bringing together feedback and input from in total 50 CSOs and Government bodies and Companies to design the tool compatible to the local context. The ATNI team also took the opportunity to get insight into the national business environment, the challenges and opportunities in the F&amp;B sector through individual meetings with relevant authorities and company visits. Collating all the relevant feedback and input from both countries, the ATNI team developed the draft indicators, the weighting, the scoring and the recommendations to construct the first version. The draft version was later presented in the SUN Global Gathering, in November 2019 in Nepal where it was reviewed by SBN coordinators, GAIN directors, as well as SMEs and other stakeholders. The feedback and input from this session were then incorporated to design the final tool. During those sessions, some SBN networks manifested their interest to test the tool as well and see how it could be used in their countries. Following the completion of the final version, ATNI started the work with its IT provider to create the tool online. The first draft of the tool will be finalized in February and presented in the two countries in the first half of 2020. The tool is now divided into five categories: Management and Products, Marketing, Workforce programs, Labelling and Engagement and it contains in total 27 main indicators. The user-friendly design of the tool will allow the companies to fill this in within 1-2 hours and to easily navigate to different sections. U.S. Spotlight Index In 2019, ATNI received funding from RWJF for the second iteration of an U.S. Spotlight Index to be published in 2021. To take the U.S. Spotlight initiative forward, the ATNI team proceeded in 2019 with the methodology review ensuring its alignment with the Global Index 2020 methodology. The revised methodology will be submitted to the U.S. Expert Group after consultations with stakeholders early 2020. A U.S.-based Research and Engagement adviser will be recruited in the first quarter of 2020. &#x2003; 7. Nutrition for Growth (N4G) summit and aligning global accountability mechanisms Nutrition for Growth In 2019, ATNI took part in the preparations for the Tokyo Nutrition for Growth (N4G) Summit planned for 2020. The organization was invited to be part of different working groups. ATNI has been part of a food systems working group, and co-lead the working group on accountability&#x202F;to form the agenda and set the stage for meaningful and SMART commitments by all stakeholders and specifically, the private sector. With GAIN, ATNI has organized an international conference in The Hague in June 2019 to build business commitments for N4G (see box). After summer, the Government of Japan has established a new advisory group in which ATNI participates as the former co-lead of the accountability working group. ATNI is also an observer in the Business Constituency Group (consisting of the major global industry associations: the Consumer Goods Forum (CGF), Food Industry Asia (FIA), the International Food and Beverage Alliance (IFBA), the SBN and the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD). ATNI has proposed to the Government of Japan and organizers of the N4G to develop a set of Investor Expectations on Nutrition, to echo a similar set of expectations on climate change, lobbying on climate change and other ESG issues. The proposed approach is to evolve the current Investor Statement into these Investor Expectations. &#x2003; WHO Global Monitoring Mechanism During an UNGA side-event on NCD&#x2019;s in September 2018, the WHO announced its desire to develop a mechanism to track how the world&#x2019;s largest F&amp;B manufacturers are aligning their commitments, targets and practices to WHO guidance and recommendations. The background paper prepared by WHO for this purpose referenced ATNI extensively. ATNI has been invited to co-lead the design and delivery of the Mechanism, in collaboration with WHO. ATNI has since participated in several WHO-led calls to discuss the development of a Global monitoring mechanism and has presented a proposal to WHO for a Global Corporate Action Tracker on nutrition (working title: GCAT). Initially, GCAT will track company progress concerning product development and reformulation, marketing to children, nutrition labelling and the use of nutrition content and health claims. GCAT in future also has the potential to be expanded monitoring other aspects of business practice related to nutrition such as &#x2013; (a) methodology to assess the levels of industrial trans-fat or sodium in companies&#x2019; products; (b) a mechanism to evaluate companies&#x2019; progress at a national level led by TGI and INFORMAS, respectively. ATNI aims to publish the first report coinciding with the Nutrition for Growth summit in 2020 in Tokyo (N4G 2020). Aligning Accountability Mechanisms, WBA and GAIN ATNI is one of the allies of the World Benchmarking Alliance (WBA) and participated in 2019 in several consultations to inform WBA&#x2019;s plans for an overarching benchmark on Food and Agriculture (a first edition is foreseen for 2021) to facilitate a transformation in the food system. ATNI is ready to provide expertise to the WBA team for building this benchmark that will make use of a few indicators included in the ATNI Indexes. ATNI and WBA will align to avoid any duplications and companies being approached twice with the same questions. GAIN and the SBN in 2018 organized a workshop with civil society and industry to map existing accountability mechanism in nutrition. ATNI participated and provided input for the consequent report, entitled &#x201C;A review of Business Accountability Mechanisms in Nutrition&#x201D; and published in March 2019. GAIN and SBN announced a follow-up workshop in early 2020 in cooperation with the CGF to align accountability mechanisms in nutrition and come up with a framework for this alignment. &#x2003; 8. Outreach activities Communications update: interactive website and new house style/branding The organization in 2019 worked on a wide range and a growing number of activities to drive the private sector&#x2019;s performance on healthy affordable diets beyond its flagship Global Index and Spotlight Country Indexes. To reflect the strategic choice to expand the scope of its benchmarking work and to develop new accountability tools, a new name and branding (with adapted logo) were chosen and introduced in 2019: &#x2018;Access to Nutrition Initiative&#x2019;. The acronym ATNI coincides with that of the Access to Nutrition Index, well known by all stakeholders working with, or making use of the organization&apos;s products over the last six years. With a new design agency, all the groundwork was done for the organization&#x2019;s new interactive website along with the new house style and branding to be launched early 2020. The organization&#x2019;s legal status as foundation and registration in The Netherlands as the &#x2018;Stichting Access to Nutrition Foundation&#x2019; did not change. Key outreach activities, meetings, conferences in 2019 India media outreach In India, while working on the research and analysis for the 2020 India Spotlight Index, with its local communication/ PR partner AvianWe, ATNI has been successful in being visible in media throughout 2019 to sensitize stakeholders in the food system and consumers alike on the importance of private sector accountability on nutrition issues. An overview of these articles and features in different media outlets can be found on ATNI&#x2019;s website. &#x2003; January - February Netherlands Working Group on International Nutrition ATNI joined the Netherlands Working Group on International Nutrition, a platform with corporate, CSO and government members to promote nutrition specific and nutrition sensitive approaches in development strategies of Dutch stakeholders. Plating up Progress ATNI participated in investor workshops in London for Plating up Progress; a collaboration between the Food and Climate Research Network based at Oxford University and the U.K. Food Foundation. Confronting Obesity February 20-21 ATNI attended the co-create consortium meeting in London organized by World Cancer Research Fund International &amp; EU Horizon 2020; Confronting Obesity: Co-creating policies with youth. Hidden Hunger conference ATNI&#x2019;s research manager participated in the 4th Hidden Hunger conference, Feb 27 - March 1, Stuttgart, University of Hohenheim. ATNI benefitted from the opportunity to consult global experts on ATNI&#x2019;s plan to develop a micro-nutrient enhanced nutrient profiling system. March Nutrition in the first 1000 days of life ATNI was represented at a Nestl&#xE9; stakeholder convening on Nutrition in the first 1000 days of life. World Benchmarking Alliance Allies meeting Mumbai On March 6-8, the World Benchmarking Alliance Allies met in Mumbai to review planning and progress towards the 5 overarching benchmarks WBA wants to launch in 2020. Their new Food and Agriculture value chain benchmark of 200 companies will be presented at N4G summit in 2020 in Japan. UNICEF/WHO workshop on Marketing Food and Non-Alcoholic Beverages to Children At the end of March, ATNI provided input at a UNICEF/WHO workshop to develop a &#x2018;Toolkit for Policymakers to Implement the WHO Recommendations on Marketing Food and Non-Alcoholic Beverages to Children&#x2019;. Subsequently, separate meetings were held on March 29 with UNICEF and WHO nutrition experts. April Tokyo meeting with Global Index stakeholders To gain more insights on the relevance of the Global Index for Japanese companies and stakeholders in the region, ATNI organized a meeting in April in Tokyo with the assistance of Ajinomoto, one of the companies in the Global Index. Companies, industry associations, representatives from four ministries, academics and other stakeholders affirmed the relevance of the Index to guide and support the nutrition agenda of Japanese multinational companies abroad as well as in Japan. For the Japanese context, reference was made to the specific needs of an ageing population which could be an element in the methodology of the future indexes. GAIN Donor meeting, Ireland In April, ATNI was invited to attend and speak at a meeting for donors of GAIN in Dublin. ATNI presented the plan for the development of a &#x2018;Nutrition Business Monitor&#x2019; tool for SMEs. This project is funded by GAIN through its &#x2019;Making markets work for nutrition&#x2019; program. The tool will initially be piloted in Nigeria and Bangladesh among member companies of the local SBNs. Partnership for a Healthier America Summit in Chicago ATNI organized a networking lunch during the PHA Summit in Chicago on 2 April. The aim was to discuss what the largest F&amp;B companies in the US are doing to help consumers make healthier choices about what they eat and drink using the results of the ATNI U.S. Spotlight Index 2018 as starting point. May ATNI donor meeting, London In May, ATNI organized a meeting for its main donors, hosted by DFID in London. Interested DFID colleagues were invited to a presentation by ATNF&#x2019;s executive director on the BMS marketing assessment undertaken for the Global Indexes as well as the on the ground assessments in specific markets. Representatives from BMGF, UK DFID and DGIS reviewed and discussed the options for ATNI&#x2019;s next multi-year strategic planning (2020-2023). June EAT Forum, Stockholm ATNI attended the EAT Forum in Stockholm in June where the follow-up on the EAT-Lancet commission report &#x2018;Food in the Anthropocene: the EAT-Lancet Commission on healthy diets from sustainable food systems&#x2019; was the central theme. In sessions organized by GAIN, WBCSD/Fresh, UNICEF companies mentioned ATNI as the nutrition accountability mechanism they work with and would want to keep using. NBM roundtables in Nigeria and Bangladesh (June-August) ATNI travelled to Nigeria and Bangladesh, the two countries where the Nutrition Business Monitor project will roll out. In each country, we organized two roundtables; one for companies and one for CSOs and policymakers, where we presented our initial thought on how the NBM tool should look like in terms of structure and indicators. July - August Better Nutrition for a Healthier Workforce ATNI attended the 2-day roundtable organized by GAIN in Geneva in cooperation with the CGF in Geneva. The participants were stakeholders from companies with or interested in workforce programs, CSOs, UNICEF, ILO and other stakeholders involved in the supply chain. GAIN and CGF are working on developing a workforce nutrition toolkit for companies that will be launched in early 2020. National Nutrition Conclave India At the end of August 2019, the Executive Director of ATNF, Inge Kauer was invited to speak at a National Nutrition Conclave in Delhi, organized by the Confederation of Indian Industry&apos;s Food and Agriculture Centre of Excellence (CII-FACE), and participated in a panel with industry and CSO representatives. October UNICEF State of the World&#x2019;s Children 2019 ATNI was invited to provide its perspective on the role of the food industry to tackle malnutrition in the UNICEF&apos;s State of the World&apos;s Children 2019 report. For the first time in 20 years, UNICEF&#x2019;s flagship report examined the issue of children, food and nutrition, providing a fresh perspective on a rapidly evolving challenge. ATNI&#x2019;s work was featured in a two-page (pp 138-139) article in the report by Executive Director Inge Kauer. The report was released in October 2019 and ATNI attended the launch event in London. World food Day ATNI featured a blog on World Food Day, titled &apos;Acknowledging progress and prompting change&apos; and combined this with a social media outreach plan to celebrate the day. &#x2003; November - December SUN Global Gathering (Kathmandu, Nepal) The bi-annual Global Gathering of the Scaling up Nutrition movement brings together stakeholders from the nutrition sphere; from governments and policy makers, to UN agencies, CSOs and businesses. The stakeholders represent the member countries of SUN as well as international organizations working in those countries. ATNI was there to present the progress of the NBM project to the various SBNs and relevant stakeholders, as well as participate in discussions for the upcoming Nutrition for Growth Summit that will take place in Japan in December 2020. Companies and investor organizations mentioning ATNI in public statements A quickscan of company and investor organizations websites and public communications found 16 companies mentioning ATNI&#x2019;s work, as well as 32 investor organizations. The following box includes some examples of how they refer to ATNI. &#x201C;We worked with the Access to Nutrition Index Foundation to develop an evidence-based approach that can be applied to our analysis. Based on their scientific methodology, we can now identify companies that sell unhealthy food products.&#x201D; &#x2013; EQ Investors &#x201C;[T]he Access to Nutrition Foundation (the &#x2018;ATNF&#x2019;), a respected independent nonprofit organization, (&#x2026;) already produces credible reports covering our Company that encompass sugar and public health (&#x2026;). We believe it is important that our shareowners know that our Company acknowledges the ATNF findings and recognizes the role the Company must play in addressing health challenges.&#x201D; &#x2013; Coca-Cola &#x201C;The Access to Nutrition Foundation (ATNF), a respected independent non-profit organization, (&#x2026;) publishes reports that not only provide a robust assessment of PepsiCo&#x2019;s goals and performance, but a critical analysis and benchmarking on efforts of other leading food and beverage manufacturers to improve consumers&#x2019; access to nutritious foods and beverages.&#x201D; &#x2013; PepsiCo &#x201C;Engagement with PepsiCo on nutrition has been limited during the year. That said we were pleased to see the company increase its score on the new Access to Nutrition Index rankings.&#x201D; &#x2013; CCLA Investment Management &#x201C;This result is encouraging and we consider it a recognition of our efforts to give substance to our purpose nourishing by nature&#x201D; &#x2013; FrieslandCampina CEO Hein Schumacher on FrieslandCampina&#x2019;s performance in the Global Index 2018 &#x201C;The evaluation performed by ATNI and its 2018 Nutrition Index regarding the strength of our H&amp;W strategy has led us to improve our actions, commitments, practices, and performance to have a positive influence our consumers [sic!] so they may achieve better lifestyles and balanced diets.&#x201D; &#x2013; Grupo Bimbo &#x201C;Campbell uses the report to help inform nutrition strategy and best practices in policy development, transparency and communication on nutrition issues.&#x201D; &#x2013; Campbell &#x2003; 9. Action research In 2019, ATNI initiated Action Research on two topics which are central to our Indexes but where conclusive evidence, international standards and company best-practice is lacking or only just emerging. Action Research is designed to advance knowledge and understanding of the selected topics and ultimately to improve companies&#x2019; performance on them. 1. Affordability and accessibility of healthy foods: ATNI Indexes reveal that the companies tend to score most poorly on Category C, which assesses their policies, practices and disclosure on improving the affordability and accessibility of healthy foods in markets around the world. Affordability and accessibility are essentially determined by two core business functions: pricing and distribution. They are not therefore subject to international bodies&#x2019; standards, guidelines or regulation. ATNI initiated this piece of Action Research to investigate how food companies address nutrition considerations within their pricing and distribution activities, with a view to providing guidance about how they could improve their performance in these crucial areas. Moreover, the intention was to inform future ATNI Index methodologies. ATNI commissioned Carnstone Partners, a UK-based consultancy, to undertake the first phase of this research. They started by collating statistics on the presence and nature of Index companies&#x2019; businesses, and the market penetration of their products, in three key LMICs (Nigeria, India and Mexico), and in the UK market. They then undertook a series of interviews with industry experts to answer the following questions: &#x2022; How do companies organize their marketing and distribution activities in these markets? &#x2022; Why are companies struggling to perform well in this area? What might be the potential barriers preventing them from doing so? &#x2022; How could some of those barriers be overcome? The first phase of the research was completed by the end of 2019. Carnstone will finalize their report and make their recommendations to ATNI in early 2020. 2. Complementary Foods Commercially produced complementary foods are increasingly becoming part of young children&#x2019;s diets. Children everywhere need a healthy balanced diet appropriate to their age and stage of development. In LMICs, highly nutritious and appropriately fortified complementary foods are particularly important. During 2019, ATNI undertook research and consulted several organizations including UNICEF, GAIN, HKI and First Steps Nutrition. Their input has helped shape this Action Research. During 2020, ATNI intends to establish a blueprint for assessing the scale, growth and players in individual countries&#x2019; markets in respect of commercially produced complementary foods, and the role they are playing in young children&#x2019;s diets. Moreover, ATNI intends to pilot a Product Profile for complementary foods using the newly developed WHO Europe Nutrient Profiling model, in one emerging market. 10. Monitoring and Evaluation In September 2019, ATNI recruited a Program Manager who started the development of an internal M&amp;E framework. In 2020 ATNI intends to enhance its current measurement and evaluation to better articulate and evidence the impact of the Indexes and its other work. ATNI itself will carry out an external review of its key activities and outputs. As part of developing a robust M&amp;E system for ATNI the team reviewed and updated the theory of change based on the outlines for a new strategic plan 2020-2024 approved by the Board. 11. Risks The organization has adopted a risk management policy end 2019 describing how risks are identified, recorded in a risk register that also includes mitigation strategy, and how they are managed. At the organizational level ATNI identifies risks continuously through the stream of the regular staff meetings as well as in the context of the quarterly Board meeting. The results are reviewed by and discussed with the audit and risk committee in the Board at least annually. Independence ATNI maintained its independence in 2019 by not accepting any funding from industry and not having board or expert group members (recently) employed by food manufacturers. Company engagement In the research process for the second India Index, more companies provided data for the Product Profile assessment; eight out of 16 companies assessed used the opportunity to engage and provide additional information to ATNI actively. Companies to be assessed in the 2020 Global Index in large numbers actively asked ATNI for details of the methodology and planning for the 2020 Global Index. 17 out of 22 companies approached participated in a webinar organized for the purpose end 2019 and expressed their appreciation for the initiative. Impact in low income countries Ongoing projects to make sure that ATNI products make an impact in low-income countries as in high-income markets gained momentum in 2019. The Nutrition Business Monitor, a self-assessment tool for SMEs in emerging markets is not yet tested or finalized but could count on a lot of interest of SBNs in countries beyond Bangladesh and Nigeria (where the tool is piloted). In the project to develop a &#x2018;micronutrient enhanced&#x2019; Nutrient Profiling System experts and companies were consulted to come to a set-up assessing 6 micronutrients (iron, vitamins A, B12, D, folate, iodine). This will be tested with companies in India in 2020. &#x2003; Visibility/external profile ATNI has been substantially visible and active in international conferences and events on food and nutrition in 2019 (like the EAT Forum, the Hague Conference on Building Business Commitments for N4G preparations) including stakeholder meetings with other members of the World Benchmarking Alliance. Civil society organizations and companies alike expressed their appreciation for ATNI&#x2019;s products and the wish that ATNI keeps its focus on in-depth analysis of nutrition and health impacts. Competing mechanisms A new Food and Agriculture system benchmark planned by the World Benchmarking Alliance will cover more companies. Additionally, the benchmark will include environmental and social impacts derived from companies. The benchmark will only include a few indicators to look at nutrition (by making use of ATNI&#x2019;s expertise) but will not provide in-depth analysis as ATNI products do. Balance resources with expectations, Safeguarding policy The ATNI team has grown steadily up to 12 by end 2019 to match the growing number of projects and plans for 2020 and beyond, and one additional staff member is to join the team in early 2020. New staff members in 2019 were asked to sign a code of conduct and were trained on the safeguarding policy. Value for Money To ensure it delivers value for money ATNI has a constant dialogue with suppliers and sub-contractors on price levels of services provided. No significant new risks emerged in 2019 to be added to the risk register nor were changes observed in the likelihood of risks to occur or the severity of their impacts. ATNI did develop a risk management policy in 2019 that was reviewed by and adopted by the Board end 2019. &#x2003; 12. 2019 in Pictures &#x2003; &#xAC;</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">1. Introduction The Access to Nutrition Initiative (ATNI), an independent non-profit organization based in the Netherlands, is dedicated to driving changes in the global nutrition landscape by tracking and assessing the food industry&#x2019;s attempts to tackle undernutrition, obesity and diet-related chronic diseases through designing and delivering a range of accountability tools. The organization influences the industries&#x2019; contribution to address global nutrition challenges, by objectively assessing the food industry and publishing Global and Spotlight Country Nutrition Indexes and by developing new accountability tools and studies to support this. ATNI aims to encourage companies both to increase access to healthy products and to responsibly exercise their influence on consumers&#x2019; choice and behavior. The organization in 2019 worked on a wide range and growing number of activities to drive the private sector&#x2019;s performance on healthy affordable diets beyond its flagship Global Index and Spotlight Country Indexes. To reflect the strategic choice to expand the scope of its benchmarking work and develop new accountability tools, a new name and branding (with adapted logo) was chosen and introduced in 2019: &#x2018;Access to Nutrition Initiative&#x2019;. The acronym ATNI coincides with that of the Access to Nutrition Index, well known by all stakeholders working with, or making use of the organization&apos;s products over the last six years. With a new design agency all the groundwork was done for the organization&#x2019;s new interactive website along with the new house style and branding to be launched early 2020. The organization&#x2019;s legal status as foundation and registration in The Netherlands as the &#x2018;Stichting Access to Nutrition Foundation&#x2019; does not change. Throughout 2019, the organization has done the necessary preparatory work such as industry engagement, data collection, and data processing, required for the launch of the second iteration of the India Spotlight Index in February 2020. Additionally, the preparatory work for the second US Spotlight Index has been started to facilitate the assessment in 2020 and launching the report in the second quarter of 2021. In 2019, ATNI has done an intensive revision of the methodology for the Global Index to adopt the most recent contextual changes and to incorporate stakeholders&#x2019; feedback for the Global Index 2020. Working with and supported by the Global Alliance on Improved Nutrition (GAIN), ATNI started the design and development of a self-assessment tool for small and medium-sized companies in countries with rapidly emerging food and beverage (F&amp;B) industries that have a national Scaling up Nutrition (SUN) Business Network. The tool aims to help small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to be aware of their role and opportunities to improve nutrition and benchmark their performance against their peers and larger companies. In Nigeria and Bangladesh, a total of 50 SMEs and civil society organizations and government agencies are helping to build this tool and make it as relevant as possible for the local context. A first draft version of the tool will be tested in these countries early 2020. ATNI took part in the preparations for the Tokyo Nutrition for Growth (N4G) Summit planned for 2020. The organization was invited to be part of different working groups (on data &amp; accountability and food systems) to set the agenda and set the stage for meaningful and specific, measurable, achievable, realistic, and time-bound (SMART) commitments by all stakeholders and specifically the private sector. Along with GAIN, ATNI has organized an international conference in The Hague to build business commitments for N4G. The World Health Organization (WHO) asked ATNI to help set up a global monitoring mechanism to track company reformulation efforts on salt and added sugar. In November, ATNI has published the UK Product Profile Report which revealed that some 18 largest F&amp;B manufacturers in the U.K need to increase their sales of healthy products to demonstrate that they are serious about making a meaningful contribution to consumers&#x2019; diets and public health. This should also help address the mounting business risks associated with poor diets, deal with or be prepared for regulatory intervention and the impacts on productivity among their workforces. In collaboration with ShareAction and with funding from the Guy&#x2019;s and St Thomas&#x2019; Charity, ATNI took first steps to look at the vital role the retail sector has to play in providing affordable, healthy diets to all consumers. To expand the scope of its work to this part of the food value chain, ATNI studied the UK food retail sector to shed light on the commitments and contributions of the ten largest UK food and drink retailers in regard to promoting healthy food and helping consumers to move away from high fat, salt and sugar products. The results will be presented in a report early 2020. After summer, ATNI has started action research to investigate two Index topics, namely 1: Access and Affordability of healthy food and 2: Nutrition quality of complementary foods for young children. In these categories, companies in general score low or international guidelines and standards are lacking. Since the launch of the first Global Index in 2013, more than 72 investment firms have become signatories to the Access to Nutrition Index Investor Statement, with over $7 trillion assets under management. We are pleased to mention that complementing the multi-year core funding that ATNI receives from the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, the Netherlands&#x2019; Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the UK Department for International Development in 2019 our organization has additionally received support from GAIN for the Nutrition Business Monitor project and the Guy&apos;s and St Thomas&apos; NHS Foundation Trust through ShareAction for the work on the UK Product Profile and the retailer study. At the end of 2019, ATNI also signed an agreement with Irish Aid to fund the development of new accountability tools to increase transparency around baby food companies&#x2019; lobbying and influencing of policymaking processes and with the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF) for the launch of the second U.S. Spotlight Index. Our team has grown steadily up to 12 by end 2019 and one additional staff member is to join the team in early 2020. Looking back at 2019, ATNI is increasingly recognized as an independent authority on benchmarking F&amp;B industry&apos;s efforts to contribute to better nutrition. Most of the companies assessed in the Indexes have been supportive and engaged during the research phase. Also, after the launch of the reports, they have actively communicated for validating the scores and followed up on the recommendations. Our engagement with companies for the upcoming Indexes has witnessed engagement, enthusiasm as well as a great commitment to improving their overall scores and contributions to tackle malnutrition. Our work is being increasingly recognized by the stakeholders engaged in the global nutrition landscape, including international organizations such as the World Health Organization (WHO) and UNICEF, civil society organizations and investors. Inge Kauer, Executive Director, Access to Nutrition Foundation &#x2003; 2. Global Index The third Global Access to Nutrition Index 2018, assessing the 22 globally largest F&amp;Bmanufacturers, has revealed that while the companies started increasingly emphasizing on their efforts to introduce better diets, still serious concerns remained on the healthiness of the product portfolios. ATNI, in 2018 and 2019, during the post-launch engagements shared this message with the companies which encouraged transformation and initiated changes. Listed companies (like Keurig Dr Pepper and Kraft Heinz) that did not actively engage during the Global and US Index 2018 research phase did show interest to discuss the findings of the 2018 Index and to actively engage in the iterations process for the upcoming Global Index 2020. In 2019, ATNI received some noteworthy recognition from the companies that it has assessed. Several companies, recognizing ATNI&#x2019;s Product Profile, indicated considering the Health Star Rating as an independent nutrient profiling system besides its internal system. ATNI&#x2019;s initiatives have been on the agenda of some companies&#x2019; Board meetings and influenced their strategy discussions. One company team indicated that the Index was a useful tool to drive their internal thinking and contributing to a portfolio with more &#x2018;nutrition positive&#x2019; products. Another company mentioned that ATNI&#x2019;s outreach at international fora and conferences was remarkable. In March 2019, Coca Cola&#x2019;s board reportedly opposed a shareholders resolution to report &#x2018;an assessment of risks to Coke&apos;s finances and reputation associated with changing scientific understanding of the role of sugar in disease causation&#x2019; as the Access to Nutrition Foundation, an independent nonprofit, already produces reports about Coke that address sugar and public health. ATNI continued consulting with all stakeholders, including the companies to gather feedback on the methodology review for the upcoming Global Access to Nutrition Index 2020. During the post-launch consultation process of Global Index 2018, ATNI received recommendations for the Index to reduce complexity and perceived duplications as well as incorporate vital changes and improvements that companies had initiated. Considering the feedback, in 2019, ATNI started a revision process for the Global Index methodology for the upcoming Global Index 2020. ATNI selected 25 companies in total for the Global Index 2020 iteration. The three new/additional companies are Keurig Dr Pepper (American company that was assessed for the U.S. Spotlight Index 2018, but not for the Global Index), China Mengniu and Yili (Chinese companies). In the last quarter of the year, ATNI went through a consultation process with all the companies to discuss the main changes and novelties of the Global Index methodology. The proposed main changes were also duly presented and discussed with the ATNI Expert Group and Board. Changes in Global Index 2020 Methodology &#x2022; In the Global Index 2018, the Corporate Profile and Product Profile were presented as separate outputs with different scores and rankings. The methodology review led to integrate the Product Profile results into Category B of the Corporate Profile to offer one overall Index ranking. For the Global Index 2020, these changes imply that the Product Profile being incorporated into Category B will carry 20% of the total Index weight. &#x2022; In the Global Index 2018, the company-wide actions for preventing and addressing undernutrition (among the populations at risk in developing countries) were assessed within an undernutrition section. The undernutrition indicators were not applied to companies that derived less than 5% of their F&amp;B revenues from non-OECD markets. In the Global Index 2020 methodology, the commitment of companies to specifically address the needs and key nutritional priorities for populations at-risk is considered relevant for both developed and developing countries. As a result, how comprehensively a company covers various forms of malnutrition, is based on the company&#x2019;s market presence and the specific micronutrient deficiencies/undernutrition issues in all markets. &#x2022; For the Global Index 2018 iteration, ATNI focused on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs); particularly with regards to reaching Goals 2 (zero hunger) and 3 (health and well-being for all). In the Global Index 2020 new methodology, ATNI has also incorporated indicators assessing companies&#x2019; efforts in reducing the per capita food loss and waste along F&amp;Bproduction and supply chains (from the post-harvest stage to the retail and consumer levels), in line with Sustainable Development Goal 12 (target 12.3). Stakeholders consultation and feedback on updated methodology Companies selected for the Global Index 2020 assessment were invited to take part in an online survey at the end of 2019. Overall, the stakeholders have received the revised methodology positively. Most of the companies that responded support the integration of the Product Profile into Category B (Formulating Appropriate Products). The consultation also involved investors as an important group of stakeholders in the overall process of the methodology revision. In December 2019, ATNI organized a webinar to collate feedback from the investors. The investor group has particularly appreciated the incorporation of the food loss and food waste concepts to the methodology. The combined stakeholders&#x2019; feedback was considered to finalize the Global Index methodology, which will be submitted to the Expert Group members for further review in January 2020. 3. Monitoring marketing of breast-milk substitutes and complementary foods Because of the importance of infant and young child nutrition (IYCN), each edition of the Global Access to Nutrition Index includes a breast-milk substitutes (BMS)/complementary foods (CF) Marketing sub-ranking that scores and ranks the world&#x2019;s largest baby food manufacturers&#x2019; marketing policies, and practices and disclosure. This analysis assesses the extent to which these companies market their products in line with the International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes (The Code) and subsequent relevant World Health Assembly (WHA) resolutions, including WHA 69.9 (together referred to as The Code) . We use a comprehensive, robust and published methodology to do so, developed with the advice of WHO, UNICEF and many other international experts and not-for-profit organizations dedicated to improving infant and young child nutrition (IYCN). ATNI&#x2019;s work In 2019, ATNI started preparing for the two assessments that will feed into the BMS/CF Marketing sub-ranking of the Global Index 2020. Whereas for the previous Index only six companies were included in this sub-ranking, for the next Global Index ATNI is extending its coverage to the ten largest baby food companies globally: Danone, FrieslandCampina, Kraft Heinz, Nestl&#xE9;, Abbott, RB/Mead Johnson Nutrition (RB/MJN), Pepsico, Feihe International, Inner Mongolia Yili Industrial Group and China Mengniu Dairy. Two emerging markets were selected in which NetCode studies will be undertaken to assess the extent of marketing of BMS and CF products. ATNI has again contracted Westat to conduct these studies. The BMS/CF Marketing assessment, including the two country reports, will be completed in 2020. New partnerships Additionally, ATNI partnered with FTSE Russell. In recent years, ATNI and FTSE Russell have conducted similar but separate in-country verification exercises of companies&#x2019; BMS Marketing. From 2019 onwards, ATNI will provide data to FTSE Russell from our in-country NetCode studies, to feed into its approach to determine whether BMS companies meet its criteria for inclusion in its FTSE4Good Indexes. ATNI will continue to apply its criteria and methodology as previously for its Indexes. For more information on the agreement between FTSE Russell and ATNI, please read the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs). How ATNI&#x2019;s work on BMS and CF Marketing is viewed and used ATNI is now widely recognized among key stakeholders that work on this topic as providing the definitive analysis of the major baby food companies&#x2019; marketing policies and practices. We publish a wide range of materials for use by stakeholders, including a dedicated chapter within each Global Index report, separate Scorecards for each BMS company, a summary report of each &#x2013; and in-country studies of marketing practices, as well as Westat&#x2019;s full technical reports of those studies. Some major institutional investors, such as Norges Bank Investment Management (NBIM) and BMO Global Asset Management, use our analysis to inform their engagement with these companies. The purpose of their engagement is to encourage companies to adopt policies and practices that implement The Code. ATNI has been approached by B-Lab, the organization that created B-Corp certification. B-Lab is planning to introduce new BMS Marketing standards, which any company wanting to become a B-Corp must meet. It is proposing to tie companies&#x2019; qualification for B Corp certification to a percentage score on our BMS/CF Marketing sub-ranking. Within the auspices of the N4G Summit, efforts are being made to encourage baby food companies to commit to full Code compliance by 2030, and to announce and take a major step forwards from their current policies and/or practices within 2020. Further, they are being asked to publish an action plan that sets out how they will achieve Code compliance over the next decade. ATNI has been proposed as the organization that will track companies&#x2019; implementation of those action plans. 4. India Spotlight Index, 2020 Company selection and engagement process Preparations for the second Access to Nutrition India Spotlight Index 2020, that started at the end of 2018, continued throughout 2019. The Index has built upon the analysis and the recognition that ATNI received from most stakeholders on the first India Index in 2016. The Index had been broadly recognized as influential in driving positive changes among Indian F&amp;B companies to emphasis on diet, nutrition and health issues. The Index also aimed to broadly complement the efforts made by other stakeholders, including the Government-led Eat Right India movement, to address all forms of malnutrition. ATNI research in 2019 mainly focused on the contribution made by the 16 largest F&amp;B manufacturers in India. The research investigated the companies&#x2019; policies, practices and disclosure related to nutrition uptake. The second India Spotlight Index covers the same topics and takes the same broad approach to assess, score and rank the companies as the first iteration. However, the methodology was updated to incorporate relevant feedback from companies, civil society stakeholders and a review panel of experts in India consisting of: &#x2022; Dr. Rajan Sankar, Director Nutrition and Vivek Arora, Senior Advisor, Tata Trusts; &#x2022; Rohini Saran, Deputy Lead Food Fortification Resource Centre, Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI); &#x2022; Dr. Avula Laxmaiah, Scientist &#x2018;G&#x2019; &amp; Head, Public Health, National Institute of Nutrition (NIN) Hyderabad, India; &#x2022; Devyani Hari, Director Programmes, Centre for Responsible Business (CRB); &#x2022; Rachna Sujay, Senior Technical Advisor Diffusion States, Alive &amp; Thrive; &#x2022; Dr. Antaryami Dash, Advisor Nutrition, Save the Children India; &#x2022; Shiva Mudgil, Vice President, RaboResearch Food &amp; Agribusiness, Rabobank India. Based on 2018 retail sales, the 16 largest F&amp;B manufacturers were selected for the India Spotlight Index 2020. These companies together accounted for 31% of India&#x2019;s packaged F&amp;B market share with a combined total retail sale of just over INR 1800 billion (approximately equivalent to EUR 21.89 billion). Eleven out of the sixteen companies have headquarters based in India and the other five are multinationals with headquarters elsewhere. Multiple stakeholders such as funders, nutrition experts, CSOs and Government bodies were consulted through roundtable meetings in early 2019. Eight companies and the industry association CII (the Confederation of Indian Industry) participated in a private sector roundtable, discussing the methodology and planning of the research. The ATNI team engaged with two more companies through separate meetings. Multi-stakeholder engagement The following civil society and public sector organizations participated in separate roundtables or were consulted separately on the methodology and during the research process. Research phase In May 2019, ATNI, organized webinars to inform companies on the use of the data gathering platform and further details on the India Spotlight Index research process and planning. Seven companies attended the webinars, and the rest of the companies were informed on the process through one-on-one meetings. Over summer, companies had the opportunity to access the online data gathering platform to see the first assessment and provide additional information or evidence. In August 2019, ATNI organized a visit to India for face-to-face meetings with senior management in some of the companies based in Kolkata, Chennai, Bangalore and Delhi. The main agenda of the meetings was explaining &#x2013; (a) the rationale and the mmethodology of the second ATNI India Index to the companies; (b) the importance for the companies to engage in the research process and the options to do so. Two new companies subsequently announced to participate in the research process actively. ATNI and its India-based communication partner AvianWe, also received remarkable attention from the print media with articles and interviews published in different local outlets during 2019 (see overview in the section outreach activities). End of August 2019, the Executive Director of ATNI, Inge Kauer was invited to speak at a National Nutrition Conclave in Delhi, organized by the Confederation of the Indian Industry&apos;s Food and Agriculture Centre of Excellence (FACE), and participated in a panel with industry and CSO representatives. Eight out of sixteen companies, selected for the second India Index, actively engaged during the research phase to provide additional information and evidence on organizations&#x2019; policies and practices. Four other companies that either participated in meetings (that the ATNI team organized to explain the methodology and research process) or met with ATNI staff individually, finally did not make use of the option to exchange information through ATNI&apos;s online data gathering platform in the research phase. The remaining four companies declined to engage due to other priorities. ATNI will further explore how best to encourage these companies to participate in the future Indexes. There was a substantial increase (from 3 in 2016 to 7 for the 2020 Index) in the number of companies providing data on their product lists for the Product Profile product assessments, which contributed significantly to the quality of the assessment. Analysis and launch preparation The subsequent analysis, quality checks and verifications and scoring of companies continued during the last quarter of 2019. Experts from ATNI&#x2019;s global Expert Group and in India from GAIN (Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition), CII (the Confederation of Indian Industry) and FSSAI (the Government Food Safety and Standards Authority), and Tata Trusts TINI (The India Nutrition Initiative)reviewed the main findings and messages. For each company, individual summary reports of main findings (the company scorecard) were drafted and shared with the companies for them to crosscheck any factual inconsistencies and disclosure of non-public data. This summary did not indicate how the companies scored and ranked in the overall Index. ATNI commissioned the George Institute for Global Health (The George Institute) to conduct the Product Profile assessment for the 16 companies selected in the India Index 2020. And they also analyzed changes in the nutritional profile of packaged F&amp;B products from 11 large companies in India over a three-year period. 1456 products marketed in India by the 16 companies were analyzed in the Product Profile assessment. Innova Market Insights (Innova), a commercial knowledge supplier for the F&amp;B industry, provided additional product composition data. Because of the extra efforts put in the company engagement and the consequently required longer research period, ATNI decided in consultation with stakeholders in India (Industry and Government) to postpone the launch of the second Index to February 2020. 5. Investor Engagement Collaborative Company Engagement by ATNI&#x2019;s Investor Signatories During 2019, ATNI continued to support a group of 31 of its 72 Investor Signatories that signed up to engage with the 18 listed companies included in the Global and US Indexes published in 2018. ATNI hosted quarterly calls with this investor group during the year to facilitate coordination of their work. Some of these investors requested briefing calls from ATNI before their engagement calls with companies, to ensure that they were entirely up to speed on their performance on the Index(es) in critical areas. Towards the end of the year, each investor leading the engagement with a company completed a tool to capture their discussions with the company, in order to be able to review the collaborative engagement process. A consultant was hired to undertake this review, which is due to be completed by April 2020. ATNI will use it to inform the ways in which we support our investor signatories. We hope to be able to substantially increase the number of investor signatories as our capacity to support them grows with the advent of new funding in this area. ATNI encourages major investors to engage with baby food companies about their BMS marketing In January, ATNI wrote to the ten largest shareholders in each of the five listed baby food companies that we assess and rank (Nestl&#xE9;, Danone, Abbott, RB and KraftHeinz). We outlined our comprehensive approach to assessing these companies&#x2019; BMS marketing policies and practices and enclosed the relevant materials. We offered each investor a briefing call on the performance of the companies they were shareholders of. While few responded, as we expected, one that did was NBIM. On a follow-up call with NBIM, it outlined its active engagement with ten BMS companies in which it had shareholdings. NBIM noted that it had used our materials, which it finds comprehensive and helped determine which questions to ask. Partnership with ShareAction on its Healthy Markets campaign Work also continued with ShareAction &#x2013; a UK based not-for-profit organization that campaigns with investors on nutrition issues &#x2013; to inform and shape investor engagement through its Healthy Markets campaign. On September 18th, ATNI published the first-ever Product Profile for the UK. This report presented an analysis of the nutritional quality of the product portfolios of 18 of the largest food manufacturers that sell their products in the UK. It found that 69% of more than 3,000 products analysed did not meet the healthy standard of a Health Star Rating of 3.5 and that 85% of the products were unsuitable to be marketed to children. The publication attracted a lot of social media activity. ATNI also posted a blog about it, and ShareAction authored a feature. ATNI started work to adapt its standard Index methodology used to assess manufacturers to retailers&#x2019; business models, with input from several UK experts. Once finalized, ATNI hired a consultant to undertake research on the reporting of the UK&#x2019;s ten largest supermarket chains on diets, nutrition and health. This research was completed by the end of the year. The consultant began to draft the final report, and preparations began to launch the report in Q1 2020, in close consultation with ShareAction and the funder of this work, Guys &amp; St Thomas&#x2019;s Charity. Support for Plating Up Progress Throughout the year, ATNI served on the advisory group for a new UK-focused initiative called Plating Up Progress, a collaboration between the Food and Climate Research Network based at Oxford University and the UK Food Foundation. Plating Up Progress is working to develop a set of metrics that investors can press food companies to adopt in their reporting, and to guide their policies and practices, to demonstrate their contribution to creating a sustainable, healthy food system. In January and March 2019, ATNI participated in two Plating up Progress investor workshops in London and provided comments on the two reports that were published during the year. Investor Portal Together with our website developers, a password-protected investor portal on our website has been under development during the year. This portal will allow ATNI&#x2019;s Investor Signatories to log in to access relevant ATNI documents, information about collaborative engagement and serve as a repository of investor-authored or investor-relevant reports on nutrition. The portal will be launched in 2020. &#x2003; 6. Development of new spotlight indexes and accountability tools Nutrition Business Monitor ATNI partnered with GAIN and the SUN Business Network (SBN) in the &#x201C;Nutrition Business Monitor&#x201D; project designed to develop and pilot a new voluntary self-assessment tool for SMEs in the F&amp;B sector. The tool aims to help SMEs review where they stand regarding their nutritional policies and practices and provide them with recommendations on how to improve. Along with the SBN in Nigeria and Bangladesh, ATNI organized a series of roundtables which were instrumental in bringing together feedback and input from in total 50 CSOs and Government bodies and Companies to design the tool compatible to the local context. The ATNI team also took the opportunity to get insight into the national business environment, the challenges and opportunities in the F&amp;B sector through individual meetings with relevant authorities and company visits. Collating all the relevant feedback and input from both countries, the ATNI team developed the draft indicators, the weighting, the scoring and the recommendations to construct the first version. The draft version was later presented in the SUN Global Gathering, in November 2019 in Nepal where it was reviewed by SBN coordinators, GAIN directors, as well as SMEs and other stakeholders. The feedback and input from this session were then incorporated to design the final tool. During those sessions, some SBN networks manifested their interest to test the tool as well and see how it could be used in their countries. Following the completion of the final version, ATNI started the work with its IT provider to create the tool online. The first draft of the tool will be finalized in February and presented in the two countries in the first half of 2020. The tool is now divided into five categories: Management and Products, Marketing, Workforce programs, Labelling and Engagement and it contains in total 27 main indicators. The user-friendly design of the tool will allow the companies to fill this in within 1-2 hours and to easily navigate to different sections. U.S. Spotlight Index In 2019, ATNI received funding from RWJF for the second iteration of an U.S. Spotlight Index to be published in 2021. To take the U.S. Spotlight initiative forward, the ATNI team proceeded in 2019 with the methodology review ensuring its alignment with the Global Index 2020 methodology. The revised methodology will be submitted to the U.S. Expert Group after consultations with stakeholders early 2020. A U.S.-based Research and Engagement adviser will be recruited in the first quarter of 2020. &#x2003; 7. Nutrition for Growth (N4G) summit and aligning global accountability mechanisms Nutrition for Growth In 2019, ATNI took part in the preparations for the Tokyo Nutrition for Growth (N4G) Summit planned for 2020. The organization was invited to be part of different working groups. ATNI has been part of a food systems working group, and co-lead the working group on accountability&#x202F;to form the agenda and set the stage for meaningful and SMART commitments by all stakeholders and specifically, the private sector. With GAIN, ATNI has organized an international conference in The Hague in June 2019 to build business commitments for N4G (see box). After summer, the Government of Japan has established a new advisory group in which ATNI participates as the former co-lead of the accountability working group. ATNI is also an observer in the Business Constituency Group (consisting of the major global industry associations: the Consumer Goods Forum (CGF), Food Industry Asia (FIA), the International Food and Beverage Alliance (IFBA), the SBN and the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD). ATNI has proposed to the Government of Japan and organizers of the N4G to develop a set of Investor Expectations on Nutrition, to echo a similar set of expectations on climate change, lobbying on climate change and other ESG issues. The proposed approach is to evolve the current Investor Statement into these Investor Expectations. &#x2003; WHO Global Monitoring Mechanism During an UNGA side-event on NCD&#x2019;s in September 2018, the WHO announced its desire to develop a mechanism to track how the world&#x2019;s largest F&amp;B manufacturers are aligning their commitments, targets and practices to WHO guidance and recommendations. The background paper prepared by WHO for this purpose referenced ATNI extensively. ATNI has been invited to co-lead the design and delivery of the Mechanism, in collaboration with WHO. ATNI has since participated in several WHO-led calls to discuss the development of a Global monitoring mechanism and has presented a proposal to WHO for a Global Corporate Action Tracker on nutrition (working title: GCAT). Initially, GCAT will track company progress concerning product development and reformulation, marketing to children, nutrition labelling and the use of nutrition content and health claims. GCAT in future also has the potential to be expanded monitoring other aspects of business practice related to nutrition such as &#x2013; (a) methodology to assess the levels of industrial trans-fat or sodium in companies&#x2019; products; (b) a mechanism to evaluate companies&#x2019; progress at a national level led by TGI and INFORMAS, respectively. ATNI aims to publish the first report coinciding with the Nutrition for Growth summit in 2020 in Tokyo (N4G 2020). Aligning Accountability Mechanisms, WBA and GAIN ATNI is one of the allies of the World Benchmarking Alliance (WBA) and participated in 2019 in several consultations to inform WBA&#x2019;s plans for an overarching benchmark on Food and Agriculture (a first edition is foreseen for 2021) to facilitate a transformation in the food system. ATNI is ready to provide expertise to the WBA team for building this benchmark that will make use of a few indicators included in the ATNI Indexes. ATNI and WBA will align to avoid any duplications and companies being approached twice with the same questions. GAIN and the SBN in 2018 organized a workshop with civil society and industry to map existing accountability mechanism in nutrition. ATNI participated and provided input for the consequent report, entitled &#x201C;A review of Business Accountability Mechanisms in Nutrition&#x201D; and published in March 2019. GAIN and SBN announced a follow-up workshop in early 2020 in cooperation with the CGF to align accountability mechanisms in nutrition and come up with a framework for this alignment. &#x2003; 8. Outreach activities Communications update: interactive website and new house style/branding The organization in 2019 worked on a wide range and a growing number of activities to drive the private sector&#x2019;s performance on healthy affordable diets beyond its flagship Global Index and Spotlight Country Indexes. To reflect the strategic choice to expand the scope of its benchmarking work and to develop new accountability tools, a new name and branding (with adapted logo) were chosen and introduced in 2019: &#x2018;Access to Nutrition Initiative&#x2019;. The acronym ATNI coincides with that of the Access to Nutrition Index, well known by all stakeholders working with, or making use of the organization&apos;s products over the last six years. With a new design agency, all the groundwork was done for the organization&#x2019;s new interactive website along with the new house style and branding to be launched early 2020. The organization&#x2019;s legal status as foundation and registration in The Netherlands as the &#x2018;Stichting Access to Nutrition Foundation&#x2019; did not change. Key outreach activities, meetings, conferences in 2019 India media outreach In India, while working on the research and analysis for the 2020 India Spotlight Index, with its local communication/ PR partner AvianWe, ATNI has been successful in being visible in media throughout 2019 to sensitize stakeholders in the food system and consumers alike on the importance of private sector accountability on nutrition issues. An overview of these articles and features in different media outlets can be found on ATNI&#x2019;s website. &#x2003; January - February Netherlands Working Group on International Nutrition ATNI joined the Netherlands Working Group on International Nutrition, a platform with corporate, CSO and government members to promote nutrition specific and nutrition sensitive approaches in development strategies of Dutch stakeholders. Plating up Progress ATNI participated in investor workshops in London for Plating up Progress; a collaboration between the Food and Climate Research Network based at Oxford University and the U.K. Food Foundation. Confronting Obesity February 20-21 ATNI attended the co-create consortium meeting in London organized by World Cancer Research Fund International &amp; EU Horizon 2020; Confronting Obesity: Co-creating policies with youth. Hidden Hunger conference ATNI&#x2019;s research manager participated in the 4th Hidden Hunger conference, Feb 27 - March 1, Stuttgart, University of Hohenheim. ATNI benefitted from the opportunity to consult global experts on ATNI&#x2019;s plan to develop a micro-nutrient enhanced nutrient profiling system. March Nutrition in the first 1000 days of life ATNI was represented at a Nestl&#xE9; stakeholder convening on Nutrition in the first 1000 days of life. World Benchmarking Alliance Allies meeting Mumbai On March 6-8, the World Benchmarking Alliance Allies met in Mumbai to review planning and progress towards the 5 overarching benchmarks WBA wants to launch in 2020. Their new Food and Agriculture value chain benchmark of 200 companies will be presented at N4G summit in 2020 in Japan. UNICEF/WHO workshop on Marketing Food and Non-Alcoholic Beverages to Children At the end of March, ATNI provided input at a UNICEF/WHO workshop to develop a &#x2018;Toolkit for Policymakers to Implement the WHO Recommendations on Marketing Food and Non-Alcoholic Beverages to Children&#x2019;. Subsequently, separate meetings were held on March 29 with UNICEF and WHO nutrition experts. April Tokyo meeting with Global Index stakeholders To gain more insights on the relevance of the Global Index for Japanese companies and stakeholders in the region, ATNI organized a meeting in April in Tokyo with the assistance of Ajinomoto, one of the companies in the Global Index. Companies, industry associations, representatives from four ministries, academics and other stakeholders affirmed the relevance of the Index to guide and support the nutrition agenda of Japanese multinational companies abroad as well as in Japan. For the Japanese context, reference was made to the specific needs of an ageing population which could be an element in the methodology of the future indexes. GAIN Donor meeting, Ireland In April, ATNI was invited to attend and speak at a meeting for donors of GAIN in Dublin. ATNI presented the plan for the development of a &#x2018;Nutrition Business Monitor&#x2019; tool for SMEs. This project is funded by GAIN through its &#x2019;Making markets work for nutrition&#x2019; program. The tool will initially be piloted in Nigeria and Bangladesh among member companies of the local SBNs. Partnership for a Healthier America Summit in Chicago ATNI organized a networking lunch during the PHA Summit in Chicago on 2 April. The aim was to discuss what the largest F&amp;B companies in the US are doing to help consumers make healthier choices about what they eat and drink using the results of the ATNI U.S. Spotlight Index 2018 as starting point. May ATNI donor meeting, London In May, ATNI organized a meeting for its main donors, hosted by DFID in London. Interested DFID colleagues were invited to a presentation by ATNF&#x2019;s executive director on the BMS marketing assessment undertaken for the Global Indexes as well as the on the ground assessments in specific markets. Representatives from BMGF, UK DFID and DGIS reviewed and discussed the options for ATNI&#x2019;s next multi-year strategic planning (2020-2023). June EAT Forum, Stockholm ATNI attended the EAT Forum in Stockholm in June where the follow-up on the EAT-Lancet commission report &#x2018;Food in the Anthropocene: the EAT-Lancet Commission on healthy diets from sustainable food systems&#x2019; was the central theme. In sessions organized by GAIN, WBCSD/Fresh, UNICEF companies mentioned ATNI as the nutrition accountability mechanism they work with and would want to keep using. NBM roundtables in Nigeria and Bangladesh (June-August) ATNI travelled to Nigeria and Bangladesh, the two countries where the Nutrition Business Monitor project will roll out. In each country, we organized two roundtables; one for companies and one for CSOs and policymakers, where we presented our initial thought on how the NBM tool should look like in terms of structure and indicators. July - August Better Nutrition for a Healthier Workforce ATNI attended the 2-day roundtable organized by GAIN in Geneva in cooperation with the CGF in Geneva. The participants were stakeholders from companies with or interested in workforce programs, CSOs, UNICEF, ILO and other stakeholders involved in the supply chain. GAIN and CGF are working on developing a workforce nutrition toolkit for companies that will be launched in early 2020. National Nutrition Conclave India At the end of August 2019, the Executive Director of ATNF, Inge Kauer was invited to speak at a National Nutrition Conclave in Delhi, organized by the Confederation of Indian Industry&apos;s Food and Agriculture Centre of Excellence (CII-FACE), and participated in a panel with industry and CSO representatives. October UNICEF State of the World&#x2019;s Children 2019 ATNI was invited to provide its perspective on the role of the food industry to tackle malnutrition in the UNICEF&apos;s State of the World&apos;s Children 2019 report. For the first time in 20 years, UNICEF&#x2019;s flagship report examined the issue of children, food and nutrition, providing a fresh perspective on a rapidly evolving challenge. ATNI&#x2019;s work was featured in a two-page (pp 138-139) article in the report by Executive Director Inge Kauer. The report was released in October 2019 and ATNI attended the launch event in London. World food Day ATNI featured a blog on World Food Day, titled &apos;Acknowledging progress and prompting change&apos; and combined this with a social media outreach plan to celebrate the day. &#x2003; November - December SUN Global Gathering (Kathmandu, Nepal) The bi-annual Global Gathering of the Scaling up Nutrition movement brings together stakeholders from the nutrition sphere; from governments and policy makers, to UN agencies, CSOs and businesses. The stakeholders represent the member countries of SUN as well as international organizations working in those countries. ATNI was there to present the progress of the NBM project to the various SBNs and relevant stakeholders, as well as participate in discussions for the upcoming Nutrition for Growth Summit that will take place in Japan in December 2020. Companies and investor organizations mentioning ATNI in public statements A quickscan of company and investor organizations websites and public communications found 16 companies mentioning ATNI&#x2019;s work, as well as 32 investor organizations. The following box includes some examples of how they refer to ATNI. &#x201C;We worked with the Access to Nutrition Index Foundation to develop an evidence-based approach that can be applied to our analysis. Based on their scientific methodology, we can now identify companies that sell unhealthy food products.&#x201D; &#x2013; EQ Investors &#x201C;[T]he Access to Nutrition Foundation (the &#x2018;ATNF&#x2019;), a respected independent nonprofit organization, (&#x2026;) already produces credible reports covering our Company that encompass sugar and public health (&#x2026;). We believe it is important that our shareowners know that our Company acknowledges the ATNF findings and recognizes the role the Company must play in addressing health challenges.&#x201D; &#x2013; Coca-Cola &#x201C;The Access to Nutrition Foundation (ATNF), a respected independent non-profit organization, (&#x2026;) publishes reports that not only provide a robust assessment of PepsiCo&#x2019;s goals and performance, but a critical analysis and benchmarking on efforts of other leading food and beverage manufacturers to improve consumers&#x2019; access to nutritious foods and beverages.&#x201D; &#x2013; PepsiCo &#x201C;Engagement with PepsiCo on nutrition has been limited during the year. That said we were pleased to see the company increase its score on the new Access to Nutrition Index rankings.&#x201D; &#x2013; CCLA Investment Management &#x201C;This result is encouraging and we consider it a recognition of our efforts to give substance to our purpose nourishing by nature&#x201D; &#x2013; FrieslandCampina CEO Hein Schumacher on FrieslandCampina&#x2019;s performance in the Global Index 2018 &#x201C;The evaluation performed by ATNI and its 2018 Nutrition Index regarding the strength of our H&amp;W strategy has led us to improve our actions, commitments, practices, and performance to have a positive influence our consumers [sic!] so they may achieve better lifestyles and balanced diets.&#x201D; &#x2013; Grupo Bimbo &#x201C;Campbell uses the report to help inform nutrition strategy and best practices in policy development, transparency and communication on nutrition issues.&#x201D; &#x2013; Campbell &#x2003; 9. Action research In 2019, ATNI initiated Action Research on two topics which are central to our Indexes but where conclusive evidence, international standards and company best-practice is lacking or only just emerging. Action Research is designed to advance knowledge and understanding of the selected topics and ultimately to improve companies&#x2019; performance on them. 1. Affordability and accessibility of healthy foods: ATNI Indexes reveal that the companies tend to score most poorly on Category C, which assesses their policies, practices and disclosure on improving the affordability and accessibility of healthy foods in markets around the world. Affordability and accessibility are essentially determined by two core business functions: pricing and distribution. They are not therefore subject to international bodies&#x2019; standards, guidelines or regulation. ATNI initiated this piece of Action Research to investigate how food companies address nutrition considerations within their pricing and distribution activities, with a view to providing guidance about how they could improve their performance in these crucial areas. Moreover, the intention was to inform future ATNI Index methodologies. ATNI commissioned Carnstone Partners, a UK-based consultancy, to undertake the first phase of this research. They started by collating statistics on the presence and nature of Index companies&#x2019; businesses, and the market penetration of their products, in three key LMICs (Nigeria, India and Mexico), and in the UK market. They then undertook a series of interviews with industry experts to answer the following questions: &#x2022; How do companies organize their marketing and distribution activities in these markets? &#x2022; Why are companies struggling to perform well in this area? What might be the potential barriers preventing them from doing so? &#x2022; How could some of those barriers be overcome? The first phase of the research was completed by the end of 2019. Carnstone will finalize their report and make their recommendations to ATNI in early 2020. 2. Complementary Foods Commercially produced complementary foods are increasingly becoming part of young children&#x2019;s diets. Children everywhere need a healthy balanced diet appropriate to their age and stage of development. In LMICs, highly nutritious and appropriately fortified complementary foods are particularly important. During 2019, ATNI undertook research and consulted several organizations including UNICEF, GAIN, HKI and First Steps Nutrition. Their input has helped shape this Action Research. During 2020, ATNI intends to establish a blueprint for assessing the scale, growth and players in individual countries&#x2019; markets in respect of commercially produced complementary foods, and the role they are playing in young children&#x2019;s diets. Moreover, ATNI intends to pilot a Product Profile for complementary foods using the newly developed WHO Europe Nutrient Profiling model, in one emerging market. 10. Monitoring and Evaluation In September 2019, ATNI recruited a Program Manager who started the development of an internal M&amp;E framework. In 2020 ATNI intends to enhance its current measurement and evaluation to better articulate and evidence the impact of the Indexes and its other work. ATNI itself will carry out an external review of its key activities and outputs. As part of developing a robust M&amp;E system for ATNI the team reviewed and updated the theory of change based on the outlines for a new strategic plan 2020-2024 approved by the Board. 11. Risks The organization has adopted a risk management policy end 2019 describing how risks are identified, recorded in a risk register that also includes mitigation strategy, and how they are managed. At the organizational level ATNI identifies risks continuously through the stream of the regular staff meetings as well as in the context of the quarterly Board meeting. The results are reviewed by and discussed with the audit and risk committee in the Board at least annually. Independence ATNI maintained its independence in 2019 by not accepting any funding from industry and not having board or expert group members (recently) employed by food manufacturers. Company engagement In the research process for the second India Index, more companies provided data for the Product Profile assessment; eight out of 16 companies assessed used the opportunity to engage and provide additional information to ATNI actively. Companies to be assessed in the 2020 Global Index in large numbers actively asked ATNI for details of the methodology and planning for the 2020 Global Index. 17 out of 22 companies approached participated in a webinar organized for the purpose end 2019 and expressed their appreciation for the initiative. Impact in low income countries Ongoing projects to make sure that ATNI products make an impact in low-income countries as in high-income markets gained momentum in 2019. The Nutrition Business Monitor, a self-assessment tool for SMEs in emerging markets is not yet tested or finalized but could count on a lot of interest of SBNs in countries beyond Bangladesh and Nigeria (where the tool is piloted). In the project to develop a &#x2018;micronutrient enhanced&#x2019; Nutrient Profiling System experts and companies were consulted to come to a set-up assessing 6 micronutrients (iron, vitamins A, B12, D, folate, iodine). This will be tested with companies in India in 2020. &#x2003; Visibility/external profile ATNI has been substantially visible and active in international conferences and events on food and nutrition in 2019 (like the EAT Forum, the Hague Conference on Building Business Commitments for N4G preparations) including stakeholder meetings with other members of the World Benchmarking Alliance. Civil society organizations and companies alike expressed their appreciation for ATNI&#x2019;s products and the wish that ATNI keeps its focus on in-depth analysis of nutrition and health impacts. Competing mechanisms A new Food and Agriculture system benchmark planned by the World Benchmarking Alliance will cover more companies. Additionally, the benchmark will include environmental and social impacts derived from companies. The benchmark will only include a few indicators to look at nutrition (by making use of ATNI&#x2019;s expertise) but will not provide in-depth analysis as ATNI products do. Balance resources with expectations, Safeguarding policy The ATNI team has grown steadily up to 12 by end 2019 to match the growing number of projects and plans for 2020 and beyond, and one additional staff member is to join the team in early 2020. New staff members in 2019 were asked to sign a code of conduct and were trained on the safeguarding policy. Value for Money To ensure it delivers value for money ATNI has a constant dialogue with suppliers and sub-contractors on price levels of services provided. No significant new risks emerged in 2019 to be added to the risk register nor were changes observed in the likelihood of risks to occur or the severity of their impacts. ATNI did develop a risk management policy in 2019 that was reviewed by and adopted by the Board end 2019. &#x2003; 12. 2019 in Pictures &#x2003; &#xAC;</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">1. Introduction The Access to Nutrition Initiative (ATNI), an independent non-profit organization based in the Netherlands, is dedicated to driving changes in the global nutrition landscape by tracking and assessing the food industry&#x2019;s attempts to tackle undernutrition, obesity and diet-related chronic diseases through designing and delivering a range of accountability tools. The organization influences the industries&#x2019; contribution to address global nutrition challenges, by objectively assessing the food industry and publishing Global and Spotlight Country Nutrition Indexes and by developing new accountability tools and studies to support this. ATNI aims to encourage companies both to increase access to healthy products and to responsibly exercise their influence on consumers&#x2019; choice and behavior. The organization in 2019 worked on a wide range and growing number of activities to drive the private sector&#x2019;s performance on healthy affordable diets beyond its flagship Global Index and Spotlight Country Indexes. To reflect the strategic choice to expand the scope of its benchmarking work and develop new accountability tools, a new name and branding (with adapted logo) was chosen and introduced in 2019: &#x2018;Access to Nutrition Initiative&#x2019;. The acronym ATNI coincides with that of the Access to Nutrition Index, well known by all stakeholders working with, or making use of the organization&apos;s products over the last six years. With a new design agency all the groundwork was done for the organization&#x2019;s new interactive website along with the new house style and branding to be launched early 2020. The organization&#x2019;s legal status as foundation and registration in The Netherlands as the &#x2018;Stichting Access to Nutrition Foundation&#x2019; does not change. Throughout 2019, the organization has done the necessary preparatory work such as industry engagement, data collection, and data processing, required for the launch of the second iteration of the India Spotlight Index in February 2020. Additionally, the preparatory work for the second US Spotlight Index has been started to facilitate the assessment in 2020 and launching the report in the second quarter of 2021. In 2019, ATNI has done an intensive revision of the methodology for the Global Index to adopt the most recent contextual changes and to incorporate stakeholders&#x2019; feedback for the Global Index 2020. Working with and supported by the Global Alliance on Improved Nutrition (GAIN), ATNI started the design and development of a self-assessment tool for small and medium-sized companies in countries with rapidly emerging food and beverage (F&amp;B) industries that have a national Scaling up Nutrition (SUN) Business Network. The tool aims to help small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to be aware of their role and opportunities to improve nutrition and benchmark their performance against their peers and larger companies. In Nigeria and Bangladesh, a total of 50 SMEs and civil society organizations and government agencies are helping to build this tool and make it as relevant as possible for the local context. A first draft version of the tool will be tested in these countries early 2020. ATNI took part in the preparations for the Tokyo Nutrition for Growth (N4G) Summit planned for 2020. The organization was invited to be part of different working groups (on data &amp; accountability and food systems) to set the agenda and set the stage for meaningful and specific, measurable, achievable, realistic, and time-bound (SMART) commitments by all stakeholders and specifically the private sector. Along with GAIN, ATNI has organized an international conference in The Hague to build business commitments for N4G. The World Health Organization (WHO) asked ATNI to help set up a global monitoring mechanism to track company reformulation efforts on salt and added sugar. In November, ATNI has published the UK Product Profile Report which revealed that some 18 largest F&amp;B manufacturers in the U.K need to increase their sales of healthy products to demonstrate that they are serious about making a meaningful contribution to consumers&#x2019; diets and public health. This should also help address the mounting business risks associated with poor diets, deal with or be prepared for regulatory intervention and the impacts on productivity among their workforces. In collaboration with ShareAction and with funding from the Guy&#x2019;s and St Thomas&#x2019; Charity, ATNI took first steps to look at the vital role the retail sector has to play in providing affordable, healthy diets to all consumers. To expand the scope of its work to this part of the food value chain, ATNI studied the UK food retail sector to shed light on the commitments and contributions of the ten largest UK food and drink retailers in regard to promoting healthy food and helping consumers to move away from high fat, salt and sugar products. The results will be presented in a report early 2020. After summer, ATNI has started action research to investigate two Index topics, namely 1: Access and Affordability of healthy food and 2: Nutrition quality of complementary foods for young children. In these categories, companies in general score low or international guidelines and standards are lacking. Since the launch of the first Global Index in 2013, more than 72 investment firms have become signatories to the Access to Nutrition Index Investor Statement, with over $7 trillion assets under management. We are pleased to mention that complementing the multi-year core funding that ATNI receives from the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, the Netherlands&#x2019; Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the UK Department for International Development in 2019 our organization has additionally received support from GAIN for the Nutrition Business Monitor project and the Guy&apos;s and St Thomas&apos; NHS Foundation Trust through ShareAction for the work on the UK Product Profile and the retailer study. At the end of 2019, ATNI also signed an agreement with Irish Aid to fund the development of new accountability tools to increase transparency around baby food companies&#x2019; lobbying and influencing of policymaking processes and with the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF) for the launch of the second U.S. Spotlight Index. Our team has grown steadily up to 12 by end 2019 and one additional staff member is to join the team in early 2020. Looking back at 2019, ATNI is increasingly recognized as an independent authority on benchmarking F&amp;B industry&apos;s efforts to contribute to better nutrition. Most of the companies assessed in the Indexes have been supportive and engaged during the research phase. Also, after the launch of the reports, they have actively communicated for validating the scores and followed up on the recommendations. Our engagement with companies for the upcoming Indexes has witnessed engagement, enthusiasm as well as a great commitment to improving their overall scores and contributions to tackle malnutrition. Our work is being increasingly recognized by the stakeholders engaged in the global nutrition landscape, including international organizations such as the World Health Organization (WHO) and UNICEF, civil society organizations and investors. Inge Kauer, Executive Director, Access to Nutrition Foundation &#x2003; 2. Global Index The third Global Access to Nutrition Index 2018, assessing the 22 globally largest F&amp;Bmanufacturers, has revealed that while the companies started increasingly emphasizing on their efforts to introduce better diets, still serious concerns remained on the healthiness of the product portfolios. ATNI, in 2018 and 2019, during the post-launch engagements shared this message with the companies which encouraged transformation and initiated changes. Listed companies (like Keurig Dr Pepper and Kraft Heinz) that did not actively engage during the Global and US Index 2018 research phase did show interest to discuss the findings of the 2018 Index and to actively engage in the iterations process for the upcoming Global Index 2020. In 2019, ATNI received some noteworthy recognition from the companies that it has assessed. Several companies, recognizing ATNI&#x2019;s Product Profile, indicated considering the Health Star Rating as an independent nutrient profiling system besides its internal system. ATNI&#x2019;s initiatives have been on the agenda of some companies&#x2019; Board meetings and influenced their strategy discussions. One company team indicated that the Index was a useful tool to drive their internal thinking and contributing to a portfolio with more &#x2018;nutrition positive&#x2019; products. Another company mentioned that ATNI&#x2019;s outreach at international fora and conferences was remarkable. In March 2019, Coca Cola&#x2019;s board reportedly opposed a shareholders resolution to report &#x2018;an assessment of risks to Coke&apos;s finances and reputation associated with changing scientific understanding of the role of sugar in disease causation&#x2019; as the Access to Nutrition Foundation, an independent nonprofit, already produces reports about Coke that address sugar and public health. ATNI continued consulting with all stakeholders, including the companies to gather feedback on the methodology review for the upcoming Global Access to Nutrition Index 2020. During the post-launch consultation process of Global Index 2018, ATNI received recommendations for the Index to reduce complexity and perceived duplications as well as incorporate vital changes and improvements that companies had initiated. Considering the feedback, in 2019, ATNI started a revision process for the Global Index methodology for the upcoming Global Index 2020. ATNI selected 25 companies in total for the Global Index 2020 iteration. The three new/additional companies are Keurig Dr Pepper (American company that was assessed for the U.S. Spotlight Index 2018, but not for the Global Index), China Mengniu and Yili (Chinese companies). In the last quarter of the year, ATNI went through a consultation process with all the companies to discuss the main changes and novelties of the Global Index methodology. The proposed main changes were also duly presented and discussed with the ATNI Expert Group and Board. Changes in Global Index 2020 Methodology &#x2022; In the Global Index 2018, the Corporate Profile and Product Profile were presented as separate outputs with different scores and rankings. The methodology review led to integrate the Product Profile results into Category B of the Corporate Profile to offer one overall Index ranking. For the Global Index 2020, these changes imply that the Product Profile being incorporated into Category B will carry 20% of the total Index weight. &#x2022; In the Global Index 2018, the company-wide actions for preventing and addressing undernutrition (among the populations at risk in developing countries) were assessed within an undernutrition section. The undernutrition indicators were not applied to companies that derived less than 5% of their F&amp;B revenues from non-OECD markets. In the Global Index 2020 methodology, the commitment of companies to specifically address the needs and key nutritional priorities for populations at-risk is considered relevant for both developed and developing countries. As a result, how comprehensively a company covers various forms of malnutrition, is based on the company&#x2019;s market presence and the specific micronutrient deficiencies/undernutrition issues in all markets. &#x2022; For the Global Index 2018 iteration, ATNI focused on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs); particularly with regards to reaching Goals 2 (zero hunger) and 3 (health and well-being for all). In the Global Index 2020 new methodology, ATNI has also incorporated indicators assessing companies&#x2019; efforts in reducing the per capita food loss and waste along F&amp;Bproduction and supply chains (from the post-harvest stage to the retail and consumer levels), in line with Sustainable Development Goal 12 (target 12.3). Stakeholders consultation and feedback on updated methodology Companies selected for the Global Index 2020 assessment were invited to take part in an online survey at the end of 2019. Overall, the stakeholders have received the revised methodology positively. Most of the companies that responded support the integration of the Product Profile into Category B (Formulating Appropriate Products). The consultation also involved investors as an important group of stakeholders in the overall process of the methodology revision. In December 2019, ATNI organized a webinar to collate feedback from the investors. The investor group has particularly appreciated the incorporation of the food loss and food waste concepts to the methodology. The combined stakeholders&#x2019; feedback was considered to finalize the Global Index methodology, which will be submitted to the Expert Group members for further review in January 2020. 3. Monitoring marketing of breast-milk substitutes and complementary foods Because of the importance of infant and young child nutrition (IYCN), each edition of the Global Access to Nutrition Index includes a breast-milk substitutes (BMS)/complementary foods (CF) Marketing sub-ranking that scores and ranks the world&#x2019;s largest baby food manufacturers&#x2019; marketing policies, and practices and disclosure. This analysis assesses the extent to which these companies market their products in line with the International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes (The Code) and subsequent relevant World Health Assembly (WHA) resolutions, including WHA 69.9 (together referred to as The Code) . We use a comprehensive, robust and published methodology to do so, developed with the advice of WHO, UNICEF and many other international experts and not-for-profit organizations dedicated to improving infant and young child nutrition (IYCN). ATNI&#x2019;s work In 2019, ATNI started preparing for the two assessments that will feed into the BMS/CF Marketing sub-ranking of the Global Index 2020. Whereas for the previous Index only six companies were included in this sub-ranking, for the next Global Index ATNI is extending its coverage to the ten largest baby food companies globally: Danone, FrieslandCampina, Kraft Heinz, Nestl&#xE9;, Abbott, RB/Mead Johnson Nutrition (RB/MJN), Pepsico, Feihe International, Inner Mongolia Yili Industrial Group and China Mengniu Dairy. Two emerging markets were selected in which NetCode studies will be undertaken to assess the extent of marketing of BMS and CF products. ATNI has again contracted Westat to conduct these studies. The BMS/CF Marketing assessment, including the two country reports, will be completed in 2020. New partnerships Additionally, ATNI partnered with FTSE Russell. In recent years, ATNI and FTSE Russell have conducted similar but separate in-country verification exercises of companies&#x2019; BMS Marketing. From 2019 onwards, ATNI will provide data to FTSE Russell from our in-country NetCode studies, to feed into its approach to determine whether BMS companies meet its criteria for inclusion in its FTSE4Good Indexes. ATNI will continue to apply its criteria and methodology as previously for its Indexes. For more information on the agreement between FTSE Russell and ATNI, please read the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs). How ATNI&#x2019;s work on BMS and CF Marketing is viewed and used ATNI is now widely recognized among key stakeholders that work on this topic as providing the definitive analysis of the major baby food companies&#x2019; marketing policies and practices. We publish a wide range of materials for use by stakeholders, including a dedicated chapter within each Global Index report, separate Scorecards for each BMS company, a summary report of each &#x2013; and in-country studies of marketing practices, as well as Westat&#x2019;s full technical reports of those studies. Some major institutional investors, such as Norges Bank Investment Management (NBIM) and BMO Global Asset Management, use our analysis to inform their engagement with these companies. The purpose of their engagement is to encourage companies to adopt policies and practices that implement The Code. ATNI has been approached by B-Lab, the organization that created B-Corp certification. B-Lab is planning to introduce new BMS Marketing standards, which any company wanting to become a B-Corp must meet. It is proposing to tie companies&#x2019; qualification for B Corp certification to a percentage score on our BMS/CF Marketing sub-ranking. Within the auspices of the N4G Summit, efforts are being made to encourage baby food companies to commit to full Code compliance by 2030, and to announce and take a major step forwards from their current policies and/or practices within 2020. Further, they are being asked to publish an action plan that sets out how they will achieve Code compliance over the next decade. ATNI has been proposed as the organization that will track companies&#x2019; implementation of those action plans. 4. India Spotlight Index, 2020 Company selection and engagement process Preparations for the second Access to Nutrition India Spotlight Index 2020, that started at the end of 2018, continued throughout 2019. The Index has built upon the analysis and the recognition that ATNI received from most stakeholders on the first India Index in 2016. The Index had been broadly recognized as influential in driving positive changes among Indian F&amp;B companies to emphasis on diet, nutrition and health issues. The Index also aimed to broadly complement the efforts made by other stakeholders, including the Government-led Eat Right India movement, to address all forms of malnutrition. ATNI research in 2019 mainly focused on the contribution made by the 16 largest F&amp;B manufacturers in India. The research investigated the companies&#x2019; policies, practices and disclosure related to nutrition uptake. The second India Spotlight Index covers the same topics and takes the same broad approach to assess, score and rank the companies as the first iteration. However, the methodology was updated to incorporate relevant feedback from companies, civil society stakeholders and a review panel of experts in India consisting of: &#x2022; Dr. Rajan Sankar, Director Nutrition and Vivek Arora, Senior Advisor, Tata Trusts; &#x2022; Rohini Saran, Deputy Lead Food Fortification Resource Centre, Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI); &#x2022; Dr. Avula Laxmaiah, Scientist &#x2018;G&#x2019; &amp; Head, Public Health, National Institute of Nutrition (NIN) Hyderabad, India; &#x2022; Devyani Hari, Director Programmes, Centre for Responsible Business (CRB); &#x2022; Rachna Sujay, Senior Technical Advisor Diffusion States, Alive &amp; Thrive; &#x2022; Dr. Antaryami Dash, Advisor Nutrition, Save the Children India; &#x2022; Shiva Mudgil, Vice President, RaboResearch Food &amp; Agribusiness, Rabobank India. Based on 2018 retail sales, the 16 largest F&amp;B manufacturers were selected for the India Spotlight Index 2020. These companies together accounted for 31% of India&#x2019;s packaged F&amp;B market share with a combined total retail sale of just over INR 1800 billion (approximately equivalent to EUR 21.89 billion). Eleven out of the sixteen companies have headquarters based in India and the other five are multinationals with headquarters elsewhere. Multiple stakeholders such as funders, nutrition experts, CSOs and Government bodies were consulted through roundtable meetings in early 2019. Eight companies and the industry association CII (the Confederation of Indian Industry) participated in a private sector roundtable, discussing the methodology and planning of the research. The ATNI team engaged with two more companies through separate meetings. Multi-stakeholder engagement The following civil society and public sector organizations participated in separate roundtables or were consulted separately on the methodology and during the research process. Research phase In May 2019, ATNI, organized webinars to inform companies on the use of the data gathering platform and further details on the India Spotlight Index research process and planning. Seven companies attended the webinars, and the rest of the companies were informed on the process through one-on-one meetings. Over summer, companies had the opportunity to access the online data gathering platform to see the first assessment and provide additional information or evidence. In August 2019, ATNI organized a visit to India for face-to-face meetings with senior management in some of the companies based in Kolkata, Chennai, Bangalore and Delhi. The main agenda of the meetings was explaining &#x2013; (a) the rationale and the mmethodology of the second ATNI India Index to the companies; (b) the importance for the companies to engage in the research process and the options to do so. Two new companies subsequently announced to participate in the research process actively. ATNI and its India-based communication partner AvianWe, also received remarkable attention from the print media with articles and interviews published in different local outlets during 2019 (see overview in the section outreach activities). End of August 2019, the Executive Director of ATNI, Inge Kauer was invited to speak at a National Nutrition Conclave in Delhi, organized by the Confederation of the Indian Industry&apos;s Food and Agriculture Centre of Excellence (FACE), and participated in a panel with industry and CSO representatives. Eight out of sixteen companies, selected for the second India Index, actively engaged during the research phase to provide additional information and evidence on organizations&#x2019; policies and practices. Four other companies that either participated in meetings (that the ATNI team organized to explain the methodology and research process) or met with ATNI staff individually, finally did not make use of the option to exchange information through ATNI&apos;s online data gathering platform in the research phase. The remaining four companies declined to engage due to other priorities. ATNI will further explore how best to encourage these companies to participate in the future Indexes. There was a substantial increase (from 3 in 2016 to 7 for the 2020 Index) in the number of companies providing data on their product lists for the Product Profile product assessments, which contributed significantly to the quality of the assessment. Analysis and launch preparation The subsequent analysis, quality checks and verifications and scoring of companies continued during the last quarter of 2019. Experts from ATNI&#x2019;s global Expert Group and in India from GAIN (Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition), CII (the Confederation of Indian Industry) and FSSAI (the Government Food Safety and Standards Authority), and Tata Trusts TINI (The India Nutrition Initiative)reviewed the main findings and messages. For each company, individual summary reports of main findings (the company scorecard) were drafted and shared with the companies for them to crosscheck any factual inconsistencies and disclosure of non-public data. This summary did not indicate how the companies scored and ranked in the overall Index. ATNI commissioned the George Institute for Global Health (The George Institute) to conduct the Product Profile assessment for the 16 companies selected in the India Index 2020. And they also analyzed changes in the nutritional profile of packaged F&amp;B products from 11 large companies in India over a three-year period. 1456 products marketed in India by the 16 companies were analyzed in the Product Profile assessment. Innova Market Insights (Innova), a commercial knowledge supplier for the F&amp;B industry, provided additional product composition data. Because of the extra efforts put in the company engagement and the consequently required longer research period, ATNI decided in consultation with stakeholders in India (Industry and Government) to postpone the launch of the second Index to February 2020. 5. Investor Engagement Collaborative Company Engagement by ATNI&#x2019;s Investor Signatories During 2019, ATNI continued to support a group of 31 of its 72 Investor Signatories that signed up to engage with the 18 listed companies included in the Global and US Indexes published in 2018. ATNI hosted quarterly calls with this investor group during the year to facilitate coordination of their work. Some of these investors requested briefing calls from ATNI before their engagement calls with companies, to ensure that they were entirely up to speed on their performance on the Index(es) in critical areas. Towards the end of the year, each investor leading the engagement with a company completed a tool to capture their discussions with the company, in order to be able to review the collaborative engagement process. A consultant was hired to undertake this review, which is due to be completed by April 2020. ATNI will use it to inform the ways in which we support our investor signatories. We hope to be able to substantially increase the number of investor signatories as our capacity to support them grows with the advent of new funding in this area. ATNI encourages major investors to engage with baby food companies about their BMS marketing In January, ATNI wrote to the ten largest shareholders in each of the five listed baby food companies that we assess and rank (Nestl&#xE9;, Danone, Abbott, RB and KraftHeinz). We outlined our comprehensive approach to assessing these companies&#x2019; BMS marketing policies and practices and enclosed the relevant materials. We offered each investor a briefing call on the performance of the companies they were shareholders of. While few responded, as we expected, one that did was NBIM. On a follow-up call with NBIM, it outlined its active engagement with ten BMS companies in which it had shareholdings. NBIM noted that it had used our materials, which it finds comprehensive and helped determine which questions to ask. Partnership with ShareAction on its Healthy Markets campaign Work also continued with ShareAction &#x2013; a UK based not-for-profit organization that campaigns with investors on nutrition issues &#x2013; to inform and shape investor engagement through its Healthy Markets campaign. On September 18th, ATNI published the first-ever Product Profile for the UK. This report presented an analysis of the nutritional quality of the product portfolios of 18 of the largest food manufacturers that sell their products in the UK. It found that 69% of more than 3,000 products analysed did not meet the healthy standard of a Health Star Rating of 3.5 and that 85% of the products were unsuitable to be marketed to children. The publication attracted a lot of social media activity. ATNI also posted a blog about it, and ShareAction authored a feature. ATNI started work to adapt its standard Index methodology used to assess manufacturers to retailers&#x2019; business models, with input from several UK experts. Once finalized, ATNI hired a consultant to undertake research on the reporting of the UK&#x2019;s ten largest supermarket chains on diets, nutrition and health. This research was completed by the end of the year. The consultant began to draft the final report, and preparations began to launch the report in Q1 2020, in close consultation with ShareAction and the funder of this work, Guys &amp; St Thomas&#x2019;s Charity. Support for Plating Up Progress Throughout the year, ATNI served on the advisory group for a new UK-focused initiative called Plating Up Progress, a collaboration between the Food and Climate Research Network based at Oxford University and the UK Food Foundation. Plating Up Progress is working to develop a set of metrics that investors can press food companies to adopt in their reporting, and to guide their policies and practices, to demonstrate their contribution to creating a sustainable, healthy food system. In January and March 2019, ATNI participated in two Plating up Progress investor workshops in London and provided comments on the two reports that were published during the year. Investor Portal Together with our website developers, a password-protected investor portal on our website has been under development during the year. This portal will allow ATNI&#x2019;s Investor Signatories to log in to access relevant ATNI documents, information about collaborative engagement and serve as a repository of investor-authored or investor-relevant reports on nutrition. The portal will be launched in 2020. &#x2003; 6. Development of new spotlight indexes and accountability tools Nutrition Business Monitor ATNI partnered with GAIN and the SUN Business Network (SBN) in the &#x201C;Nutrition Business Monitor&#x201D; project designed to develop and pilot a new voluntary self-assessment tool for SMEs in the F&amp;B sector. The tool aims to help SMEs review where they stand regarding their nutritional policies and practices and provide them with recommendations on how to improve. Along with the SBN in Nigeria and Bangladesh, ATNI organized a series of roundtables which were instrumental in bringing together feedback and input from in total 50 CSOs and Government bodies and Companies to design the tool compatible to the local context. The ATNI team also took the opportunity to get insight into the national business environment, the challenges and opportunities in the F&amp;B sector through individual meetings with relevant authorities and company visits. Collating all the relevant feedback and input from both countries, the ATNI team developed the draft indicators, the weighting, the scoring and the recommendations to construct the first version. The draft version was later presented in the SUN Global Gathering, in November 2019 in Nepal where it was reviewed by SBN coordinators, GAIN directors, as well as SMEs and other stakeholders. The feedback and input from this session were then incorporated to design the final tool. During those sessions, some SBN networks manifested their interest to test the tool as well and see how it could be used in their countries. Following the completion of the final version, ATNI started the work with its IT provider to create the tool online. The first draft of the tool will be finalized in February and presented in the two countries in the first half of 2020. The tool is now divided into five categories: Management and Products, Marketing, Workforce programs, Labelling and Engagement and it contains in total 27 main indicators. The user-friendly design of the tool will allow the companies to fill this in within 1-2 hours and to easily navigate to different sections. U.S. Spotlight Index In 2019, ATNI received funding from RWJF for the second iteration of an U.S. Spotlight Index to be published in 2021. To take the U.S. Spotlight initiative forward, the ATNI team proceeded in 2019 with the methodology review ensuring its alignment with the Global Index 2020 methodology. The revised methodology will be submitted to the U.S. Expert Group after consultations with stakeholders early 2020. A U.S.-based Research and Engagement adviser will be recruited in the first quarter of 2020. &#x2003; 7. Nutrition for Growth (N4G) summit and aligning global accountability mechanisms Nutrition for Growth In 2019, ATNI took part in the preparations for the Tokyo Nutrition for Growth (N4G) Summit planned for 2020. The organization was invited to be part of different working groups. ATNI has been part of a food systems working group, and co-lead the working group on accountability&#x202F;to form the agenda and set the stage for meaningful and SMART commitments by all stakeholders and specifically, the private sector. With GAIN, ATNI has organized an international conference in The Hague in June 2019 to build business commitments for N4G (see box). After summer, the Government of Japan has established a new advisory group in which ATNI participates as the former co-lead of the accountability working group. ATNI is also an observer in the Business Constituency Group (consisting of the major global industry associations: the Consumer Goods Forum (CGF), Food Industry Asia (FIA), the International Food and Beverage Alliance (IFBA), the SBN and the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD). ATNI has proposed to the Government of Japan and organizers of the N4G to develop a set of Investor Expectations on Nutrition, to echo a similar set of expectations on climate change, lobbying on climate change and other ESG issues. The proposed approach is to evolve the current Investor Statement into these Investor Expectations. &#x2003; WHO Global Monitoring Mechanism During an UNGA side-event on NCD&#x2019;s in September 2018, the WHO announced its desire to develop a mechanism to track how the world&#x2019;s largest F&amp;B manufacturers are aligning their commitments, targets and practices to WHO guidance and recommendations. The background paper prepared by WHO for this purpose referenced ATNI extensively. ATNI has been invited to co-lead the design and delivery of the Mechanism, in collaboration with WHO. ATNI has since participated in several WHO-led calls to discuss the development of a Global monitoring mechanism and has presented a proposal to WHO for a Global Corporate Action Tracker on nutrition (working title: GCAT). Initially, GCAT will track company progress concerning product development and reformulation, marketing to children, nutrition labelling and the use of nutrition content and health claims. GCAT in future also has the potential to be expanded monitoring other aspects of business practice related to nutrition such as &#x2013; (a) methodology to assess the levels of industrial trans-fat or sodium in companies&#x2019; products; (b) a mechanism to evaluate companies&#x2019; progress at a national level led by TGI and INFORMAS, respectively. ATNI aims to publish the first report coinciding with the Nutrition for Growth summit in 2020 in Tokyo (N4G 2020). Aligning Accountability Mechanisms, WBA and GAIN ATNI is one of the allies of the World Benchmarking Alliance (WBA) and participated in 2019 in several consultations to inform WBA&#x2019;s plans for an overarching benchmark on Food and Agriculture (a first edition is foreseen for 2021) to facilitate a transformation in the food system. ATNI is ready to provide expertise to the WBA team for building this benchmark that will make use of a few indicators included in the ATNI Indexes. ATNI and WBA will align to avoid any duplications and companies being approached twice with the same questions. GAIN and the SBN in 2018 organized a workshop with civil society and industry to map existing accountability mechanism in nutrition. ATNI participated and provided input for the consequent report, entitled &#x201C;A review of Business Accountability Mechanisms in Nutrition&#x201D; and published in March 2019. GAIN and SBN announced a follow-up workshop in early 2020 in cooperation with the CGF to align accountability mechanisms in nutrition and come up with a framework for this alignment. &#x2003; 8. Outreach activities Communications update: interactive website and new house style/branding The organization in 2019 worked on a wide range and a growing number of activities to drive the private sector&#x2019;s performance on healthy affordable diets beyond its flagship Global Index and Spotlight Country Indexes. To reflect the strategic choice to expand the scope of its benchmarking work and to develop new accountability tools, a new name and branding (with adapted logo) were chosen and introduced in 2019: &#x2018;Access to Nutrition Initiative&#x2019;. The acronym ATNI coincides with that of the Access to Nutrition Index, well known by all stakeholders working with, or making use of the organization&apos;s products over the last six years. With a new design agency, all the groundwork was done for the organization&#x2019;s new interactive website along with the new house style and branding to be launched early 2020. The organization&#x2019;s legal status as foundation and registration in The Netherlands as the &#x2018;Stichting Access to Nutrition Foundation&#x2019; did not change. Key outreach activities, meetings, conferences in 2019 India media outreach In India, while working on the research and analysis for the 2020 India Spotlight Index, with its local communication/ PR partner AvianWe, ATNI has been successful in being visible in media throughout 2019 to sensitize stakeholders in the food system and consumers alike on the importance of private sector accountability on nutrition issues. An overview of these articles and features in different media outlets can be found on ATNI&#x2019;s website. &#x2003; January - February Netherlands Working Group on International Nutrition ATNI joined the Netherlands Working Group on International Nutrition, a platform with corporate, CSO and government members to promote nutrition specific and nutrition sensitive approaches in development strategies of Dutch stakeholders.

Companies and investor organizations mentioning ATNI in public statements A quickscan of company and investor organizations websites and public communications found 16 companies mentioning ATNI&#x2019;s work, as well as 32 investor organizations. The following box includes some examples of how they refer to ATNI. &#x201C;We worked with the Access to Nutrition Index Foundation to develop an evidence-based approach that can be applied to our analysis. Based on their scientific methodology, we can now identify companies that sell unhealthy food products.&#x201D; &#x2013; EQ Investors &#x201C;[T]he Access to Nutrition Foundation (the &#x2018;ATNF&#x2019;), a respected independent nonprofit organization, (&#x2026;) already produces credible reports covering our Company that encompass sugar and public health (&#x2026;). We believe it is important that our shareowners know that our Company acknowledges the ATNF findings and recognizes the role the Company must play in addressing health challenges.&#x201D; &#x2013; Coca-Cola &#x201C;The Access to Nutrition Foundation (ATNF), a respected independent non-profit organization, (&#x2026;) publishes reports that not only provide a robust assessment of PepsiCo&#x2019;s goals and performance, but a critical analysis and benchmarking on efforts of other leading food and beverage manufacturers to improve consumers&#x2019; access to nutritious foods and beverages.&#x201D; &#x2013; PepsiCo &#x201C;Engagement with PepsiCo on nutrition has been limited during the year. That said we were pleased to see the company increase its score on the new Access to Nutrition Index rankings.&#x201D; &#x2013; CCLA Investment Management &#x201C;This result is encouraging and we consider it a recognition of our efforts to give substance to our purpose nourishing by nature&#x201D; &#x2013; FrieslandCampina CEO Hein Schumacher on FrieslandCampina&#x2019;s performance in the Global Index 2018 &#x201C;The evaluation performed by ATNI and its 2018 Nutrition Index regarding the strength of our H&amp;W strategy has led us to improve our actions, commitments, practices, and performance to have a positive influence our consumers [sic!] so they may achieve better lifestyles and balanced diets.&#x201D; &#x2013; Grupo Bimbo &#x201C;Campbell uses the report to help inform nutrition strategy and best practices in policy development, transparency and communication on nutrition issues.&#x201D; &#x2013; Campbell &#x2003; 9. Action research In 2019, ATNI initiated Action Research on two topics which are central to our Indexes but where conclusive evidence, international standards and company best-practice is lacking or only just emerging. Action Research is designed to advance knowledge and understanding of the selected topics and ultimately to improve companies&#x2019; performance on them. 1. Affordability and accessibility of healthy foods: ATNI Indexes reveal that the companies tend to score most poorly on Category C, which assesses their policies, practices and disclosure on improving the affordability and accessibility of healthy foods in markets around the world. Affordability and accessibility are essentially determined by two core business functions: pricing and distribution. They are not therefore subject to international bodies&#x2019; standards, guidelines or regulation. ATNI initiated this piece of Action Research to investigate how food companies address nutrition considerations within their pricing and distribution activities, with a view to providing guidance about how they could improve their performance in these crucial areas. Moreover, the intention was to inform future ATNI Index methodologies. ATNI commissioned Carnstone Partners, a UK-based consultancy, to undertake the first phase of this research. They started by collating statistics on the presence and nature of Index companies&#x2019; businesses, and the market penetration of their products, in three key LMICs (Nigeria, India and Mexico), and in the UK market. They then undertook a series of interviews with industry experts to answer the following questions: &#x2022; How do companies organize their marketing and distribution activities in these markets? &#x2022; Why are companies struggling to perform well in this area? What might be the potential barriers preventing them from doing so? &#x2022; How could some of those barriers be overcome? The first phase of the research was completed by the end of 2019. Carnstone will finalize their report and make their recommendations to ATNI in early 2020. 2. Complementary Foods Commercially produced complementary foods are increasingly becoming part of young children&#x2019;s diets. Children everywhere need a healthy balanced diet appropriate to their age and stage of development. In LMICs, highly nutritious and appropriately fortified complementary foods are particularly important. During 2019, ATNI undertook research and consulted several organizations including UNICEF, GAIN, HKI and First Steps Nutrition. Their input has helped shape this Action Research. During 2020, ATNI intends to establish a blueprint for assessing the scale, growth and players in individual countries&#x2019; markets in respect of commercially produced complementary foods, and the role they are playing in young children&#x2019;s diets. Moreover, ATNI intends to pilot a Product Profile for complementary foods using the newly developed WHO Europe Nutrient Profiling model, in one emerging market. 10. Monitoring and Evaluation In September 2019, ATNI recruited a Program Manager who started the development of an internal M&amp;E framework. In 2020 ATNI intends to enhance its current measurement and evaluation to better articulate and evidence the impact of the Indexes and its other work. ATNI itself will carry out an external review of its key activities and outputs. As part of developing a robust M&amp;E system for ATNI the team reviewed and updated the theory of change based on the outlines for a new strategic plan 2020-2024 approved by the Board. 11. Risks The organization has adopted a risk management policy end 2019 describing how risks are identified, recorded in a risk register that also includes mitigation strategy, and how they are managed. At the organizational level ATNI identifies risks continuously through the stream of the regular staff meetings as well as in the context of the quarterly Board meeting. The results are reviewed by and discussed with the audit and risk committee in the Board at least annually. Independence ATNI maintained its independence in 2019 by not accepting any funding from industry and not having board or expert group members (recently) employed by food manufacturers. Company engagement In the research process for the second India Index, more companies provided data for the Product Profile assessment; eight out of 16 companies assessed used the opportunity to engage and provide additional information to ATNI actively. Companies to be assessed in the 2020 Global Index in large numbers actively asked ATNI for details of the methodology and planning for the 2020 Global Index. 17 out of 22 companies approached participated in a webinar organized for the purpose end 2019 and expressed their appreciation for the initiative. Impact in low income countries Ongoing projects to make sure that ATNI products make an impact in low-income countries as in high-income markets gained momentum in 2019. The Nutrition Business Monitor, a self-assessment tool for SMEs in emerging markets is not yet tested or finalized but could count on a lot of interest of SBNs in countries beyond Bangladesh and Nigeria (where the tool is piloted). In the project to develop a &#x2018;micronutrient enhanced&#x2019; Nutrient Profiling System experts and companies were consulted to come to a set-up assessing 6 micronutrients (iron, vitamins A, B12, D, folate, iodine). This will be tested with companies in India in 2020. &#x2003; Visibility/external profile ATNI has been substantially visible and active in international conferences and events on food and nutrition in 2019 (like the EAT Forum, the Hague Conference on Building Business Commitments for N4G preparations) including stakeholder meetings with other members of the World Benchmarking Alliance. Civil society organizations and companies alike expressed their appreciation for ATNI&#x2019;s products and the wish that ATNI keeps its focus on in-depth analysis of nutrition and health impacts. Competing mechanisms A new Food and Agriculture system benchmark planned by the World Benchmarking Alliance will cover more companies. Additionally, the benchmark will include environmental and social impacts derived from companies. The benchmark will only include a few indicators to look at nutrition (by making use of ATNI&#x2019;s expertise) but will not provide in-depth analysis as ATNI products do. Balance resources with expectations, Safeguarding policy The ATNI team has grown steadily up to 12 by end 2019 to match the growing number of projects and plans for 2020 and beyond, and one additional staff member is to join the team in early 2020. New staff members in 2019 were asked to sign a code of conduct and were trained on the safeguarding policy. Value for Money To ensure it delivers value for money ATNI has a constant dialogue with suppliers and sub-contractors on price levels of services provided. No significant new risks emerged in 2019 to be added to the risk register nor were changes observed in the likelihood of risks to occur or the severity of their impacts. ATNI did develop a risk management policy in 2019 that was reviewed by and adopted by the Board end 2019. &#x2003; 12. 2019 in Pictures &#x2003; &#xAC;</narrative>
