Progress on relevant objectives for April - June 2020

Core Objective 1: Progress Global Indexes
Global Index 
The second quarter of the year was marked by the adaptation of the project to the new context of the COVID-19 pandemic. ATNI initiated a timeline and feasibility consultation with the Global Index selected companies. The intention to develop an action research project to monitor the response of F&amp;B companies to the pandemic was also communicated. 
Out of the 25 selected companies, we received 20 responses. The 5 companies that did not provide any input have not been engaging so far in the Index. All responding companies manifested their interest in the upcoming COVID-19 response tracking project. A few of them offered to actively contribute.
Based on the outcomes of the consultation we proposed a differentiated data collection approach on the 12th of June. The timeline was presented as follows:
&#x2022;	The first group of companies was invited to provide additional information on the 1st of June.
&#x2022;	The second group will be invited to start in July 2020. 
&#x2022;	The third group from September 2020.
Despite the differentiated approach, ATNI will maintain a similar data collection duration for all groups. All companies, regardless of the group they are included in, will be able to submit additional relevant information up to the 29th of September 2020. It was also announced that the substantial timeline adjustment will impact the publication of the Index, which was initially planned for the fourth quarter of 2020, and will be now most likely to occur in the first half of 2021. Consequently, the Global Index will, from now own, bee referred to as the Global Index 2021. 
Although companies welcomed the flexibility offered by the differentiated approach, a few of them raised concern about the potential impact it might have on their score. ATNI guaranteed to maintain strong quality assurance processes. Furthermore, besides the specific peer-review process organized for each group of companies, ATNI will hold a final reviewing session at the end of the assessment cycle. 
At the time this report was is written ATNI finished compiling company profiles based on publicly available info for the first group consisting of 7 companies. These companies took part in an introductory webinar on the 29th of May and started the first four-week data exchange phase on the 1st of June. The ATNI research team started work of the second group, which includes 4 companies, throughout the month of June. 
At the end of June, the detailed Global Index 2021 methodology was published on the ATNI website and shared via multiple communication channels, including ATNI social media. 
&#x2003;
Core Objective 2: BMS marketing policies and practices
The &#x2018;Breastmilk Substitutes -BMS- and Complementary Foods -CF- marketing&#x2019; sub-ranking comprises two elements: 
BMS / CF 1. Corporate Profile assessment &#x2014; designed to measure the extent to which the BMS companies&apos; marketing policies align to The Code , the strength of their management systems and the extent of their public disclosure.
BMS / CF 2. In-country assessments &#x2014; designed to measure companies&apos; compliance with The Code and/or national regulations (whichever is stricter) in two selected countries. The studies are conducted using the NetCode protocol; data is collected in healthcare facilities, retailers and various forms of the media.
This quarter, ATNI complied company profiles for BMS / CF 1 based on publicly available info for the seven BMS companies that are actively engaging &#x2013; Nestl&#xE9;, Danone, RB, Abbott, FrieslandCampina, Kraft-Heinz and Pepsico. The companies reviewed ATNI&#x2019;s initial analysis and provided their feedback. ATNI is now reviewing their input. We will have one further round of clarification with the companies on any open points and/or questions before completing the assessment by the end of September 2020. 
Regarding BMS/ CF 2, ATNI completed data collection in the Philippines with slight delays due to COVID-19 that affected our local research partners&#x2019; ability to purchase BMS products in order to review their labels and inserts. However, our local partner had by the end of the quarter bought most of the products and completed the analysis. Westat has started analysing and doing a 100% quality check of the data, before organizing data files to share with ATNI, which we will share with the companies for their review. Preparations for the second country study are still on hold because of the pandemic. ATNI remains in close contact with Westat and its local partner to monitor developments and determine how we can move forwards. 
Regarding our work with FTSE Russell and PwC, ATNI is closely coordinating the process. During this quarter, PwC analysed the information it collected during the visit to the Philippines earlier in the year to interview three companies &#x2013; Nestl&#xE9;, Danone and RB &#x2013; and followed up with them to clarify certain points and ask for additional documentation. PwC will use the information from these interviews together with a data set provided by ATNI to prepare company reports for FTSE Russell.
During the quarter, ATNI has also worked closely with several UN agencies and NGOs that have signed and launched a Call to Action to the world&#x2019;s 19 largest BMS manufacturers to ask them to commit to full Code compliance by 2030, and other steps between now and then. ATNI will evaluate the responses for the Call to Action signatories.
&#x2003;
Core Objective 3: Publish two India Spotlight Indexes for c. 10-20 manufacturers in 2016 and 2020
In February 2020, ATNI launched and published the main results of  the India Spotlight Index 2020 and the detailed results and analysis of the scores of companies on the category studying the healthiness of their product portfolio and individual products (with the Product Profile).

With the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, planning for the release of the other thematic chapters of the Index (on marketing, labelling, governance, access &amp; affordability , healthy lifestyle support and engagement) had to be adjusted to match the new realities companies are facing in India.

Companies in February received an invite to participate in a CEO roundtable after summer on the outcomes of the Index and possible sector-wide alignment and agenda setting towards an accelerated shift for healthier nutrition for all Indians.

With the pandemic still having large impacts at the time this report is written, ATNI and stakeholders have decided to explore ways to organize online events to take these plans forward.

&#x2003;
Core Objective 5: Outreach activities
1.	Investors
During the second quarter, ATNI worked closely with an external consultant to finalise the new Investor Expectations on Nutrition, Diets and Health, and to consult with relevant stakeholders. The consultations provided ATNI with valuable input; the final document was ready by the end of Q2. In early Q3, ATNI will share the Expectations with current Investor Signatories and to ask them to endorse them, before reaching out towards the end of the quarter to additional institutional investors to ask them to become signatories. The Investors Expectations document can be found here. 
The investor portal has been populated and a few last design revisions are being made. The portal will contain a document library with various reports relevant to investors on nutrition, and a news section. The section dedicated to collaborative engagement will also be populated with relevant documents from work so far and prepare it for engagement relating to future Indexes. The portal will be launched in Q3. The new portal and Investor page on the website will be featured more prominently.
The ATNI Investor Statement has been updated and designed in the new ATNI branding, it can be accessed here. 
2.	Publication of Global Index 2021
The methodology of the Global Index 2021 was published on June 26. In terms of outreach, the methodology document was added to the library of the website and a news item was published alongside it, to describe the initial plans for the next iteration of the Global Index paying particular attention to the changes compared to previous Global Indexes such as the inclusion of the Product Profile within Category B. It also emphasized that there is a reduction in the number of indicators the assessment is based on, a decision that was made to improve efficiency when assessing and engaging with companies. The news item is available here, and the full Global Index 2021 Methodology document can be downloaded here. 
3.	World Benchmarking Alliance &#x2013; Allies Assembly
Various members of the ATNI team attended the Allies Assembly, organized by the World Benchmarking Alliance. Over the course of the Assembly (8-10th June), we delved into a number of topics and explored ways in which WBA&#x2019;s Allies can help to drive collective action and collaboration on the shared goals of the Alliance. ATNI was represented at three of the five possible workshops: 
&#x2022;	Workshop 1: Systems transformation, focused on building back better systems in the context of COVID-19
&#x2022;	Workshop 2: North-South cooperation which had a focus on food and agriculture
&#x2022;	Workshop 5: Reinforcing WBA&#x2019;s narrative, turning benchmarks into action, it looked at the roles of the Allies how to create better community among allies
Core Objective 6: Develop action research activities
In 2019, ATNI started action research on two topics related to the Indexes. Action research is designed to focus on areas where conclusive evidence, international standards and/or company practice is weak or emerging. The goals are to feed into the methodologies for our Indexes, publish new analysis, and to contribute new insights on these topics to a wide range of stakeholders.
1.	Action research on accessibility and affordability 
The goal of this research is to better understand why companies are struggling to perform well in Category C in the ATNI Indexes, which assesses their performance on improving the affordability and accessibility of healthy products. ATNI contracted Carnstone Partners to do the first phase of this work. During the first quarter of 2020, Carnstone finalized its analysis and presented this to ATNI. Plans to hold one or more workshops for companies and other stakeholders to discuss the findings are on hold, due to COVID-19.
2.	Action research on complementary foods
The goal of this research is to contribute to the understanding of the role commercially produced complementary foods play in the diets of infants and young children in low- and middle-income countries. 
During Q2, ATNI followed up with organisations in the Philippines and Mexico  - the two countries selected for this project - and discussed and agreed on the Table of Contents and the way forward for the study. The local partners will complete pilot Landscape Studies in both countries.  In the Philippines, the local partner will also do a Product Profile using the WHO Euro CF model, with the guidance of the team at the University of Leeds who initially developed and tested the model for WHO Europe.
&#x2003;

Core Objective 7: Develop monitoring and evaluations
As part of developing a robust monitoring and evaluation system for ATNI, the ATNI team reviewed and updated ATNI&#x2019;s theory of change based on the outlines for the new strategic plan 2020-2024 that have been approved by the ATNI Board.
The framework proposal will be submitted to the ATNI Board in September 2020 for revision and approval. 
&#x2003;
Additional Objective 1: Developing indexes that assess the performance of other key segments of the F&amp;B industry, e.g. retailers, food service companies, fast food chains
ATNI continued its communication with ShareAction, funded in part through its Healthy Markets campaign, on the follow up of the UK Supermarket Spotlight report (https://accesstonutrition.org/project/atni-shareaction/) published on March. 
At ShareAction&#x2019;s request, ATNI drafted a proposal to present to ShareAction&#x2019;s funder, Guys &amp; St Thomas&apos;s Charity, to develop and publish a full UK ATNI Retailer Index on 2021-2022. A decision is expected in the next quarter.
&#x2003;
Additional Objective 2: New Spotlight Indexes
US Spotlight Index 
The focus of the US Index for the 2nd Quarter of the year was twofold. The methodology consultation was carried on while planning repercussions of the COVID-19 pandemic were considered to adjust the overall timeline of the Index.
The US Index methodology consultation yielded feedback on the main methodological changes for this second iteration of the Index. Firstly, the methodology was aligned with the Global Index. More specifically, the Product Profile was integrated in Category B of the Index (Products). Moreover, Food Loss and Waste indicators were added and the PAHO model was selected as the relevant WHO regional model to guide the responsible marketing to children. In continuity with its most recent work on the responsible lobbying framework initiative, ATNI adapted the G1 indicator details. Lastly, while the introduction of the Priority Population concept led to a major change in the Global Index methodology since the Priority Populations concept was already introduced in the US index 2018, no major changes in the US Index approach for 2021 were needed. 
Those key changes were submitted for consultation to different stakeholder groups. On the 15th of April, a webinar was organized with investors. 6 investors attended the session where main methodology changes were discussed. The introduction of the Food Loss and Waste indicators were positively received. On the other hand, questions were raised about the adoption of the PAHO model in comparison with the CFBAI model which is largely adopted in the United States. 
The 11 selected companies responded to an online survey. The main concerns focused on the third scored element of the Product Profile, namely the mean healthiness score between 2018 and 2021, for which further description was requested by a few companies. Another point was raised around the PAHO model which was not perceived as the most adapted to the US market. Further suggestions were made to add indicators including the effort made by companies to reduce package size under the topic of portion control.
The consultation cycle was closely followed by the RWJF who made further suggestions. The US Expert Group will meet in July to go through the main outcomes of the consultation and offer recommendations. 
Lastly, the COVID-19 impact on the implementation timeline of the Index was assessed and will be later communicated to involved stakeholders. 
&#x2003;
Additional Objective 3: Further development of verification-type activities
Nutrition Business Monitor project 
Due to COVID-19, many of the scheduled activities for the NBM project had to be rescheduled and adapted to the new circumstances. Therefore, all trips for testing the tool in the two selected countries were cancelled. Regarding Nigeria, the SUN Business Network that is quite well established was interested to move forward with a first round of online testing of the tool. In May, 4 companies used the tool and then a webinar was organized to discuss the feedback the companies had regarding the functionality and content of the tool. The feedback was very insightful and to the point. ATNI is now preparing for a second round of testing with 5 more Nigerian companies, to get a more representative sample of how the tool works for SMEs in Nigeria. Regarding Bangladesh, the project was put on pause for Q2 as the hit of the pandemic was quite hard for Bangladesh businesses, and especially SMEs. ATNI remained in contact with the SBN coordinator in Dhaka and is preparing to continue with the project in Bangladesh during Q3 and get 5 companies to test the tool. 
Responsible Lobbying Framework 
To take forward ATNI&#x2019;s work to encourage responsible lobbying the team has been involved in the development of a new Responsible Lobbying Framework: https://www.responsible-lobbying.org/about

It&#x2019;s designed to be picked up by companies themselves, industry associations, investors - a wide range of organizations - to inform their policies, practices and transparency linked to BMS marketing &amp; Code compliance or on any topic - climate change, food and nutrition.

ATNI is adapting it to create a methodology to assess the approach to lobbying of infant formula companies. The initial analysis against that methodology is nearly completed. In the medium term, ATNI intends to integrate (parts of) the framework in our assessments of food and beverage companies, within our Global and Spotlight Access to Nutrition Indexes.
&#x2003;
Extra DFID-funded activities 2020-2022
Earlier this year and in addition to DFID&#x2019;s contributiton to ATNI&#x2019;s core budget for the period of 2016-2020, ATNI received an additional grant with the amount of &#xA3;1,500,000 from DFID and for the period of 2020-2022. The DFID-funded extra activties will allow ATNI to work on the agreed upon extra activities and to adapt plans and priorities to take into account the impacts of COVID-19.
Map and monitor food and beverage (F&amp;B) sector companies&apos; responses to COVID-19 starting April 2020
This quarter, ATNI has developed a framework to identify action (and inaction) by food and beverage manufacturers in response to the Covid-19 pandemic and its consequences, adding an explicit COVID-19 lens to ATNI&#x2019;s existing assessment of companies. This new framework will empower stakeholders with the knowledge and understanding of the actions of major food and beverage manufacturers worldwide to address the crisis and its far-reaching effects; it will essentially act as a best-practice guide.
The indicators included in the framework span ATNI&#x2019;s existing Index thematic areas (see graph below). It enables a systematic assessment of companies&#x2019; strategic commitments, product formulation and marketing, accessibility and affordability of products, support for employees and supply chain partners, and whether, during the crisis, baby food manufacturers are marketing their products appropriately. This framework will also incorporate new approaches to track companies&#x2019; engagement actions in support of governments&#x2019; efforts to combat the crisis, and leadership examples in supporting SMEs and livelihoods across the food value chain. 
In June, following the development of the draft ATNI Covid-19 Framework, ATNI organized Zoom/MS Teams consultations with representatives of industry organizations, UN agencies and NGOs. Comments were also sought from ATNI board members. All were sent, in advance, an introduction to the Framework and the draft Framework itself:
&#x2022;	Representatives of Food Industry Asia, The Consumer Goods Forum and the World Business Council on Sustainable Development; 
&#x2022;	Department for International Development (UK); 
&#x2022;	Directorate-General for International Cooperation (DGIS &#x2013; within the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs); 
&#x2022;	Food Foundation (UK); 
&#x2022;	GAIN; 
&#x2022;	Institute of Development Studies (UK); 
&#x2022;	International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI); 
&#x2022;	Netherlands Nutrition Working Group (representatives of the International Medical Corps, RVO, Save the Children Netherlands, The Hunger Project, UNICEF Netherlands and the Wageningen Centre for Development Innovation); 
&#x2022;	Tufts University (US); 
&#x2022;	UNICEF; 
&#x2022;	World Food Program; 
&#x2022;	and ATNI board members. 
The aim of the consultation was to inform the scope of the initiative as a whole and to gather concrete suggestions for the Framework and indicators themselves. It was used to ascertain whether and how the Framework could add value to those working in the nutrition space, avoiding duplication of others&#x2019; efforts (because many initiatives have sprung up simultaneously since the start of the Covid-19 crisis in early 2020). Overall, the Framework was well received, and many useful comments and suggestions were made. 
The final Framework adapted with the inputs from the consultations is to be published in July and will also include a section with emerging themes.</narrative>
