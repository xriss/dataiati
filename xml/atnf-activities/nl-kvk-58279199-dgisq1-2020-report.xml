Core Objective 5 Extend outreach activities for different stakeholder groups, particularly investors, to amplify impact. Core Objective 6 Develop action research activities to advance thinking and practice in key areas. Core Objective 7 Develop measurement and evaluations. Core Objective 8 Conduct a feasibility study on expansion and innovation. * Additional objectives ATNF also sees various options for expansion, on top of the Core Objectives, for which additional funding would be needed. These include: Additional Objective 1 Developing one or more Global Indexes that assesses the performance of other key segments of the F&amp;B industry, e.g. retailers, food service compa-nies, fast food chains. Additional Objective 2 Development of new Spotlight Indexes for other priority countries. Additional Objective 3 Further development of complementary verification-type activities, such as the Product Profile (that could be expanded to assess labelling com-pliance and marketing spending; more or wider BMS marketing assessments, etc.).</narrative>
