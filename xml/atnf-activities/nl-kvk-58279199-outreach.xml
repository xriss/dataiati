   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Investors ATNI&#x2019;s Investor Signatories continued to engage with Index companies during the quarter. ATNI met with the very large investment manager UBS Asset Management to explain our Indexes in depth and to press them to become a signatory, which they have been considering for some time. They have not yet made a decision though indicated their interest in principle. In January, ATNI wrote to the ten largest shareholders in each of the 5 listed baby food companies we assess and rank, presenting our materials and offering a briefing. Three responded, of which we have briefed one. We also had a call with Save The Children Norway who have been engaging with Norges Bank Investment Management (NBIM), which manages the country&#x2019;s enormous sovereign wealth fund. Save The Children were aware of our work but wanted further input as to how investors could use it and how they should suggest NBIM monitors the companies&#x2019; responses to its engagement. In January and March, ATNF participated in two in investor workshops in London through the Plating up Progress initiative, a collaboration between the Food and Climate Research Network based at Oxford Uni-versity and the U.K. Food Foundation. Plating Up Progress is working to develop a set of metrics that in-vestors can press food companies to adopt in their reporting, and to guide their policies and practices, to demonstrate their contribution to creating a sustainable, healthy food system. As the first quarter of the year is when many investment organisations publish their 2018 reports, we have noticed an uptick in references to ATNI and investors&#x2019; use of our Indexes and related materials. Other outreach activities, meetings, conferences ATNF in February became a member of the Netherlands Working Group on International Nutrition, a plat-form with corporate, CSO and government members to promote nutrition specific and nutrition sensitive approaches in development strategies of Dutch stakeholders. As part of the Meridian process ATNF, NGO participants, BMGF, WHO and UNICEF in February in New York provided updates about their work and discussed how to take various elements of the Meridian process forward. February 20-21 ATNF attended the co-create consortium meeting in London organized by World Cancer Research Fund International &amp; EU Horizon 2020; Confronting Obesity: Co-creating policies with youth. ATNF&#x2019;s research manager participated in the 4th Hidden Hunger conference, Feb 27 - March 1, Stuttgart, University of Hohenheim. This was an excellent opportunity to consult global experts on ATNF&#x2019;s plan to develop a micro-nutrient enhanced nutrient profiling system. March 15 and 15 ATNF was represented at a Nestle stakeholder convening; Nutrition in the first 1000 days of life. End March ATNF provided input at a UNICEF/WHO workshop to develop a &#x2018;Toolkit for Policymakers to Im-plement the WHO Recommendations on Marketing Food and Non-Alcoholic Beverages to Children&#x2019;. Sub-sequently separate meetings were held on March 29 with UNICEF and WHO nutrition experts. March 6-8 World Benchmarking Alliance Allies met in Mumbai to review planning and progress towards the 5 overarching benchmarks WBA wants to launch in 2020. Their new Food and Agriculture value chain benchmark of 200 companies will be presented at N4G summit in 2020 in Japan. Allies will receive a foundational document with the proposed methodology for the benchmarks early April. ATNI is part of food systems working group to plan for the Tokyo 2020 Nutrition for Growth -N4G- summit and in February and March had meetings to discuss how corporate engagement and commitment can be strengthened.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Investors During this quarter ATNF continued to monitor and support collaborative engagement with Global/U.S. companies as needed. ATNF host quarterly collaborative engagement working group meeting, and the May meeting saw company investor leads update the group with engagement activity to date. The use of tracking sheets for investment activity was discussed. ATNF worked closely with design agency Kummer &amp; Herman this quarter to begin developing a password protected investor portal, a place for investors to log in and access investor-specific documents. The portal will allow investors to compare companies scores on a range of indicators, and enables investor leads to keep track of their engagement with companies. ATNF has continued its collaboration with Food Foundation and Food Climate Research Network, on the Plating Up Progress project. Will Nicholson of Food Foundation authored a guest blog on the ATNF website to celebrate the launch of the program New Website Work on the new ATNF website has been continuing with a brainstorming phase recently coming to a close. Feedback was gathered from the stakeholders identified in our communications strategy to gain insights on how the website can be optimized specifically for ATNF&#x2019;s audiences. A new website layout has been proposed and new features of the site include: a PDF generator so visitors can customize the view of information they need, trends over time section, scorecard comparison tool, improved data visualization across the site, password protected investor portal, sharable items, news and &#x2018;in the media&#x2019; section, pho-tographs by professional photographer, interactive world map, agenda/events calendar. A new &#x2018;long-read&#x2019; style of reporting is being adopted which will feature a web-based report with customizable PDFs. This is an interactive, concise, and accessible way of reporting that helps tell a story in a modern and exciting way. In the next phase of the process, the designers will present the new look and feel of the site along-side the first wireframes. In phase three (second half of 2019), the website will be developed and created. New branding &#x2018;ATNI&#x2019; and prospectus With the launch in summer of a prospectus introducing its activities to all new stakeholders, including potential funders, the foundation also soft-launches a slightly different and new branding choosing &#x2018;Ac-cess to Nutrition Initiative&#x2019; as the new standard nominator for the organization and its programs. This better covers the diverse activities and tools beyond the Indexes of the organization and still allows the use the acronym ATNI which most stakeholders know the organization best by. The use of the legal name of the foundation (which will not change) and the acronym ATNF will be limited to legal documents and other places where the status of the organization as employer or legal entity is relevant. Next editions of this progress report will therefore also use ATNI as the default acronym to refer to the organization. Other outreach activities, meetings, conferences EAT Forum, Stockholm ATNF attended the EAT Forum in Stockholm in June where the follow-up on the EAT-Lancet commission report &#x2018;Food in the Anthropocene: the EAT-Lancet Commission on healthy diets from sustainable food systems&#x2019; was the central theme. In sessions organized by GAIN, WBCSD/Fresh, UNICEF companies men-tioned ATNF as the nutrition accountability mechanism they work with and would want to keep using. The Hague Conference: &#x201C;Building business contribution for the 2020 Global Nutrition Sum-mit&#x201D; June 25-26, ATNF in collaboration with GAIN co-hosted the &#x201C;Building business contribution for the 2020 Global Nutrition Summit&#x201D; (right). The meeting was hosted by the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs with the support of the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD), Scaling Up Nutrition (SUN) Movement and the Netherlands Working group on international Nutrition (NWGN). The meeting brought together over 100 participants, including a variety of government representatives, consumer groups, food companies, and NGOs/CSOs. The key objectives of the meeting were to reach consensus on: (a) the overall level of ambition of businesses; (b) a set of public-private engagement principles leading up to Japan 2020; (c) priority areas on which commitments will be developed to be presented, and (d) SMART business to launch at Japan 2020. ATNF had a prominent place at the event with various high-profile speakers referring to our work. ATNF&#x2019;s executive director Inge Kauer facilitated a panel discussion on how businesses see nutrition challenges and opportunities ahead of the Tokyo 2020 summit. ATNF also hosted a working session on Responsible Marketing to Children which was very well attended and had panelists from WHO, UNICEF, Mars, IFBA and the World Obesity Federation. Besides calling for stronger regulatory frameworks, independent nutrient profiling, and independent monitoring, the session identified the Olympics as a unique opportunity to showcase what responsible marketing and education on healthy option could look like. The outcomes of the working group sessions and the overall conference were collated in a concluding statement for the Japanese Government preparing for the 2020 Global Nutrition Summit. GAIN Donor meeting, Ireland ATNF in April was invited to attend and speak at a meeting for donors of GAIN in Dublin. ATNF presented the plan for the development of a &#x2018;Nutrition Business Monitor&#x2019; tool for small and medium sized enterprises. This project is funded by GAIN through its &#x2019;Making markets work for nutrition&#x2019; program. The tool will ini-tially be piloted in Nigeria and Bangladesh among member companies of the local SUN Business networks. ATNF donor meeting, London In May, ATNF organized a meeting for its main donors, hosted by DFID in London. Interested DFID col-leagues were invited to a presentation by ATNF&#x2019;s executive director on the BMS marketing assessment undertaken for the Global Indexes as well as the on the ground assessments in specific markets. Representatives from BMGF, UK DFID and DGIS (online attendance) reviewed and discussed the options for ATNF&#x2019;s next multi-year strategic planning (2020-2023). WHO Global Monitoring Mechanism meeting, Geneva In June a follow-up meeting was organized by WHO with ATNF and Informas representatives to discuss the next steps to develop a global monitoring mechanism on company commitments to contribute to the SDG&#x2019;s and other nutrition targets as set by WHO and the world Health assembly. EAT Lancet report launch in the Netherlands In June, ATNF attended the Netherlands launch of the EAT Lancet Sustainable diets report. The event took place in the Hague also presenting the findings of the 2019 Global Food Policy Report. A clear mes-sage emerged from both reports and the subsequent discussions: the global food system crisis is acceler-ating. Addressing these complex challenges will require of context specific solutions and multiple stake-holders working together. In this regard, it was promising to see so many stakeholders present at the event Panelists at the launch of the EAT Lancet Sustainable diets report</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Investors During this quarter, ATNI continued to monitor and support collaborative engagements with Global Index and U.S. Spotlight Index companies. The group is currently working on developing a tracking sheet to monitor engagement with investors. Work also continued with ShareAction &#x2013; a UK based not-for-profit organization that campaigns with investors on nutrition issues &#x2013; to shape investor engagement around childhood obesity and sugar. This project falls under the sub-grant with ShareAction which supports their Healthy Mar-kets campaign. On September 18th we jointly released the results of an assessment of the nutri-tional quality of the product portfolios of 18 major food companies in the UK. There was much social media outreach about this publication and a blog was posted on the ATNI website. Share-Action authored a feature on this topic too. The next phase commenced in the Plating Up Progress project which is geared toward driving integrated &#x2018;sustainable food system&#x2019; reporting metrics for food retailers and out-of-home sec-tors. Together with our website developers, a password protected investor portal is being developed, with a first design being made. This portal will allow investors to log in and access relevant doc-uments, information about collaborative engagements, and give access to the new scorecard comparison tool and trends over time data visualisation tool, New Website The third phase of the development of the new website is underway which is the content and website development phase. Having completed a detailed brainstorming and planning phase, website developers Kummer &amp; Herman have begun designing and creating the new homepage, a Global Index long-read (below), interactive tools, investor platform and the new scorecards for the India Spotlight Index. The new site will feature an easily navigable dashboard for users to easily use all the new features of the site. New branding &#x2018;ATNI&#x2019; and prospectus The prospectus was first used at different conferences and network gatherings this quarter and received positive feedback.

The outcomes of the working group sessions and the overall conference held in The Hague in June on &#x201C;Building the business contribution for the 2020 Global Nutrition Summit&#x201D; were collated in a con-cluding statement for the Japanese Government as it prepares for the 2020 N4G Summit. The Government of Japan has established a new advisory committee, which ATNI will participate in. ATNI is also an observer in the Business Constituency Group. ATNI has proposed to the Govern-ment of Japan and organizers of the N4G to develop a set of Investor Expectations on Nutrition (or similar name), to echo similar sets of expectations on climate change, lobbying on climate change and other ESG issues. Proposed approach is to evolve the current Investor Statement into these Investor Expectations, with anchor investors being major Dutch, British and Japanese pension funds (in the first instance) invited by their governments; then ATNI could invite our current investor signatory base and many other institutional investors to add their voice.</narrative>
