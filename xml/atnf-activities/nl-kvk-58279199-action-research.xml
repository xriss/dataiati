   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In 2019, ATNF starts Action Research into two topics which are important for our indexes but where con-clusive evidence, international standards and company best-practices are lacking or only just emerging. 1) Action Research on Accessibility and Affordability ATNF has contracted Carnstone Partners to perform initial mappings and other assessments, including collating statistics on the distribution, presence and/or market penetration of (healthy) products in LMIC markets. The goal is to find out why companies are struggling to show good performance in this category? What might be the potential barriers that are preventing them from doing well? The map-ping also will identify ideas to drive improvement in affordability and accessibility across brands and achieve commitments from senior management within some F&amp;B manufacturers to pilot or implement those ideas wholesale. Eventually, the results are to inform future iterations of the methodology. This work is due to start in the third quarter of 2019. 2) Action Research on Complementary Foods ATNF has been in contact with WHO, who would publish their findings on adapting the WHO Europe model for marketing foods to children, validating it and running pilot assessments in July 2019. The WHO assessment will be one important starting point for the research. ATNF will explore whether and how the complementary foods made by the manufacturers ATNF engages with could contribute to im-proving young children&#x2019;s diets, for example by undertaking the first-ever Product Profile of such foods using the WHO model, and/or other activities, with a focus on LMICs.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In 2019, ATNI started Action Research into two topics which are important for our indexes but where conclusive evidence, international standards and company best-practices are lacking or only just emerging. The initial goal is to refine and strengthen our indicators in the index and help prior-itizing countries where we could do spotlight indexes or other country specific monitoring. 1) Action Research on Accessibility and Affordability ATNI has contracted Carnstone Partners to undertake an initial mapping and to collate statistics on the distribution, presence and/or market penetration of (healthy) products in LMIC markets. The goal is to find out why companies are struggling to perform well in the category in the ATNI In-dexes focusing on access to and affordability of healthy products and identify barriers that might prevent them from doing well. This initial research will identify ideas of how to drive improvement in affordability and accessibility across brands and achieve commitments from senior management within some F&amp;B manufacturers to pilot or implement the ideas wholesale. The intention is also that the insights gained will inform future iterations of the methodology. 2) Action Research on Complementary Foods ATNI attended the launch of the WHO Europe new Nutrient Profiling System for Complementary Foods and accompanying research on the composition, labelling and claims used on such foods in 4 WHO Europe-region member states. This WHO NPS and research will be an important starting point for ATNI&#x2019;s proposed research. ATNI will explore whether and how the complementary foods made by the manufacturers ATNI engages with (and other companies) could contribute to improv-ing young children&#x2019;s diets, for example, by undertaking the first-ever Product Profile of such foods using the WHO model, and/or other activities, with a focus on LMICs.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Investors ATNI&#x2019;s Investor Signatories continued to engage with Index companies during the quarter. ATNI met with the very large investment manager UBS Asset Management to explain our Indexes in depth and to press them to become a signatory, which they have been considering for some time. They have not yet made a decision though indicated their interest in principle. In January, ATNI wrote to the ten largest shareholders in each of the 5 listed baby food companies we assess and rank, presenting our materials and offering a briefing. Three responded, of which we have briefed one. We also had a call with Save The Children Norway who have been engaging with Norges Bank Investment Management (NBIM), which manages the country&#x2019;s enormous sovereign wealth fund. Save The Children were aware of our work but wanted further input as to how investors could use it and how they should suggest NBIM monitors the companies&#x2019; responses to its engagement. In January and March, ATNF participated in two in investor workshops in London through the Plating up Progress initiative, a collaboration between the Food and Climate Research Network based at Oxford Uni-versity and the U.K. Food Foundation. Plating Up Progress is working to develop a set of metrics that in-vestors can press food companies to adopt in their reporting, and to guide their policies and practices, to demonstrate their contribution to creating a sustainable, healthy food system. As the first quarter of the year is when many investment organisations publish their 2018 reports, we have noticed an uptick in references to ATNI and investors&#x2019; use of our Indexes and related materials. Other outreach activities, meetings, conferences ATNF in February became a member of the Netherlands Working Group on International Nutrition, a plat-form with corporate, CSO and government members to promote nutrition specific and nutrition sensitive approaches in development strategies of Dutch stakeholders. As part of the Meridian process ATNF, NGO participants, BMGF, WHO and UNICEF in February in New York provided updates about their work and discussed how to take various elements of the Meridian process forward. February 20-21 ATNF attended the co-create consortium meeting in London organized by World Cancer Research Fund International &amp; EU Horizon 2020; Confronting Obesity: Co-creating policies with youth. ATNF&#x2019;s research manager participated in the 4th Hidden Hunger conference, Feb 27 - March 1, Stuttgart, University of Hohenheim. This was an excellent opportunity to consult global experts on ATNF&#x2019;s plan to develop a micro-nutrient enhanced nutrient profiling system. March 15 and 15 ATNF was represented at a Nestle stakeholder convening; Nutrition in the first 1000 days of life. End March ATNF provided input at a UNICEF/WHO workshop to develop a &#x2018;Toolkit for Policymakers to Im-plement the WHO Recommendations on Marketing Food and Non-Alcoholic Beverages to Children&#x2019;. Sub-sequently separate meetings were held on March 29 with UNICEF and WHO nutrition experts. March 6-8 World Benchmarking Alliance Allies met in Mumbai to review planning and progress towards the 5 overarching benchmarks WBA wants to launch in 2020. Their new Food and Agriculture value chain benchmark of 200 companies will be presented at N4G summit in 2020 in Japan. Allies will receive a foundational document with the proposed methodology for the benchmarks early April. ATNI is part of food systems working group to plan for the Tokyo 2020 Nutrition for Growth -N4G- summit and in February and March had meetings to discuss how corporate engagement and commitment can be strengthened.</narrative>
