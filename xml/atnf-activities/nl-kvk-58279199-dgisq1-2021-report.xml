Progress on relevant objectives for January-March 2021

Core Objective 1: Progress Global Indexes

Global Index 

The final phase of company engagement closed in mid-December and a peer review was conducted by the research team to make the scoring consistent across the Index. Based on the peer review, company scores were adjusted. The preliminary findings by category will be prepared in the second quarter of 2021.
Between January and March, the ATNI team conducted additional calculations on Product Profile results to obtain the elements necessary for the three scored elements: Healthiness score (sales-weighted mean Health Star Rating score), relative category performance score, and change in Health Star Rating (HSR) score compared to 2018. The Product Profile assessments included more products (more than 41,000) and more companies.
ATNI will continue to write the category chapters and will begin writing the company scorecards in April/May. The team plans to hold a discussion on how to deal with the Product Profile outcomes in April. In early June, the company scorecard narratives will be shared with companies for a final fact check. Pre-launch preparations with a selected PR agency will also take place in the second quarter of 2021. The Report is to be launched by July 1.

Core Objective 2: BMS marketing policies and practices

BMS/CF Marketing 1

The first quarter of 2021 was dedicated to drafting the BMS/CF 1 Index report. The final scores of the companies assessed were calculated. As of the end of the first quarter of 2021, the BMS 1 chapter is being finalised and set to be published as part of the ATNI BMS/CF Marketing Index 2021 in the beginning of June.
In this iteration, the BMS/CF Marketing Index will, for the first time, be published as a standalone report. However, a summary section on the BMS analysis will also be included in the Global Index report and will inform scoring of BMS companies included in the Global Index 2021. A webinar will be organised for global stakeholders in the weeks after publication.

BMS/CF Marketing 2 

The BMS/CF Philippines country assessment was finalized in the first quarter of 2021 and will be launched on May 13 in a webinar with selected Filipino stakeholders. The ATNI summary report and Westat report will be published at the same time the day before the webinar.
The BMS/CF Mexico country assessment will be finalized in the second quarter of 2021. The ATNI summary report and the Westat report will be published mid-June, at the same time with the ATNI BMS/CF Marketing Index 2021 and a webinar with Mexican stakeholders will follow in the weeks after publication.
As a next step, the BMS/CF 2 chapter of the Index will be drafted in the second quarter of 2021.

Other BMS work

FTSE4Good

 The PwC reports for the head office and the Philippines have been prepared and will be published on the ATNI and FTSE websites in April.The PwC reports for Mexico have been reviewed by companies and ATNI with PwC is currently reviewing comments and working to finalise the reports. The PwC Mexico reports will be published by the end of May. With the publication of the second set of reports, the collaboration with FTSE and PwC will be completed for this round of assessments. 
BMS Call to Action
On March 23, the companies&#x2019; responses were posted on the website of the Call to Action, along with a press release published on behalf of the Signatories and other communications. The signatories will discuss next steps in April and decide how to move forward with the assessment of the roadmaps submitted by the companies. ATNI will play a role in assessing the submitted roadmaps of the companies. The details of the next steps are being discussed with the signatories. 
&#x2003;
Core Objective 3: Publish two India Spotlight Indexes for c. 10-20 manufacturers in 2016 and 2020

In February 2021, ATNI launched the detailed findings of the thematic chapters followed by a post-launch engagement phase. Later in 2021 (when COVID19 allows it), ATNI will organize a multi-stakeholder webinar to share the findings of the project Index and linking the results to ATNI&#x2019;s Covid-19 third and fourth reports, in which India is highlighted as a case study. All companies assessed in the India Spotlight Index will also be invited to this webinar, as well as a wider group of stakeholders in India from academia, government, and civil society.  In the second half of 2021, ATNI will start preparing for a potential next iteration of the India Index. 

Core Objective 5: Outreach activities

Investors

Signatory Recruitment (current Asset under Management is $13.6 trillion)

ATNI continued to work on expanding the membership of the Investor Coalition in the first quarter of 2021. Two new investors had joined the ATNI Investor Signatories: the Guy&#x2019;s and St. Thomas&#x2019;s Foundation from the UK and Trillium Asset Management from the US. The ATNI investor support team has organised introductory calls with three additional investors: Kempen Asset Management and UBS Asset Management, both from The Netherlands, and Nomura Asset Management from Japan.
In early 2021, ATNI began working with a Japanese consultant to reach its profile in Japan ahead of the Tokyo Nutrition for Growth Summit and to include Japanese investors in its signatory base. To this end, communications materials have been developed in Japanese. These have been disseminated in relevant ESG magazines in Japan and have been added to ATNI&apos;s website.
Collaborative Investor Engagement 
The signatories have been invited to participate in a new round of collaborative engagement with companies following the Global Index launch 2021. Two webinars for existing signatories were held in March 2021 to present the plans for the collaborative engagement, provide them with timelines and ask them on informing us with which companies they are planning to engage. ATNI is preparing internally for the engagement, arranging chairs and co-chairs, and ensuring investors are ready to reach out to the companies once the GI is published. The collaborative engagement will last until 2023 and conclude before the next Global Index is published.

Communications and Outreach

In early 2021, ShareAction used the insights from the UK Supermarket Spotlight to form a coalition of institutional and retail investors and filed the first health-based shareholder resolution at Tesco, calling on the UK&#x2019;s largest food retailer to set targets to increase the proportion of healthy products in its sales. Tesco responded to the resolution in March 2021 and set a target to increase the proportion of sales from healthier products to 65% by 2025. The supermarket giant commits to publish a strategy to achieve this goal and to report on its progress annually, as requested by the shareholder proposal filed in February. 
ATNI agreed with PRI (the United Nations Principles for Responsible Investment) and with UKSIF (the UK Sustainable Investment and Financial Association) to co-host webinars to further disseminate the investment case for nutrition and grow its signatory base in May and in June, respectively. An investor newsletter was sent to all signatories and non-signatories in March 2021. 

Investor Portal

Together with website developers, ATNI developed and launched a password-protected investor portal on its website in January 2021. This portal allows ATNI&#x2019;s Investor Signatories to log in to access relevant ATNI documents, information about collaborative engagement and serve as a repository of investor-authored or investor-relevant reports on nutrition. 
More specifically, the portal contains a document library with various reports relevant to investors on nutrition, and a news section. The section dedicated to collaborative engagement will be launched soon and it is being populated with relevant documents from work conducted so far and prepared for engagement relating to future Indexes.

Communications update

ATNF continued its efforts to make its website and social media accounts more interactive and spreads the release of Index results over time in the first quarter of 2021. This will continue throughout 2021 with PR activities around the launch of the Global Index 2021 and US Index, active participation in the UN FSS and the N4G Summit and a social media audit that is planned for mid-2021.
As of February 2021, ATNI is working with its design agency to improve the user-experience of the website. For example, the PDF generator is being improved after feedback that it is not working optimally. Additionally, it was noted that there is scope to improve the Trends Over Time tool, so the website developers are working with the ATNI research team to ensure data is being displayed in the most useful and interesting way. 
ATNI has also started up the process of hiring a new PR agency to support with the Global Index 2021 launch and in an ongoing capacity. Three agencies were invited to bid in the first quarter of 2021, with a focus on the following key services:
&#x2022;	Prepare and execute an impactful communications strategy for the Global Index
&#x2022;	Craft compelling narratives grounded in data to target audiences 
&#x2022;	Pitch and secure high-quality coverage in top tier media in key markets
&#x2022;	Support ATNI in facilitating conversations with key industry leaders and stakeholders 
&#x2022;	Continue success gained at the launch to promote ATNI and its agenda at key moments throughout 2021 (N4G Summit and UN FSS)
 
Core Objective 6: Develop action research activities

ATNI is conducting various action research activities to develop knowledge on various nutrition topics relevant for its work.

Action Research on Complementary Foods

In the first quarter of 2021, ATNI and its local partner the Nutrition Center of the Philippines (NCP) worked on finalizing the report and a preview of results will be presented on April 22 in a USAID webinar organized in the framework of the Global Health Science and Practice Technical Exchange (GHTechX) digital conference. ATNI plans to organize another webinar in the following weeks in the Philippines, with a focus on Filipino stakeholders, where the results of the study and the BMS/CF marketing country assessment will be jointly presented on May 13 to present both studies. The study will be published on the day of the webinar. 

Action Research on Workforce Nutrition

Workforce nutrition programs throughout a company&#x2019;s supply chain can have significant benefits for employees, employers as well as society. To unlock this potential ATNI started to develop an action research project on workforce nutrition, which consists of desk research and analysis of existing workforce nutrition initiatives, interviews throughout the supply chain with companies and other stakeholders and a report with recommendations.
ATNI started the work and planning of this activity in the first quarter of 2021, by drafting a detailed workplan, including sector focus and expectations for the rest of the year. The research will be based on desk research, interviews and will include two in-country case studies. Together with external consultants on the ground, ATNI will conduct the research over the summer of 2021, starting directly after the Global Index launch.
Furthermore, GAIN together with CGF have launched the Workforce Nutrition Alliance tool in the beginning of April 2021. The companies can voluntarily use this tool to assess where they stand in terms of the main elements of workforce nutrition. However, if companies want to publicly use their scores and results, they need to go through a verification process. ATNI has been asked by GAIN to submit a proposal with suggested costs on verifying companies&apos; response to the tool that the Alliance developed. ATNI has been in discussion with GAIN on this topic for a few months and it was agreed that the best way to do this piece of work is if ATNI will be paid via GAIN for conducting the verification of the companies&#x2019; responses to the tool. The proposal includes two options: 
&#x2022;	Option 1: &#x2018;Light&#x2019; verification assessment: To do the assessment by analyzing the company responses against only publicly available information on their websites, or any other information that the company shares in the public domain (public reports, articles, policies etc.). Average time for this verification would be 5 working days per company. Cost: 5,000 euros 
&#x2022;	Option 2: Verification assessment, including engagement with the companies: To do a search to identify publicly available information and do a first analysis based on this. Following that, ATNI would reach out to the companies and ask them to provide further evidence to support the responses and/or to back up any recommended changes to the initial analysis. Average time for this option would be 10 working days. Cost: 10,000 euros
The action research will be finalized by the end of 2021. Learnings and outcomes of the action research on workforce nutrition will be shared at the N4G summit.

Action Research on Product Inequities

In December 2020, the first discussions on the new action research project to analyze and map possible differences in nutritional quality for a selection of specific products with identical brand and product names or with identical appearance took place.
In agreement with FCDO it was decided in Q1 2021 not to do a full research. Rather, ATNI will draft a positioning paper based on the outcomes of the Global Index 2021 product profiling research on inequities in nutrition quality standards, nutrient levels and/or formulation strategies applied for the same brands in the markets that have been assessed for the 25 companies for the Global Index 2021. The paper is planned to be presented or shared during the UN FSS in September 2021.

Action research on Country Mapping

In agreement with FCDO, this activity has been put on hold. ATNI will discuss the required next steps with FCDO in its next update meeting.
&#x2003;
Core Objective 7: Develop Monitoring and Evaluation

In 2021 ATNI will hire an impact consultant to assess ATNI&#x2019;s impact thus far and improve its M&amp;E system. ATNI has received three proposals for this. The selection of the impact assessment consultant will take place in April 2021.  
ATNI will organize an inception with the consultant in June 2021 and will also commence the desk review to finalize the impact assessment design. The impact assessment will take place in the second and third quarter of 2021 after the launch of the Global Index 2021, with data collection taking place throughout July-September 2021. The final report of the impact assessment is planned to be published September/October 2021. 

&#x2003;
Additional Objective 1: Developing indexes that assess the performance of other key segments of the F&amp;B industry, e.g., retailers, food service companies, fast food chains (not funded by DGIS, not part of prolongation)

ATNI UK Retailer Index

Following the stakeholder consultations on the methodology held with retail companies and other nutrition stakeholders in the UK in October and November 2020, a second Expert Group (EG) meeting was organized in January 2021. Input from the consultation sessions as well as the EG meetings was used to improve the methodology and finalize the scoring and weighting system. The methodology will be published in May 2021.
ATNI started the company research in February 2021. As with other Indexes, retailers will be offered the opportunity to sign Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs) in order to provide ATNI with confidential information. By June 2021, companies will be able to provide input on the research platform and in July 2021, they can add clarifications. After that, ATNI will close the research platform and data analysis to start the writing of scorecards and the report, to be published in Q1 2022.
&#x2003;
Additional Objective 2: New Spotlight Indexes (not funded by DGIS, not part of prolongation)

US Spotlight Index 

In an effort to further streamline the research process, in the fourth quarter of 2020, the US Index team developed a 15-min survey for to gather feedback from US-based food and beverage (F&amp;B) companies about their experience regarding indicators and data collection for the Global Index. Additionally, in the first quarter of 2021, the 11 companies who participated in the US Index were invited for a cognitive interview, which aimed to gain a deeper understanding of issues and doubts identified through the survey. 6 of the 11 companies participated in the interviews and in 50% of the interviews, 2 or 3 company representatives participated. Through the findings of the survey and interviews, the team was able to understand how companies interact with the online research platform, which terms or response options may be unclear or interpreted differently across the companies and identify common issues with some of the questions. 
In March, ATNI presented the US Index as well as impact of Covid-19 on the F&amp;B industry in the US during the annual Healthy Eating Research meeting, which was online this year (see also below Covid-19 project).
Based on these insights, in the second quarter of 2021, the research team will adjust the data collection tool and conduct a pilot assessment, after which the data collection protocol will be revised. The US Index 2021 is set to be published at the end of 2021.
&#x2003;
Additional Objective 3: Further development of verification-type activities (not funded by DGIS, not part of prolongation)

Nutrition Business Monitor project 

Between January and March 2021, ATNI worked on updating the recommendations, and calibrating certain elements of the Nutrition Business Monitor tool for SMEs such as design and format. ATNI also started planning the capacity building activities, together with GAIN and SBN Nigeria and Bangladesh, that will take place in Q2-Q3 2021. To contribute to these activities, ATNI subcontracted Bopinc., an independent foundation, who will organize and implement two trainings per country: one on business development and one on marketing, both with a focus on nutritious food. The second priority is to reach 25 companies testing the tool per country. Alongside these activities, ATNI aims to roll out the tool in  1-2 other SUN Business Network (SBN) countries together with GAIN.

Responsible Lobbying Framework
 
Irish Aid grant on responsible lobbying

ATNI submitted the final deliveries of the action research into responsible lobbying of BMS to Irish Aid, hereby completing the project cycle in the first quarter of 2021. ATNI is expecting to receive final comments by Irish Aid by the end of April and is currently working on final reporting. A call with Irish Aid has been scheduled for May to discuss potential future funding and next steps.
In the second quarter of 2021, ATNI aims to publish the Responsible Lobbying report which is a spotlight on the lobbying policies and systems of the BMS companies assessed in the ATNI BMS/CF Marketing Index.
&#x2003;
Extra activities 2020-2022 (funded by FCDO, not part of prolongation)

Map and monitor food and beverage (F&amp;B) sector companies&apos; responses to Covid-19 starting April 2020 

In the first quarter of 2021, ATNI published the third report in the series: presenting a deep dive in three markets: Mexico, Nigeria and India. This research identified many similarities between the food industries&#x2019; responses in the three markets as well as some intriguing differences. The similarities broadly reflected the global trends identified in the previous reports and described above. 
The team has started to organize a series of webinars in each of the countries and beyond, which will serve as an opportunity to disseminate the results of the report, and to share information about ATNI&apos;s other ongoing work in each country. 

So far it has been presented at the following events this year: 
&#x2022;	Healthy Eating Research Meeting (March 26th): Useful opportunity to share findings with U.S. based audience and provide initial details about the upcoming US Index 
&#x2022;	Save the Children Japan, &#x201C;Nutrition Critical&#x201D; Report Launch Event (February 24th): Served as an opportunity to boost our profile in Japan in this crucial year for nutrition 
&#x2022;	Food and Nutrition Board, Looking back and looking ahead webinar(March 30th): ATNI presented on US Covid-19 findings 
In April, ATNI will present the Covid-19 work and NBM work to the Nutrition Working Group meeting in Nigeria (April 13th). Nigeria is a target market of ATNI and donors, UN agencies and foundations will be in attendance.   
The final report in the Covid-19 series will discuss the impact of Covid-19 on nutrition over the first year of the pandemic. It will summarize the themes already identified in earlier reports and highlight broader issues, notably the impact of Covid-19 on equity and how the food manufacturers have responded and could respond further. Company websites will be reviewed for updates since August 2020 and information from annual reports will be featured. It will also feature a timeline of major relevant report over the first year of the pandemic. ATNI will make recommendations, pulling together examples of best practice from the previous three reports, showing that companies can make a difference. The aim is to provide direction for the industry on positive, nutritious ways forward for a new normal.

Private sector commitment monitoring hub supporting 2020 Global Nutrition Summit (GNS)/Nutrition for Growth (N4G), 2021 United Nation&#x2019;s Food System Summit (UN FSS) and World Health Organization (WHO) starting August 2020

The Nutrition for Growth Summit: In the first quarter of 2021, ATNI continued to regularly advise the Business Constituency Group (BCG), of which it is an observer holding an advisory role, on how companies can start preparing SMART commitments, which include accountability elements. ATNI has been taking part in the monthly Business Constituency Group (BCG) online meetings together with the Consumer Goods Forum (CGF), the International Food &amp; Beverage Alliance (IFBA), Food Industry Asia (FIA), the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) and GAIN as well as representatives from the UN FSS and was the host of the March meeting. 
Additionally, to its advisory role in the BCG, ATNI is taking a leading role in facilitating investor engagement at the Tokyo N4G Summit, securing possibilities for investor participation in the Summit events and exploring possibilities for an investor Call to Action to companies and potentially governments.
The UN Food Systems Summit: The UN Food Systems Summit will take place in New York in September with a July pre-Summit event hosted by Italy. It aims to launch bold new actions to transform food systems, delivering progress on all 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). ATNI is involved by discussing the role of investors in the Summit. ATNI also intends to share the Covid-19 report series and research on inequities in product profiling. 
WHO Global Monitoring Mechanism: After submitting a proposal for tracking trans-fat commitments of IFBA companies and performances against these commitments in November 2020,  ATNI and WHO reached an agreement. As of the end of the first quarter of 2021, ATNI and WHO are working on kickstarting the project and moving forward with the work.   
World Benchmarking Alliance: During the fourth quarter of 2020, ATNI evaluated the draft methodological framework/indicators of FAB (to be published in September 2021) and submitted a response. In the first quarter of 2021, ATNI and WBA conducted a random test on a selection of overlapping nutrition indicators for two companies using information that exists in the public domain only and arrived at similar assessments for companies. This exercise was conducted to ensure alignment on the way WBA and ATNI assessed companies on the overlapping indicators between the two benchmarks.
In May 2021, together with WBA, GAIN, the Food Foundation, ATNI will co-organize the UN FSS dialogue to discuss the role of Indexes in LMICs.</narrative>
