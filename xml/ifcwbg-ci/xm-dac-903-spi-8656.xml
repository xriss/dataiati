Morokro and Kakou have over 25 years experience in the Petroleum Products distribution sector as senior managers at the Shell Group.      Project Cost Including proposed IFC investment    	The project cost is US$5.2 million and IFC&apos;&apos;s proposed investment is a US$2.9 million equivalent guarantee of a local currency loan.    Location of project and Description of site    	The Company is located in Abidjan, Cote d&apos;&apos;Ivoire.    	Five of the new stations will be located in Abidjan, and the other five in secondary Cote d&apos;&apos;Ivoire cities.    Description of Company and Purpose of Project    	The project is for Petro Ivoire to contruct ten new gas stations over three years (1999-2001) and increase its gas station network from its current eleven to twenty one stations.  Petro Ivoire, founded in 1994 as the sole Ivorian-owned Petroleum Products distributor in the country, is currently operating eleven gas.  IFC (through the AEF) helped the Company in its first expansion in CY1995/6 when it added 4 gas stations.      	The purpose of the project is to increase the Company&apos;&apos;s presence in the retail gas station segment.    Environmental Category and Issues    	This is a category B project according to IFC&apos;&apos;s environmental review procedure.  The siting of new service stations will consider issues such as the location of power lines and transformers, depth to groundwater table, and distance to existing residential areas.  Petro Ivoire will install underground petroleum storage tanks at the retail stations, as well as large above ground tanks at the central depot.  Each underground/aboveground tank will be provided with secondary containment and will have the proper ventilation equipment and ancillary facilities for periodic inspection, spill prevention and ongoing maintenance.  Storm drains that collect rain runoff from the gas station property and any oily wastewater generated at each station will be treated in an oil/water separator prior to discharge to the local drainage system.  Appropriate measures are being taken in the design of all facilities to provide fire protection and facilitate early alarm in case of fire. Fire hydrants and portable fire extinguishers will be located at strategic points throughout each retail station.  Petro Ivoire is committed to implementing a strong occupational health and safety policy, organizing effective safety training, providing medical services, supplying personal protective devices for its employees and providing appropriate equipment safeguarding.  Based on its review of available information regarding potential environmental impacts and proposed mitigation measures, IFC concludes that the proposed project is being designed to meet World Bank policies, and environmental, health and safety guidelines.
