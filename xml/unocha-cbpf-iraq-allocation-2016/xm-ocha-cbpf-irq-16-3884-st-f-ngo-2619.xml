   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Emergency food assistant for new IDPs in Anbar Governorate</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Anbar IDPs due to last liberation operations were concentrated in closet districts to movement routs , Nukhaib ,7 kilo ,Wafa and Rahalyah ,some of them inhabit in camps , others in informal accommodation like  unfinished buildings , Mosques and accompanied with relatives , the main needs ,   Food consumption gaps as well as severe and intense employment of negative coping strategies are observed among the most vulnerable .The most vulnerable include displaced people in camps or unfinished buildings female-headed displaced families in camps households with no regular income sources and households with limited or no access to PDS. Priority should also be given to those facing a protracted duration of displacement in camps newly displaced people with limited/no access to assistance/PDS central and southern governorates and besieged localities where food
markets are not fully functional. The people have a significant food consumption gap and/or manage to achieve a minimum level of consumption with the help of food assistance, while
they resort to severe, intense and irreversible coping strategies. The FSC minimum assistance package is ensuring food assistance to the most vulnerable, food insecure
families through emergency response rations to people fleeing conflict or through
family food parcels .Key factors affecting the household food security include:
The population in the central and southern governorates reportedly have engaged in severe and irreversible livelihood coping strategies. It is worth noting that a significant number of households reportedly has exhausted their coping strategies: among the IDP households in camps, more than 20 percent of them did not sell household assets since they have already sold them earlier 33% of camp IDPs had already spent all of their savings and 24% had previously sold their last female animal, which signals an alarming situation among the vulnerable IDPs whose coping capacity is diminishing due to the continued crisis.
Food insecurity is likely to be more severe and prevalent among the following categories of people:
 IDPs in camps or unfinished buildings
 Female-headed IDP households in camps
 Households with no regular income sources
 Households with limited or no access to PDS
 Duration of displacement among IDPs in camps
 That is why it became necessary to address advocacies and cover gaps to reduce the burden on  IDPs . Ensure that the immediate food needs of 1,000 HH  newly displaced in hard to reach area in Anbar governorate  in Rahalyah , 7 kilo , Wafa and Nukhaib whome inhabit in informal camps  , IDPs in  new transit locations nearby front lines , for IDPs in movement  and  returnees in new liberated area in and food security for most vulnerable HH  in Anbar Governorate are met, via   in-kind food/food parcels and Kitchen kits.</narrative>
