   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Enhancing social cohesion and promoting emergency livelihoods opportunity for displaced persons in Anbar</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Through this five months pilot project, ACTED in collaboration with UIMS, will provide a first-line response in emergency livelihoods and social cohesion in Anbar Governorate through:
1) Improving understanding and the awareness of the livelihoods and social tension issues facing displaced communities
2) Enhancing emergency livelihoods opportunities for IDPs and host communities

ACTED in partnership with UIMS will target newly displaced vulnerable individuals (first 3 months of displacement), and accessible women, girls, boys, and men located in informal waypoint and formal settlements and formally managed settlements. This project will extend the immediate support provided through ACTED and UIMS mobile responses in Anbar in WASH and SNFI, in three areas in Amiriyat Al Falluja, Habbaniyah Tourist City and Habbaniyah, though with the intention of being mobile to adapt if the situation changes

ACTED will target at least 2,922 direct beneficiaries in Falluja and Ramadi districts offering them an access to temporary employment, training, and enhancing social cohesion through awareness and community mobilization. These activities will target all vulnerable people (IDPs and Host Communities) using a standard vulnerability selection criteria to identify those who benefit.  By identify those who are particularly vulnerable and by providing CfW to people who have young and at-risk children, elderly persons or disabled persons in their household, the project will also be able to reach those who cannot access livelihoods themselves by providing and income for the family through the person implementing the CfW.

The mobile units are part of a larger ACTED multi-sectorial approach which will respond to the WASH, shelter and non-food Items (NFIs) and livelihood needs. This multi-sectorial approach aims to respond to the current crises in Anbar by flexibly identifying and responding to the most urgent needs and new displacements. This approach ensures an efficient and effective emergency response, where multiple needs can be identified through rapid multi-sector site assessments and rapidly responded to. It will also allow for constant and regular monitoring of internally displaced persons (IDP) movements and activities implemented by UIMS. This inclusive method further promotes protection main-streaming.
The livelihoods component of this multi-sectorial response will complement the WASH and the SNFI answer in identifying vulnerable displaced persons and host communities in Falluja and supporting them in meeting their immediate needs through community mobilization and training for skilled cash for work linked to shelter and WASH works and rehabilitation and to promotion and prevention awareness which will be ongoing as part of the humanitarian response. Considering the strong links with the communities and with the market of any livelihoods intervention, ACTED will also conduct strong initial assessment to respect the do not harm principles, i.e social tensions mapping and a quick market assessment. 

In line with the cluster priorities and the direction from the IHPF advisory board, this project is intended as a pilot to test a modality for providing emergency first-line livelihoods to newly displaced populations from former Daesh-held areas. With a population that may be displaced multiple times in difficult circumstances and with anticipated high levels of tension between IDPs and potential host communities, there is a need to test modalities for emergency livelihoods that can be scaled-up from other emergency projects. ACTED&#x2019;s intervention will be robustly tested and assessed with the intention of drawing lessons learned in co-ordination with other humanitarian actors in Anbar to help define the contingency response for Mosul when over 600,000 may be displaced in similar circumstances.  Assessments, evaluations and approaches will be jointly shared and developed with the other ELSC Cluster actors</narrative>
