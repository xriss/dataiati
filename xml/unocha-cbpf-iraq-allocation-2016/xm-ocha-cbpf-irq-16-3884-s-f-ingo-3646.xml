   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Life saving food security response for IDPs along the Mosul Corridor</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Mosul, Iraq&#x2019;s second-largest city was captured by Da&#x2019;esh in June 2014 and until now remains under their control. The Iraqi army has vowed to recapture Mosul and that a counter-offensive is imminent. All scenarios for this military operation have dramatic humanitarian implications. According to some estimates, between 1.2 and 1.5 million civilians could flee into either the surrounding areas or into IS controlled areas in Syria. The Ninewa Plains may see a sharp increase in the number of displaced people in the coming months. In the Ninewa Plains, where movement restrictions may be put in place, Oxfam will consider engaging mobile traders to offer credit, cash for work in formal or informal camp settings and establishing savings and loans groups for new IDPs who may have movement restrictions placed upon.
Oxfam has recently led a Pre-Crisis Market Analysis (PCMA) in Ninewa Governorate to inform contingency planning, including assessing food security needs. Oxfam is building upon the ongoing humanitarian response, food security cluster priorities, and plans to respond to critical food needs for communities not covered by WFP or public distribution system (PDS). 
Oxfam intends to address the emergency food security needs of 6,000 the most vulnerable Internally Displaced People (IDPs) and most vulnerable households of the host community in the Tigris Corridor (Ninewa and Salahaddin Governorates) through:
- Preparing the response strengthening coordination with other humanitarian actors, update market and trader mapping, conduct trader&#x2019;s capacity assessments, preparation of framework agreements for food suppliers, provide training to traders and partners to deliver timely food security assistance that is within Oxfam&#x2019;s standards
- Providing life-Immediate response food rations to 12,000 newly internally displaced in transit and informal settlements in Qayyarah and Haji Ali, beneficiaries
-Providing life saving e-vouchers to 7,200 IDPs from Mosul in Shaikhan, in Ninewa, Baiji in Salahaddin.
Oxfam will continue best practice in assessing the situation rapidly before intervening, using the vulnerability criteria based on needs. For e-vouchers a maximum of 10% of beneficiaries will belong to Host communities most vulnerable people.
Oxfam uses beneficiary registration and verification exercises will be conducted through the Red Rose ONE Solution. This will increase accountability and transparency of the project while also contributing to monitoring and reporting. If the e-voucher modality is feasible, then the data collected through the Red Rose ONE solution will also form part of ongoing project monitoring and reporting, allowing for real time monitoring of voucher redemption.
Oxfam is already operational in targeted areas of the Tigris corridor, through market assessments, WASH work, and assessing recent displacements through security and access assessments. Oxfam has built experience in both rural and urban contexts, and a combination of both will be made available to women in these areas based on their sets of skills and type of livelihood that they want to re-establish.
Cross-cutting issues mainstreamed through the intervention:
- Gender - Oxfam will ensure that gender differences are factored in the needs assessment and in the response modalities, including women in consultations and decision making process for the response.
- Priority will be given to female-headed households, youth at risk of being recruited by armed groups IDP households with a large number households with a large number of children, handicapped, sick and elderly people who have no income nor access to assets, 
- Protection &#x2013; includes  &#x2018;do no harm approach&#x2019; and ensures that there are conditions of secure and safe access to markets for the beneficiaries, with a particular focus on women. Ensures that PSEA is followed up, providing assistance and capacity building to Oxfam and Partner Staff, especially in the preparedness phase</narrative>
