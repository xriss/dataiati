   <narrative xml:lang="EN">As the crisis in Iraq carries on into its second year, social tensions continue to rise, particularly in areas in which IDPs and host communities face economic or social hardship. Displacement and its subsequent economic repercussions upon host communities directly contribute to conflict between displaced and host communities, according to a recent impact assessment conducted at the cluster. Debt is growing among displaced communities, as well as Iraqi society as a whole, creating greater reliance on a diminishing social protection floor. The ability of the protracted displaced population to find sustainable job opportunities continues to be severely limited, with income generation remaining among one of the top needs of displaced populations. 

Livelihoods needs often lead to social tension erupting in conflict. Over 1.2 million people are expected to be prone to social conflict. Assessments have shown that both displaced and host community populations which are unable to address their needs or which struggle economically are significantly more likely to have poor relationships with other communities. This is confirmed by the reality that IDPs continue to face ethnic and socioeconomic discrimination, and host community individuals often view recent economic hardship as caused by incoming displaced populations. Where economic grievances may lead to social tensions, specific livelihoods interventions are needed to support vulnerable households. In Anbar Muslim Aid-Iraq has succeeded in developing early livelihood opportunities for the extremely vulnerable IDP categories during the last couple of months with generous support from UNHCR under co-existence and community stability theme, the benefited groups of this project were able to cover the basic living needs of their families which resulted in reducing the tensions among the displaced families and their hosting communities in different manners. 

Muslim Aid-Iraq is proposed a short-lived project to maintain the self-resilience of IDPs and their hosting communities and enable them to cope with the impact of crisis at their areas of displacement in Khaldiyah and Amiriyat Al-Falluja in Anbar province through immediate access to income for vulnerable families and social awareness especially in areas with high risks of tensions within the proposed locations. Through this project MA seeks to enhance the humanitarian response by working with other clusters to increase their scope and impact, MA will consult with CCCM and protection clusters to conduct joint efforts for the benefits of the targeted communities through CFW initiatives such as basic renovation for the facilities inside the IDP camps, renovation of primary schools, kindergartens and PHCCs that serve the both communities (IDPs and host) and conduct protection awareness on IDP rights, mine risk and doing some sort of rapid needs assessment during fluid displacement to identify the needs of the affected population.

MA-Iraq project proposal will aim to conduct rapid assessment regarding social tension and conflict sensitivity as well as to confirm the identification of the potential livelihood opportunities that were selected before through pre-assessment surveys took place for the purpose of developing this proposal. MA will also conduct community outreach initiatives to reduce and/or prevent social tensions among the targeted communities. We will also initiate temporary employment activities for the extremely vulnerable categories for four months, such temporary employments will assist in restoring the most useful facilities within the IDP camps as well as to assist and help in the renovation of damaged schools, irrigation channels and community waste water drains. Women will be consulted to identify meaningful C4W activities that are socially acceptable.</narrative>
