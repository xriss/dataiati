  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The ongoing crisis in Iraq has forced more than 3 million Iraqis to flee their homes and seek safety and protection in other areas of displacement. Al-Mortaqa foundation through its continues humanitarian response to the needs of those IDPs and through multi-clusters&apos; needs assessment which was conducted recently and targeted the fresh displacement in northern Salah ad-din and southern Nineveh (specifically, Qayyara, Makhmour and Tlool Al-Baaj) released that some of the non-camp IDPs especially those with special needs such as (female headed-household, people with disabilities, people with a lot of children) in besieged and hard-to-reach areas were unable to get access to the minimum basic living necessities such as safe drinking water, hygiene kits and ready-to-eat food during their first days of displacement, the limited mobility of the assessed people was also considered as a reason for that gap. This was a direct result of many parameters represented by the lack of coordination among the local governments of the targeted provinces, access-related difficulties and conflict of interest among the concerned security and local authorities. Al-Mortaqa foundation proposes this project to act as the first respondent to any sudden displacement in the above mentioned areas taking into consideration the humanitarian principles and the protection mainstreaming as a baseline and indication for its humanitarian intervention.

Al-Mortaqa foundations&#x2019;s response plan for the immediate needs of the extremely vulnerable non-camp IDPs and affected besieged communities will addresses some of the key findings reflected in the multi-clusters&apos; needs assessment mission conducted by Mortaqa Rapid Response Team along the last two weeks as well as the needs reported by other humanitarian actors such as OCHA, WFP, FSC, IOM, Rise foundation and ICRC. Al-Mortaqa foundation will ensure the adaptation of humanitarian principles and Protection Mainstreaming in its activities under this proposed project.

Mortaqa foundation will reach the extremely vulnerable non-camp IDPs and the affected communities in hard-to-reach and besieged areas to provide them with ready-to-eat food parcel within the first 24 HOURS of their displacement, each parcel will contain:
A. 5 cans of beans (medium size)
B. 5 cans of meat/chicken (medium size)
C. 4 cans of cheese (big size)
D. 2 cans of jam (medium size)
E. 4 packs of Turkish bread (big size)
F. 1 packs of dates (medium size)
G. Sugar
H. Tea
I. 20 pcs of disposable cups
J. 01 piece of knife

Mortaqa foundation has piloted the components of the above mentioned commodities in three locations in northern Salah ad-din and south of Nineveh, it was released that such parcel could be sufficient for a family of 5 members for one week which is the most critical period during the fresh displacement. Al-Mortaqa foundation will consult with the concerned local authorities and Iraqi security forces to secure the distribution area which will not be far from the IDPs locations (maximum 500 m), delivery at household level will take place for the people with specific needs or limited mobility.

Al-Mortaqa foundation will be mandated for providing OCHA and the FSC with the required documentations such as the distribution lists, confirmation letter from the relevant local authorities in addition to some videos and pictures for each single distribution cycle. Additionally Al-Mortaqa foundation will provide OCHA, FSC, ICRC, MoMD and other related partners with 24 hrs update regarding the needs, response and gaps in the proposed areas through its growing network among the whole province of Nineveh. Such update will be qualitative and quantitative in terms of data and will be verified by the local authorities and MoMD field representatives. MF will be also mandated for providing advocacy for the IDPs with the concerned local authorities to ensure the availability of the minimum requirements of food for the affected people.</narrative>
