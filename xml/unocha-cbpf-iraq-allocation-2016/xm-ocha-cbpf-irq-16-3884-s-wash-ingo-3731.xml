   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The objectives of the proposed project are to meet immediate life-saving WASH needs through rapid and timely humanitarian assistance and to further improve the access to basic appropriate water, sanitation and hygiene facilities and services, subsequently ensuring continued, improved and further equitable access to basic, appropriate WASH for vulnerable, critically affected girls, boys, men and women living in camps, off camp as well as within informal and collective centers in Salah Al-Din province. This project is taking into account the highly anticipated IDP movement to this province from the Mosul area. RIRP will remain flexible during project implementation in such cases that needs within other quadrants require additional assistance, we are prepared to re orientate our implementation to those areas. 

The proposed project aims to provide access to (sustainable) water and sanitation facilities for 13,500 vulnerable IDP&#x2019;s within Salah Al-Din province, (or to areas of greatest need).

Our project comprises of first-line response activities. The project includes emergency delivery of safe water, supply and installation of water tanks with tap stands, emergency latrines and bathing facilities, garbage collection and desludging to service the IDP locations. Within the project proposal, we will also deliver 11250 rolls of household garbage bags, 270 garbage containers, 5625 basic hygiene kits and conduct hygiene awareness training/promotion within the targeted areas.

The areas of project implementation have and will continue to be, selected in coordination and cooperation with the sub national WASH Cluster operating out of Salah Al-Din, which is led by UNICEF to reach vulnerable groups who are still suffering from water shortage and lack of access to hygiene and sanitation. 

RIRP is currently working in the targeted areas, conducting the following activities: Water trucking, delivery of hygiene kits, delivery/supply/installation of water tanks, septic tanks, construction of latrines and showers. RIRP aims to conduct hygiene awareness training as well as promoting health aspects and installation of RO stations at a later stage. 

In all of our project implementations, RIRP attempts to involve members of the local community (in addition to the beneficiaries), in project assessment, planning, preparation and realization. The aim is to deliver gender and culturally appropriate services taking into account the special needs of all vulnerable groups, with a strong focus on and the aim of ensuring safe and equitable access for all beneficiaries, specifically considering the most urgent needs of girls, boys and women. To do so we ensure, wherever possible, to include the female community members into the project.

The proposed project will be broken down into two categories, Response and Preparedness and it is our aim to deliver the FULL WASH PACKAGE to each of the beneficiaries, i.e. each beneficiary will benefit from the whole set of activities performed. Numbers mentioned below: 

Based on the WASH Response against Settlement Typology we have calculated the below numbers based on Temporary Living Sites (Potential Emergency Camps):
 
Response will include 30% of all mentioned activities
4,050 beneficiaries of which:
30% will be targeted in formal camps: 1,215
70% to be targeted in temporary living sites: 2,835
For the duration of 6 months.

Preparedness will include 70% of all mentioned activities
9,450 beneficiaries of which:
30% will be targeted in formal camps: 2,835
70% to be targeted in temporary living sites: 6,615
For the duration of 1 month.</narrative>
