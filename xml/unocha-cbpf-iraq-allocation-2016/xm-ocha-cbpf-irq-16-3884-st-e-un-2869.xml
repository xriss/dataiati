   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Improving immediate access to inclusive safe and protected learning environments for highly vulnerable children from besieged areas in Anbar Governorate</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project will improve immediate access to inclusive safe and protected learning environments for 30,000 highly vulnerable children (5-17 years) from ISIL besieged areas across Anbar Governorate. Children who have been living under ISIL control have very specific and critical needs in terms of their psychological well-being. Many of them have been out-of-school for up to 2 years and/or exposed to serious ISIL indoctrination, violence and deprivation. This project will support children who are severely conflict affected to access positive and structured forms of learning and play with guided psychosocial support. This is imperative to their well-being and prospects for developing into peaceful and productive members of Iraqi society and to assisting them to regain a sense of stability and security in their lives. These activities form part of a first line response to providing education in emergencies.

The focus will be on reaching children from ISIL controlled areas who are in (i) 3 transit sites (al Wafaa, Kilo 7/18, Khaldiya) (ii) 2 large IDP camps (Ameriyat al Fallujah, Habbaniya Tourist City) (iii) nearby communities hosting large IDP populations (Ameriyat al Fallujah, Habbaniya Tourist City, Khaldiya) and (iv) in communities recently re-taken from ISIL where people did not displace (e.g. Rutbah, Hit, Kubaisa).

The frontline activities will be adjusted to the type of setting for the intervention to maximize the benefit for children&#x2019;s learning and well-being. Specifically, 18 temporary learning spaces will be established in the 3 transit sites 24 prefab classrooms will be installed in the 2 established IDP camps where such units are already being used to serve part of displaced population of school-age children and 20 existing schools will be repaired and/or extended in host communities and communities re-taken from ISIL with a high proportion of displaced and/or conflict affected children. 

Children from besieged areas will have access to quality learning and recreation materials through distribution of Arabic Kits, School-in-box kits and recreation kits they will also have access to 650 teachers who have been attuned to the needs of conflict affected children from besieged areas through an orientation on education in emergencies and psychosocial support that will improve their skills, including in identifying children who require specialized services. Teachers will also receive incentives to cover transport and related costs enabling them to organize and teach extra classes for conflict-affected children so this does not become a barrier.

Collectively, this project will provide children from besieged areas with safe spaces for learning and play that will facilitate them to regain a sense of normalcy and security in their lives and contribute to their positive development.</narrative>
