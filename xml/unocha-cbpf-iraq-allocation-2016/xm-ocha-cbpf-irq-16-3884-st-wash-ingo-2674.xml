   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The objectives of the proposed project are to meet immediate life-saving WASH needs through rapid and timely humanitarian assistance and to further improve the access to basic appropriate water, sanitation and hygiene facilities and services, subsequently ensuring continued, improved and further equitable access to basic, appropriate WASH for vulnerable, critically affected girls, boys, men and women living in camps, off camp as well as within informal and collective centres in Al Anbar and Salah Al-Din provinces. This project is taking into account the highly anticipated IDP movement through the Anbar Corridor during the intended liberation of Mosul.

The proposed project aims to provide access to (sustainable) water, sanitation and hygiene facilities for 106,000 vulnerable IDP&#x2019;s within Al Anbar and Salah Al-Din provinces.  

Our project delivers a full first and second line WASH package and is an extension to our currently ongoing projects in the named areas. The project includes emergency delivery of safe water, supply and installation of water tanks with tap stands, emergency latrines and bathing facilities. Supply and installation of Reverse Osmosis (RO) stations with 5m&#xB3;/hr. capacity, all accessories and with water network pipeline to service the IDP locations. Within the project proposal, we will also deliver 2000 hygiene kits and conduct hygiene awareness training/promotion within the targeted areas. This will greatly reduce the number of cases of water borne diseases and promote a healthier living environment.

The areas of project implementation have and will continue to be, selected in coordination and cooperation with the sub national WASH Cluster operating out of Baghdad, which is led by UNICEF to reach vulnerable groups who are still suffering from water shortage and lack of access to hygiene and sanitation. 

RIRP is currently working in the targeted areas, conducting the following activities: Water trucking, delivery of Hygiene Kits and RRM&#x2019;s, Delivery/Supply/Installation of water tanks, septic tanks, latrines and showers. RIRP conducts Hygiene Awareness training as well as promoting health aspects, installation of RHU&#x2019;s, shelter construction and shelter rehabilitation and installation of RO stations. In addition we realize activities in the field of education such as rehabilitating/maintaining schools, installing tented classrooms, providing education materials etc. Therefore, RIRP has proven that it is in the position to access these areas and provide the necessary help utilizing local staff in the region that is able to access the project locations unobstructed. Also hard to reach areas such as the the west of Ramadi can be accessed by our team and we are able to deliver humanitarian aid to the IDPs living there. 

In all of our project implementations, RIRP attempts to involve members of the local community (in addition to the beneficiaries), in project assessment, planning, preparation and realization. The aim is to deliver gender and culturally appropriate services taking into account the special needs of all vulnerable groups, with a strong focus on and the aim of ensuring safe and equitable access for all beneficiaries, specifically considering the most urgent needs of girls, boys and women. To do so we ensure, wherever possible, to include the female community members into the project.</narrative>
