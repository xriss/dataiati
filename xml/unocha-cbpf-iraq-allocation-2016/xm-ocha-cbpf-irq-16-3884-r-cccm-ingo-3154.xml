   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Addressing site management needs and provision of assistance to IDPs in formal and informal settlements in Anbar</narrative>

  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In order to better meet the needs of IDP women, men boys and girls, DRC proposes addressing site management gaps across the governorate of Anbar that is based on the TWINNING approach to CCCM which was developed by DRC, IOM and NRC. This approach facilitates the capacity building of camp managers in Anbar whiles also supporting local authorities and humanitarian actors to provide first line assistance to the more than 119,648 camp population in Anbar as reported by the Iraq CCCM Settlement Status Report- July 11, 2016. The core objective of DRC&#x2019;s approach under the Twinning approach is to strengthen camp coordination, management and information in Anbar by deploying Mobile Response Teams (MRT) which will provide technical assistance and guidance to the national camp management actors already working in the camps. Each MRT will consist of 2 to 3 members and will cover 4 camps and or informal settlements in Ameriyat al Fallujah, Habbaniyah Tourist City (HTC), and Bzeibiz bridge areas of eastern Anbar. With existing funding under an ongoing ECHO project DRC has already established two MRTs in IDP camps in Anbar as of July 1, 2016 and is in the process of establishing a third team in response to the increasing number of displaced families in Anbar.

Key activities that will be implemented by DRC MRTs under this intervention include:
1) The capacity building of national site management actors and the establishment of coordination structures within formal camps and collective centers, ensuring that relevant site managers and support staff can increasingly assume more responsibility in directly providing assistance to IDPs and increase access to services by other humanitarian actors 
2) Providing technical and material/ in-kind support to site managers in the form of on the job training, caravans for the hosting of management activities and staff, as well as the necessary kits and supplies to carry out site management activities
3) Strengthening community mobilization through the establishment of self- governance structures and site representative networks which will engage the active participation of IDPs in the daily management of formal and informal camp sites. Furthermore, this activity will increase the dissemination of reliable and up-to-date information on site needs.
4) Supporting site maintenance through cash for work (CFW) that will provide financial resources for basic site infrastructure improvements and fire safety equipment and training in order to minimize physical risk for IDPs.

By deploying MRT in Anbar, DRC will be able to provide robust first-line assistance, provide real-time information and mapping to help coordinate emergency response to underserved IDPs in both formal and informal camp settlements. The cost-saving interventions through the MRT will allow for basic first-line response, while also ensuring the rapid referral of specific needs/gap analysis to various cluster members and coordination bodies, thus underlining multiple sectors first line and full-responses. Through this inter-cluster coordination approach, DRC aims to ensure that the specialized concerns of women, children and other vulnerable groups are better responded to and gaps in the provision of basic services are decreased. In addition, DRC CCCM will work towards fostering the active participation of women in site management by seeking to establish gender equal site representation, women&#x2019;s committees and youth committees.</narrative>
