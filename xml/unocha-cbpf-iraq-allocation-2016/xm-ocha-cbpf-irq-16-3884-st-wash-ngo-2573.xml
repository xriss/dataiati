   <narrative xml:lang="EN">WASH Emergency Response for Anbar IDPs  in HTC and new IDPs in transit locations in  7 Kilo, Rahalyah, Nukhaib and al Wafaa districts</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Due to continuous clashes between Iraqi forces and ISL in Anbar province west of the country, thousands of families forced to flee in the direction of closest liberated areas. The Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs reported that a high number of families have fled Ramadi area since the military operation started in December 2015. The statement pointed out that these families were displaced from the center of the Ramadi areas including Alibovraj, Albu-Thiyab, Busada, Alboganm, Albomahl, AlQariah Al Asriah, Zangorah and Sufis, located all around the city of Ramadi. 
Some of these families are located in transit and formal camps in Kilo 7/18, al Wafaa, Rahalyah and Nukhaib districts but these districts have inadequate water resources and sanitation to support the IDPs. This also affects the host community. Despite the support provided by UN agencies, UNICEF and NGOs, there are many gaps in WASH services and significant needs are still not covered. Needs are increasing in HTC with about 23,800 IDPs counted and a new site of 150 tents set up to accommodate newly arrived IDPs. But some interventions have been stopped due to end of project period and there is a critical need to upgrade interventions. HTC needs to sustain water supply operation, to get both RO water and wash service water by ensuring permanent water pumping through pipe lines and via water trucks .

This project is in line with the WASH cluster minimum package of support, first line and second line response strategies and activities and overall objectives to provide immediate, urgently required access to safe water, sanitation hygiene to the affected boys, girls, men and women in order to reduce mortality and morbidity. The project is also designed to ensure the continuity and scale up these services for affected IDPs and host communities. The project also includes critical support to the operation rapid restoration of critical government water projects and the provision of waste management supplies. These will be handed to the local authorities at the end of the project for continued provision of services, there is operator assigned by local authority.

Afkar Society for Development and Human Relief (ASDHR) plans to dig bore holes in the designated areas to ensure sustainability of the water resources and mitigate the cost of water trucking. This water can be used as washing water. The installation of RO units will provide drinking water for both host community and IDPs.  ASDHR interventions will be done through mobile teams to reach the newly arrived IDPs and water trucking will be established for the hard to reach areas. The waste management component of the project will include garbage removal and procurement of sanitary mobile units. 
 
ASDHR is in regular contact with the local authorities and decision makers in Anbar who are expecting further waves of displacement from Ana, Rawa, Rutba and Qaim towards Rahalyah in the next few weeks. With an estimated number of not less than 20,000 newly displaced IDPs, ASDHR is planning to scale up WASH interventions in Rahalyah while continuing to provide services to the IDPs already settled there as well as the host community.</narrative>
