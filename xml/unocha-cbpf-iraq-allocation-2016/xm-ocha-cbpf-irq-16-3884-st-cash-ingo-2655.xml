   <narrative xml:lang="EN">To provide immediate emergency support to 300 extremely vulnerable IDP and host households affected by the current crisis in Ninewa governorate, through multi-month, multipurpose cash assistance</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project aims to provide immediate emergency support to a total of 300 extremely vulnerable households affected by the current crisis through multi-month, multipurpose cash assistance. This includes 270 extremely vulnerable IDP families (1,620 individuals) as well as 30 host families (10%) (180 individuals). This is expected to include 50% male (900 individuals) and 50% female beneficiaries (900 individuals). This evidence-based intervention derives directly from a rapid needs assessment carried out in Ninewa in October 2015, which showed that critical needs remain at the household level and that almost 100% of families had resorted to negative coping strategies. In the RNA men and women were consulted separately to ensure each gender could speak freely. Findings were incorporated into the design of this project. 

The project will provide 3 monthly instalments (MMCA) valued at $360 each to support families in meeting some of their critical needs, delivered through Hawala services. The cash amount equals 70% of the Survival Minimum Economic Basket (SMEB) and is in line with the HRP MPCA strategy, as TF aims to address critical needs of those protracted displaced families through the second line response. Host families will also be included. This MMCA helps extremely vulnerable families to recover from shocks enabling them to clear debts, purchase items for hygiene or cooking and reverse some of the negative coping mechanisms. 

TF&#x2019;s project team has previously implemented various cash projects and thus brings experience in the delivery of MPCA projects to a high standard. Beneficiary accountability is included at all stages of the project and a dedicated accountability officer is ensuring community feedback is received, resolved and integrated where possible. Post Distribution Monitoring (PDMs) will be carried out to track expenditure against critical needs. As chair of the Dohuk CWG, TF will continue its advocacy for MPCA and enhance coordination among all implementing agencies. This will also include preparation for and coordination of MPCA response to the expected recapture of Mosul, for which TF has already supported a contingency planning workshop for all actors and is continuing to facilitate joint efforts in harmonising and mapping of tools and experience. TF also includes a contingency component in this project to allow for this.

In addition, this project will focus on strengthening existing and identifying new referral pathways for persons with special needs, classified as extremely vulnerable. This will include, but is not limited to people with a disability or severe medical condition, but also those in need of psychosocial support. The CWG will be used as a platform to identify current gaps and link actors to services available. Geographic coordination with other actors operating in the proposed project location is also underway and will ensure local support mechanisms for those groups in need of assistance beyond cash.</narrative>
