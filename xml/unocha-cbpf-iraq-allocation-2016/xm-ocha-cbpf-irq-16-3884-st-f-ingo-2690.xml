   <narrative xml:lang="EN">EMERGENCY ASSISTANCE TO THE EXTREMELY VULNERABLE IDPS AFFECTED BY THE IRAQ CRISIS THROUGH DELIVERY OF BASIC LIVING SERVICES IN ANBAR AND SALAH AD-DIN PROVINCES</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The ongoing crisis in Iraq has forced more than 3 million Iraqis to flee their homes and seek safety and protection in other areas of displacement. Muslim Aid through its continues humanitarian response to the needs of those IDPs and through multi-clusters&apos; needs assessment which was conducted recently and targeted the fresh displacement in Anbar and Salah ad-din has released that some of the IDPs especially those with special needs such as (female headed-household, people with disabilities, people with a lot of children) in seiged and hard-to-reach areas were enable to get access to the minimum basic living necessities such as safe drinking water, hygiene kits and ready-to-eat food during their first four days of displacement. This was a direct result of many parameters represented by the lack of coordination among the targeted provinces, access-related difficulties and conflict of interest among the concerned security and local authorities. Muslim Aid proposes this project to act as the first respondent to any sudden displacement in sieged or hard-to-reach areas taking into consideration the humanitarian principles and the protection mainstreaming as a baseline and indication for its humanitarian intervention.

MA&#x2019;s response plan for the immediate needs of the IDPs addresses some of the key findings reflected in the multi-clusters&apos; needs assessment mission conducted by MA team along the last period as well as the needs reported by other humanitarian actors such as OCHA, WFP, UNICEF, IOM and ICRC. MA will ensure the adaptation of humanitarian principles and Protection Mainstreaming in its activities under this proposed project.

MA-Iraq&#x2019;s proposal based on the following activities/themes:
1.	For Food-related response:
-	MA-Iraq will identify the extremely vulnerable IDPs in hard-to-reach and sieged areas to provide them with ready-to-eat food parcel within the first 24 hours of their displacement, each parcel will contain:
a.	3 cans of beans
b.	3 cans of meat
c.	3 cans of cheese
d.	2 cans of jam
e.	3 packs of biscuits
f.	2 packs of dates
g.	2 packs of Tahini
h.	2 packs of Halawa
i.	Sugar
j.	Tea
k.     20 pieces of local white breads
The priority will be given to the female headed household, families with more than two elderly, families with more than five children, families with members suffer from disabilities&#x2026; Etc.
-	MA will consult with the concerned local authorities and Iraqi security forces to secure the distribution area which will not be far from the IDPs locations (maximum 500 m)
-	MA will provide the donor with the required documentations such as the distribution lists, confirmation letter from the local authorities in addition to some videos and pictures

2.     MA will provide OCHA, FSC and other related partners with 24 hrs update regarding the needs, response and gaps in the proposed areas through establishing a wide network among the whole province. Such update will be qualitative and quantitative in terms of data and will be verified by the local authorities.

3.     MA will provide advocacy for the IDPs with the concerned local authorities to ensure the availability of minimum requirements of food for the AP</narrative>
