   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Pre-positioning of Winterized S/NFI assistance for Mosul displaced population in Northern Ninewa.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The proposed project aims to procure and preposition Winterized S/NFI assistance for the population expected to flee from Mosul towards Northern Ninewa - Quadrants 2 and 1A - into areas where PIN already has operational presence and active projects. Further on, taking advantage of being registered with the GoI as well as having operational field office in Zummar (N.Ninewa), if the security situation allows PIN might expand the assistance onto Quadrant 3, areas west of Mosul. PIN intends to closely monitor situation in this area which will be further aided by PIN presence in Hasakeh Governorate (North-East Syria) which might allow for triangulation of information on displacements. Taking into consideration high degree of flexibility required from humanitarian actors to respond in a relevant and timely manner, PIN will follow the developments in all these areas through close coordination with all the stakeholders and will be prepared to address the needs where they emerge.

The assistance is planned to be delivered through mobile approach, in close coordination with other shelter actors and the shelter cluster, targeting gaps not covered by other NGOs, particularly in areas where PIN already has necessary access permissions. The proposed assistance will target out-of-camp population residing in unfinished/abandoned buildings and other informal settlements and is designed in line with Shelter Cluster recommendations in terms of content and value of the kits. Taking into consideration that this proposal is focused on preparedness and pre-stocking, no cash modalities are being planned for. PIN will however consider cash-based modalities in further stages of the response if the market condition allow and there are no obstacles towards such approach from the relevant authorities.

Proposed project will mainstream protection concerns through screening of beneficiary population for presence of vulnerable individuals and involvement of vulnerable groups in design of distributions. Vulnerable individuals such as woman-headed households, child-headed households or elderly-headed households will be prioritized during distributions and will be considered for further support with additional cash grants to cover costs of labor for installation of the shelter kits and/or SoK.

Particular attention will be paid to coordination with the OCHA Coordination hub, S/NFI Cluster and other INGOs active in the areas, both through existing coordination mechanisms as well as through bilateral communication, to avoid duplication, overlaps, as well as to exchange information on situation in the area.</narrative>
