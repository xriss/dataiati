   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Provision of Emergency Shelter and NFI Support through mobile teams to IDPs displaced by conflict from Mosul City and settlements in the Mosul Corridor</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Through this three month initiative, ACTED will carry out a two-month preparation phase in order to procure and pre-position emergency shelter and NFI kits and a one month response phase, consisting in a first-line response of Shelter and NFIs to displaced individuals coming from Mosul city and settlements in the Mosul corridor in order to ensure that vulnerable IDP families have 1) access to emergency shelter, and 2) access to essential seasonal appropriate NFIs. This will thus ensure the continuation of the first-line response activities ACTED is currently undertaking in Northern Ninewa and Anbar. ACTED proposes a flexible, mobile and comprehensive approach by using mobile teams ready to be deployed according to needs identified on the ground as these arise.

Activities will primarily take place in camp and outside of camp settlements via mobile teams pre-positioned in the area, with items stocked respectively in Dohuk and Shikhan and Sulaymaniyah warehouses as needed. ACTED will be able to access and intervene quadrant 1 and 2 and will focus on these areas in coordination with other partners in order to avoid duplication of efforts. 

ACTED will target 10,000 beneficiaries, including 2,700 women, 2,600 men, 2,400 girls and 2,300 boys in order to ensure they have access to emergency shelter and life-saving NFIs. Activities will include distribution of Basic Emergency Shelter Kits (BESKs) and Mobile NFI kits. ACTED will ensure flexibility of the BESKs as materials will be distributed depending on the needs on the ground. The BESKs and NFI Mobile kits will be distributed, where applicable, in combination with RRM kits in Ninewa&#x2019;s districts where ACTED is either the main or backup RRM partner.

The NFI kit proposed has been standardised across Shelter-NFIs cluster partners and is already been piloted by ACTED in Anbar and Ninewa under the previous round of IHPF this year. The kit was agreed on among partners by identifying current needs of IDPs, lessons learnt and past experiences in the areas of interventions. The kit has been designed to provide an effective first line response that would cover essential NFIs needs of the beneficiaries for a period of up to two weeks. Additionally, the kit is mobile in nature, as it is composed of easy-to-transport items that in case of further displacement will be able to be carried around for this reason, all the items will fit in a bag.

Lastly, the proposed activities are part of a mobile intervention, which includes a comprehensive approach that will respond not only to Shelter and Non-Food Items (NFIs) needs but also to WASH and Camp Coordination and Camp Management (CCCM). This multi-sectoral integrated approach aims to respond to the emergency that will unfold following the liberation of Mosul City as well as the current needs of IDPs in the area. Needs will be identified by ACTED CCCM and AME teams carrying out respectively site assessments and a multi-sectoral rapid needs assessment. ACTED will also monitor all its distribution activities and carry out a Post Distribution Monitoring (PDM) in order to assess the impact that these activities have on beneficiaries. This, together with the assessments, will be shared with the Shelter and NFI Cluster to share information and lessons learnt with all the partners.</narrative>
