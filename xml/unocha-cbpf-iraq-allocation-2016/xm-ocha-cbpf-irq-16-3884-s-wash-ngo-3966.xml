   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Provision of emergency WASH response for 2400 extremely vulnerable IDPs in remote and hard to reach areas in Nineveh province</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project is designed as preparedness project to meet the demands of a large number of IDPs concerning WASH issues at screening points / emergency camps. The project is about to cover a period of 3 month with 1 month of implementation, stockpiling hygiene kits as well as water distribution. Water trucking will be arranged for one month.

The planning is based upon the WASH NFI response guidelines and WASH response typology for emergency camps as recommended by the WASH cluster. The project is set up as to react on short notice and flexible concerning the final location. It is able and ready to work either at emergency camps of directly at the screening centers according to the requirements at the time of activation. 

Newly displaced people need a quick response in many areas. The need for drinking water and hygiene are among the top priorities.

It is expected that with the beginning of new military operations in the Mosul area a great number of the local population will leave the city. According to official planning screening sites will be erected close behind the front line to check peoples identities. We expect that at these points or probably not far away emergency camps will be set up, where WASH operations will be required most. Travel long distances on foot in the desert at high temperatures will lead to loss of fluid, which could be dangerous.

Beneficiaries of the operation are highly vulnerable IDPs with a high percentage of women and children among them. It is estimated that women will make up a proportion of at least 25-30% of prospective IDPs. Pregnant women are estimated to rise to 9% of the total number of women, while women who breastfeed children are estimated to number about 20% of the total number of women. Our experiences indicate that children (girls and boys) will also be numerous and vulnerable to the hardships of displacement. Estimates further say that the percentage of people with disabilities from Mosul&apos;s residents up to 3%, and those in need of special attention.

It has to be taken in mind that at the screening points the men will be isolated from the rest of their families which is very likely to increase the challenges. Also the civilian population in Mosul did not get used to the face of displacement conditions yet.

The aim of the project is to provide these vulnerable people with water and the basic means concerning sanitary und hygiene issues. These include drinking water, latrines, washing facilities and hygiene kits. This will not only prevent casualties from thirst and prevent the spread of diseases but also result in stabilizing the people mental state after the shock of flight. We will pay great attention to facilitate the access to all the help for all IDPs (including the disabled), while ensuring that this is done fairly with respect for their dignity</narrative>
