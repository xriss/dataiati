   <narrative xml:lang="EN">First line emergency support for 825 IDP and host households affected by the crisis in Mosul / Ninewa governorate</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Tearfund will provide first line cash assistance to 825 households (approx. 4950 people) displaced by military operations against Islamic State (IS) in Mosul. This will involve a single payment of $400 to each household to help meet their immediate needs. The cash grants will be distributed in Ninewa (Shekhan and Tilkaif) awith the exact geographic location determined by the actuals of the displacement. It is estimated that 10% of the total caseload may be host community. 

Tearfund has implemented cash assistance in Iraq since 2014, including projects in Dohuk, Ninewa and Kirkuk and reached more than 10,000HH (50,000 individuals).

Tearfund is now implementing a response and preparedness plan for populations displaced by the offensive. The specific preparedness actions which have been carried out thus far include: pre-crisis market assessments in Ninewa which investigated the availability of key commodities as well as access to markets price monitoring, signing of agreements with specific financial service providers (hawala) with capacity to scale up cash delivery recruitment and capacity building of appropriate teams. Standardized forms have been developed to conduct rapid market and needs assessments and staff have been trained on them specifically.

Tearfund will be using the cash SOPs developed and used successfully over the last two years to implement this programme. It will use standardised online survey tools for beneficiary selection and conduct independent data triangulation. Criteria for selection are line with the HRP technical guidance that qualifies newly arrived families, using the shelter situation as a proxy criteria for vulnerability. 

Tearfund will coordinate with the other actors, by using the master beneficiary database, to avoid duplication. The delivery of cash grants will be done efficiently prioritizing people&apos;s dignity, safety and data protection. Beneficiary accountability is included at all stages and a dedicated officer is ensuring community feedback is received, resolved and integrated where possible. Post Distribution Monitoring (PDMs) will be carried out over the phone and complemented through household visits. 

Protection is a critical concern during and in the aftermath of the coming offensive and is mainstreamed into Tearfund programming (detailed in the relevant section). Men may be detained at screening centres, children separated and women and children may be stranded or transported elsewhere. For vulnerable groups identified, e.g. persons with a disability, or child headed households, Tearfund will seek to address issues through targeting, onwards referrals for additional support and advocacy. 

Based on secured funding totals, funding for cash programming in Ninewa/Dohuk will run out by the end of January 2017. The cash funding in Ninewa that is ending is from IHPF - however it is for second line response only. The request for first line assistance through this project is critical to enable Tearfund to respond at scale with first line cash support.</narrative>
