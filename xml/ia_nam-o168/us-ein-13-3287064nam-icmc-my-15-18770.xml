   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Since 2010 ICMC has worked within Burmese refugee communities to address and reduce the risk of Sexual and Gender-Based Violence (SGBV), and to assist SGBV survivors and their families with their urgent and long-term needs.  Starting in Kuala Lumpur and expanding into the Klang Valley and Penang State, this work is dynamic, progressive and multifaceted, evolving each year to address new aspects and perspectives of SGBV. To ensure the long-term value of its projects and extend their impact beyond Malaysia, ICMC also responds to the onwards movement of refugees by identifying new beneficiaries for training and assistance on an ongoing basis, equipping them with transferable skills to be used after resettlement, and building SGBV awareness and capacity within communities. 
ICMC&#x2019;s operations in Malaysia are notable for their strong emphasis on building trust and constructive relationships with key actors and communities.  At the heart of this approach is the Refugee Women&#x2019;s Protection Corps (RWPC), a dedicated body of volunteers recruited and trained by ICMC. Comprising both female and male volunteers from a cross-section of Burmese refugee groups, the RWPC provides unparalleled access to refugee communities and increases the reach and effectiveness of ICMC&#x2019;s projects.</narrative>
