(Mardan), Khairabad (Nowshera) and Voluntary Repatriation Center (VRC) Chamkani (Peshawar). ICMC is already providing health services in Peshawar,
Charsadda, Buner and Chitral with ECHO funds and proposes the continuation of these services from January 1st, 2018 to May 31st, 2018. ICMC will provide qualified staff, medicines and medical supplies to ensure the availability of emergency lifesaving healthcare to refugees, will train health workers and
organize health awareness sessions. ICMC also proposes to continue refugee protection activities (through its implementing partner SHARP) from January 1st, 2018 to May 31st, 2018 and provide free legal aid on civil cases, assistance for documentation&apos;s issuance and other general and legal information. Enhancing capacity of the legal practitioners and mass awareness raising of communities will also remain a key activity.
