   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The action responds to the specific protection and health needs of Afghan refugees living in Charsadda, Chitral, Buner, Dir and Peshawar districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP), Pakistan. The action will provide legal aid on civil cases to Afghan refugees and other general and legal information including on areas of return in Afghanistan. The action will assist refugees in obtaining Proof of Registration (PoR) cards and other legal documentation. It will identify and refer cases to UNHCR and other NGOs for other services like education and health. Enhancing capacity of the legal practitioners in formal and informal justice sectors, police, and judges amongst others will be a key activity in this action. Finally, the action will link up field level learning with policy dialogue in Islamabad and Peshawar thus highlighting difficulties faced by refugees and aiming to improve legal and protection environment for refugees. This will be supported by mass awareness and community mobilization campaigns. 
In health sector, the action has been designed in consultation with UNHCR, CAR, Frontier Primary Health Centers (FPHC), Project Directorate of Health (PDH) and other stakeholders that stopped their activities or are planning to reduce their services in the targeted areas. The action will establish/revitalize Basic Health Units, provide qualified staff and medical supplies to ensure the availability of emergency lifesaving health assistance for refugees, such as obstetrical and child care, train community health workers and organize health awareness and hygiene promotion sessions.</narrative>
