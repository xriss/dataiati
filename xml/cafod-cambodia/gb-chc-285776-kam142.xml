   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project is to support rural communities in Preah Vihear province, which is in northern Cambodia. Rich in resources and biodiversity, the province has only relatively recently been opened to the outside. The different targeted communities are surrounded by forests and other natural resources and are mostly indigenous groups. From day to day, the communities have faced challenges of forest clearance, forestland encroachment, illegal logging, and wildlife hunting by outsiders and companies. This has really affected community people&#x2019;s livelihoods as their daily needs are partly relying on surrounding community natural resources and forests. The project aims to enhance communities&#x2019; traditional platforms, improve their livelihoods, sustain natural resources protection, and regenerate the environment.

Two main areas of intervention of the project are enhancing the communities&#x2019; grassroots institutions platforms for local/indigenous knowledge sharing and sustainable natural resources protection and improving communities&#x2019; self-reliance on natural resources management via sustainable livelihoods.   

Main project activities include developing 3 sets of forest management regulations and traditional ground rules for the 3 villages participating in the programme; building 3 Indigenous Peoples (IPs) cultural centres; designing and building community-based ecotourism projects in 3 villages; establishing and training 15 patrol groups for forest monitoring and  wildlife conservation; training on Natural Resource Management (NRM) to communities; forming 3  groups for art, dance and traditional hand-weaving; creating 3 IPs women saving groups and 3 rice banks; and planting 15 kinds of seeds planted in the 3 ha of forestland.</narrative>
