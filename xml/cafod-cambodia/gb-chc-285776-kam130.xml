   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Srer Khmer is one of local partners that has expertise and experiences on sustainable socio-economic development through research, training, education and community development by promoting farmer-led activities, networking and sustainable agriculture. The partner has been a key partner supporting CAFOD to deliver strategic outcomes since 2015.

Since 2018, SK has had internal organisational leadership and management issues that have not been addressed until present. The issues have been developed over time without attention of the leadership, and staff turnover becomes significant in 2019. This has impacted the overall performance of the organisation ranging from improper compliance to organisational policies and procedures, ineffective communication, withdrawn trust and confidence among staff and funding partners, lack of clarity on structures and their roles and responsibilities. As a result, their projects have not been implemented as plan and affected to project outcomes. With these challenges, some funding partners have ended funding support to SK. In late 2019, SK&#x2019;s executive director resigned amidst this period of turbulence.

In September 2019, the new ED, Ms. Alyny, has been appointed by staff and SK board members to lead SR accompanied by some experienced project staff in place. They have a high commitment to join together to run all remaining projects to achieve projects&#x2019; objectives/outcomes and improve organizational capacity as a whole. However, there are still some key challenges for SK to strengthen organizational development and financial management.      

To support SK to overcome these issues, SK will hire external consultants for supporting and coaching their management team both on organizational development and financial management. For organizational development, a consultant will conduct a need assessment to develop a series of training and coaching plan and prioritized them based on their needs. For financial management, a consultant will develop areas of focuses and action plan based on the need assessment. Also, some practical tools/templates for the internal implementation will be revisited and developed. The support is expected to run for 6 months and could be extended depending on reasonable inquiries.   

The project objectives are:
- To improve SK organisational capacity through strengthening leadership and management so that they can overcome challenges and each role in the organisation will be executed effectively.
- To strengthen SK capacity on financial management, so that policies, procedures and reporting are properly complied by all staff

It is an added value for CAFOD to help a local skilful partner partner during the critical time. By this support, SK will be reformed and will have future opportunities to use their skills and expertise to support rural communities in field of livelihood improvement and community development.</narrative>
