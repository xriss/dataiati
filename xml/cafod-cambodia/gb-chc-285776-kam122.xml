   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This is a project that will empower women through developing their skills in agriculture production and engaging in the market for their agriculture products. The project will strengthen skills of women in expanding their agri business, and support them to establish network with dealers and private sectors in order for them to have more market access.

Rural women in the target areas of Battambang and Siem Reap province have largely involved in agriculture producing food for their families and generating incomes from selling products from their small-scale farming. However, due to limited level of their education, women in the villages do not have much access to information, knowledge, and new experiences that are beneficial for them to improve their lives. As they are also primary family carers, women farmers are not able to have much mobility to look for and connect with big markets and dealers to sell their agriculture products. Therefore, the project will strengthen their capacity to improve their farming productivity and to improve their coordination and networking skills to connect and negotiate with buyers, and relevant private sector to trade agriculture products in the long run by themselves.

This project is considered as an exit strategy from the target communities and the partner. CAFOD is supporting this project as the last grant with the partner.</narrative>
