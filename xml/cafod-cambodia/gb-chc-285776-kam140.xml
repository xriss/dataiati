   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This is the second phase of community development project of a Church organization, KBO. The project target provinces are Kompong Chhnang, Pursat, Battambang, Banteay Meanchey, Siem Reap, and Kompong Thom. The project is to support smallholder farmers in target remote areas to gain knowledge and skills to develop sustainable agriculture techniques that enhance their livelihoods and resilience to climate change. The project has revealed that farmers in the areas of intervention have faced challenges in their agriculture such as poor physical infrastructure, limited irrigation and rural roads, inadequate access to farming skills, and the lack of opportunity to extend services. With these challenges, farmers could not produce more rice, especially in the dry season and could not implement better crops due to lack of skills on new farming technique and impact of climate change. 

To support communities, in the first phase, partner worked with different ways: 1. facilitating the creation of Self-Help Groups (SHGs) to let farmers work together, 2. promoting the new technique called System of Rice Intensification (SRI) that allows farmers to use less input and attain larger crops, 3. establishing a Demonstration and Training Farm (DTF) where  new techniques of sustainable farming have been studied, and 4. supporting the farmers with the commercialization of their products by setting up a Marketing Outlet and Caf&#xE9; on the National road, where farmers can showcase their products in the outlet to local and international buyers.  

Within project phase 2, partner has identified key aspects to be developed for the financial sustainability of the communities by supporting SHGs to be legal entities, recognised by Cambodian authorities as Agriculture Cooperatives (ACs) and supporting the ACs to develop business models and in the process of certification of the AC&#x2019;s organic products to allow the communities to get a premium price for their products in the market.</narrative>
