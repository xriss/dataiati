   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Cambodia CSP and Programme Review</narrative>
  </title>
  <description>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This is to support a review on Cambodia programme which have been implemented from 2017 up to date. Throughout the years of implementation, changes in programming approach and partnership have been put into place in order to ensure relevance and effective use of resources to response to real needs of target communities. In addition to programme reflection that the team conducts internally each year, this review will provide an external and independent view on strategy, Cambodia programme, and partnership portfolio. This review happens at a time that CAFOD is embarking on a new strategic framework, so this will be a great opportunity to reflect on the current programme and identify potential areas for alignment in order to inform future programme design and management. 

The aim is to develop Cambodia programme through strategic reflection on programme performance, partnership portfolio, and local country context to uplift quality and alignment to the new strategic framework on Our Common Home. Some specific objectives of the review are:

 - To assess the performance of programme towards delivering CAFOD mission and programme&#x2019;s intended outcomes and identify lesson learnt for future programme management and design
 - To identify the extend to which safeguarding, gender, and advocacy have been integrated into programme and projects
 - To demonstrate achievements, areas of strength of the programme, as well as areas of improvement
 - To review partnership portfolio, values of each partner, and identify challenges or gaps, if any (for example, advocacy), that inhibit realisation of strategic outcomes
 - To analyse programme areas that are aligned to the new strategic framework and new opportunities that can be introduced into the programme

An external consultant will be commissioned to carry out this strategic review assignment with support from CAFOD programme team. CAFOD will facilitate arrangements for consultations with local partners and target communities.</narrative>
