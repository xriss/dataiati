  </title>
  <description>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project is to support a new partner, PKH, to design a three-year project on community natural resources management of community people in Preah Vihear province. Through the project design process poor target communities will be empowered to involve in project design process and participate in decision making by putting their initiative action plan into project development to ensure their prioritized needs will be solved through project implementation. 
Partner has proposed an initial study in different communities where there have natural resources especially forest surrounded, and community people who are living there are mostly indigenous groups. From day to day, the communities have faced some challenges on forest clearance, forestland encroachment, illegal logging, and wildlife hunting by outsiders and companies. It has affected community people daily needs who are relying on surrounded community natural resources. In order to understand deeply on the issues and real needs of community people, the study will use the people led development approach (PLD) that provide opportunity to all community groups and local authorities to involve in the whole process of project study  from problem analysis to develop their own initiative action plan based on their own capacity and resources.
In response to CAFOD strategy-OCH, it is an approach that CAFOD invests time and resources for holistic, rigorous analysis and design leading to integrated, multi-year and multi-stakeholder programmes. It is also a CAFOD added value that invests time and resources for local partners to lead analysis and design with community and stakeholders to ensure that the project will respond to community needs. 
In term of learning and sharing resources among stakeholders, partner staffs who have participated in this project design process will document their experiences and lesson learnt from this design process to share within their organisation and other CAFOD partners to increase design process for all future projects.</narrative>
