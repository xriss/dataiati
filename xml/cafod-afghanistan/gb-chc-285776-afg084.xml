  </title>
  <description>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The convergence of conflict, drought and COVID-19 has left thousands of people in Afghanistan unable to meet their basic needs and survive the winter with dignity. In the target region of Daikundi 18,863 people have been displaced, while at the same time the province is hosting 18,778 IDPs and within Takhar there are 35,522 IDPs. In Samangan, 17,255 people have left the region and 17,645 IDPs have come from other provinces (OCHA ). Already in 2020, almost half of the population of Afghanistan lived in poverty. Currently, 22.8 million people are at risk of hunger, and about 3.2 million children under the age of 5 suffer from acute malnutrition (WFP).

The project regions Daikundi (with a population of 686,593 people) and Samangan (with a population of 572,253), are currently particularly hard hit by the effects of the drought. All harvests have declined significantly due to conflict and the weather conditions in 2021. While Daikundi&#x2019;s agricultural backbone is growing almonds, Samangan is heavily dependent on rain-fed agriculture and livestock farming. 

As well as the drought, the pandemic, and the international sanctions after the de facto takeover by the Taliban led to a breakdown of local markets and (trans)national supply chains, which destroyed the livelihood and income opportunities of many families while at the same time the cost of food and non-food items continued to rise considerably between August and December 2021. Additionally, there is a financial crisis in which the first private banks have ceased operations. These socio-political upheavals of the last few months have led to a drop in income which also threatens the livelihoods of communities in both regions. 

The project objective is to ensure the survival of the most vulnerable families in Samangan, Daikundi and Takhar provinces who are acutely affected by food insecurity and the effects of winter through the provision of cash for food and winterisation.</narrative>
