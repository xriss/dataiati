   <narrative xml:lang="EN">II. To what extent has the project contributed to the National Plans? 
The 3-year project &#x201C;You have a right, a choice&#x2026;Claim it!&#x201D; commissioned in 2019 by the Embassy of the Netherlands to the King Hussein Foundation (KHF) aims to increase knowledge and awareness on women&#x2019;s rights through mobilizing knowledge, service delivery and advocacy with a focus on the right of women and girls to live a life free of violence. Through KHF two community centered, women focused institutes including the Information Research Centre (IRCKHF) and the Institute for Family Health (IFH in addition to disability-related activities implemented by the project&#x2019;s partner I am Human for people with Disability, the project will build on existing national strategies in support of gender equality and women&#x2019;s rights. It aims to educate women on their rights in healthcare, psychosocial empowerment and social support, and women rights in marriage contracts

Upon the competition of the 3-year project, society portioners and human rights stakeholders will be more aware of how Muslim marriage contract can be a tool for prevention of gender-based violence and domestics violence. Moreover, cases of violations to women with disabilities will be monitored documented and reported in multiple platforms to advocate for the protection of women from all forms of gender-based violence. Four GBV centers of excellence (COE) will be developed to become certified GBV centers and women safe spaces and youth friendly hubs accessible to all women and youth including people with disabilities. These centers will provide primary health care and psychosocial services to mitigate consequences of GBV. The project will also lead a national awareness campaign to change attitudes and influence change amongst the community and decision makers on the rights of women including women with disability and contribute to the global efforts to end GBV. 

All the above results will contribute to achieve objectives of various national plans including the 2020-2025 National Strategy for Women&apos;s which aims to ensure a society free of all forms of GBV and discrimination, in which women and girls can realize their full human rights and have equal opportunities to achieve inclusive and sustainable development; the 2018-2021  Jordanian National Action Plan that aims to advance the implementation of the UN Security Council resolutions on Women, Peace and Security by the year 2021, the Comprehensive National Plan for Human Rights (2016-2025) that aims to enhance and protect Women Rights to enjoy their rights in conforming to justice and equal opportunities. According to the National Centre for Family affairs (NCFA)- there is limited access to GBV services in Jordan due to lack of knowledge of services, rights and lack of power amongst women and girls -a matter related to cultural constraints.  Through the awareness campaign and the GBV CoE , the project will raise awareness on available services delivered by all family protection providers, with a specific focus on legal, psychological, social, and protection aid services for women and children at risk of violence.

Through the KHF&#x2019;s strategic partnership with the National Team for Family Protection against Violence, women rights organizations and human rights activists, the project will unify efforts among all sectors and partners to prevent and address the phenomenon of GBV in our society, and to secure the accessibility of protection services for the most vulnerable groups especially in light of the economic and social pressures imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic. &#x201C;You have a right, a choice&#x2026;Claim it!&#x201D; is also in line with Jordan&#x2019;s Response Plan (JRP) to strengthen protection systems in order to address the social and protection needs of vulnerable segments and the provision of quality protection services and interventions. Following &#x201C;Leave no one behind&#x201D; approach, beneficiaries of all segments including refugees will have access to all the services provided by the project including the healthcare services and psychosocial support provided by the GBV centers of Excellence.</narrative>
