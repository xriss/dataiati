   <narrative xml:lang="EN">1.1 A Knowledge, Attitude and Practices (KAP) survey on women&#x2019;s legal right to add stipulations and conditions in their marriage contract

A mixed-methods national study was conducted on the knowledge, attitudes, and practices of people towards stipulations in Muslim marriage contracts in Jordan.  In 2020 a legislative review and literature review were conducted, along with &#x2018;A Historical Reading of Marriage Contracts and the Jordanian Personal Status Law&#x2019; (this paper was prepared by the project consultant and technical committee member Dr. Sara Ababneh). The aim of the paper is to provide historical information on marriage contracts and the findings can be used during the media campaign. (Attached: historical reading paper).  The research tools were designed for the qualitative and quantitative research components had been designed in year 1 and in year 2 were reviewed by the technical committee and the procurement began for the surveying company in the beginning of 2021. 

The Quantitative Research: 

The subcontracted company WeFiled conducted the data collection between January and March 2021, with 2,650 respondents. The telephonic survey is nationally representative, covering all 12 governorates of Jordan.  Oin the 22nd of March 2021, findings were presented to the projects technical committee &#x2013; the project Management unit, Dr. Hayel Daoud, the Sharia consultant (Shari&#x2019;a Professor at the University of Jordan), Dr. Salma Nims from the Jordanian National Commission for Women (JNCW), Dr. Sara Ababneh Assistant Professor at the University of Jordan&apos;s Center for Strategic Studies. Based on the discussion, Wefield conducted further analysis. (Attached: Presentation of quantitative findings.)

Qualitative Research: 

Key informant interviews were conducted with 5 religious experts and policy makers. The interviews aimed to explore the current practices and attitudes regarding marriage contracts and the challenges faced in terms of practical application. (Annex 1: report of key findings from KIIs)
The IRCKHF team designed the tools for the qualitative portion of the research based on the research design (to cover those components that weren&#x2019;t covered in the quantitative) as well as to build explore in further depth based on the quantitative findings. The research included over 20 in-depth interviews and 12 focus group discussions. The qualitative research for marriage contracts (IDIs and FGDs) was initially planned to take place between February and April 2021. However, due to the health situation and following the government&#x2019;s regulations, no data collection activities took place in the field during those months. As a result, the qualitative data collection was conducted In July and August. 
To clarify, in order not to delay the research, IRCKHF decided that the quantitative survey would be carried out over the phone, and not include any questions that may bring harm to the respondent. The more sensitive questions and issues were kept for the qualitative component, which has to be conducted face-to-face in the field.  Further details about the process ca be found below:

&#x2022;	In depth interviews and focus group discussion tools were finalized and presented to the technical committee. The qualitative tools were approved by an Institutional Review Board at the Jordanian University for Science and Technology for ethical considerations. A data collection plan was developed and implemented.
&#x2022;	The field work of focus groups and individual interviews was coordinated in all the governorates. A qualitative research sample was prepared based on the contact lists obtained through the quantitative research and direct coordination with civil society organizations.
&#x2022;	The team of researchers were all trained in both the IDI and FGD tools. To avoid further delays to the data collection the transcriptions of the interviews and focus group discussions were outsourced.
&#x2022;	Focus group discussions and individual interviews were completed in all governorates.  26 in depth Interviews and 12 Focus Group Discussions 
&#x2022;	A qualitative data analysis plan to analyze the data through Atlas.ti program is currently being implemented.

GBV Research for project:

Based on the findings of the comprehensive literature and legislative review on gender-bases violence against women and girls with disabilities, there was a need to develop policies to ensure women and girls with disabilities&#x2019; access to justice. Therefore, the project team worked on developing a policy paper on &quot; Gender-based violence and discrimination against women and girls with disabilities: access to justice in Jordan&#x201D;. 

The policy paper was finalized and shared with project partners in a round table session to review the results of this paper, discuss the observations and derive recommendations in their final form before being presented at the policy paper launch event. An institution specialized in design and printing was selected to design this paper in both Arabic and English languages in addition to braille language. 
Launch of the Policy Paper:  

The paper was launched on 18 October 2021 at the land mark Hotel ( accessible for people with disability) with the attendance of more than 90 representatives from the embassy of the Netherlands , ministries, civil society organizations including Disabled People&apos;s Organizations  who work with survivors of GBV from various governorates of the Kingdom, , media representatives, human rights advocates in addition to the project partners including the Higher Council Higher Council for the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, the Higher population council, the National Council for Family Affairs, the Jordanian National Commission for Women who had a role in revising and presenting the policy paper during the launch.
In this event, a presentation was made about the policy paper and the recommendations with a focus on four themes: 1) access to information and awareness, 2) legislation, 3) policies and strategies and 4) access to justice. Following a discussion session during which attendees shared their observations and interventions, working groups were held to review the recommendations and come up with further recommendations and feedback as to whom each of the recommendation should be targeted to for implementation.

The event was livestreamed and broadcast of social media channels. Sign language interpretation was facilitated along with a translation from Arabic to English was provided to make this event available in both languages and as a reference for those interested in this field. The policy paper is available in Arabic and English and was also printed inBraille language. (Annex 2: Policy Paper).


An awareness campaign is in process of design to enhance knowledge and awareness on rights of people with disabilities based on the findings of the policy. The main outputs of the awareness campaign which will be implemented during the second quarter of the 3rd year of the project will include the following: 

1.	 Video graphics / animations to raise awareness on rights of people with disabilities. The animation will highlight true stories documented during the first and second year of the project.
2.	A short educational documentary film to raise awareness among youth and the community at large on the adversities of violence against women and girls with disabilities.
3.	Media posts in the form of infographs that will be developed based on the results of the policy paper and published in the social media channels. 
4.	A song for disability rights &#x2013; the lyrics of the song will be written by some of the beneficiaries of the project with their participation if possible.</narrative>
