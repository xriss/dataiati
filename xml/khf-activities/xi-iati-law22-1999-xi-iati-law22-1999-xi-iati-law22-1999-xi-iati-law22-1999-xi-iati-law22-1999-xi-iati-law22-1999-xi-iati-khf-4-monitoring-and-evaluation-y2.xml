   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Monitoring and evaluating implementation of the project is conducted throughout the life cycle of the project to review the progress of the planned activities and ensure goals and objectives are achieved as planned and reassess and adjust if needed. Through various meetings and communication via email and phone, and later during the quarantine period through online communication tools (Skype /zoom/teams) with the Monitoring and Evaluation specialist in the PMU, an evaluation plan in line with the project proposal and action plan to be used as way to track the progress of the project was designed. The plan includes different elements such as relevant outputs indicators, indicators grids with columns designed to show any disaggregation required and mean of verification, source of information used to collect the indicator, person responsible for data collection, when the indicator should be collected, how often the indicator should be collected, baseline and target distributed over three years 2020,2021,2022). 

&#x2022;	Evaluation of the ongoing provision of services to the general public in Sweileh, Karak, Zarqa and Ajloun: 

Evaluation on the satisfaction of beneficiaries with the service provided, and psychological and social improvement were conducted at the relevant centers of excellence utilizing a beneficiary satisfaction survey developed by the MEAL Department at the Institute for Family Health, to figure out how survivors experience the provided service, which helps in understanding what is well implemented, what needs to be improved, and what are the challenges. 
In order to provide unbiased responses and to mitigate the risk of manipulating the data and information, especially when the tool is administered orally, it is desirable that the person administering the survey is not the case coordinator who manages the case, thus the satisfaction survey is filled electronically by the case manager supervisor through one-to-one interview with the cases of another case manager supervisor in the same location or in another location without disclosing any personal data related to the case where the case&#x2019;s personal data is anonymized using a unique code for each case, data then is collected and analyzed by the Monitoring and Evaluation Department to measure the cases&#x2019; level of satisfaction with the quality of services provided within the GBV program. 

The case manager supervisor fills out the questionnaire using tablet device to measure the satisfaction of the beneficiaries with the service after receiving the initial and follow-up sessions. The case&#x2019;s code and case coordinator information are included in the template so that information can be tracked if corrective measures are required to address identified weaknesses and deficiencies.
Furthermore, the Monitoring and Evaluation Officer analyses the data and sends the results to the Gender-based Violence program manager and the Project Manager for follow-up and corrective action. 

A total of over 400 cases filled the satisfaction surveys in all the four centers (Sweileh, Zarqa, Karak and Ajloun) prior implementation of the workplans of the Centers of Excellence (COE). A post survey with a sample of 400 cases will be filled following the completion of the implementation of the workplans and accreditation to measure the level of satisfaction. The results will be analyzed and share with the project manager and GBV technical supervisor.

The Hopkins&apos; assessment of anxiety and depression for measuring changes in psychosocial wellbeing in terms of anxiety and depression for gender-based violence is also utilized to track the level of improvement of the GBV survivors before, during and after the intervention. The Hopkins pre assessment was used before sessions begin with the survivor as a fundamental value of the post assessment, then Hopkins&#x2019;s post assessment is applied in two stages, the first stage takes place after 3 months, when the survivor trusts the case coordinator, and the second stage is conducted after 6 months to measure the improvement of GBV cases.

Number of GBV cases who were pre-assessed using Hopkins&#x2019;s, post assessed for 3-month point, and 6-month point (final evaluation), are shown in the below table:


	Total cases pre-assessed	Average pre-assessment	Total cases first post- assessed	Average first post-assessed	Total Cases second Post-assessed	Average second post-assessed
Zarqa	99	2.76	61	2.13	29	1.46
Karak	220	2.2	136	1.7	113	1.6
Ajloun	83	2.2	58	1.7	22	1.4
Sweileh	109	2.5	33	1.8	

&#x2022;	A social return on Investment (SROI)
Through communication with the project partners, it has been unanimously agreed that the integration of music into the treatment plan for battered women, which was presented by the specialists at the Institute for Family Health, was one of the activities that had a tangible impact on beneficiaries battered women from Ajloun, Karak, Zarqa, and Sweileh. 
Introductory meetings were held with the project management unit and the institute for family health to assess the social impact of the music sessions provided by the National Music Conservatory in the four governorates. IRCKHF reviewed the documentation of this intervention and commenced the field research. Through individual interviews, partners found that group music therapy sessions created an atmosphere of trust and safety, and attendees felt comfortable participating in activities of a new nature to them. Engaging in simple musical activities with a specific goal contributed to lowering their anxiety and stress levels and replacing these negative factors with joy, hope and positivity. Moreover, these interventions contributed to improving their self-image, self-esteem and confidence, as well as helping them to control and stabilize their emotions. In the long term, these musical interventions can also help them form social bonds that are more open to new experiences. IRCKHF team developed the scope of work framework and communicated with Social Value UK to obtain their guidance which will enable us to start the data collection phase and write the social impact report</narrative>
