A technical committee of 10 members from technical and managerial team sharing the experience and following the process for the center&#x2019;s accreditation was established to monitor the implementation of the work plan and recommendations highlighted in the reassessment&#x2019;s reports.

(Annex 3 shows that institutional approach of IFH in terms of GBV). 

&#x2022;	IFH-MEAL policy in dealing with GBV cases: IFH developed a policy which indicates all the SOPs that must be taken into consideration while monitoring and evaluation; for example, in the monitoring part, the MEAL focal point used to monitor the indicators of each activity through:
1.	Monitor the reports submitted by the assigned focal point in terms of number of beneficiaries and number of sessions provided.
2.	Follow up on the activities held within the program, which include workshops and awareness campaigns, activities in terms of the number of workshops held, the number of attendees, and ensuring the correct documentation of the data taking into consideration the confidentiality and privacy.
3.	Follow up on the capacity building program held within the gender-based violence program in terms of t number of trainings held, the number of attendees, the report submitted by the trainer.
4.	Follow up the plans of the departments / centers with regard to the achievements of activities related to GBV programs and send a periodic report that includes feedback on the indicators&#x2019; achievement, the extent to which the desired goal has been achieved, the percentage of achievement.
