   <narrative xml:lang="EN">1.1 A Knowledge, Attitude and Practices (KAP) survey on women&#x2019;s legal right to add stipulations and conditions in their marriage contract will be conducted to measure the extent of awareness amongst women and girls that they are entitled to make stipulations in the marriage contract; a right guaranteed to women by the constitution and assailable by Personal Status Law &#x2013; Article 19. Surveys focus group discussions, and in-depth interviews with male and female respondents will be conducted.

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The output of this activity is to release a KAP study and conduct 12 focus group sessions, 15 in-depth interviews and fill in questionnaires with a sample of 1200 women and girls. Work is in progress to achieve the outputs, but changes to the time plan has been made and work will continue during the second year of the project due to the following reasons: 1) the unforeseen outbreak of the COVID -19 pandemic and its impact on mobility to conduct the Focus group sessions and in-depth interviews, 2) a recommendation by all partners to double the sample of the survey from 1200 to 2500 to be nationally representative of both men and women. 

KAP Survey :Because such a large sample is not within the capacity of the research implementing partner, KHF procured and outsourced an organization with strong quantitative research skills and experience to conduct the quantitative survey. A representative sample was purchased from the Department of Statistics (DOS) for the marriage contracts KAP survey &#x2013; 2,500 households in the North, Center and South of Jordan. A procurement process abiding by KHF policy took place in the form of releasing a tender in the newspaper on 16 August 2020. Six companies submitted technical and financial proposals. As per the procurement policy KHF technical and financial committee met on and reviewed the tenders. Only 3 companies passed the technical scoring, yet their financial offers were above the allocated budget. An amendment to the procurement process was made to accommodate the need of carrying out the survey by telephone as opposed to face-to-face. Wefield Company was selected based on their offer. IRCKHF and Wefield signed a contract on 22 October and conducted a kickoff meeting. The quantitative component began  in October 2020, and end in December 2020. The qualitative will run in parallel, and the data analysis will take place in early 2021.

Development of Marriage Contracts survey themes and questions: Following the development of the first draft of the survey, two online meetings were held with the project consultants&#x2013; Dr. Salma Nims from JNCW, Dr. Sara Ababneh from CSS, and Dr. Hayel Daoud, the Sharia consultant (Shari&#x2019;a Professor at the University of Jordan) &#x2013; as well as the PMU, Wefield and the IRCKHF team. The survey questions were revised, discussed and amended. The final survey was sent to Wefield.</narrative>
