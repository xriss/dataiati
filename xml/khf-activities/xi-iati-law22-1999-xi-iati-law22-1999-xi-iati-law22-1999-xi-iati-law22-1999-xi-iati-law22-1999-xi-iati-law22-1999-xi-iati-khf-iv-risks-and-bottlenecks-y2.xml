The outbreak of COVID 19 was indeed an unexpected obstacle. During the first phase and specifically the legal review of the existing policies, regulations instructions and legislations about marriage contracts, GBV and PWD, the risk was very low as most of the assignments were online. However, with the progress of the project and implementation in the field, the COVID-19 pandemic has brought about additional risks, especially in the conducting of field research (namely surveys, focus group discussions and in-depth interviews which delayed the qualitative and quantitative research of the marriage contracts component, from year 1 to year 2. 

Given the outbreak of the COVID -19 Pandemic and as part of the KHF contingency plan,
all relevant reporting templates were shared with the partners and uploaded on Microsoft Office Teams -Office 365. an online presentation on how to utilize Teams was developed by KHF IT Manager and was circulated amongst all project team members along with continuous technical support throughout the day. All employees are provided with laptops and any additional equipment needed to successfully complete their tasks from if needed. All project- related files and correspondences are uploaded on TEAMS thus allowing continued remote access regardless of location. 

Identified project tasks which might be postponed or adjusted during the time of the pandemic has been revised and measure have been taken to develop multiple implementation scenarios that take into account various assumptions and aim to understand the effect of change in the project, thus review all aspects of the project. For example, trainings and sessions can be conducted online or divided to include limited number of people (not to exceed 8 persons in one room ensuring social distancing).

Should the above restriction continue during the second year of the project, KHF will rely on digital services and existing resources in finding creative solutions to work around such hurdles. KHF will ensure continuous engagement with partners and stakeholders in order to collaborate and coordinate on broader planning efforts. 


Through the national survey, it was found that 5% of the sample inserted stipulations in their marriage contracts. In qualitative research, we tried to expand conducting individual interviews with women and men who inserted stipulations in their marriage contracts despite their small percentage across the governorates of the Kingdom. However, the number of women and men who collaborated and responded to the research team&apos;s invitation for individual interviews was relatively low. The research team resorted to the snowball sampling method, where a woman/man who made stipulations in the marriage contract refers another woman/man, but the response was weak. However, the research team finds that the number of interviews carried out with this group provided information that enriches the qualitative research. Following the launch of the awareness campaign, we may face risks related to community&#x2019;s misunderstanding of the campaign&#x2019;s objectives. For example, community members may misunderstand the campaign objective and think that it encourages divorce or that there is a tendency to give more rights to women compared to men. The campaign management will deal with these risks as they occur.</narrative>
