       <narrative xml:lang="EN">The activity was done as planned and target achieved.
Since school closed, many children were involved in fishing. Many boys accompanied fishermen into the lake for deep fishing. As a result boys got sexually exploited as they sought accommodation in the deep waters islands. Some fishermen sexually exploited these boys in exchange of food since fishing took more than a week. Most of these boys are orphaned, child headed households and others come from very poor background where they need to support the family with meeting their basic needs.   The project together with DCS and local chiefs have been able to follow up with the children through continuous home visits to asses their well being as well as continue with the counseling services.;</narrative>

It emerged that many participants were not aware on the procedures to be followed once a child has been sexually abused. Most of them provide counseling services before the child could receive medical support and reporting the case to the police. The project team together with DCS saw the need for further training of local CSO on how to handle victims of CSEC and the reporting mechanism;</narrative>

The project team was engaged in 2 radio talk shows at Bulala FM. During the talk shows the project team together with the Children Officer sensitized the community on the need to protect their children against all forms of exploitations including CSEC. The community was also sensitized on where to report cases of CSEC whenever they occur and the correct procedure to follow when the abuse has happened. The local chief got the opportunity to also inform the community to report all cases of child sexual exploitation to his office, police or nyumba kumi.;</narrative>

The underspent is because of savings in exchange rates. 30 community members around the lake were sensitized on the negative effects of CSEC and its manifestations. As a result of the training many cases were able to be reported especially those of boys that are rarely reported. It was also agreed that the area chief will include one Beach Management Committee member in the Local Area Advisory Council where issues of children are discussed;</narrative>

This included school levies that supported their lunch feeding programme increasing their concentration level at school and their school attendance. This has consequently improved their academic performance. The prolonged schools closure due to COVID exposed children to abuse and exploitations increasing the need for educational support;</narrative>

This is an ongoing activity 50 Project families that were adversely affected by COVID 19 by losing their livelihoods were supported with cash transfers of Ksh 2000/- for 7 months. These funds are helping the families to purchase food stuff lowering our beneficiaries from falling victims of CSEC. These families have also been supported with face masks to prevent the spread and protect our beneficiaries from COVID 19 pandemic.
The families are however still in camps since their houses were destroyed. These families are asking for support in reconstructing their houses to be able to have a roof again. The project recommends the partner TdH-NL to support these families re start off their lives by supporting them with basic building materials;</narrative>
