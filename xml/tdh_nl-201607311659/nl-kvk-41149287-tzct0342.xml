       <narrative xml:lang="EN">KIWOHEDE in collaboration with SAUT law school organised and conducted legal aid sessions to the  children sheltered at DIC and those out of the center.
Up to this reporting period a total of six (6) legal mobile sessions were conducted to the established centers i.e 1 at Nyamanoro ward , 1 at  Kisesa ward, 2 at  Nyanguge ward ,  and 2 other sessions were conducted during the sensitization meetings in Mkolani and Kisesa wards  reaching 63 (51Girls,12Boys) children victims  of CTM and 22 parents  (17F,5M).

KIWOHEDE/TdH in collaboration with 18 Police Officers made follow ups to the  8 filed cases at various Police stations within the 12 Project wards as follows: (6 cases at Igogo Police Station, 1 case at Nyakato Police station and 1 case at  Kisesa Police Station). 
 
Achievements 
Among the eight (8) filed cases ,1 case filed at Nyakato Police Station with RB number  NY/RB/1457/2020 its initial investigation at destination has been completed while the investigation to children origin/parents is underway. 
No case is closed, all other seven cases are still  at the initial investigation stage.

Challenges
Lack of  fund for the investigation of  CTM cases
The lacunae in law against trafficking in person (The Ant Trafficking in Person Act no 6 of 2008),an Attempt to trafficking is not criminalized.
In some police stations(Misungwi and Kisesa) the trained Police officers on CTM issues have been  transferred to other Police stations and replaced by new one who are yet to be trained.

Recommendations
To continue lobbying the government through the Anti Trafficking Secretariat for the review of the Anti Trafficking in Person Act no 6 of 2008 in order to accomodate the offense of an attempt to human trafficking.
To continue training law enforcers and keep on the regular follow up on the filed cases in order to push the  investigation.;</narrative>
