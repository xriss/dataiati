However, 2(girls) dropped out, the reasons for the drop out is still not known as neither the parents, teachers nor community child protection committees are aware of it. The project team did consult the Department of children service and local administrators to support in tracing the drop out children as they were not at their homes which warrant security concerns. The project surpassed the target by 180%, this was because we achieved previous quarter targets of 30. Moreover, the Child protection committee was very instrumental in identification and referrals of the younger survivors who helped to speed up the process.;</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">612 children (232b and 380g) were trained on life skills, child rights, sexual exploitation, legal instruments, and running of clubs. From the children, the training was useful as it provided them with information of where to report cases, their roles and responsibilities as change agents. As a result, 4 peer to peer sessions were conducted in 2 schools reaching 114(75girls, 49boys). The children committed to conduct more peer-to-peer sessions in schools and at the community level to protect other children from sexual exploitation. The under expenditure on this line was due to peer-to-peer sessions that kicked off late in the quarter.  10 sessions translating to more expenditure will be featured in the coming quarter.;</narrative>

There is improvement in the confidence and public speaking among the peer educators as they disseminated the trained topic with ease.  The pending sessions are expected to continue in next quarters in all the 20 schools. The delays in achieving the targets was attributed to late start of the peer to peer sessions which was as a result of late training of club members leading in conducting peer to peer sessions.;</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">A two-day training to 194 Child Protection Committees members (112 female and 82 male) in Kwale and Kilifi was done.  The training focused on child rights and child protection, sex trafficking, and sexual exploitation of children and prevention and protection, identification of and anti-trafficking advocacy skills for child survivors of sex trafficking. In the discussions, the majority of participants admitted that sexual exploitation of children is an issue of concern in their communities and needs to be addressed. Participants pointed out that child sex trafficking is very rampant in the project areas, and many of these cases go unreported and thus resulting to denial of justice to the survivors. The activity was underbudgeted and the balance will be recovered in the next quarter.;</narrative>

Resulting from the CPC training, 14 proposed key messages conducted 14 dialogue sessions and some members supported the project team in the identification and referral of cases of sexual exploitation at the community as well as follow up to the already identified and supported children. An example is where a CPC member in Lungalunga and Msambweni reported 2 project participants who went missing. 250% variance is because of training 10 more structures which were not trained in the previous quarter.;</narrative>

The sessions focused on negative effects of sexual exploitation and measures to address it, while encouraging reporting to relevant channels including 116 the toll free line. Parents were urged to step up their responsibilities in bringing up their children. Consequently, the community members have started reporting cases of sexual exploitation, child trafficking and other child protection cases In other instances, fathers have started owning up to their responsibilities as they are now eager to support their children in the reintegration  process while participating in home visits sessions.The variance in the budget is due to procurement of IEC materials which had been planned for last quarter.;</narrative>

This will be implemented after the enrollment and completion of course for project participants in the vocational skills or apprenticeship. This is planned in subsequent quarters.

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">This activity was delayed pending completion of the Labor Market Assessment (LMA). The expenses incurred were for the 1st and 2nd installments payment for the LMA consultant, and for conducting the validation workshop. The variance in the amount is due to incomplete payment of the final installment to the LMA consultant and a private sector and academic stakeholders meeting not done due to LMA activity. The final payment for the consultant will be done after the final report and accelerated plan for activities pegged on LMA has been developed. to be implemented in subsequent quarters.;</narrative>

The referral mechanism highlights procedures of where the cases will be reported. In the school the trained teacher will be the focal person for reporting cases and will coordinate with the headteacher. Besides, the trained teachers managed to map out key service providers around their school where to report. These were, the Child protection volunteer, area chief, the sub county children Officer, Sub-county director of Education, and the nearest police post. It was agreed, all cases reported need to be documented and proper follow up will be done.The over targeted was because of training 39 (19F, 20M) teachers from 20 school, 10 in Kilifi and 10 in Kwale.;</narrative>

To strengthen and improve on the referral mechanism within the school, the project conducted training to 39(19F, 20M ) teachers from the 20 schools in the previous quarter, and trained 612 (232boys and 380 girls) children in the current quarter to increase the functionality of the referral in the 20 schools and at the community through identification, sensitizations and reporting.  The project also shared the existing contacts and referral points with the teachers and the children in school for ease of reporting and follow up. As a result 20 schools have established referral mechanisms. However the functionality is yet to be felt as no cases have been reported;</narrative>

In the current quarter, the 20 schools established  child rights clubs and  the club members  participated in life skills, legal instruments, and sexual exploitation training. The child rights club members from the 20 schools developed the awareness messages which were used during the commemoration of the World Day Against Trafficking in Persons.  It is expected the school will contribute in utilization and popularization of the existing referral mechanism and identify and report cases.;</narrative>

Teachers agreed that child rights clubs in schools will be established or revitalized since they are integral in enhancing children self esteem as well as sensitizations targeting other children on critical issues. The activity was initially under budgeted and the overspend will be recovered from the next quarter for the same activity.;</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">This activity was implemented and reported in the previous quarter where the project trained 39 (20 male and 19 female)  patrons from the 20 schools. In the current quarter, the patrons  coordinated the establishment of club activities i.e. peer to peer sessions, participation in the international days as chaperon, training of children and sensitizing children on the essence for reporting cases. Some club patrones were supportive in linking children to other service provision such as psychosocial support service for one of the project participants and providing basic guidance counselling to project participants in the schools. The underspent here was due to delayed peer to peer sessions by club members. This is planned for next quarter.;</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">A total 75 (66 girls, 9 boys) project participants in Kwale and Kilifi county were supported with school uniforms, dignity packs (two pieces of sanitary packs, tooth brush, tooth paste, bar soap, underwear), masks, and petroleum jelly), scholastic materials (ruler, exercise books, pencils, erasers and school bag) and cheques for school fees. The support has increased attendance of the children in school as they cannot miss the school. The gross under expenditure in this line is due to pending commitments to suppliers. Besides, during the design alot of budget was allocated for secondary school beneficiaries while the reality is  93% of beneficiaries supported are in primary school. The project will be monitoring the progress of the budget and re-allocate to other activities.;</narrative>
