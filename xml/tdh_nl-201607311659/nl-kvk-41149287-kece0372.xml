However, 2(girls) dropped out, the reasons for the drop out is still not known as neither the parents, teachers nor community child protection committees are aware of it. The project team did consult the Department of children service and local administrators to support in tracing the drop out children as they were not at their homes which warrant security concerns. The project surpassed the target by 180%, this was because we achieved previous quarter targets of 30. Moreover, the Child protection committee was very instrumental in identification and referrals of the younger survivors who helped to speed up the process.;</narrative>

The transition was as a result  a government directive which encouraged 100% transition of all learners in learning institutions in the County.12 (10girls, 2boys) did not manage to transition to the next level of education as they had not  attended class regularly thus not being able to conduct final exams. The reason for not attending class regularly was that some were pregnant, dropped out due to stigma and name calling and others had gone missing.;</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">Usually transition happens at the beginning of a new year. A change of school calendar shifted the transition phase from January to April meaning the supported beneficiaries are yet to transition. This will be reported in Q2 of 2022. However, the project continued to support the enrolled children with scholastic materials (uniforms, dignity packs and books) and follow-ups through school visits and home visits to assess the project beneficiary&#x2019;s academic performance, social integration and mentorship as this would also contribute to their academic performance hence transitioning to the next level.;</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">612 children (232b and 380g) were trained on life skills, child rights, sexual exploitation, legal instruments, and running of clubs. From the children, the training was useful as it provided them with information of where to report cases, their roles and responsibilities as change agents. As a result, 4 peer to peer sessions were conducted in 2 schools reaching 114(75girls, 49boys). The children committed to conduct more peer-to-peer sessions in schools and at the community level to protect other children from sexual exploitation. The under expenditure on this line was due to peer-to-peer sessions that kicked off late in the quarter.  10 sessions translating to more expenditure will be featured in the coming quarter.;</narrative>

The sessions focused on child rights, life skills, effects of sexual exploitation on children and how to report such cases using the established referral pathways. The change in school calendar due to covid 19 affected the project not to reach the targeted number as the school program was compressed. The project team will coordinate with schools and club members to conduct more sessions during break time, assemblies and games to reach the targeted number of sessions. The over expenditure was due spendings for the previous quarter as well as impact of the rise in transport cost and refreshments compared to the budgeted costs.;</narrative>

There is improvement in the confidence and public speaking among the peer educators as they disseminated the trained topic with ease.  The pending sessions are expected to continue in next quarters in all the 20 schools. The delays in achieving the targets was attributed to late start of the peer to peer sessions which was as a result of late training of club members leading in conducting peer to peer sessions.;</narrative>

In the reporting period, the project sustained coaching and mentorship to CPCs members who championed dialogue sessions, follow ups, tracing of missing children and as well as mobilization of participants in commemoration of international days like International day of the Girl Child. The cost reported was based on the carry over expenditure from the previous quarter. The cost supported the Directorate of children service with stationeries (toner and printing pacers) and airtime for data bundles which was to facilitate documenting of cases reported by CPC in the CPIMS.;</narrative>

The training focused on child rights and child protection, sex trafficking, and sexual exploitation of children and prevention and protection, identification of and anti-trafficking advocacy skills for child survivors of sex trafficking. In the discussions, the majority of participants admitted that sexual exploitation of children is an issue of concern in their communities and needs to be addressed. Participants pointed out that child sex trafficking is very rampant in the project areas, and many of these cases go unreported and thus resulting to denial of justice to the survivors. The activity was underbudgeted and the balance will be recovered in the next quarter.;</narrative>

Resulting from the CPC training, 14 proposed key messages conducted 14 dialogue sessions and some members supported the project team in the identification and referral of cases of sexual exploitation at the community as well as follow up to the already identified and supported children. An example is where a CPC member in Lungalunga and Msambweni reported 2 project participants who went missing. 250% variance is because of training 10 more structures which were not trained in the previous quarter.;</narrative>

The sessions focused on negative effects of sexual exploitation and measures to address it, while encouraging reporting to relevant channels including 116 the toll free line. Parents were urged to step up their responsibilities in bringing up their children. Consequently, the community members have started reporting cases of sexual exploitation, child trafficking and other child protection cases In other instances, fathers have started owning up to their responsibilities as they are now eager to support their children in the reintegration  process while participating in home visits sessions.The variance in the budget is due to procurement of IEC materials which had been planned for last quarter.;</narrative>

Out of the 7, 4 in motor vehicle mechanics, 3 in plumbing and electrical and 2 in cake baking and decoration. The under expenditure was due to the late admission of beneficiaries into TVET and apprenticeship following a delay by the LMA report. Furthermore, a lot of time was spent convincing the project participants to enroll in market driven courses shunning away from traditional courses discouraged by LMA findings. The enrollment of remaining children will be done in the next quarter.;</narrative>

These were, the Child protection volunteer, area chief, the sub county children Officer, Sub-county director of Education, and the nearest police post. It was agreed, all cases reported need to be documented and proper follow up will be done.The over targeted was because of training 39 (19F, 20M) teachers from 20 school, 10 in Kilifi and 10 in Kwale.;</narrative>

Since then, the trained patrons have championed for the coordination of establishment and the rolling of club activities not limited to peer-to-peer sessions, participation in the international days as chaperones, training of children and sensitizing children on the essence of reporting cases.  Some patrons have been very instrumental in linking children to targeted responsive services including referrals. The budget for this quarter was wrongly forecasted in Q4.
