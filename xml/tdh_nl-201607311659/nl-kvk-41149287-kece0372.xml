However, 2(girls) dropped out, the reasons for the drop out is still not known as neither the parents, teachers nor community child protection committees are aware of it. The project team did consult the Department of children service and local administrators to support in tracing the drop out children as they were not at their homes which warrant security concerns. The project surpassed the target by 180%, this was because we achieved previous quarter targets of 30. Moreover, the Child protection committee was very instrumental in identification and referrals of the younger survivors who helped to speed up the process.;</narrative>

The collaboration between teachers and CRC members on trained topics has contributed to child protection cases being reported through schools.;</narrative>

In the current quarter 20 child rights club members developed the awareness messages which were used during the commemoration of the World Day Against Trafficking in Persons and 2 clubs participated in the physical events and conducted awareness sessions on child rights, sexual exploitation through poems, guest speakers and masters of ceremonies.  Furthermore, the 20 clubs established are expected to continue to conduct sensitizations, develop messages and support in identification and referrals of sexual exploitation and child trafficking cases.;</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">612 children (232b and 380g) were trained on life skills, child rights, sexual exploitation, legal instruments, and running of clubs. From the children, the training was useful as it provided them with information of where to report cases, their roles and responsibilities as change agents. As a result, 4 peer to peer sessions were conducted in 2 schools reaching 114(75girls, 49boys). The children committed to conduct more peer-to-peer sessions in schools and at the community level to protect other children from sexual exploitation. The under expenditure on this line was due to peer-to-peer sessions that kicked off late in the quarter.  10 sessions translating to more expenditure will be featured in the coming quarter.;</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">In 2021, the project equipped 612 children (232 boys and 380 girls) child right club members with life skills, child rights, sexual exploitation, legal instruments, and running of clubs. Furthermore the training provided them with information on where to report cases, their roles and responsibilities as change agents. Between January and March 2022, the trained CRC members reached out to 1190 (506boys, 684 girls) children in schools through peer to peer sessions. A refresher training was planned in the quarter but due to the schools long holiday break from March, refresher training was pushed to the next quarter thus zero spending on the forecast.;</narrative>

The sessions focused on child rights, life skills, effects of sexual exploitation on children and how to report such cases using the established referral pathways. The change in school calendar due to covid 19 affected the project not to reach the targeted number as the school program was compressed. The project team will coordinate with schools and club members to conduct more sessions during break time, assemblies and games to reach the targeted number of sessions. The over expenditure was due spendings for the previous quarter as well as impact of the rise in transport cost and refreshments compared to the budgeted costs.;</narrative>

The training focused on child rights and child protection, sex trafficking, and sexual exploitation of children and prevention and protection, identification of and anti-trafficking advocacy skills for child survivors of sex trafficking. In the discussions, the majority of participants admitted that sexual exploitation of children is an issue of concern in their communities and needs to be addressed. Participants pointed out that child sex trafficking is very rampant in the project areas, and many of these cases go unreported and thus resulting to denial of justice to the survivors. The activity was underbudgeted and the balance will be recovered in the next quarter.;</narrative>

In the reporting period, the CPCs members continued to champion for change in social norms through dialogue sessions, follow-ups of the beneficiaries, providing basic guidance and tracing missing children in partnership with the Directorate of Children Services. The variance in expenditure was due to the planned output not taking place as the Directorate of children service were committed to other activities. The forecast was to support the Directorate&apos;s of children service strengthening child protection information management system through reporting and documenting data.

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">14 community child protection committee structures were established in 2021. In the reporting period, the 14 established structures conducted 58 community dialogue sessions. The sessions were on sex trafficking, child protection, with emphasis on ensuring caregivers/parents provide adequate care and a safe environment for their children, as well as encouraging parents to retain children in school. Parents were urged to keep a keen eye on their children, especially given the 2 months school break, which increases the risk of sexual exploitation and sex trafficking. The under expenditure of EURO 131.57 is due to uncompleted quarterly stakeholder review sessions. This will be implemented next quarter.;</narrative>

Resulting from the CPC training, 14 proposed key messages conducted 14 dialogue sessions and some members supported the project team in the identification and referral of cases of sexual exploitation at the community as well as follow up to the already identified and supported children. An example is where a CPC member in Lungalunga and Msambweni reported 2 project participants who went missing. 250% variance is because of training 10 more structures which were not trained in the previous quarter.;</narrative>

The sessions were on sex trafficking, child protection, with emphasis on ensuring caregivers/parents provide adequate care and a safe environment for their children, as well as encouraging parents to retain children in school. Parents were urged to keep a keen eye on their children, especially given the 2 months school break, which posses a risk of sexual exploitation and sex trafficking. This activity took place within the quarter against the plan because it is adjusted from the previous quarter. The over achievement in targets resulted from conducting more sessions in different locations thus reaching out to many people.;</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">642 (432female, 210 male) community members were reached through community dialogues sessions. The sessions focused on negative effects of sexual exploitation and measures to address it, while encouraging reporting to relevant channels including 116 the toll free line. Parents were urged to step up their responsibilities in bringing up their children. Consequently, the community members have started reporting cases of sexual exploitation, child trafficking and other child protection cases In other instances, fathers have started owning up to their responsibilities as they are now eager to support their children in the reintegration  process while participating in home visits sessions.The variance in the budget is due to procurement of IEC materials which had been planned for last quarter.;</narrative>

Out of the 7, 4 in motor vehicle mechanics, 3 in plumbing and electrical and 2 in cake baking and decoration. The under expenditure was due to the late admission of beneficiaries into TVET and apprenticeship following a delay by the LMA report. Furthermore, a lot of time was spent convincing the project participants to enroll in market driven courses shunning away from traditional courses discouraged by LMA findings. The enrollment of remaining children will be done in the next quarter.;</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">20 schools were trained on referrals mechanism, this resulted in the development of their internal referrals mechanism. The referral mechanism highlights procedures of where the cases will be reported. In the school the trained teacher will be the focal person for reporting cases and will coordinate with the headteacher. Besides, the trained teachers managed to map out key service providers around their school where to report. These were, the Child protection volunteer, area chief, the sub county children Officer, Sub-county director of Education, and the nearest police post. It was agreed, all cases reported need to be documented and proper follow up will be done.The over targeted was because of training 39 (19F, 20M) teachers from 20 school, 10 in Kilifi and 10 in Kwale.;</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project revitalised and established 20 schools in the previous quarter. To strengthen and improve on the referral mechanism within the school, the project conducted training to 39(19F, 20M ) teachers from the 20 schools in the previous quarter, and trained 612 (232boys and 380 girls) children in the current quarter to increase the functionality of the referral in the 20 schools and at the community through identification, sensitizations and reporting.  The project also shared the existing contacts and referral points with the teachers and the children in school for ease of reporting and follow up. As a result 20 schools have established referral mechanisms. However the functionality is yet to be felt as no cases have been reported;</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">A total 75 (66 girls, 9 boys) project participants in Kwale and Kilifi county were supported with school uniforms, dignity packs (two pieces of sanitary packs, tooth brush, tooth paste, bar soap, underwear), masks, and petroleum jelly), scholastic materials (ruler, exercise books, pencils, erasers and school bag) and cheques for school fees. The support has increased attendance of the children in school as they cannot miss the school. The gross under expenditure in this line is due to pending commitments to suppliers. Besides, during the design alot of budget was allocated for secondary school beneficiaries while the reality is  93% of beneficiaries supported are in primary school. The project will be monitoring the progress of the budget and re-allocate to other activities.;</narrative>
