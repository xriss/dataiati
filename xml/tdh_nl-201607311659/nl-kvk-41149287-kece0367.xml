       <narrative xml:lang="EN">During the baseline survey, respondents listed the following as barriers to access reproductive health; distance to the facility, lack of communication between youth and their parent, lack of information on the available services and how effective they are and lack of youth friendly centers and service providers. The reproductive health sessions were integrated during life skills sessions where youth were trained on available reproductive health services, where they can access them and why the service is important, communication among parent and partners was emphasized and the negotiation skills practiced. The issue of distance was discussed where youth were referred to the nearest health facility, on cost it was said that government facilities are cheaper.

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">The process involved identification of vocational training institutions within Naivasha and Gilgil and matching the courses the boys, girls and the youth had applied for during the registration process, this was further supported with the baseline data on the marketable courses, the institutions were introduced to CSEC project and discussions on how to tailor make the trainings to fit the duration of the training plus the market need. The institution will further sign a memorandum of understanding on the agreed number of students.
