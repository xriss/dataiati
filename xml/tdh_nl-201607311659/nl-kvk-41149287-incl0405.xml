Further project encouraged the communities to participate and mobilise the intensive fortnightly campaign &apos; Government at your door steps &apos;by the Government of Jharkhand.  In addition, after resuming of normalcy (after 2nd week of February 2022), project organized consultative sessions at block, district level with involvement of key stakeholders (with special mention of DLSAs in Koderma and Giridih districts).;</narrative>

The project resorted to informal and locatlised sessions (block level. district level) and small sessions at community level to inform about Government mainstream social welfare /social protection schemes. In addition, the project encouraged communities to attend Statewide campaign ( Government at Door step) to inform and facilitate increased access to outreach services/facilities.;</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">During the quarter 652 girls reached but only 417 were the new ones. The reason for excess utilization in the quarter is due to huge needs to strengthen pre school learning facilities both at institutional levels and community level (homebased ECE).The needs could be attributed to the fact that preschool learning facilities and service providers needed more support (capacity building as well as availability of teaching and learning materials - to create and strengthen child friendly and joyful learning environment. It was also one of the deliverable during the Phase 1 .0 (October 2021 to March 2022) and institutional pre school learning centered resumed activities for children from 2nd week of February 2022.;</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">The reason for less utilisation is due to  learning instituitions remained closed for learning/academic activities for children. The project has planned to equip the learning centers with agespecific TLMs (Teaching and Learning Materials) but could not be done. It shall be done in next qtr as learning centers are expected to resume normal functioning. However for younger children (3-6 years) the project promoted homebased ECE (to minimise the negative impact of COVID-19 on learning of young children through  Government mainstream learning center)  and it did not require any cost.;</narrative>
