  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">&amp;nbsp;
The need for this project is born out of experience in implementing interventions against OCSE in Kenya, which has witnessed an increase in online child sexual exploitation. The proposed intervention comes at a time when a lot of online learning is taking place due to closure of schools as a result of Covid-19.</narrative>

So far, 135 (81 girls and 54 boys) children have been rescued through out the project period. All these children have received counseling which is ongoing beyond the life of the project for some of them. Additional services provided include, legal support, medical support and educational support and placement into temporary safe shelters. 

Nine cases proceeded to court. Two of them were concluded. In one case the perpetrator was convicted while in the second case the perpetrators were acquitted. The rest of the cases are under investigation to gather facts of the case to inform the next steps with regard to legal support.;</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">10 mapping meetings were held to fast track this activity; 3 in Kisumu, 3 in Mombasa and 4 in Nairobi. It was agreed with the LEAs that more frequent meetings to attend to the identified cases and take action would be more productive. 
1. One play station and one villa were identified in Mombasa 
2. One play station, one cyber, one villa, one hall and 5 movie shops were also identified in Kisumu with suspicious activity.
3. Two cybers identified in Nairobi.
These cases have been referred to DCI to conduct in depth investigations to confirm the allegations and initiate prosecution where necessary.
Costs for case conferences, mapping meetings and IEC materials will be paid in Q4. Salary for Head of Programs was not paid for 2 months pending direction from TdH-NL on proposed reallocation.;</narrative>

In Kisumu:  1 villa and four open spots with free Wi-Fi where children gather to download movies and videos.
In Mombasa: 1 video den, 1 play station and 1 villa.
These cases have been referred to DCI for investigations to confirm the allegations and initiate prosecution where necessary.

The over expenditure  realized was due to the unutilized activity balances carried forward from the previous quarters.;</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">Three online abuse perpetrators were identified from the three project sites with one case from each county. All cases were reported to the police stations in the project sites. The case for Mombasa is in Shanzu law Courts while the other two are under investigation. Activities under this output facilitated the identification of cyberdens, private villas and movie shops. The monthly case conferencing meetings for April and May were not done due to late start of the project and delay in IEC materials development as well as mapping of perpetrators which was not done in Kisumu due to the covid-19 restrictions hence the under spend.;</narrative>

Salaries for Project officers have all been paid as well.

The over expenditure was due to the education  and scholastic materials support offered to children. This was carried forward from previous quarters and paid in quarter 4.;</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">Several virtual meetings have been held to discuss the most appropriate way to have online abusers identified tracked and stopped. The team agreed to engage a consultant to analyze the national legal framework in Kenya on the investigation and prosecution of OCSE cases. The first dissemination meeting was held where feedback was provided. The team shared the draft document with HO colleagues for their input as well. The next steps will be to develop the software and tools to be used by LEAs to conduct undercover investigations leading to arrest and prosecution of online sex offenders/pedophiles. First installment was paid in Q2 for the legal consultant, balance to be paid in Q3 once the assignment is complete.;</narrative>
