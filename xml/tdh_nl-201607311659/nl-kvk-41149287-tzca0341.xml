During the reporting period there was no case which was referred from the CSOs to ATFGM Masanga, this is because of the COVID 19 that most of the institution closed all of their activities.

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">a total of 39 Cases were filed with the police among these 9 cases are at the court and 30 cases are under investigation.  29 cases are FGM cases while the rest are other GBV cases, all of these cases were reported during the pandemic of COVID 19.  The community members used a period of movement cessation due to the COVID 19 outbreak  as an opportunity for them to mutilate the girls. The problem with these cases is that there are some political influences where some politicians try to interfere with the prosecution process, bail out the suspected perpetrators and intimidate the people who are willing to provide the witness. 
There were also some of the community members especially women coming to seek legal advice but it was difficult to help them because of Corona. These women are those who were identified last year and were facilitated with IGA and currently they are engaging with small business but also they help us in giving information on GBV issues happening in the society.;</narrative>
