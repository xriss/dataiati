The 39% over expenditure for the quarter was caused by the shift in activities planned for the quarter implementation. It so happens that activity 1 under output 2 was planned to be conducted in quarter 2 but rather shifted and conducted in quarter one. This led to a rise by 39% of the planned expenditure for the quarter. However, the funds that were overspent will be deducted during implementation of activity 2 to cover up the over-expenditure and to meet the target.;</narrative>
