  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">18% funding from&amp;nbsp;Global Giving campaign led by RO Asia (raised in 2017). This 3 month bridge project, extension of project KHCA0215, aims to build and implement a sustainability strategy for the interventions that have been developed by the first project: educational support, awareness on SRH and behavioural change through C4D with child clubs. It aims to showcase approach implemented by TdH-NL in Mondulkiri, a territory largely marginalized re:development efforts, and attract potential donors. After implementing a similar project in Ratanakiri, UNICEF is assessing the possibility to expand to Mondulkiri in 2021 in the context of the development of a Provincial Action Plan to tackle ECM.

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">The initial plan of facilitating end of project sessions with children and youth volunteers and  commune-level authorities to encourage the inclusion of prevention of ECM in commune-level plans and budgets could not happen because of restrictions linked to COVID-19. Alternatively, community facilitators had individual conversations with commune chiefs. According to these interviews, all  4 communes have integrated child marriage into their plans for 2022. One commune has allocated the budget and the other 3 communes are still in process of requesting budget allocations.;</narrative>
