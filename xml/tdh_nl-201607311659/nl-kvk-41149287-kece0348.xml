The over expenditure is as a result of the Subcounty AAc&apos;s training for the three counties which was done in this quarter yet it was planned in Q3. There was a delay in the training of county AACs since the training had to be rescheduled due to covid &apos;19 surge set at the project sites county;</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">During the reporting period, dialogue forums with community groups and community resource persons together with sensitization of teachers on the approved manuals were held  in all the Counties. The training of teachers on the manuals came in handy as a sustainability approach that teachers can use to continue supporting children. Social media was also used to sensitize the public on OCSE, this led to reaching higher numbers of people. The use of the AMANI videos to raise awareness by Community Resource Persons was also a plus to the project.
Social media engagements has been done but the payments is done in bits and not lumpsum hence the low burn rate.;</narrative>

Once the county NPA consultations are concluded, ISPs will be taken through the developed NPA on COP to enable them come up with Standard Operating procedures that ensure the safety of children whenever they use their platforms
