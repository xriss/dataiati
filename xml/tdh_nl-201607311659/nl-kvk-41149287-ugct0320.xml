CSOs under the Girls Advocacy Alliance were collaborated with in the commemoration of the Day of the African Child. We have worked with 3 CSOs in Napak (NACRAN) to commemorate the Day of the African child, and 13 CSOs under CATIP Uganda (already reported in Quarter 1) and 5 CSOs under the East African Child Rights Network (EACRN) were engaged during quarterly coordination meetings to discuss various child protection issues in light of the COVID 19 pandemic, as well as plan for the forth coming world day Against Child trafficking scheduled for 30th July 2020.;</narrative>

During the lobby meetings, it was also discovered that our suggested mode of doing online meetings would not have enabled us achieve our set goals. As such, our contacts in the respective offices advised us to conduct actual (scientific) meetings on the suggested dates, observing all set ministry of health guidelines.;</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">When mobilising for the orientation meeting for police, we realised that the police, magistrates and judges who were our target audience were of different caliber, and could not be met together, hence the recommendation from our contact in the judiciary to divide the group and meet the police and state attorneys separately from the magistrates and judges. Please note that this activity was done in partnership with Rahab Uganda who had targeted State Attorneys and Judges while DP targeted Police and Magistrates. The police and state attorneys meeting has been completed, while the Judges and Magistrates meeting, which was scheduled for 16th April has had to be postponed to a later date due to the COVID-19 pandemic.;</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">3 activities were planned under this output, but only 2 were partially completed. On 1.2.1, ordinance popularisation was completed in Napak, while in Kampala, the KCCA is still hesitant about popularising only parts of the ordinance pending approval from the Solicitor General. As such, we will develop jingles with anti trafficking messages in line with the PTIP Act and air these out on local radio stations within Kampala to create awareness on CTM. 
on 1.2.2, we completed follow up of signs and outcomes in Kampala, while in Napak, this would be done in quarter 3.
1.2.3 has been challenging to coordinate as most of the Members of Parliament who are the targeted audience are busy with their policial campaigns. However, we have now planned to conduct a much small meeting with a small representation from the UPFC and the MoGLSD to enable the UPFC provide technical guidance to the Ministry on how best to present their budgets in a way that will enable it to be prioritized on the floor of Parliament. This was a recommendation from the last UPFC dialogue that was conducted in Quarter 1;</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">Iganga district was supported to complete popularization. Napak support, which had been planned for 22nd-27th March 2020 was interrupted by COVID-19.

Financially, we exceeded target here because of the UPFC engagement that had been planned for Q2. During our pre-engagement with the UPFC Chairman and UPFC Coordinator to share our 2020 plans with them, we were advised to ensure all engagements targeting MPs were completed by April as election preparations were to start in May 2020, which would have taken away most of the targeted MPs. They went ahead to give a date for the first engagement which was only 2 weeks away; very short notice, yet with so much preparations, hence the sad oversight in seeking for authorization from TdH Nl before hand. (We sincerely apologize for this oversight);</narrative>

We also completed the development and approval of all our IEC and advocacy materials within this reporting period to be used for continued public awareness campaigns beyond the project timeline (The distribution timelines have been affected by the COVID 19 pandemic);</narrative>
