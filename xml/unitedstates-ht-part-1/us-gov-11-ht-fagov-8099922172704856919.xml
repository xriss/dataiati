    <narrative xml:lang="EN">Haiti remains a foreign policy priority for the United States and is taking steps to improve the business climate, attract investments, and create jobs. The Government of Haiti prioritizes investments in agriculture, basic infrastructure, manufacturing, and other sectors to foster economic growth. The Government of Haiti has also reinforced its commitment to improving and strengthening the health system and services throughout the country. Access to quality education remains a priority for the Government of Haiti, as it works to enhance standards within schools, improve curricula, train teachers and drastically increase student enrollment. Haiti further supports reforms that have strengthened the capacity of municipalities to increase tax collection and deliver better services. Despite these positive developments, the pace of much-needed progress is still hindered by weak public institutions, conflicts between the executive and legislative branches, lack of accountability, and weak state capacity to provide basic services. Further, this weakened state of governance contributed to the recent impasse over presidential elections, resulting in an indefinite postponement of a run-off scheduled for late January 2016. The inability to find consensual and constructive solutions to elect a new president before President Martelly&apos;s term expired on February 7, 2016, may result in Haiti&apos;s institutions being overseen by unelected officials, which could hinder the pace of economic and social development efforts. These persistent governing challenges only underscore the need for a permanent electoral council and ongoing foreign and U.S. engagement.</narrative>
