   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This award strives to conserve biodiversity and manage natural resources in ways that maintain their long-term viability and preserve their potential to meet the needs of present and future generations. Activities include combating illegal and corrupt exploitation of natural resources and the control of invasive species. This includes Indonesia is home to two subspecies of wild elephants, Sumatran and Bornean, with both populations critically endangered and believed to range below 1,000 breeding animals. The goal of this project is to save Indonesia&#x2019;s elephants from extinction by increasing the capacity of Indonesian professionals, protected area managers, and decision makers to independently implement successful and sustainable conservation and monitoring programs. This project will support one of Indonesia&#x2019;s most respected universities, the Gadjah Mada University, in: 1) establishing a wildlife conservation center within the Faculty of Forestry including the renovation and equipping of training facilities; and 2) creating a training program to increase the capacity of forestry students and faculty to implement wildlife monitoring and conservation projects, including courses covering project design, scientific methods, ecological concepts, and fundraising. 250 students will be included in the training program, with six courses offered for undergraduate and five for graduate students. Applied field skills workshops and internships with elephant conservation projects in Central Sumatra will be offered to directly link conservation theory to practical application. The success and sustainability of elephant conservation is directly linked to the will and capacity of Indonesia and the Indonesian people to conserve their wildlife species and wildlands..</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">Having undergone a remarkable democratic transformation, Indonesia is a key regional and global player. Given Indonesia&apos;s status as the world&apos;s largest Muslim-majority nation, third largest democracy, and one of the largest greenhouse gas emitters, the United States has an interest in its continued success. Despite its progress, success is not assured and challenges still remain. In the framework of the U.S.-Indonesia Strategic Partnership, United States development assistance partners with Indonesians to improve the quality and relevance of higher education and delivery of priority healthcare, strengthen governance and democracy, sustain the environment, manage disasters, and create an environment for science, technology, and innovation to thrive. Priorities and goals for U.S. assistance will need to be flexible to accommodate potential changes in the Government of Indonesia (GOI)&apos;s own development plans, including a new 2015-2019 National Development Strategy, which was finalized in early 2015. The U.S. foreign assistance resources in Indonesia support two Presidential Initiatives. The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) implements activities to build capacity for communities to adapt to climate change, promote low emissions development, and encourage sustainable management of natural resources in support of the Global Climate Change (GCC) Initiative. USAID also works to reduce maternal and child mortality and strengthen Indonesia&apos;s response to infectious diseases in support of the Global Health Initiative (GHI).</narrative>
