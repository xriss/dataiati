   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Reversing decline of Sumatran rhinoceros population in Bukit Barisan Selatan National Park: an alternative approach for conservation management practice</narrative>
  </title>
  <description>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The purpose of this project is to increase the number of rhinos at the Bukit Barisan Selatan National Park (BBSNP) source site to secure their future expansion into their historical home range. This will be done by: (a) scientifically defining an inviolate source site to secure the last remaining rhino population in the Park; (b) establishing and implementing an adaptive monitoring system to estimate the size of the rhino population and its density in the source site and determine spatial and temporal patterns of rhino distribution, habitat use and threats within the source site; and (c) developing a long-term inclusive strategy to improve the protection of the Sumatran rhino population in the source site. Specifically, the Recipient will: (1) develop an agreement between the project partners regarding sharing, analysis and publication of historical data; (2) identify the current rhino distribution and relative population density in BBSNP, as well as evaluate factors contributing to the current distribution pattern in BBSNP; (3) develop a joint protocol on monitoring with key stakeholders; (4) provide training on the field survey monitoring protocols; (5) conduct and analyze monitoring surveys to identify the rhino population in source site; (6) conduct a threat assessment and analyze the data including identification, mapping and monitoring of all pathways in the source site, and conduct a series of community surveys to better understand and mitigate the impacts of human interventions in the source site; (7) conduct a study to analyze conservation interventions over the last ten years and compare with the decrease in the rhino population and distribution in BBS to evaluate conservation program effectiveness; and (8) organize a series of meetings with key-partners to jointly analyze and discuss the data and develop a joint strategy for future interventions by integrating existing activities such as rhino protection units, MIST and resort based management systems.</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">Having undergone a remarkable democratic transformation, Indonesia is a key regional and global player. Given Indonesia&apos;s status as the world&apos;s largest Muslim-majority nation, third largest democracy, and one of the largest greenhouse gas emitters, the United States has an interest in its continued success. Despite its progress, success is not assured and challenges still remain. In the framework of the U.S.-Indonesia Strategic Partnership, United States development assistance partners with Indonesians to improve the quality and relevance of higher education and delivery of priority healthcare, strengthen governance and democracy, sustain the environment, manage disasters, and create an environment for science, technology, and innovation to thrive. Priorities and goals for U.S. assistance will need to be flexible to accommodate potential changes in the Government of Indonesia (GOI)&apos;s own development plans, including a new 2015-2019 National Development Strategy, which was finalized in early 2015. The U.S. foreign assistance resources in Indonesia support two Presidential Initiatives. The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) implements activities to build capacity for communities to adapt to climate change, promote low emissions development, and encourage sustainable management of natural resources in support of the Global Climate Change (GCC) Initiative. USAID also works to reduce maternal and child mortality and strengthen Indonesia&apos;s response to infectious diseases in support of the Global Health Initiative (GHI).</narrative>
