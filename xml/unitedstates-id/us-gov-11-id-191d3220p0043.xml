    <narrative xml:lang="EN">Having undergone a remarkable democratic transformation, Indonesia is a key regional and global player. Given Indonesia&apos;s status as the world&apos;s largest Muslim-majority nation, third largest democracy, and one of the largest greenhouse gas emitters, the United States has an interest in its continued success. Despite its progress, success is not assured and challenges still remain. In the framework of the U.S.-Indonesia Strategic Partnership, United States development assistance partners with Indonesians to improve the quality and relevance of higher education and delivery of priority healthcare, strengthen governance and democracy, sustain the environment, manage disasters, and create an environment for science, technology, and innovation to thrive. Priorities and goals for U.S. assistance will need to be flexible to accommodate potential changes in the Government of Indonesia (GOI)&apos;s own development plans, including a new 2015-2019 National Development Strategy, which was finalized in early 2015. The U.S. foreign assistance resources in Indonesia support two Presidential Initiatives. The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) implements activities to build capacity for communities to adapt to climate change, promote low emissions development, and encourage sustainable management of natural resources in support of the Global Climate Change (GCC) Initiative. USAID also works to reduce maternal and child mortality and strengthen Indonesia&apos;s response to infectious diseases in support of the Global Health Initiative (GHI).</narrative>
