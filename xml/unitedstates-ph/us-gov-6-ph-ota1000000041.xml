    <narrative xml:lang="EN">U.S. foreign assistance priority programs in the Philippines will broaden and deepen the U.S. partnership with the Philippines, while enabling the country to become a more capable ally in enhancing regional security, stability, and economic prosperity. The programs will support the Philippines&apos; military modernization, improve counter-terrorism and law enforcement capabilities, deter transnational crime, and improve the Philippines&apos; capability to monitor and secure its vast maritime domain. Development resources will harness the Philippines&apos; economic growth trajectory to foster conditions for inclusivity, promote effective democratic governance and rule of law, and strengthen public institutions. They will also enable the country to undertake reforms needed for possible participation in the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP). U.S. assistance will help the country achieve sustainable, broad-based growth, while addressing the root causes of terrorism in Mindanao and mitigating the threats of climate change and environmental degradation that undermine the country&apos;s prosperity and stability.The FY 2017 Request supports regional climate change programs across 12 Pacific Island countries. With some areas only 15 feet above sea level, these countries are among the most vulnerable to climate change, as well as the least able to respond effectively. The USAID/Philippines&apos; Office for the Pacific Islands will implement strategic interventions to build the capacity of people to adapt to climate change, as well as their resilience to climate impacts.</narrative>
