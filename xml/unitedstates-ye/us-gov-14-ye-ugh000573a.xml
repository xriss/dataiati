    <narrative xml:lang="EN">Yemen continues to face serious security, humanitarian, and development challenges that threaten not only its long-term stability but regional and global stability as well. Yemen continues to suffer from the conflict that began in September 2014 which resulted in the Houthi rebel group taking over most of the western portion of the country and led to the collapse of country&apos;s military, social services, and commerce. In response to a plea from President Hadi to defend the Yemeni government, in March 2015 Saudi Arabia formed a ten-member coalition of predominantly Sunni Arab states and initiated an air campaign against Houthi military positions countrywide. Yemen already faced a fragile security situation, extremely high levels of need, and significant development challenges; these are all escalating dramatically due to the current, ongoing conflict. Despite the promise of the 2013-2014 National Dialogue Conference (NDC), the conflict has frozen the normal political process, and both parliamentary and presidential elections are overdue. The collapse of education, health, and law enforcement systems, as well as of livelihoods, will weigh heavily upon the country&apos;s initial steps toward recovery. The U.S. government remains committed to supporting all Yemenis who strive for a peaceful, resilient, and unified Yemen. The United States must be fully prepared and resourced to support these goals as soon as opportunities emerge, as this will be a critical time to prevent further deterioration and destabilization and help to create positive momentum. The convening of UN-mediated peace negotiations in December 2015, public commitments from the Republic of Yemen Government (ROYG) and parties to the conflict to a political settlement, and discussion of confidence building measures are early signals that Yemen is entering a critical period. U.S. assistance and engagement will be vital to helping to stabilize and rebuild the country. Funding will support key interventions in democracy and governance, education, health, nutrition, water, and economic growth, with the end goal of assisting Yemen to recover from the conflict and become a more prosperous and resilient country. In particular, U.S. assistance can provide targeted assistance to support negotiations and the fragile political transition process that emerges as well as to help prevent further collapse of the economy and health systems, both of which would have disastrous repercussions across other areas. U.S. assistance will strengthen the ROYG&apos;s ability to confront terrorism, extremism, and other national security threats, which is critical to countering Al Qa&apos;ida in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) and other militant groups. U.S. assistance programs will respond as quickly as political conditions progress and the operating environment will allow, and in a manner that maximizes flexibility and coordination with international organizations and other donors. U.S. government personnel are currently located in the Yemen Affairs Unit in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. The U.S. government is monitoring these developments and will consult closely with Congress on adjustments in programming activities.</narrative>
