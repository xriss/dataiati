  </title>
  <description type="1" xml:lang="EN">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Project restructuring seeks to (1) replace the &#x2018;Kiwano&#x2019; (Upington) Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) Plant&#x2019; pilot project with a large-scale distributed Battery Storage Program1 linked to continuation of South Africa&#x2019;s Renewable Energy Independent Power Producers (REIPP) Program. It also seeks to (2) reallocate the remaining proceeds from the completed activities to the battery storage investment program and (3) extend the project implementation period until December 30, 2021, to allow sufficient time for successful implementation of this storage program.

The proposed changes to the project components involve a change of activity in component 2 to include financing for grid-scale distributed electrochemical batteries, to complement the operation of new wind and solar power capacity to be built under REIPPP round 4, Sere wind farm financed under the Project, and with future distributed solar PV capacity to be built and operated by Eskom.

A technical assistance sub-component under component 2 will be added to (i) support the final design, procurement and supervision of energy storage infrastructure to be supplied through the project, (ii) to strengthen Eskom technical capacity in sustainable operation and maintenance of large scale batteries and (iii) to prepare the enabling environment (regulatory, technical, construction standards) for further private investment in VRE capacity using storage.</narrative>
