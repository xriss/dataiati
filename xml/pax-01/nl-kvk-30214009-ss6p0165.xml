   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Result Area 1: Improved implementation of policies and regulations on gender-based violence and protection of women and girls, including psychosocial support and self-care. When women and girlsG know their rights, have access to and use mental health and psychosocial support (MHPSS), and legal protection services, while in parallel forma land traditional authorities will implement laws and policies against gender-based violence as well as protect survivors after being informed on these topics, women and girls will be less vulnerable to physical and emotional harm. 
 Result Area 2: Changed attitudes and beliefs of civil society to facilitate inclusion of women and girls, and promote gender equality. Changing harmful norms and attitudes includes transforming violent masculinities by targeting influential powerholders (men/boys) as allies and positive role models, to jointly advocate with women and youth groups for gender equality, as well as for equal participation of women and youth groups. 
 Result Area 3: Increased and effective participation of women and youth in leadership and peacebuilding. Increased, influential participation of women and youth in leadership and peacebuilding is possible when women and youth facilitate political positioning and influencing across ethnic/religious/conflict lines, together with male counterparts (as well linked to Result Area 2).</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Leaders of Peace Alliance (LoP) is a 5-year joint programme (2021-2025) of Plan International (programme lead), HealthNet TPO (HNTPO), AMA (Assistance Mission for Africa), EVE and PAX. The programme is implemented in 5 states located in South Sudan, including Unity, Lakes, Western Equatoria, Eastern Equatoria and Central Equatoria. South Sudan has been engaged in a peace process for years. The programme focuses on the role of women and youth in peacebuilding. It aims to achieve and sustain a more empowering and inclusive environment in South Sudan for women and girls. To achieve this, we enable and support civil society organisations (CSOs) with the capacity, resources and legitimacy to influence government and societal actors. At the same time, the programme mobilizes key decision-makers to work towards inclusive laws, policies, norms and practices to achieve gender equality and female participation in decision-making. Juba will be the central location to link advocacy work to national platforms and decision-makers.</narrative>
