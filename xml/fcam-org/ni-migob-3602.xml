   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Founded in 2003, the Fondo Centroamericano de Mujeres - FCAM (Central American Women&apos;s Fund) - is a feminist fund based in the region, dedicating to mobilizing resources to strengthen the women&apos;s movement and support the initiatives of women&apos;s groups and organizations, particularly young women&apos;s organizations, that promote and defend women&apos;s human rights. FCAM has reinforced its strategic role in the search of new and more financing sources to support women&#xB4;s rights in a decade that has been defined by progressive reduction of the financing to civil society organizations and particularly to women&#xB4;s organizations.</narrative>
