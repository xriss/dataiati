   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The MCC Board of Directors approved a $524.7 million compact for C?te d&apos;Ivoire at its quarterly board meeting in September 2017. The Government of C?te d&apos;Ivoire is expected to contribute an additional $22 million to support the compact. The program will support the country&apos;s drive to diversify its economy through investments in the education and transportation sectors. The Projects respond to constraints to economic growth in C?te d&apos;Ivoire, and the Government&apos;s national priorities by seeking to address education and the competitiveness of Abidjan as the country&apos;s economic growth hub by improving the mobility of goods and people.</narrative>
