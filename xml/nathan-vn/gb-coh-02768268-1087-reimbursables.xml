   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The purpose of the &#x201C;Vietnam National Trade Repository Programme&#x201D;, known hereafter as the &#x201C;Vietnam NTR&#x201D;, is to establish a National Trade Repository (NTR) which will provide easier access to regulations and trade facilitation information.

The overarching objective of Vietnam NTR is to facilitate free trade and open markets by providing easier access to regulations and trade facilitation information, enable greater investment and interaction with global value chains in creating jobs and prosperity, and help reduce poverty and promote gender equality. 

Vietnam NTR will be delivered over 18 months and comprise the following four activities:
-	Design, development and implementation of the NTR
This includes the design, development and implementation of the NTR including mobilisation and delivery of an outline NTR, followed by inclusion of content. This activity includes mandatory training for MOIT and other stakeholders in the operation and management of the platform.
-	Governance Framework
Creation of an Information Governance Framework to manage flows of data and designate roles and responsibilities.
-	Inter-agency working group
Technical assistance through the GTP to support the creation of a legal and governance structure as well as an operating model for inter-agency working between relevant agencies in Vietnam.
-	Awareness-raising
Delivery of a national programme of consultation and awareness-raising, i.e. a programme of events to ensure broadest national coverage.

In parallel, two complementary research projects will be delivered:
Streamlining of regulations to enhance the coherence of the body of enactments to be input in the NTR; and
An evaluation of the concepts, contents and design of the other ASEAN portals to learn lessons, achieve consistency and ensure ASEAN ATR requirements are met.</narrative>
