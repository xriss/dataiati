   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Since Umeme started operation in 2005, it has connected 93,821 new customers in Uganda where less than 10% of the population has access to electricity.  It has also improved the performance of the countrys distribution sector by reducing technical and commercial losses from 38% in 2005 to 34% in 2008 despite the significant tariff increase mainly due to high oil prices in those years.  It is expected that Umeme will further improve the sector performance through the Project, and will have a significant development impact on the country in the form of:  - Increased access to electricity supply (at least 20,000 new connections annually) - Reduction in the technical and commercial losses for at least additional 2% by 2010 - Reduction in losses, which will in the long term lead to a reduction in the tariff  - Improvement in the quality of service to end users</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Umeme Limited (Umeme) is a regulated electricity distribution company in Uganda, supplying over 300,000 customers mainly located in the semi-urban strip from Entebbe through Kampala to Jinja.  In March 2005, Umeme was awarded a 20 year concession to manage and operate the assets of Uganda Electricity Distribution Company (UEDCL).  The award of the concession was part of Ugandas broader privatization of its power sector, which also involved the unbundling of transmission, distribution and generation, and the awarding of concessions for the operation of its existing generation assets.  Ugandas power sector privatization was fully supported by the World Bank Group, and the Umeme financing structure includes both MIGA insurance and a partial risk guarantee from IDA.  To date, Umeme has invested about $44 million in rehabilitating and developing its network, making additional connections, implementing a new customer billing system, and rolling out a customer call center and work management centers.  Subject to the Ugandan regulators approval, Umeme intends to spend a further $50 million in the next two years (the Project).  This investment is a continuation of the existing program, covering renewal of its asset base, loss reduction, network extension, and new connections (in addition to the 93,821 Umeme has already made).</narrative>
