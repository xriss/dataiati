  </title>
  <description>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Fuego Volcano the most active volcano in Guatemala erupted on 3 June generating a column of ash lava and pyroclastic flows up to 10km from the crater. The eruption affected over 1.7 million people in Sacatep&#xE9;quez Escuintla and Chimaltenango departments where national authorities declared the highest level of alert. At that time the authorities issued and evacuation order and some villages could be safely emptied to three emergency shelters. On Tuesday 5 June a new explosion was reported in Fuego volcano and further descent of pyroclastic lava flow led to new evacuations injured and casualties. A new lahar(volcanic mudflow) formed on 7 June which was descending through the valleys of Santa Teresa Mineral and Taniluya. At time of writing official figures are reporting 109 casualties 58 injured and some 197 people are still missing. Some 12 407 people have been evacuated and only 4 175 of the 12 407 evacuees have been relocated to 22 official and unofficial emergency collective centres which include churches schools cultural and sports centres and town halls in the departments of Escuintla Sacatep&#xE9;quez Santa Rosa Guatemala and Suchitep&#xE9;quez. Over 4 000 are living in emergency shelters. Urgent shelter health food and water sanitation and hygiene promotion (WASH) needs have been identified. The Fuego Volcano continues to be active and the flow of lahar is likely to continue in the coming days and could be aggravated by the ongoing and forecasted rainfalls which increase the risk of mudslides and landslides. Consequently the affected missing and casualty figures are likely to increase. Guatemala Red Cross is leading the response and have launched a domestic emergency appeal supported by the IFRC and numerous PNS from the wider movement. IFRC also launched an appeal on 11 June for CHF2m supporting 6 000 people for 12 months.</narrative>
