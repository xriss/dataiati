   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Title: Zimbabwe Food Insecurity 2018/2019 Start and End dates: 27 th Nov 2018 - Unknown Summary: In consortium with the Danish and Finnish we supported a food security response through the use of Ecocash for people in the North of Zimbabwe. We gave financial assistance as well as having Jessa Serna and then Emilie Guinier assist with the cash distributions. The 2018/2019 consumption year food insecurity prevalence is 154% higher than that of the 2017/2018 consumption year. As such about 2 423 568 people will be food insecure during the peak hunger period. As part of its recommendations the ZIMVAC Report 2018 notes that compared to 2017 the prevalence of food insecurity among rural households has increased and that there is therefore need for urgent food distribution to food insecure households in order to avoid a worsening situation. Location: Binga and Kariba Zimbabwe Bens: Phase 1 was 2000HH Phase 2 was 2500HH Donor: None however all funding came from the disaster fund PNSs: Finnish Red Cross and Danish Red Cross Budget: Phase 1 BRC sent 120K and Phase 2 BRC sent an additional 150K Or 240K in total (roughly) Phase 1 total from all PNS = 550 000 USD Phase 2 total from all PNS = 644 000 USD Current Situation (Dec 2019) : The cash distributions are coming to an end however these is still a lot of food insecurity throughout the country. The Finnish Red Cross have acquired funding through ECHO for 15 000 HHs the 2500HHs from this programme will continue to be supported by Danish Red Cross however probably in In-Kind support as the markets have slowly stopped working.</narrative>
