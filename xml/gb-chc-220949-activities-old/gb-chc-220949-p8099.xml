  <description>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Since 7 July 2019 heavy rainfall and water from upstream countries of Nepal and India have led to landslides and extreme flooding in Bangladesh. While flooding during the monsoon season is an annual event continuous rain and flooding in neighbouring Nepal and India have converged in Bangladesh s two major river systems (Jamuna and Tista) in the north leading water levels to exceed normal monsoon levels and reaching their highest level in 100 years making the impacts of the event considerably more extreme than annual monsoon flooding. As of 28 July seven million people in 28 districts have been affected with 400 000 houses fully or partially damaged leading to the displacement of over 280 000 people. People are marooned communities are detached and approximately 163 000 hectares of crops have been damaged leading to loss of livelihoods and food shortages. In 17 days the death toll reached to 114. The floods have disrupted water supplies and sanitation services leading to shortages in safe drinking water and with many families displaced in shelters and with family living in crowded conditions and lacking access to suitable sanitation there is considerable risk from waterborne diseases among the affected population. With at least seven more days of flooding expected in the worst affected districts the situation is still rapidly evolving. It is therefore likely that more needs will be identified in the coming weeks. The operation may therefore be reviewed and adjusted to accommodate these as the results of ongoing needs assessments become available</narrative>
