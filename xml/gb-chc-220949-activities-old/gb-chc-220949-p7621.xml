   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Since July 2014 the Diffa region in Niger have been experiencing an unprecedented security crisis and serious humanitarian needs as a result of armed groups activities in the north of Nigeria as well as in the Niger territory. The situation has deteriorated in the first months of 2018 and as a result the continued influx of IDPs has put pressure on the capacity of health facilities leading to reduced access to primary health care and referral for displaced populations and host populations. This led to IFRC launching an EA in 2018 to contribute to the epidemics prevention and strengthening the Health and Nutritional status of 43 113 people (6 159 households) in three districts of the Diffa region (Diffa centre Maine Soroa and Goudoumaria) through awareness sessions malnutrition screening and referral community-based disease surveillance wash activities and maternal and neonatal health. BRC supported this appeal with 50 000 GBP from its Disaster Fund. The situation has continued to deteriorate with over 18 800 people displaced in March 2019 in Diffa region because of Boko Haram activities and attacks against civilians adding to the 249 000 people previously displaced by the conflict (UNHCR 26/03/2019 OCHA 04/04/2019). In light of this IFRC decided to revise its 2018 s EA extending the 2018 appeal for another 12 months seeking 2.2 million CHF (an increase from last year s 1.68 M CHF EA) and increasing the number of people to be assisted by the Niger Red Cross to 50 000 (previously 43 113). The revised Emergency Appeal focusses on Health WASH and Protection Gender and Inclusion with the introduction of a Livelihoods and basic needs component and an extension of the targeted geographic area. BRC has supported the EA with 65 000 GBP from its Disaster Fund</narrative>
