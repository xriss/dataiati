  </title>
  <description>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">By January 2015 a slow onset of the rainy season in Zimbabwe was followed by severe flooding in some parts of the country that destroyed crops. The situation was exacerbated by a long dry spell throughout January to March resulting in a crop yield below the five-year average. As a country which experiences chronic food insecurity and recurrent food shortages this has increased the already high vulnerability of rural communities. Forecasts for continuing hot and drier than average conditions through mid-2016 suggest a scenario of extensive crop failure with serious consequences that will persist until at least the next harvest in 2017. The reduction of rainfall has also reduced the amount of available water reducing power supply from dams and potable water from boreholes for human and livestock consumption. In September 2015 the IFRC launched an appeal for 832 900CHF (until March 2016) to reach 10 830 people with a focus on water health hygiene promotion food security nutrition and livelihoods (through cash distributions). In February 2016 a ZIMVAC report estimated the proportion of rural households who are deemed food insecure at 30% of the population doubling from the May 2015 projection of 16% and representing approximately 2 829 159 people: the highest proportion of need for six years. Initial readings point to a severe lean season from October 2016 March 2017. In February 2016 the Government of Zimbabwe declared a state of national disaster and appealed for just under 1.6 billion in humanitarian assistance for the period February December 2016. In April 2016 the IFRC emergency appeal was revised to CHF 5 181 321 to support 38 330 people across eight districts. BRC have supported the initial appeal with CHF 100 000 ( 67 000) from the Disaster Fund and a further 20 000 R funds. BRC are looking to support the revised appeal with 550 000 - this will support response activities and HR costs for an Operations Manager.</narrative>
