       <narrative xml:lang="EN">First, a review report on international and domestic experience on system evaluation mechanism, including on allowance allocation evaluation has been prepared and submitted. To achieve this, the following work has been carried out by research group: 1) investigated the academic research perspectives of assessment on design of ETS and other environmental regulations and policies, and summarized the assessment theories and methods of ETS allowance allocation;
2) reviewed the experiences of Norway and EU in assessment and adjustments of allowance allocation of emissions trading market and their suggestions for construction of emissions trading market of China; 3) sorted out and analyzed the design features of the allocation methods in seven pilot regions, the adjustment methods of the allowance allocation methods and the underlying reasons; 4) put forward the key points for framework design of ETS allowance allocation method evaluation, including the assessment dimensions and the selection criteria of indicators, evaluation methods and data availability.



Second, a report on recommended Chinese evaluation mechanism on system performance, including on allowance allocation, is prepared and submitted. The following activities have been implemented :1) other key factors that shall be considered in theory for the assessment on the effects of ETS have been identified by means of literature research and expert interviews. 2) the experiences of EU ETS, NZ ETS, RGGI and California system in assessing the performance of the system have been reviewed. 3) draft assessment methodology suitable for the Chinese situation was put forward, including the corresponding data requirements.
4) experts from Hubei, Guangdong, Shenzhen, Shanghai and Beijing and the Preparatory Working Group for Construction of National Emissions Trading Market were interviewed to collect their views on the proposed assessment framework and methodologies. 5) adjustments were made to the proposed assessment framework and methodologies, based on the expert views and also the assessment of Hubei pilot which was selected to assess its performance and to test the proposed assessment framework and methodologies. Considering the availability of data, Wuhan University and Hubei Provincial Emissions Trading Center was contracted to assess the allowance allocation method and operation effect of Hubei ETS. Questionnaires have been distributed to the covered entities in Hubei pilot to collect information needed for the assessment of other elements of the system. The Tsinghua team, together with Norwegian experts, visited Wuhan from April 15th to April 17th 2018 for the assessment purpose. The outcome of performance assessment of Hubei pilot has been analyzed in depth. Based on the assessment outcome, the proposed assessment framework for the national system has been improved, finalized and submitted.


II.Supervision and Management Mechanism of the Third-Party Verification Body in the National ETS2

For the outcome 2, it is to investigate the implementation status of domestic verification system by analyzing relevant national and international policies and to compile series of supporting documents. In this way, a supervision and management mechanism for third-party verification bodies is expected to be proposed for China&#x2019;s relevant departments in charge. To achieve this target, seven outputs with draft version have been achieved as follows: 1) Comparison report of the third-party mechanism characteristics analysis in major international carbon trading markets; 2) Comparison report of the third-party mechanism characteristics analysis in China&#x2019;s carbon trading market pilot; 3) Research report on the management mode of third-party verification bodies in related domestic industries; 4) The investigation plan and investigation content of country wide third-party verification body in base-line years (2013-2017) of China ETS which includes third party verification quality assessment report in the reference year; 5) Third-party verification bodies implementation plan for surveillance and evaluation; 6) Policy suggestions on supervision and management mechanism of third-party verification institutions; 7) Project implementation report. The CQC research team also shared and discussed the implementation and the progress with the representatives from Norwegian Environment Agency in Beijing in April and September respectively.

III.The supporting activities to deepen and expand capacity building

First, eight textbooks of standardized training materials have been updated and finalized in 2018. The textbooks include Handbook of China carbon market, Handbook of MRV, Questions and answers of MRV, Handbook of the third-party verifiers verification report templates and examples, Handbook of enterprises GHG Emission Reporting templates and examples, Handbook of carbon emission management for enterprises, Handbook of China carbon market establishment and management; Courseware materials for China ETS carbon capacity building. To maximize the textbook impact, the evaluation analysis and summary on the standardized training materials and modules have been well complied based on the China carbon market policies, regulations and technical guidelines. In combination with the project objectives, the team designed the assessment questionnaires for training effects and materials. After each training course, the trainees have been invited to fill in the questionnaires. Based on the analysis and summary of the feedback, the team adopted the reasonable suggestions and updated the training material accordingly. The communication mechanism has been set up. In addition, 25 rounds of training program with 1300 government officials, enterprises staff and the third-party verifiers as well as 2,600 trainees were conducted. As one of outputs in this component, the help-desk website platform has been transferred to NCSC for management and daily operation in accordance with the requirement of DCC. The team provided the technical support and improved the function of the whole system and made it more user-friendly in accordance with the feedback of the users. In addition, peer learning workshops were carried out in China and Norway in 2018 to strengthen the communication and exchange in both sides. Representatives from Chinese side and Norwegian side joined the delegation, exchanged ideas on the ETS and shared experiences of low carbon development, especially on the EU ETS operation, carbon asset management of enterprises, and compliance strategies. The delegation also visited the local installation that has been covered by EU ETS and learned the practical experience concerning the daily operation and compliance from the view point of enterprises. The study tour promoted the understanding between the enterprises from both sides.
IV.To support the design of China Carbon Trading Info Platform

The carbon trading info platform and web-based UI and mobile App UI established was well maintained. Database of carbon trading info platform includes information publication, user management, operating information, columns classification and dynamic configuration. It is systemically managing the data of the platform and supporting demands of the implementation. The team

conducted a system trial and released relevant policies, regulations, news updates, compliance information, CCER projects, and carbon market common issues according to the actual situation of the national and local carbon markets. To better meet the needs of users, the online survey was delivered to acquire the feedback.


V.Project integration, coordination and management
The ETS Project set up a Project Management Office (PMO) hosted by MEE, and hired full-time staff to exercise the day-to-day management. The main duties discharged by the staff were to: assist MEE in day-to-day general project management; develop work plans and reports; prepare Terms of References for all inputs (including subcontracts, international experts, domestic and international training events), and assist and monitor the implementation of TORs, and; prepare all documents of project annual meetings and organize the meetings.</narrative>
