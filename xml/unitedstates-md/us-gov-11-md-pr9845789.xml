    <narrative xml:lang="EN">In June 2014, Moldova signed an Association Agreement (AA) and Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Agreement (DCFTA) with the European Union (EU), thus moving forward on critical components of its path toward European integration. Moldova&apos;s development progress reflects significant advancement of the fundamental U.S.~strategic goal of a Europe whole, free, and at peace. However, despite this progress, Moldova faces many challenges - most prominently Russian pressure and endemic corruption - as it works to meet the requirements of the AA and DCFTA and to implement its reform agenda. The United~States will prioritize addressing these challenges, engaging all elements of U.S.~foreign assistance. FY~2017 assistance to Moldova will strengthen democratic institutions, especially the justice sector, and promote a decentralized, participatory, and democratic political environment with more dynamic civil society and media organizations and with citizens empowered to shape political parties and the political process. Programs will also aim to raise living standards by improving the business-regulatory environment, enhancing private sector competitiveness, developing export-oriented, high-value agriculture, and helping Moldova take advantage of the trade benefits of its DCFTA. These efforts will open new markets for Moldovan exports and counter Russian economic pressure, which is aimed at derailing Moldova&apos;s European integration. All programs will incorporate strong anti-corruption elements, seeking to inhibit corruption across sectors and increase transparency. Sustained progress in these areas, coupled with support for reintegration with Transnistria, will result in an increasingly stable, economically sound, and secure Moldova that is anchored in its ties to the West. U.S. assistance will build resilience and reduce vulnerability to Russian aggression, increase European integration, and provide continued support for enduring programs.</narrative>
