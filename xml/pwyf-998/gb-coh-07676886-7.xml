   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Increase the salience of gender equality, women&#x2019;s economic empowerment (WEE), women&#x2019;s financial inclusion (WFI), women&#x2019;s empowerment collectives (WEC) and gender integration among all funders through both robust information about and recommendations for the improved collection and publication of information on funding to these areas. 

This project&#x2019;s primary outcome aligns with the foundation&#x2019;s gender equality strategy by providing evidence-based recommendations for data publication around and effective investments into four focus areas: women&#x2019;s inclusion in digital financial services, women&#x2019;s participation in economic opportunities, women&#x2019;s empowerment collectives and gender integration that act as critical platforms to empower the next generation of women and girls. The project will most directly benefit women and girls in Nigeria, Kenya, Uganda, Ethiopia, Bangladesh and Pakistan, which are countries where the foundation sees great potential for impact in one or more of the aforementioned focus areas. With targeted donor engagement, the benefits should be broader as donors take up the project&#x2019;s recommendations. The project aligns with the Global Access requirements, as its findings and recommendations will be promptly and broadly disseminated, and openly and freely accessible to the foundation&#x2019;s intended beneficiaries online.</narrative>
