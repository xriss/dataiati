At this stage it is almost impossible to define the value of those changes in both quantitatively and qualitatively. Moreover, Right to Grow started its operation in 2021 and the programme does not have any influence on those policies yet. Based on this baseline value is treated as zero.

During baseline conduction we have reviewed 26 policies, legislations, acts, rules, strategies and plans (Refer to chapter-4) related to WASH and Nutrition. We have found the existence of strong national policy framework in both sectors but weakness in effective implementation. In some cases, clear and easily understandable supporting guidelines/ handbooks are absent, such as for local government (Union Parishad) Act 2009 execution.</narrative>
