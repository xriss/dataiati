    <narrative xml:lang="EN">The objective of providing financing for advisory services and technical assistance for municipal environment infrastructure projects financed by EBRD and/or Sida related to EBRD&apos;s ETC initiative, with the aim of supporting environmentally, financially and socially sustainable projects, can be said to be fulfilled. No quantifiable&#xA0;targets are defined for the contribution, as it is difficult to do so for these type of trust funds, where projects that will be supported are not known in beforehand. Although the objective can be said to be fulfilled, implementation of e.g. the Adjara project, has been seriously delayed.&#xA0;
As a result of Sida dialogue with the EBRD,&#xA0; EBRD is piloting a new format for narrative reporting and testing it on some bilateral funds with Sida. Sida is giving feed-back on the format and assisting in its further development.&#xA0; As part of simplifying narrative reporting, Sida has also agreed to change from semi-annual to annual reporting from 2020 and onwards. An amendment to the agreement to regulate this was signed in December 2019.&#xA0;
The idea is that the new format, which is more aligned with the bank&apos;s internal reporting system, will then be applied to funds with other donors as well.&#xA0;The reporting and project follow up was discussed at the Annual project review meeting on 3 June. Minutes from the meeting have been taken and are filed in dox. With regard to project and trust fund reporting, Sida brought up the following issues:
Sida noted that standard project reports were now covering many of the projects with Sida TC support which is a real improvement. Sida also mentioned the reform of moving to annual reporting and follow-up which saves time and resources.
There is however still a need to strengthen annual narrative reporting. The following aspects needs attention:
There needs to be a &#x201C;trust-fund level&#x201D; section (an overview) for each narrative report, including at least a list of project supported, their status, fund committed and disbursed per assignment and in total (including funds remaining for financing of new assignments/projects) but preferably also other aspects like, pipeline of projects and general conclusions on progress and utilisation of funds. For some of the trust funds, this type of overview is regulated in the trust fund agreements and should then follow what is stated there.
As a rule, the annual narrative report should be compiled as one (e.g. PDF-format) report, including all annexes. Excel charts and documents not suitable for this format could still be sent as separate files, but then in the same email as the main narrative report. For non-transactional TC- the latest report available (typically TCRS-reporting) should make part of such report. For assignments where reporting is not available, e.g. assignment which are new or for other reasons, a note should be made in the trust fund overview section, to enable Sida to verify that all reporting has been delivered.
The above will effectively mean that the current &#x201C;Programme report&#x201D; would need to be revised and splitted up, to make one overview per trust fund. This is also justified as the trust funds are funded and managed in a delegated manner by Sweden, involving in this case also the Swedish Embassies in Kiev and Sarajevo. Sida offered to be part of shaping the &#x201C;new&#x201D; trust-fund level overviews to come up with something which works for both Sida and the EBRD.
For trust-fund agreements with many amendments, like &quot;SWET&quot; (this fund), Sida proposed to make &#x201C;re-instated&#x201D; agreements, incorporating all the amendments. This will bring better clarity on both sides on e.g. reporting requirements for each trust fund specifically.
For the Adjara&#xA0;project, cooperation has not been working well in the past and sorting out what went wrong as well seeking solutions for a way forward acceptable to all parties was not easy and the project became seriously delayed, also because of a late client decision to change location for the landfill.&#xA0; During the semi-annual meeting in November 2016, it was agreed that the EBRD would reinforce the project organisation for the Adjara project by introducing a Financier&apos;s Monitoring Consultant to mitigate future implementation risks.
In October 2017, the EBRD, with financial support from Sida, engaged the Monitoring Consultant&#xA0; to assist in monitoring implementation of the Loan and the Grant, to ensure that the Project&#x2019;s construction and operation are carried out according to the implementation, investment and financing plans as well as envisaged standards and applicable laws and regulations. The Financier&apos;s Monitoring consultant is reporting both to Sida and EBRD and has had a very positive impact&#xA0;on project progress. Financier&apos;s Monitor identified a number of risk factors that have the potential to jeopardise project objectives. The most important one was that the resources and capacity of the Adjara Waste management Company were insufficient and should be improved with the support of Adjara region so that the company can hire expertise needed to be able to implement the project. Following requirements from EBRD, the Ministry of the Adjara republic took action by hiring staff with adequate skill to reinforce the capacity of the solid waste company.&#xA0;&#xA0;
According to the 2020 project report, the Adjara project, which is the only project receiving investment grants and therefore take up a big share of total funds, is now progressing well and construction works for the landfill component are expected to be completed in 2021.&#xA0;In 2021, the fund agreement was extended until 2023-06-30 to enable the Adjara project to be finalised. At the annual project review meeting in June 2021, Sida asked for a timeline for completion of the full project, including closure of the existing dumpsites. EBRD&#xA0;clarified that the FS covering the closure of the existing dumpsites is expected to be finalised in early 2022 and that full completion of all components is estimated to require another 2-3 years. EBRD also clarified&#xA0; that this part of the project now has another name and is called the Batumi Solid Waste Project in their internal system. The Ministry of Finance has formally requested to increase the loan to cover the outstanding components of the project, among them closure of the two old dump sites. Sida has agreed&#xA0;to finance part of the needed update of the Feasibility study needed for this using the remaining funds left in the fund. &#xA0;Sida had originally earmarked its investment grant funding for project components related to the closure of the two existing landfills. However, due to substantial cost increase of the landfill component, in turn partly a result of the project delays, Sida agreed to reallocate its funds to the landfill component with an assurance&#xA0;that the client would finance the dumpsite closures.</narrative>
