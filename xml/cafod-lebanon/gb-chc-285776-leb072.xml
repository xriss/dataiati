   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Supporting Vulnerable Lebanese Communities Affected by Socioeconomic Crisis (EA 34/2019)</narrative>
  </title>
  <description>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">An unprecedented political uprising started in October 2019 in Lebanon, which resulted in road-blockages and major protests against corruption by the Lebanese citizens calling for a change in the government and demanding for their basic rights to be respected. 
As Lebanon is facing an economic crisis, it is estimated by the World Bank that 1.3 million Lebanese &#x2013; approximately 32.5% of the population - is living in poverty and/or dire economic conditions. With the increase of unemployment and poverty and with little to no hope of seeing a near end to the economic crisis, the Lebanese population is falling into despair and resorting to extreme measures in order to meet their basic needs to survive. 
In addition, the Lebanese banks are restricting access to both US dollars and Lebanese pounds due to a liquidity crisis faced by the Lebanese banking system. These restrictions have a detrimental effect on the population unable to access their savings. and on suppliers: medications, food items, and even fuel/gasoline were all impacted by the capital restrictions.
This project (rapid response launched through CI) will help 4,075 Lebanese (815 households) who cannot be covered under existing projects by Caritas Lebanon and who are in urgent need of assistance, including emergency cash assistance, medication and transportation to specialised schools for children with disabilities. 
CL will use vulnerability and eligibility criteria to identify households in need of cash assistance and medicines.  Criteria will include the following: 
- Daily workers whose income has been affected by the road-closures and ongoing road-blockages.   
- Family with member with severe disability
- Family with elderly member with chronic diseases or disability
- Family with very low or without income 
- Family with young children (under 5 years old)
- Large family with more than 6 members
- Female at risk of/victim of GBV with children
- Unaccompanied Elderly
- Woman headed household</narrative>
