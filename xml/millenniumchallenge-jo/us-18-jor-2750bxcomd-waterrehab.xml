   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Jordan - Water Network Restructuring And Rehabilitation project: Jordan; Water Network Restructuring And Rehabilitation: In 2007, the wastewater collection system in Zarqa Governorate was limited in reach and endangered public health. The system frequently overflowed into city streets and the surrounding environment, relied on pump stations that had insufficient capacity, and did not serve nearly 30 percent of the population. The Wastewater Network Projectrepresented the largest investment in wastewater infrastructure improvements for Zarqa Governorate system. The objectives of the project were to (i) increase access to the wastewater network, (ii) increase the volume of wastewater collected within Zarqa Governorate for treatment and reuse, and (iii) reduce the incidents of sewage overflow.

The Wastewater Network Project was originally comprised of two activities: (i) the reinforcement of existing networks and rehabilitation of existing sewer main lines in West Zarqa, and (ii) the reinforcement of existing networks and rehabilitation of existing sewer main lines in East Zarqa.

The project extended service to households that were not connected to the sewer network by constructing over 300 kilometers of new sewers in the neighborhoods of East Zarqa and West Zarqa, both of which lacked access to the sewer network.The extension of lateral sewer lines raised wastewater service coverage rates from 72 percent to about 84 percent of the local Jordanian population, though coverage rates of the full population dropped due to the influx of Syrian and Iraqi refugees. These new customer connections also generated additional wastewater. The project provided more than 8,700 connection points to the wastewater pipes, which allowed over 54,800 people to be connected to the new wastewater system. These new customer connections generated additional wastewater which is treated at the As-Samra Wastewater Treatment Plant and reused in agriculture downstream in the Jordan Valley.The project also utilized unused budget identified during implementation of the compactto add 65 kilometers of pipes to the Princess Haya neighborhood of the Zarqa Governorate and to purchase high pressure jet cleaning vehicles for the water utility to enhance system maintenance.</narrative>
