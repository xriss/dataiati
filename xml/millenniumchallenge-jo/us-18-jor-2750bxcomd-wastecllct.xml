   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Jordan - Wastewater Collection project: The objectives of the wastewater network reinforcement and expansion project (the ?Wastewater Network Project?) are to (1) increase access to the wastewater network, (2) increase the volume of wastewater collected within Zarqa Governorate for treatment and reuse, and (3) reduce the incidents of sewage overflow. The Wastewater Network Project is designed to increase the carrying capacity of impaired sewer main lines, reduce periodic overflows in the wastewater collection network, and extend lateral sewer lines to urban neighborhoods in which populations are not currently connected to the wastewater collection network.</narrative>
