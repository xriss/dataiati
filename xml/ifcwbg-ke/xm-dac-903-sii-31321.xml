   <narrative xml:lang="EN">By providing long term US$ financing and a trade line, IFC expects to deliver strong development impact through its partnership with Coop Bank.  Long term funding to address the existing maturity mismatches will offer a lower risk funding approach to the Bank&apos;&apos;s business and consequently allow for increased reach in terms of broader access to finance for various market segments.  In summary, the provision of long term finance is expected to have strong development impact in the following areas:  i) Access to Finance - SME: IFC&apos;&apos;s long-term funding will allow Coop Bank to grow its SME lending business and enable it offer affordable long term finance to its clients; ii) Access to Finance - Agriculture: access to long term funding will enhance the Bank&apos;&apos;s ability to grow its agribusiness lending portfolio and increase the tenor of its loans;  and iii) Access to Finance - Trade: the trade line under GTFP will allow the Bank to ramp up its trade activities and more importantly offer affordable trade finance to SMEs.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The proposed investment consists of a US$60 million 7-year senior loan to Cooperative Bank of Kenya (Coop Bank or the Bank) to support its long term lending business and in particular to enable the Bank to expand its SME and Agribusiness lending programs (the Project). In addition to the senior loan, a further US$5 million trade line will be made available by IFC to the Bank under IFCs Global Trade Finance Program (GTFP).  The primary objective of the Project is to support the Banks growth, address its balance sheet maturity mismatch, and help it meet its US$ funding needs.   Coop Bank is the 3rd largest bank in Kenya and accounts for 8.2% of total assets in the banking system.  The Bank was publicly listed in 2008 and trades on the Nairobi Securities Exchange (NSE) under the symbol COOP.  Coop Bank has its roots in the cooperative movement having been established in 1965 by agricultural cooperative marketing societies.  Over the last 15 years, the Bank has transformed into a strong universal bank catering to all market segments including public sector, corporate, SMEs, micro-entrepreneurs and the Cooperative sector.</narrative>
