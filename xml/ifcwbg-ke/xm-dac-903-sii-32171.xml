   <narrative xml:lang="EN">1. Access to basic education: Bridge aims to provide access to education for 3.5 million students from low-income backgrounds by 2020. 2. Promoting affordability: Bridge provides quality education for a significantly lower cost than alternative low cost private schools and government schools. 3. Improving quality and accountability: Bridge has a team of specialized content developers that develop high quality content based on the national curriculum. Independent studies on the quality of Bridge education show between 25% to 205% improvement in Bridge students&apos; literacy and numeracy over their peers in government schools and other low cost schools . The use of technology and automation has allowed Bridge to enforce accountability at all level of the organization, particularly ensuring teacher attendance which is a large problem in the Company&apos;s target markets.  4. Job creation: The Company aims to create 57,000 teaching jobs by 2020. A majority of these jobs will be filled by youth in the 24-35 year age group recruited and trained as teachers. Additionally the Company will hire individuals for the ancilliary services it intends to provide such as lunch catering services. 5. Demonstration effect: The education sector for the low income market is fragmented which results in inconsistent quality and higher costs. The Company will act as a consolidator in the sector and if successful will attract other companies to employ similar strategies, thereby improving quality and reducing costs of primary education in emerging markets. 6. Improved nutrition for students: The Company aims to introduce lunch meals at school and will provide students with affordable, nutritious meals.</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">The existing network of 211 schools is located across Kenya in urban, peri-urban and rural settings. The schools are built by Bridge on greenfield sites located in high density low income communities where children only have to walk a maximum of 500m to get to the school. The schools have clear access paths and can be reached by public/private transport or on foot. In the new markets, Bridge will follow a similar strategy for the location of the schools.</narrative>
