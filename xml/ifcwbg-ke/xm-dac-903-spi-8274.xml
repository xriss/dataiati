(GBHL)   Technical Partner and/or Major Shareholders    	Grain Bulk Handlers Ltd. (GBHL) is 80% owned by a local entrepreneur Mr. Mohamed Jaffer, whose family has been in the real estate and trading business for over 20 years.  The remaining 20% of GBHL shares are held by the Varsani family which owns and operates Mistry Jadva Parbat &amp; Company Ltd., a major construction/engineering firm in Kenya.    	The project will be managed and operated by Portia Management Services Ltd. (PMSL), a UK management and consulting company specializing in port grain handling operations. PMSL, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the publicly-listed Mersey Docks and Harbour Company, is also considering an equity investment in GBHL.     Project Cost Including proposed IFC investment    	The estimated total project cost is US$32 million.  IFCs proposed investment would include a Senior Loan of up to US$7 million and a Subordinated Loan of up to US$3 million.     Location of project and Description of site    	The project will be located on a 1.4 hectare lot adjacent to the port of Mombasa.    Description of Company and Purpose of Project    	Mombasa port, situated along the East African coast, is mainly used for commercial trading to and from Kenya and Uganda.  It is also a drop off point for grains from international donor aid agencies to other countries like Somalia, Rwanda, and Burundi.  GBHL will build and operate the first modern bulk handling and storage facility in Mombasa for imported grains and fertilizers.  The project will include the acquisition of two 300 mtph capacity ship unloaders, an enclosed twin overhead conveyor system, twenty-four 2,800 mt capacity storage grain silos, an 18,000 mt capacity fertilizer warehouse, and bagging machines.  The  project is expected to (i) relieve congestion in the existing port, (ii) control air pollution in the port area, and (iii) reduce spillage and pilferage losses during unloading.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Environmental Category and Issues    	This is a category B project according to IFCs environmental procedures. Environmental issues associated with this project include air emissions and dust control, liquid effluents, spill prevention for stormwater run-off, solid waste, and material handling and disposal. Occupational, health and safety issues include safety in storing grains and fertilizers, fire and explosion prevention, emergency response, employee training, and employee exposure to noise and dust.  The facilities have been designed to include a dust extraction system and enclosed conveyors to minimize pollutants in the air and dust emissions that may cause explosions.  Moreover, humidity inside the silos will be regulated by built-in moisture and temperature controls. GBHL will be required to submit a detailed worker safety training program for review by the IFCs Environment department.    The  is  from the Public Information Center.
