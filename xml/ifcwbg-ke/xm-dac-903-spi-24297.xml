   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project consists of the acquisition and refurbishment of five hotels and lodges in Kenya that previously comprised Lonrho Hotels Kenya B.V. These are the following:

-  Norfolk Hotel, Nairobi (167 rooms)
-  Mount Kenya Safari Club (114 rooms)
-  Mara Safari Club (50 room tents)
-  Ark Safari Lodge, Aberdare (60 rooms)
-  Aberdare Country Club (48 rooms)

Acquisition has been recently finalized for $33.4 million and refurbishment cost is estimated at $29.6 million, for a total project cost of $63.0 million.

Kenya is rich in tourism assets and after suffering in the last few years mainly due to security concerns, signs of recovery are apparent.  In addition to capitalizing on the upswing in demand in Kenya, the sponsors believe the project will create significant value by:

-  enhancing performance through stronger management; 
-  positioning the hotels to effectively compete at the top end of the market; 
-  leveraging off KHI and Fairmonts international exposure; and 
-  benefiting from KHIs economies of scale in the Africa region.</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">The following is a summary description of each hotel property:

-  The Norfolk (167 rooms)
The Norfolk Hotel has been one of Nairobi&apos;s most storied gathering places since it opened in 1904 hosting notables like American President Theodore Roosevelt, Lord Baden-Powell and Baroness Karen Von Blixen-Finecke, better known as Out of Africa author Isak Dinesen. Today, this 167-room hotel 30-minutes from Jomo Kenyatta International Airport continues to provide a sophisticated respite from the bustling nearby business district and an ideal safari departure point, complete with four impressive dining venues, an outdoor heated swimming pool, a full-scale health club, a ballroom and four function rooms.

Mount Kenya Safari Club (114 rooms)
Located 190 kilometers (118 miles) north of Nairobi, the 115-room Mount Kenya Safari Club showcases magnificent views of neighboring Mount Kenya and a long-held reputation for secluded elegance including a variety of cottages, suites and villas. Spread over 100 acres of landscaped grounds, the property features a nine-hole golf course, heated swimming pool, horseback riding, bird walks, organized trips to game reserves, fishing as well as access to an animal orphanage. Seven restaurant and bar offerings range from casual poolside cocktails to formal dinners accompanied by music and traditional Chukka dancers. Originally the retreat of movie star and Club founder, William Holden, illustrious members have included Winston Churchill, Bing Crosby and John Wayne..

Mara Safari Club (50 room tents)
The Mara Safari Club is located at the foot of the Aitong Hills, northwest of the Masai Mara Game Reserve, Kenya&apos;s most popular game reserve, on the Ol Choro Oirowua Group Ranch. This expansive lodge with dining room, lounge and pool bar is surrounded by lush gardens clustered around indigenous trees. The 50 tented accommodations include deluxe beds, en suite baths and other features of a top hotel. Guests can choose from a wide range of activities, including game drives, walking safaris, bird walks, fishing and balloon safaris over the Mara plains. A naturalist, traditional dancing and talks on Masai culture enrich this luxurious adventure.

The Aberdare Country Club (48 rooms)
Described as &quot;Scotland with lions,&quot; the unique 1,300-acre setting of the Aberdare Country Club encompasses moorland, thick forests and clear mountain streams. An easy three-hour transfer from Nairobi, this 1930s country hotel was originally built on the slope of Mweiga Hill as the private farm and residence of wealthy English landowners. The hotel&apos;s 48 accommodations are in luxurious cottages with spectacular views of the Aberdare Mountains to the west, Mount Kenya to the east and the plains below. Beyond a main lodge dining room with two lounges and a well-equipped conference center, the Club offers a nine-hole golf course, swimming pool, two tennis courts, riding stables, trout fishing and a wildlife sanctuary that abounds with zebra, giraffe, gazelles and even the elusive leopard.

The Ark (60 rooms)
Built in 1969 to complement the Aberdare Club, The Ark is a tree-lodge set in the heart of Aberdare National Park and uniquely shaped to resemble Noah&apos;s Ark. True to its ship-like structure, it overlooks the floodlit Yasabara waterhole and contains 60 &quot;cabins,&quot; accommodations with en suite bathrooms. In addition to a main dining room, lounge and bar, this one-of-a- kind safari lodge also features three decks of balconies and a lounge with 24-hour tea and coffee service, providing ideal vantage points for viewing game. A ground-level &quot;bunker&quot; takes you close to the animals for photography and cabins are fitted with buzzers to announce the arrival of the one of the &quot;Big 5&quot; at the forest waterhole.</narrative>
