   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Co-operative Bank of Kenya Ltd (Co-op Bank or the Bank) was established in 1965 as a co-operative society by agricultural marketing co-operative societies to provide access to affordable finance for players in the agricultural sector. Over the years, the Bank has transformed to a leading universal bank in Kenya serving all market segments including co-operatives, corporates, Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) and micro-enterprises. In 2008, the Bank became a public company and was listed on the Nairobi Securities Exchange (NSE). Today, Co-op Bank is the 2nd largest bank in Kenya by total assets and has network of 143 branches, over 8,700 agency banking sites and 567 ATMs. The Bank has four subsidiaries, including a banking subsidiary in South Sudan, and one associate company.   IFC will offer Co-op Bank a senior loan of up to US$105 million the purpose of which will be to provide the Bank with long-term funding to (i) support increased lending to SMEs and co-operatives, including Women-owned Enterprises (WOEs), and (ii) to promote affordable housing through expansion of mortgage and construction finance. The project will be supported by IFCs Global SME Facility (SME Facility) and the Women Entrepreneurs Opportunity Facility (WEOF).</narrative>
