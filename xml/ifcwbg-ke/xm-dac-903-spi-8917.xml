   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Summary Of Project Information (SPI)       Project Name:    Kenya: Kipevu II      Region:Sub-Saharan Africa   Sector:Power   Project No:008917   Projected Board Date:August 5, 1999   Company Name:Tsavo Power Company Limited (TPC)   Technical Partner and/or Major Shareholders    	The project will be sponsored by 4 main shareholders: Wartsila NSD Power Development Inc. (Wartsila), the principal developer, with 23%; Cinergy Global Power Ltd. and Industrial Promotion Services(Kenya) Ltd., who through a joint-venture will be the lead shareholder with 47%; and the Commonwealth Development Corporation with 30%. IFC is expected to take up to a 10% equity interest reducing Wartsila&apos;&apos;s share to 13%. IFC has extensive working experience with all of the sponsors.     Project Cost Including proposed IFC investment    	The total project cost is US$84 million. IFC&apos;&apos;s proposed investment is a US$17 million &quot;A&quot; Loan, a US$26.7 million &quot;B&quot; Loan/DEG, a US$2 million &quot;C&quot; Loan and up to US$2 million in equity investment.    Location of project and Description of site    	The project will be located on the outskirts of Mombasa, which is Kenyas second largest city (after Nairobi). The site is adjacent to a similar state-owned project known as Kipevu I, and near Mombasa Port.     Description of Company and Purpose of Project    	Over the past few years Kenya has been experiencing epidemic brown-outs and load shedding, a situation which is stifling economic growth. The system operates with practically no reserve margin and, with 80% of its capacity coming from hydropower, is particularly vulnerable to hydrological variations. Unable to fund new generation capacity, the Government of Kenya invited the private sector into power generation in 1996, choosing also to diversify into thermal resources.    	Kipevu II, which will be Kenya&apos;&apos;s third IPP, is a 74 MW diesel power station burning residual fuel oil No. 6 to be developed under a build-own-operate (BOO) scheme. The project was awarded to Wartsila following an international competitive bidding process. Although bid as a mid-peak plant to provide power locally and to act as a back up to the hydroelectric system, the prevailing electricity shortage in Kenya will require the plant to be base-loaded for at least the first few years of operation. The capacity and output of the plant will be sold to Kenya Power &amp; Lighting Company Ltd. (KPLC), the national transmission and distribution utility, under a 20 year Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) signed with Tsavo Power Company Limited (TPC), a special purpose project company formed by the Sponsors. Affiliates of Wartsila will act as the Engineering/Procurement/Construction contractor and the Operations &amp; Maintenance contractor for the project.     Environmental Category and Issues    	This is an environmental review category B project.  Issues include air emissions and ambient air quality impacts, noise, water supply and liquid effluents, fuel transmission and spill control, liquid and solid waste disposal, fire protection and emergency response, general workplace safety, and cumulative impacts from the project and the adjacent Kipevu I project. The plant will be equipped with a 45 m height stack, an acoustically insulated power house, and fuel oil storage tanks with complete containment to prevent spills.  A comprehensive Environmental Action Plan was prepared. KPLC is independently building a transmission line that is not directly linked to this project. IFC is assisting KPLC to ensure that resettlement associated with this transmission line will be carried out in accordance with IFCs requirements.    The  is  from the InfoShop.       Host country location of environmental documents    Tsavo Power Company Limited office in    Nairobi, Kenya      Date SPI sent to InfoShop: June 25, 1999   This Summary of Project Information is prepared and distributed to the public in advance of consideration of the proposed transaction by the Corporations Board of Directors.
