The line of credit from the European Investment Bank, which some Kenyan commercial banks are able to access, cannot be used for service companies.    Developmental Impact: The project will have the following impacts on development: provide a vital service as fuel is the lifeblood of the growth of any economy; improved service and competition in the transportation sector; increase in skilled employment (drivers, mechanics); and generation of additional foreign exchange.    Environmental Category and Issues    This is a category B project according to IFCs environmental review procedures. Key environmental, health and safety issues include source of water and power at fleet depot(s); disposal of liquid and solid wastes including sewage; spill prevention and secondary containment for above-ground and underground fuel storage tanks; monitoring for possible discharges from leaking fuel storage tanks; vehicle emissions; fire and explosion prevention, life safety and emergency response preparedness; employee occupational safety and fire response training; maintenance of vehicle fleet; recycling and/or proper disposal of used motor oils and grease from vehicle servicing; CFC-free air conditioning if applicable; and facility safety and good housekeeping practices. &#xA0;The sponsor has provided IFC with information regarding their methods of operation, as well as proposed mitigation measures to ensure that the project complies with all relevant IFC environmental, health and safety guidelines. Details of these procedures and mitigation measures are provided in the Environmental Review Summary (ERS) for the project, which was released to the World Bank InfoShop on November 25, 1998.
