It has since undergone two phases of expansion to its current size of 7 ha exporting about 14 million stems from 6 million in 1995. The company proposes to undertake an expansion of an additional 4.5 ha comprising of 4 ha of roses and 0.5 ha of lilies, which have had successful trials and a positive market response.

IFC will also play an important role in ensuring the company complies with the World Bank environmental protection guidelines through its regular supervision. The project creates employment for about 80 workers, the bulk of which will be women and will earn the country about US$2.6 million of foreign exchange. This is in line with the World Banks strategy of alleviating poverty and establishing sustainable local resource-based industries. The project will introduce high agronomical standards on the farm, which will ensure high quality export products and thus help Kenya to sustain its position as a quality horticultural producer.
