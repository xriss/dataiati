    <narrative xml:lang="EN">The primary goals of U.S. assistance are to strengthen Bahrain&apos;s interoperability for regional security and counterterrorism cooperation; boost Bahrain&apos;s maritime defenses against smuggling and terrorism; and improve Bahrain&apos;s ability to deny terrorist sponsorship, support, and sanctuary, while respecting human rights. The Government of Bahrain plays a key role in the Gulf&apos;s security architecture and is an important member of the U.S.-led anti-Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) coalition. U.S. assistance will help Bahrain maintain its critical support for and participation in the coalition&apos;s airstrikes in Syria, continue its steps to halt the flow of foreign fighters, and help focus the region&apos;s attention on countering terrorist financing. Bahrain is a major non-NATO ally working with the United States to facilitate a broad military alliance, operating across the Near East, and maintaining open shipping lanes. Without Bahrain&apos;s partnership, the United States would require additional deployed military assets to defend against external threats in the Gulf region. Bahrain provides the United States access to its air bases, allowing for the pre-positioning of strategic materials, and expanding exercises and training opportunities for the Bahrain Defense Force (BDF). In addition, Bahrain hosts the Fifth Fleet and the U.S. Navy Central Command Headquarters and provides protection for the U.S. military. U.S. assistance will further strengthen the military partnership and coordination while building lasting military-to-military relationships.Domestically, violent extremists continue to target Bahraini government interests, especially Ministry of Interior (MOI) personnel. U.S. assistance will enable Bahrain to more effectively counter and prevent violent activities, and includes a focus on adhering to international human rights standards when confronting threats. Ongoing political and social unrest underscores the need for the Bahraini government to address its citizens&apos; demands for reform in order to assure Bahrain&apos;s long-term domestic stability and prosperity. The United States continues to encourage Bahrain&apos;s leadership to implement reforms that adhere to human rights standards.</narrative>
