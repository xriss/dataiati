Components may include measures to increase the capacity of local service and advocacy NGOs and/or professional social workers; to establish public/private service delivery partnerships as well as family and community focused service models; to establish effective referral networks; to develop appropriate service protocols and methods for screening prospective recipients; or to improve public understanding and sensitivity to the needs of the vulnerable.</narrative>

This program area should include all evaluations designed and funded with foreign assistance funding, including the components of contracts with task orders for evaluations (regardless of the mechanism). It should also include all independent contractors hired solely to produce an evaluation(s).</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">The primary goal of U.S. assistance is to bolster Uruguayan engagement in international affairs, advance Uruguay&apos;s security sector reform, support military professionalization, and prepare the armed forces to counter emerging threats at home and abroad. Uruguay&apos;s commitment to international engagement makes it an important U.S. partner in global efforts to foster democracy, prosperity, and rule of law. Uruguay has a remarkable record as a contributor to peacekeeping operations and remains one of the top per capita police and troop contributors to United Nations peacekeeping missions. Military education and training is a key component of the U.S. government&apos;s commitment to enhancing security cooperation and strengthening Uruguay&apos;s national defense capabilities. This training also helps strengthen and maintain Uruguay&apos;s peacekeeping and disaster response capabilities.</narrative>
