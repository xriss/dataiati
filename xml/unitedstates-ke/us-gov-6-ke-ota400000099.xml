   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This award strives to establish a stable and predictable macroeconomic environment that encourages the private sector to make productivity- and growth-enhancing investments. This includes The goals of this project are to build the Kenyan National Treasury&apos;s (KNT&apos;s) capacity to oversee and manage state owned enterprises (SOE) investment in critical infrastructure projects, and to attract higher quality investment in the nascent Kenyan public private partnership (PPP) market in support of the country&apos;s continued economic growth and development. Project components will focus on: 1) developing an analytical stress test tool to monitor the financial performance of Kenyan SOEs; 2) transitioning the Public Investment and Portfolio Management Office (PIPM)from outdated, manual analysis of SOE default risk to automated, data-driven analysis through an information management system; 3) building capacity at the PPP Unit to develop high-quality, bankable PPP projects; and 4) promoting investment into the Kenyan PPP market through investor education and outreach..</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">In the last few years, Kenya has embarked on a comprehensive and ambitious democratic reform process, including the devolution of government structures and authorities. The goal of devolution is to facilitate a more accountable and participatory system of governance that will allow for broader-based economic growth and improved service delivery at the local level. U.S. assistance in Kenya works across sectors to support this process with an overarching goal of sustainably strengthening regional peace, prosperity and security. These sectors include democracy, human rights and governance; elections in 2017; health including quality and accessibility, infectious diseases, child and maternal health, and water and sanitation; agriculture; private sector competitiveness; education and youth; and environment including biodiversity, adaptation for climate change and combating wildlife trafficking. In addition to participating in several Presidential Initiatives, Kenya is a Relief-to-Development Transition (R2DT) Focus Country and receives assistance to promote resilience and climate adaptation in drought-prone areas.</narrative>
