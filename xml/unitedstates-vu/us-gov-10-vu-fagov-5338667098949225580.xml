    <narrative xml:lang="EN">Regional stability in the South Pacific is vital for promoting the viability of its fragile democratic states, and is therefore necessary to support transformational diplomacy. Weak governmental institutions and ethnic tensions leave these states chronically poor and the people largely without government services. Countries in the region lack the means to secure their often numerous and distant island chains. Although suffering from many of these challenges and the additional strains caused by ethnic tensions, Vanuatu&apos;s democratic institutions are an example to neighboring states. U.S. assistance will help Vanuatu&apos;s police force develop a more effective maritime law enforcement and surveillance capability. (Source: &lt;i&gt;Congressional Budget Justification FY 2009&lt;/i&gt;)</narrative>
