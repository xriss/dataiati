    <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Kyrgyz Republic continues to consolidate its parliamentary democratic system since a popular revolution in 2010 led to the first democratic transfer of presidential power in Central Asia in 2011. International observers widely heralded the 2015 parliamentary elections as free and fair, further demonstrating the country&apos;s commitment to a democratic system. The presidential election in 2017 will be critical to democratic development, as the country remains fragile and faces myriad challenges, including lack of viable employment opportunities, widespread corruption, weak rule of law and law enforcement sector impunity (especially in terms of treatment of minority groups), a persistent energy deficit, and a deteriorating social service infrastructure. The Kyrgyz Republic needs to address these challenges and demonstrate that democracy can deliver a better quality of life to its citizens. The primary goal of U.S.~assistance programs is to partner with the government and civil society to foster a more stable and prosperous country. U.S.~assistance will focus on economic growth programs that can have a demonstrable impact on people&apos;s lives and provide market-based solutions to address the energy deficit, as well as programs that support continued parliamentary development, judicial reform, and an electoral process that continues to reflect the will of the citizens. U.S.~assistance will fight tuberculosis and support higher education and early-grade reading across the country. U.S.~assistance programs will support greater economic prosperity and promote increased cooperation of the Kyrgyz Republic with other states of Central Asia on economic connectivity, security, and counter-narcotics efforts. U.S.~assistance will also continue to support reforms and tackle corruption in law enforcement structures. U.S. assistance will build resilience and reduce vulnerability to Russian aggression, increase European integration, and provide continued support for enduring programs.</narrative>
