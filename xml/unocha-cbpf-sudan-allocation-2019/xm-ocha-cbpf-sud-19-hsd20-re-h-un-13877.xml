  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project aims to respond to acute emergency situations in Kharthoum, including social unrest and  mass casualty, floods and outbreaks consequent to emergency crisis. In spite of political progress, the situation is still fragile and risk of protests, and demonstrations and violent confrontation remains. This year the rainy season in Khartoum resulted in unusual large scale and severity floods that so far, affected directly close to 40,000 people. However, the health threats such as outbreaks of water and vector borne diseases triggered by floods affects much larger number of people, in fact the whole Khartoum population.  The peaceful protests turned violent in at least two occasions when the Transitional Military Council tried to disperse the sit-in area in front of the Armed Forces HQs. The security forces intervention in these incidents ended up with more than 128 death and reportedly more than 940 injured. In spite of political progress. The current situation is developing on the backdrop of an already weakened health system due to the severe economic crisis affecting the country that makes the external support for the emergency trauma care and essential, time-critical and life-saving intervention. 

Since December 2018, WHO was the main actor along with MSF, and ICRC in responding to the health consequences of the mentioned situation.   
The proposed activities aims to fill in time-critical gaps of the response to acute crisis with a focus on the most vulnerable, women and children, ongoing in Khartoum through: 
	Provision of medicines and medical supplies for temporary health services that deals wirh flood affected by floods, and for the life-saving interventions at secondary level (trauma and emergency interventions) for people affected by crisis in khartoum
	Rapidly evolving stock for the imminent health threats such as AWD, dysentery and measles outbreaks. 
	Support the essential, life-saving Blood Bank and ambulance services for optimal and timely treatment of severely ill patients with medicines and supplies and operational costs for 24 hours and 7 days a weak functioning in areas affected by acute crisis.  
	Establish temporary health services for the communities affected by crisis, focusing on the flood affected areas cut-off due to road blockages.
	Community mobilization and behavior changes campaigns for mitigation, control and prevention of health risks. 
Improving the  knowledge and skills is cross-cutting across for all staff involved in the delivery of emergency service for affected communities. As cluster lead agency and through cluster mechanism WHO will ensure the coordination with FMOH, SMOH, local health authority, Sudan Professional Association, Doctors Committee, NGOs, UNICEF, UNFPA, and civil societies (such as NAFFER and Resistance Committee organizations). The development/upgrading of the SOPs that strengthen the coordination and the chain of command and control during mass casualty and other situations in Khartoum will be done through an workshop will all governmental and non-Governmental stakeholders.  will be done through an work-shop involving all governmental and non-governmental stakeholders</narrative>
