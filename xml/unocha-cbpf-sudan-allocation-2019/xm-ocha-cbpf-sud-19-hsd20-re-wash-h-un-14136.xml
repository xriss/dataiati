   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Floods and disease outbreaks have become endemic in Sudan. During these emergencies it is essential to rapidly intervene to prevent a deterioration of the situation. Lifesaving supplies and services ensure that the immediate needs of the affected population, besides averting life-threatening situations, especially in situations of floods and disease outbreaks, in this case Acute Watery Diarrhea (AWD)/cholera. Communication for Development (C4D) interventions are essential in ensuring the immediate action from the community and in facilitating long term support in preparedness and prevention efforts that reduce the risk of future outbreaks.

To respond to the ongoing AWD/cholera outbreak and to prevent deaths, communities must have access to adequate quantities of disinfected improved water, hygiene promotion and adequate sanitation. Most importantly, C4D interventions assist communities in understanding their critical role in reducing the risk of outbreaks and preventing the spread of the disease by participating in C4D research studies which analyze the norms and social barriers that contribute to recurrent outbreaks.  Health facilities must have adequate quantities of essential supplies, particularly Oral Rehydration Solution (ORS) and Intravenous Fluids (IVF) for the immediate care as well as chlorine-based disinfectant solutions, safe drinking water, adequate disposal sanitation facilities and soap to maintain hygienic conditions. Well-trained health workers and health volunteers in the communities are a key component of cholera case-management and mortality reduction during outbreaks. Communities, specially youth and women should be aware of the cholera symptoms, referral process and community level prevention measures.  C4D will invest in the existing community platforms in an effort to increase the level of engagement and to encourage community members to adopt positive attitudes toward prevention and the change of deeply rooted beliefs. Furthermore, C4D will work in partnership and in collaboration with traditional /religious leaders, media, dramas groups, youth groups and adolescents (i.e., girls and boys) to assure that the design of interventions are based on the communities norms, culture and access to information.

UNICEF Sudan Country Office works with the World Health Organization (WHO) and other partners to provide immediate, lifesaving water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH), health and nutrition as well as Communication for Development (C4D) interventions in affected areas. Since the beginning of the current outbreak in Blue Nile state, UNICEF has already provided key life-saving WASH and heath supplies. With the current escalation of the reported cholera cases, there is an urgent need to scale-up interventions.. The proposed supplies and services will focus on lifesaving WASH and health assistance - as well as communication for development (C4D) - for the AWD/cholera and flood-affected and at-risk children and their families. Currently C4D has become an integrating component in prevention efforts designed to encourage communities to accept the administration of vaccine and dispelling the myth around water chlorination and by promoting positive practices among the affected and high risk communities. The C4D intervention will ensure the equal role for men and women during the response and prevention activities.  Both women and men will receive information to encourage the positive practice at the household level and in wider community platforms.

The lifesaving interventions: 

1. Effective water chlorination of the existing improved water sources, treatment and storage of water at household level and promotion of safe sanitation and hygiene practice.
2. Effective health sector response with health facilities being equipped with the required adequate quantities of essential supplies and services.
3. Communication for development (C4D) to increase services utilization and social change</narrative>
