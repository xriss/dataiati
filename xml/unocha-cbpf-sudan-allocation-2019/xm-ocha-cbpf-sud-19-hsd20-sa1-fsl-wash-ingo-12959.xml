   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In line with NCA&#x2019;s strategic sector priorities, we aim to sustain and provide essential lifesaving WASH and food security services to South Sudanese refugees, IDPs and underserved host communities in Al Radom and Bilel refugee camps. The project will provide critical humanitarian support in food security, water, sanitation and hygiene promotion services for refugees settled at the high need Bilel and Al Radom locations in South Darfur. The fund will enable NCA to respond to gaps and complement ongoing projects in areas proposed. Up scaling and replication of sector best practice will drive NCA implementation. We conducted our own assessment in Al Radom area in March 2019 which showed that Al Radoum area and Bilel are home to South Sudanese refugees who are largely under-served with lifesaving service provision which is normally rendered to IDPs. The NCA assessment also highlighted the gap in livelihood systems in Al Radom where the malnutrition rate has reached an alarming rate. The SAM and GAM cases stand at 4.2 % and 17 % respectively. The gap in livelihoods is further confirmed by the recent March 2019 IPC classification, where Al Radom stands at level 4. This shows that the locality is critically food insecure.   In Al Radom, there are a limited number of water systems and are barely covering the needs on the ground. This has resulted in an over utilization and depletion of the existing water sources creating both severe needs and gaps in WASH services in the area, The SHF funding will enable NCA address the impending gaps and crisis. Findings of needs analyses and field reports have been used, as key reference material, to design this project in a strategic and systematic manner. The project aims to provide safe potable water for domestic use, sanitation and hygiene promotion and activities aiming at improving household nutrition to 46,564 people, 15,997 S.Sudanse refuges,15891 IDPs and 14,672 host communities in Al Radom and Bilel.  Major activities planned include provision of Nutrition focused agricultural inputs (milk goats), income generating activities for selected youth, new installation and rehabilitation of water systems, construction of household latrines, dissemination of hygiene promotion messages, strengthening of water committees aimed at strengthening and capacitating water management at the targeted locations. In Al Radom, NCA is implementing a SIDA funded Food security project which is focused on improving the nutrition status of South Sudanese families. Project outcomes showed that, considering the lack of access to land for the refuges, small ruminants such as goats remained vital sources of nutrition for families and especially for small children. NCA would like to upscale the successful intervention and cover a larger area to cover more needy families. The FSL intervention will be tied to the ongoing Nutrition project with other donors, whereby families with malnourished children will be targeted for the intervention. The target communities will be engaged throughout the project to ensure accountability and ownership. NCA will ensure that South Sudanese refugees will be engaged in the project as paid labor and running water systems, and   earn cash while implementing the project, to further strengthen their source of livelihoods.   Community participation and CLTS approaches will be used to maximize project impact. NCA will  its experienced local partner with the Sudanese Development Call Organization (NIDDA) to implement this project.</narrative>
