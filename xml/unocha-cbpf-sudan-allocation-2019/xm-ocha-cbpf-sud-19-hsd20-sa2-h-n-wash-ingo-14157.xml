   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Integrated Health, Nutrition and WASH humanitarian assistance to conflict affected and Vulnerable populations in Mukjar and Zalingei Localities in Central Darfur State</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In response to the growing humanitarian needs worsened by the ongoing economic crisis, protracted population displacements coupled with limited investments within the health sector, International Medical Corps (IMC) is proposing the implementation of an Integrated Health, Nutrition and WASH project in 7 health facilities and at community level in both Zalingei and Mukjar localities of Central Darfur targeting about 496,832 people including Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs), refugees and host communities. There is a reported increase in food insecurity within Central Darfur, with a reported 54% of households resorting to coping strategies which has led to depletion of their livelihood assets making many people vulnerable and needing urgent assistance. Malnutrition among children still remains significantly high with Humanitarian Needs Overview (HNO) 2019 figures reporting an estimated number of nearly 40,000 children suffering from Global Acute malnutrition (GAM) in the two targeted localities. Communicable diseases continue to cause high levels of mortality and morbidity in Darfur with occasional outbreaks of Acute Watery Diarrhea (AWD) and other diseases like measles, malaria among others which all require strengthening of disease surveillance and response systems to prevent possible high rates of morbidity and mortality. The WASH infrastructure in health facilities is still poor with need to construct sanitation and waste disposal facilities to enhance infection prevention and also promote hygiene within the health facilities and the communities within the two targeted localities. International Medical Corps is also proposing the strengthening of community-based health interventions and health promotion including Integrated Community Case Management to ensure that common diseases among children are prevented and treated within 24 hours of the onset of symptoms. Findings from the S3M survey conducted by Federal Ministry of Health in 2019 indicate that Central Darfur has GAM prevalence of 15.28% and SAM of 3.11% both indicators being above WHO emergency threshold for emergency above 15% and 2% respectively.  IMC has conducted SMART surveys in the neighboring localities within Central Darfur State whose results are similar to the S3M. For example, in February, 2017, A SMART survey in Guildo found a crude mortality and under five mortality rates (per 10000/day) of 2.43 and 4.32 respectively, while the GAM and SAM rates were 15.8% and 5.4% respectively. IMC conducted SMART survey in Golo in December 2017 the results indicated GAM of 17.5% and SAM of 4.1%. All the survey reports indicate that these communities are in dire need for Health and Nutrition services that warrants scaling up of the current services. In addition, there were also reported poor care and feeding practices of children. The IYCF survey done in Golo in January 2018, showed exclusive breastfeeding rates at 33% and timely complementary feeding at 46%. This is clear indication that more work needs to be done both at facility and community level in order to improve infants and young child feeding practices. 
The proposed health and nutrition project will be implemented in the following facilities and surrounding communities of Hamedia 1, Hamedia 2, Orukum, Taiba, Tereje in Zalingei locality and Mukjar clinic and Mukjah rural hospital in Mukjar Locality. The project will include health facility and community based activities including provision of primary health care services, Community Management of Acute Malnutrition (CMAM), Integrated Community Case Management (ICCM) and setting up water supply and storage systems within the health facilities, and sanitation and waste disposal to support infection prevention within the health facilities. IMC will work closely with a national organisation called TDO in the delivery of health promotion activities including community mobilization and campaigns within the two target localities.</narrative>
