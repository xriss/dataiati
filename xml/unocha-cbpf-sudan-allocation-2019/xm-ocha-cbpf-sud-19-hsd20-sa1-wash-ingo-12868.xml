   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Urgent Life-Saving Water for Drought Stricken and Neglected Qanab Locality, Red Sea State</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Qanab Locality, Red Sea State is a marginalised area of Sudan. This project targets 30.500 direct beneficiaries of the destitute host communities). The main objective of the project is to assist vulnerable conflict-affected populations in achieving their own food and nutrition security and improve their livelihoods and general wellbeing through WASH activities. Under WASH, the project will establish two mini water yards, dig 4 boreholes, it will also provide sanitation and hygiene services to the communities such as the construction of latrines in schools and conduct of CATS campaigns. 
The project includes a cash-based incentive for purchasing tool repair kits for maintaining water-points.
The other localities of the region have greater access for intervention so the Government of Sudan (GoS) asked IAS if we would intervene in El Qaneb instead of Tokar because of our history of targeting the most desperate people, their trust in our work, and because we have our own water drilling equipment and skilled staff for providing safe water for people, livestock, and, if the locals will be willing to diversify their diets and commence sedentary farming habits, the potential for agriculture. There is virtually no cropping. Communities are almost totally dependent on animals grazing. With so little rain grass seeds from previous years are non-existent. 
Since their is so little available safe water sources the situation of dying livestock, lack of grazing feed, historic lack of healthy diet is compounded by thirst. The Beja are forced to drink turbid and unhealthy water adding water-borne diseases to the grim picture. 
Without clean water personal hygiene and cooking is accomplished with filthy water. In the past, efforts to encourage communities to construct latrines in safe locations have been met with opposition from a people unwilling to change to these  wise  and common sense habits.
The villages in this locality are very difficult to access only rugged 4-wheel drive vehicles can slowly struggle along &#x201C;glorified donkey trails.&#x201C; Yet the lack accessibility is a big factor in neglecting these fellow human beings who desperately need the most basic necessities to survive and eventually thrive.
Other listed data based on IAS&#x2018; February 2019 Needs Assessment:
	The Sudanese Government has not run any public services according to the Water, Environment and Sanitation (WES) Line Ministry. 
	The people in this area are suffering from malnutrition due to lack of land for agriculture, lack of water.
	100% of community are not using latrine (Open Defecation) and not aware of the relation between water, hygiene and sanitation.
	There is zero personal hygiene in all the area. 
	Most water sources  that the communities are using are not protected (open hand dug wells)
	Almost all the mini water yards are broken 1 of five was working
	Hygiene knowledge was lacking with poor understanding of simple household practices to improve or maintain safe drinking water, and personal Hygiene
	All of water sources in some villages was contaminated due to the situation
	No water maintenance committees in place
	No hand washing facilities at schools
Targeted villages include Obo, Kumasna, Yublala, Nobahebi, Lakago, Gasheet, Tahadat, Agwam, Alaryg and Almudrush.
Activities:
2 MWYs, 4 Hand-dug wells, 3 School hand-washing units, 6 CATS, 6 school hygiene campaigns, 6 Level Water Maintenance Committee (including mechanic training with at least one women student) 1 amp 2 Sanitation amp Hygiene 6 day training which includes cross-cutting issues as well as gender inclusion promotion. Classes of of up to 12 will be 50% women.
For each targeted village will women will be included in the design and planning of the waterpoint intervention. The project will be a platform for promotion women&apos;s and girls issues and protection, IWRM principles, and environmental concerns. 
Gender Impact Assessments are carried-out for each water point.</narrative>
