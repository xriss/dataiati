   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Response to Cholera Outbreak in Blue Nile state</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">AORD has been implementing WASH services in Blue Nile State years ago and has gained considerable experience in this field. AORD has just proposed to implement WASH services in Damazine and Al Rosaries targeting 12,220 individuals (4,444 families) existing in 10 communities. (2393 Male, 2494 Female, 3593 boys, and 3740 girls). In fact, not all indicated groups are directly affected by Cholera, but however, they are positive cases reported in El Rosaries (122 cases) and 67 in Ad Damazine apart of which in our targeted areas in Yarwa amp Elhumara of Damazine locality and Gunnies, Karory amp Diwa of Al Rosaries Locality. All+ cases are admitted to the respective CTCs for treatments. Providing that Cholera disease spreads very rapidly and all targeted communities are very adjacent and interacting with one another, thus putting all surrounding communities at risk and are very much suspected of the disease.  This is why we are focusing on these communities precisely. the interventions which this project is addressing are varied but are complemented one another to jointly leverage the existing situation of the Cholera disease outbreak.
in this project, AORD will drill 2 HPs, one in each locality. 60 HPs operators will be nominated by their respective community to receive basic training on HP&apos;s operations and maintenance (30 per each locality). 
AORD will rehabilitate 500 HHs latrines (350 in Al Rosaries amp 150 in Ad Damazine) by way of providing new-build slaps mostly for those experienced difficulties to access their HH latrines and \or completely collapsed. This result could be checked out and emphasized by the Home Visit to be conducted by AORD volunteers. Likewise, 1000 new HHs latrines will be constructed through provisions of slaps and bricks. This intervention will target those initially didn&#x2019;t have latrines and has optionally and inconsiderately of the importance of latrines chose to practice open deification.
AORD in reverse will conduct 4 refresher training for WASH committees targeting 100 members (at least 51 % Female) to mobilize their entire community of the importance of latrines, water quality, flood protection, and handwashing, all of which will help leverage-positive understandings and encourage its practice. 10 clean up campaigns one per each community will be conducted to remove debris and mud whereby all facilities and cleaning tools will be provided and volunteers as well as village health and sanitation committees will participate and sensitize the community members to actively engaged in. to ensure involvement of all community segments and enhances subjective sustainable actions the project will conduct 10 health and sanitation committees training on hygiene and health promotions and vector control to involve 15 members, who asked to develop work plan following the training to ensure monitoring of activities, encourage community members to stick to the new communicated behaviors and avoid being retreat to old bad practices.
AORD will conduct 10 Hygiene promotion sessions per each community targeted which will include schools, Health Centers and or even public areas. To ensure safety-ness and quality of water AORD will further use (50 trained volunteers -25 from each locality to supply chlorine tabs (0.33 mg) to families those fetching water directly from open sources including Blue Nile river for 12 hrs. /day for one month. This task will supplement the awareness-raising sessions, home-visits and committee training. As such AORD will collaborate with the department of Health Services of the targeted localities to facilitate the provisions of this training.
With the objective being raising the awareness on environmental health and sanitation of the 5000 HHs, 25 AORD volunteers will pay house to house visits to all targeted HHs and provide them with knowledge related to the importance of latrine, hand washing and its consequences, ways to protect their food and all such stuff.</narrative>
