   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Strengthen the improvement of the access to sustainable WASH and education services as well as livelihood opportunities through inclusive approach for protracted affected people living in Kreinik camp</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Kreinik is a locality of West Darfur located 60km east of Geneina, and thus very close to the Chadian border. In 2004, it was a significant area of refuge for IDPs (22,907 persons) fleeing the activity of armed groups and inter-tribal conflicts that started occurring in 2003. Most of them settled in two camps located within Kreinik area &#x2013; and which constitute today two districts included in the locality. Currently, 32,600 IDPs live inside the town itself and share their districts with 8,510 hosts (SHF PDS Year 1 Analysis Report). Because of the insecurity and the remoteness of the location (the road between Geneina and Kreinik is in bad condition), public services are almost absent. Furthermore, for many years international and national NGOs have provided populations with relief assistance without taking into account durable solutions, thinking that the displaced populations would one day return to their home villages. 
During the 1st phase of the project, the strategy was to respond to the lack of basic services i.e. water supply, access to education and food security, in Kreinik camp. As stated in the final report, 5,394 students, 106 teachers and 101 members of PTAs of 8 schools have benefitted from TGH intervention in Kreinik through the distribution of school kits, the rehabilitation of schools and latrines in school, the implementation of water delivery system in schools and hygiene sensitization. PTAs received support to develop IGAs. These activities enhanced the learning environment, one of the key factors to reduce the drop-out rate. Moreover, a Common Vegetables Farms (CVF) for women was established to enable the production of vegetables in the area targeted. Hygiene promotion sessions were conducted, enabling to strengthen the knowledge about hygiene practices, thanks to the capacity building provided to HKPs among the community, the rehabilitation and construction of water points improved the access to drinking water for 27.907 people and to ensure the durability of the new water points, TGH created two WC and trained them on Operation and Management and Cost Recovery System. Finally, TGH implemented the activities related to the garbage collection system that improved the sanitation environment of the area. 
However, to enable the sustainability of these achievements, a close follow-up, a continuous infrastructure improvement as well as capacity building enhancement are needed. The 2nd phase of the hereby presented project was designed to respond to this objective to ensure a continuous support to the beneficiaries of the CVF, to the PTAs regarding their IGAs, to the teachers, to the HKPs, the WuCs and the WES, with the improvement of the garbage disposal system. 
The 1st phase responded to the more urgent needs, while the 2nd one will focus on the resilience of the population, to enable the communities to react to external shocks without the assistance of humanitarian actors. At this extent, the activities implemented during the 1st phase of the project focused on meeting the basic needs of the population in terms of water access, sanitation, food security and education access, while the 2nd phase will build the communities&#x2019; capacities to meet these needs in a sustainable way through the reinforcement of livelihood opportunities, the follow-up and improvement of all the soft components started during the 1st phase (WuC and WES capacity building, ToT, etc.).
The links between WASH and Education sectors are clear, as HKPs will conduct hygiene promotion sessions in the schools targeted and VIP latrines and handwashing facilities will be constructed. Moreover, the latrines will be gender-sensitive, respecting the SPHERE standards. Regarding the FSL sector, the school gardening activity includes both FSL and Education sectors, as the PTAs members will take part to this activity (capacity building) and the children will have access to a more diversify nutrition at school.</narrative>
