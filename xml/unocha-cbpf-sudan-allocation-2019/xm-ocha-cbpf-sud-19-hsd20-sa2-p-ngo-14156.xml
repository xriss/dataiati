   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project will carry out extensive consultations with local community and line ministries as an entry point for smooth project implementation. NADA embraces community based protection approach by building capacity of targeted communities through equipping them with necessary skills and knowledge to implement community driven solutions to their local communities.  Currently, NADA has established amp trained 3 CBPNs in Abujara, Haskanita amp Godat under protection project funded by UNHCR. CBPNs has already received their term of reference amp comprehensive training on protection, GBV amp Child protection(CP) risks, threads, concerns amp needs. CBPNs are organizing coordination amp consultation meetings on monthly basis. However due to absent of the women /community centres, awareness raising sessions on protection and GBV are not conducted regularly. NADA plan to construct two women centre in Abujara and Haskanita while rehabilitate the third centre which was constructed by NADA resources in Godat . Lack of having women centre with well designed space for provision of psychosocial support intervention including case management and counselling hindered the GBV survivors from accessing the urgent support /assistance. Women and girls will enjoy a safe space through establishment of three women centers Abujara, Haskanita amp Godat served as entry points for GBV , support identification of GBV survivors to benefit by referral to a range of services disseminate GBV information, raise awareness on social issues, and provide recreational activities and psycho-social support including counseling inside the women centers.  Recreation activities are considered as methodology for counseling and  means to improve psychological wellbeing. Recreation will be conducted by professional experts  The three centres will received about 10,400 individulas including hosting communities. In consultation ampcollaboration with NADA social workers, CBPNs members are conducting regular focused awareness raising sessions among targeted communities in open spaces such as markets- playing yards etc. To strengthen the community capacity amp ensure wider dissemination of protection, GBV amp CP information, the project will conduct 6 community based psycho-social support campaigns which will target a total number of 15,000 community members in the three locations with protection, CP ampGBV messages. The campaigns will be conducted using precise PSS methodologies such as narrative theater, confidential corners, flash cards exercise etc. This will allow NADA team to conduct structured awareness raising sessions within the campaigns as well as addressing some PSS community needs targeting round directly 1,000 individuals Project team will ensure wider dissemination awareness raising message through distribution of leaflets which contained clear messages on PSS. Enhancement of community capacity on protection will improve the community coping mechanism amp wellbeing. NADA has already set platform for identification of extremely vulnerable people (EVIs) through the training of the existing CBPNs and social workers on the conducting vulnerability assessment for persons with special needs (PSN). The project will strengthen the referral mechanism by identifying 600 PSN. The intervention will assist 100 individuals among PSN through provision of direct assistance including case management for identified GBV survivors. The remaining 500 PSN will be assisted through referral services. Project team will organize monthly meetings with relevant partners and services providers to ensure better access of the PSNs including GBV survivors. 3000 women and girls will receive direct support through provision of personal hygiene Kits (PHKs). Additionally, the project will disseminate awareness raising message to targeted communities through public awareness campaigns which address GP, GBV amp CP issues, risks amp concerns as well as messages on environmental concern, risks and prevention methods.</narrative>
