   <narrative xml:lang="EN">For collaborative impact, this response is complementing food security activities of other partners like WCH, WVI and WFP (see 2a). It is also complementing our SSJR7 response (FSL/WASH) in Manalor and Awul, as the acute food needs are surpassing the food assistance component of SSJR7/Crisis Modifier. Linkage with SSJR7 thus allows for quick start-up and enables longer-term food security outlook through provision of seeds, tools and restocking.
  
Considering local food availability/risk market distortion and insecurity food distribution has been identified as the most appropriate modality. 11,100 individuals (1,850 HH) will receive food for two consecutive months as follows:
&#x2022;Food items and ratios according to WFP standards and (COVID-19) SOPs  
&#x2022;Beneficiary identification and selection with community leaders, local government authorities, and project management committees (PMCs). Preference will be given to those who score highest on food insecurity scale, with special attention for vulnerable groups like women, people with disabilities (PWD), elderly 
&#x2022;Selection of safe and accessible distribution sites with community representatives
&#x2022;Notification about entitlements and feedback mechanism using AAP-system
&#x2022;Post distribution monitoring (PDM) to assess effectiveness, appropriateness and coverage of the distribution 

To prevent spread of COVID-19 prevention and control is integrated:
&#x2022;Awareness creation and messaging in local language during food distribution
&#x2022;Application of the updated WFP food distribution SOPs (e.g. social distancing, hand-washing facilities)
&#x2022;Provision of re-usable face masks and soap to all beneficiaries

Protection will be mainstreamed to ensure to Do No Harm and address protection issues:
&#x2022;General protection awareness events 
&#x2022;Training of selected groups (women, PWD, community leaders)
&#x2022;AAP System
&#x2022;Transparent selection of beneficiaries, with special attention for vulnerable people
&#x2022;Selection of safe &amp; well-accessible distribution sites</narrative>
