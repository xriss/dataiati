   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In the first quarter of 2019 the effects of years of conflict, displacement and lack of basic services continued to be felt in South Sudan. The number of people in need increased as compared to the estimated figures. Disruption of food production, sexual and gender based violence, fluid population movement, particularly internal displacement remained a persistence feature of the crisis. Communities showed increasing vulnerability as food stocks dwindled in local markets, while prices rose in advance of the lean season which historically runs from May to August. Inter-communal violence and cattle raids also showed a marked increase between January and March and displaced thousands according to 2019 humanitarian response plan monitoring report (January &#x2013; March). Western Bahr el Ghazal is among the states that saw increased numbers of displaced people in this period. Jur River and Wau counties are places where relatively higher numbers of reported returnees. Housing, livelihood, land and property issues were a significant impediment for many displaced people trying to return or relocate. Since the signing of the revitalized peace agreement in September 2018, physical movement continued to broadly improve and provides the hope of peace and cautious optimism. In Western Bahr el Ghazal, access improved to Baggari. According to IPC analysis of May and Sept. 2019, in Western Bahr el Ghazal region, the food security situation deteriorated slightly in comparison to the projections. The deterioration is mostly attributed to the impacts of the lean season, delayed onset of the seasonal rains and the conflict in Jur River. In spite of the delivery of the planned humanitarian food and multi-sector assistance in Wau and Jur river, the counties remained in crisis (IPC analysis, Sep 2019). Inter-communal violence has displaced more than 20,000 people since early March and has prevented thousands of civilians from returning to their homes in Kuajiena and RocRocdong, Jur River County. Hence, as a result of this situation the implementation of JR interventions were delayed until the area became stable. In both counties, Wau and Jur river, reduced market access due to worsening road condition as a result of seasonal rain led to increased food prices resulting in further widening of the food consumption gap. Moreover, despite sustained efforts, WASH needs continue to be widespread. Limited access to improved sources of safe water, inadequate sanitation facilities and prevalence of poor hygiene practices have left a large proportion of the population at risk of preventable diseases. Lack of access to WASH services further increases protection risks such as GBV and intensifies inter-communal conflict. JR partners in Wau (Dorcas, Help a Child, WDG and MHA) will continue working in the same geographic location of Wau and Jur River Payams with some adjustments following the context changes in the areas. As a result of relative stability and improvement of access around the areas of Baggari, opportunities to step up operations in this areas increased. In Baggari, Dorcas and Help a Child implemented only limited food distributions (including protection mainstreaming) in 2019 through Mary Help (MHA), a local partner. The Wau based JR partners are planning to increase the scale of intervention with other components of FSL, WASH and Protection in Baggari. The assessment conducted by the JR partners in the area shows that the general security situation has been improved as compared to the same period of last years. People are able to move freely but it is also worth to note that adults, youth and some children are visibly seen carrying guns as they run their usual businesses. People in Baggari mainly rear goats and poultry of local breeds. However, prevalence of diseases and scarcity of water particularly during dry seasons are the major impediment for the growth of the area. Farmers grow crops and vegetables but the prices of cereal crops are very high in the local market due to poor production and shortage of supply to the nearby local market. Pests, diseases and lack of access to improved agricultural inputs are some of the barrier of production and productivity. In order to augment the sole income source some households practice income generation activities but in a limited scale mainly due to lack of skill and startup capital. The majority of the households in Baggari fetch water from open sources which makes them vulnerable to various waterborne diseases. The few protected water sources are either seasonal or broken down and lack proper management. The knowledge level of the community on proper station and hygiene practices is very low. In Baggari, protection related challenges are recorded from displaced children, young girls are exposed to abuses (forced marriages by families in exchange for wealth) due to economic hardship. Psychological distress, a high number of female headed household reported, most of whom cannot single handedly support their children. The majority of the women interviewed in Baggari and other assessed areas indicated they lost their husband in the conflict and some have joined the forces and lost touch with families. In addition, Increased numbers of teenage pregnancies are reported. Parents have lost means of livelihood and can no longer sufficiently support their children hence increasing vulnerability of the girls who are easily taken advantage of. High number of school drop outs reported as schools got disrupted by the conflict. Some teenage children voluntarily joined the armed force as reported by parents during interviews although there are reports on forced recruitments. From the joint needs assessments it was found that it is feasible to assist 875 households in Baggari with the following protection activities: construction of a CFS including latrine, general sensitization on child protection, sensitization on WASH/FSL, What&#x2019;s up People/Children/Ladies/CPC&#x2019;s/Teacher and PTA. Hence, this will focus on children, parents, the wider community including attention for a safe schooling environment. Additionally, HaC will implement a DRA DIF awarded program in Wau and Jur River County called Build your Own Buddy: an innovative MHPSS method to help young children in need based on local knowledge and materials. This number (855) was foud to be feasible because many households in the area are still unsettled and move around Baggari. An approach that addresses protection needs in protection is then not feasible. However, through the protection sensitization meetings during the FSL activities of Dorcas, still many people that are unsettled will be reached with protection messages.</narrative>
