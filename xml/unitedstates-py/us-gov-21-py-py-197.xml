    <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Government of Paraguay is making significant advances in fighting corruption and impunity and eradicating extreme poverty. Encouraged by a recently approved Freedom of Information Law and widely available public notices, citizens are denouncing irregularities and sending a clear message that corruption will not be tolerated. Although high levels of income inequality remain, Paraguayan government programs are producing positive results in reducing poverty and in countering illicit activities in the northern region. U.S. assistance programs add momentum to these positive developments, helping Paraguay strengthen its democratic institutions and supporting more equitable and environmentally sustainable economic growth.</narrative>
