   <narrative xml:lang="EN">&quot;The proposed project will enable the effected population to meet their basic needs by providing targeted HHs with Unconditional Multipurpose Cash Transfers (UCT). 
 The critical need for water will be met through emergency water trucking to three of proposed five locations (these villages were deemed to reach more critical levels of need and therefore were prioritised), while the proposed hygiene promotion will complement the planned hygiene kit distributions mobilised from the WASH Cluster hub.
 
 Due to limited availability of resources the project proposes to target the most vulnerable and in need households among the IDPs. For the UCT, IDPs living in open area e.g. under tree or in makeshift shelter (not hosted by relatives or friends etc. in their house), HHs with chronically ill or person with special need member, pregnant/lactating women, and families of large size HHs e.g. more than 10 members will be prioritised. In addition, approximately 10 percent of host households who meet extreme vulnerability criteria will also be targeted for assistance. These houses have been effected by the severe drought conditions, the impact of COVID 19 and desert locusts. The project will assist a total 1,300 IDP HHs and approximately 200 of the most vulnerable host HHs with one month of UCT. This is very much required to avoid the tension between host and IDP population as they share the scare resources e.g. total 13,000 population in this five villages are currently hosting more than 20,000 IDPs and three of this five villages do not have sufficient water available. 
 
 While the emergency water supply will aim to reach all residents, approximately 9,746 people, in Odaa, Iidaan and Gaawiido villages. Concern has developed water sources in in Unsi and Malkaariyey villages under previous projects and it has been established that those are still functional and thus will not requires water trucking. For water distribution, temporary water storage distribution and water storages point will be installed at strategic locations within these villages following community consultation to identify sites. Hygiene promotion is proposed under this project with very limited budget to provide honorarium to community volunteers to complement the planned distribution of hygiene kits mobilised from WASH Cluster hub. In the given situation of COVID-19 and to mitigate the risk of WASH related diseases outbreak. 
 
 Concern and LLG are well placed with the necessary infrastructure to deliver UCT in Belet Xaawo district of Gedo region with prior experience on Cash Assistance in this region. This response seeks to provide UCT to 1,500 of the most vulnerable households. Transfer will be made via mobile money transfer, which ensures efficiency and transparency, is cost-effective and enables mitigation of protection risks. UCTs will improve beneficiaries&apos; access to food and other basic needs including safe water, medicine/healthcare, and shelter, while also preventing HHs from resorting to negative coping mechanisms, which erode resilience in the longer term. The proposed rate of $85 per HH is in line with the minimum expenditure basket for Lower Shabelle, aligned with the value endorsed by the Somalia Cash Working Group that Concern is co-leading. The response will undertake Post-distribution monitoring after two weeks of cash transfer to assess appropriateness and relevancy of the response.&quot;</narrative>
