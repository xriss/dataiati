    <narrative xml:lang="SV">The project has been able to complete successfully 3 output targets out of 5 and 100 % outcome targets which was 14 in total. Out of 19 indicators, only 2 output indicators (Number of courses developed and total number of certified EHS professionals) were partially completed, however the project has undertaken significant activities towards reaching the targets. The project has also helped to establish the EHS+ Center in the North South University (NSU), a leading private university of Bangladesh
&#xA0;
Highlights of the major results achieved during the project period: 
&#xA0;
Life of Project Output Targets
&#xA7;&#xA0; Trained 5,509 participants (target was 4,000), of which 2,477 were managers and 3,032 were line-workers from 933 unique factories;
&#xA7;&#xA0; Completed 1 business and marketing strategy (target was 1) the EHS+ Center;
&#xA7;&#xA0; Submitted 20 business proposals (target was 20) to different factories and organizations;
&#xA0;
Outcome Targets &#x2013; Health and Safety 
&#xA7;&#xA0; 99% of the trained participants (both male and female) enhanced their knowledge on H&amp;S (target was 70%);
&#xA7;&#xA0; 87% of trained participants (both male and female) shared learning with other employees on H&amp;S (target was 10%);
&#xA7;&#xA0; 68% of trained managers (both male and female) adopted knowledge and practices on H&amp;S (target was 10%); and
&#xA7;&#xA0; 94% of trained workers (both male and female) adopted knowledge and practices on H&amp;S while (target was 50%). 
&#xA0;
Outcome Targets &#x2013; Energy and Carbon Management&#xA0; 
&#xA7;&#xA0; 96% of the trained participants (both male and female) enhanced their knowledge on energy and carbon management (target was 70%);&#xA0; 
&#xA7;&#xA0; 80% of trained participants (both male and female) shared learning with other employees on energy and carbon management (target was 10%);
&#xA7;&#xA0; 55% of trained managers (both male and female) adopted knowledge and practices on energy and carbon management (target was 10%); and
&#xA7;&#xA0; 94% of trained workers (both male and female) adopted knowledge and practices on energy and carbon management (target was 50%). 
&#xA0;
Outcome Targets &#x2013; Environmental Management&#xA0; 
&#xA7;&#xA0; 98% of the trained participants (both male and female) enhanced their knowledge on environmental management (target was 70%);&#xA0;&#xA0; 
&#xA7;&#xA0; 83% of trained participants (both male and female) shared learning with other employees on environmental management (target was 10%);
&#xA7;&#xA0; 49% of trained managers (both male and female) adopted knowledge and practices on environmental management (target was 10%); and
&#xA7;&#xA0; 94% of trained workers (both male and female) adopted knowledge and practices on environmental management (target was 50%). 
&#xA0;
Outcome Targets- Build capacity of women in industry to improve their working and living condition
&#xA7;&#xA0; About 87% of trained women (both worker and manager) perceive the training as useful for workplace and home (target was 70%); and 
&#xA7;&#xA0; 85% of trained women shared training learnings at work and home (target was 70%). 
&#xA0;
The two targets that were not fully achieved were: 1) Develop 35 courses on environment, health and safety and 2) 20% of those trained through the project (4000 managers) are certified (800). The explanation for not fully reaching these targets it provided below. 
&#xA0;
&#xA7;&#xA0; Project has worked with the EHS+ Center to develop 28 courses (80% of the target) on environmental and energy management, health and safety. These courses were identified and designed based on need and demand expressed by participants, sector experts and brands. Considering few challenges such as&#xA0; this market for training was still nascent and professionals in the RMG sector were not ready for very technical training courses, time constraints for factory manager to attend full training courses, lack of support from factory owners to participate trainings courses and&#xA0; and distance of the Center from factories, project&#x2019;s team focused on diversifying the service offerings (free training workshops; free courses combined with an exam) using the existing material, customizing it to the needs of different groups of training participants and institutions.
&#xA7;&#xA0; Secondly, project has worked with industry experts to design and pilot 3 certification exams on EHS (Health and Safety Practitioner, Environmental Management Practitioner, and Energy Manager) for industry professionals. This was a &#x201C;first&#x201D; in Bangladesh as no standard certification exam or process exists in Bangladesh for EHS or OHS (occupational health and safety) Managers. By modifying the approach which include also managers and workers, project has successfully trained not only 5,509 managers, but instead trained 2,269 managers and 3,240 line-workers. 
&#xA0;
The project has also helped to establish the EHS+ Center in the North South University (NSU), a leading private university of Bangladesh. ISC provides financial resources, technical assistance and capacity building support to the EHS+ Center, while NSU provides institutional resources such as faculty support, facilities and other in-kind resources. In addition to providing financial resources, all three donors (USAID, Walmart, and Sida) have also provided strategic oversight and technical support to ensure the success of this initiative.
Specific initiatives that have led to these successful results include a strong but adaptive marketing strategy for the EHS+ Center, improving awareness of the presence and offerings of the EHS+ Center and expand networks to reach more institutions. Project has provided significant business development assistance to the EHS+ Center by out to international brands, local manufacturing groups, and building strategic relationships with organizations that are implementing ready-made garments (RMG) industry focused programs. In addition, has also worked with the Center to offer diversified learning courses to both professionals with technical backgrounds and non-technical professionals through full-day and half-day training workshops as well. 
&#xA0;So in summary, the EHS+ Center Project has achieved it&#x2019;s targeted results successfully.</narrative>
