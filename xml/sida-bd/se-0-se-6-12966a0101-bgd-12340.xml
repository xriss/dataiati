Support to mental health among Rohingya refugees and host population i Cox&apos;s Bazar, Bangladesh.

The Organization for International Migration, IOM, has applied for funding from Sida with SEK 20 million to implement the intervention &quot;Expanding the Protection and Promotion of Mental Health and Psychosocial Support for the Communities Affected by the Refugee Emergency in Cox&apos;s Bazar, Bangladesh&quot; during the period 2019-2021.

The main objective of the intervention is to scale-up Mental Health and Psycho Social Support, MHPSS, to increase outreach capacity and improve service provision towards achieving a more holistic, comprehensive and inclusive mental health and psychosocial response for both refugees and host population.

The programme  will work towards three priority outcomes in order to meet this objective:
1. Strengthen the national system in the provision of MHPSS services through increased coordination and knowledge management
2. Improve MHPSS coverage by adding and expanding outreach services and elements to the host community, as well as addressing the need to strengthen local capacity for adequately detecting and responding to mental health challenges
3. Strengthen the community-based and development approach of the MHPSS response.

The total budget of the contribution is 20 million Swedish kronor. No funds will be sub-granted.</narrative>

2. Improve MHPSS coverage by adding and expanding outreach services and elements to the host community, as well as addressing the need to strengthen local capacity for adequately detecting and responding to mental health challenges
3. Strengthen the community-based and development approach of the MHPSS response.

Outputs expected are:- Contribution to an implementation plan to address MHPPS gaps identified by the readiness assessment is developed jointly with the Government of Bangladesh (GoB) - MHPSS service delivery offered to beneficiaries at refugee health facilities and points specifically chosen to improve host community access- Strengthened capacity to identify, refer, treat and follow up severe mental disorders amongst affected communities- Promoted a sense of belonging in the Rohingya refugee community to restore social connections and well-being

Activities: Under outcome 1- Conduct a MHPSS services availability and readiness assessment- Provide support to the Government of Bangladesh (GoB) to develop an implementation plan to address MHPPS gaps
Under outcome&#xA0;2- Establish specialized core MHPSS team dedicated to strengthening outreach services for Rohingya and host community members, including recruiting and training mental health professionals, making resources more physically accessible to beneficiaries, and raising awareness around mental health care- Organize comprehensive counselling training/mentoring programme for community health workers- Conduct mental health assessments that will help to identify those in need of specialized services- Conduct resource mapping on existing clinical assessment tools for mental health response, helping to identify gaps in resources for addressing beneficiary mental health conditions- Mental health professional will develop a culturally-validated tool informed by findings of resource mapping and mental health assessment- Mental health professional will train 25 mental health professionals in use and application of tool to provide special mental health services- Core Mental Health Team will train professionals and community-based workers to improve identification of those in need of mental health support, as well as techniques for strengthening referral pathways to assist in their care and improve the mental health response system.
Under outcome&#xA0;3- Establish a Historical Memory Centre that is aimed at promoting community identity and local values; facilitating inter-generational dialogues by engaging children and young people with historical narratives; and finally, vindicating spiritual and cultural rituals that have been historically marginalized or prohibited- Develop a module on psychosocial development skills, targeting non-MHPSS professional community members of both host and refugee communities that are participating in other projects intended to improve livelihood opportunities or full realisation of their social rights.- Conduct 300 community-based activities to promote social-cohesion and integration, coordinating with other humanitarian actors such as UNHCR and UNICEF
The target groups are Rohingya refugees and host population in Cox&apos;s Bazar. The community-based activities will seek to empower women, older persons, youth, boys, and girls, as well as groups especially at-risk in contexts of economic, social, and political hardship.&#xA0; In the districts of Ukhya and Teknaf&#xA0; targeted populations will be children and youth (boys and girls), and older persons (men and women). &#xA0;
The project intervention is expected to lead to that people living in Cox&apos;s Bazar, refugees and host population, will have improved access to mental health, which will hopefully prevent outbreak of more severe mental illness and help them to cope with the daily stressors in their daily life as well as to strengthen their capacity to plan for their future.</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">Coordination with the Goverment of Bangladesh:
Regarding coordination and partnership with government, IOM has increased their interaction and communication with government partners after the COVID-19 restrictions were lifted. The IOM MHPSS team met with the Director of the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) in Dhaka and the Ministry of Women and Children Affairs (MoWCA) with the aim of supporting the centre in the services they provided for women. Further meetings were carried out with the Central Drug Addiction Treatment Centre, Ministry of Home Affairs and with the Ministry of Disaster 
 anagement &amp; Relief where IOM reiterated its role in supporting the government. Partners from IOM MHPSS, NIMH and DGHS met to discuss the current status of National Mental Health Strategic Plan and the technical task team. Since the plan has been already developed, partners discussed supports required in implementing it along with opportunities to strengthen collaboration between DGHS, NIMH and IOM MHPSS team aiming to improve mental health services in Bangladesh. Once costing is finalized, the strategic plan is expected to be endorsed by the relevant authority.
Additionally, partners agreed that in order to improve information sharing and
knowledge management between Coxs Bazar MHPSS community and MoHFW, as Cochair of MHPSS Working Group (WG) in Coxs Bazar, IOM will share regularly information from MHPSS actors on the progress and provided services at district level
(updated 4Ws and progress report). To improve IOM involvement in the implementation of the National Mental Health Strategy plan IOM plans to employ a national consultant who will work out of Dhaka. It will be the GoB choosing the consultant and therefore having an ownership in the
implementation of the national strategic plan.

Improve MHPSS coverage and community response:
During the first half of 2021, IOM continued to provide services in both communities, Rohingya and host through health facility and community support activities. In total 14,446 beneficiaries have been reached (9,576 F, 4,870 M), out of them 1,773 from host and 12,673 from Rohingya communities. IOM continued to operate through nine MHPSS outreach teams in Ukhiya and Teknaf camps and host communities supported by community volunteers who have been trained
and supervised on basic MHPSS, referrals, PFA and other topics. These previously trained 240 CHWs conducted 2738  activities during January-June 2021 period and reached 16,677 (13,120 Refugee and 3,557 Host, 1,707 M and 14,970 F) through awareness raising/sensitization  sessions on mental health.

MHPSS team continued to contribute to the system of identification, referral and follow up of persons with severe mental health conditions to ensure appropriate and complex support. 324 (155 F, 169 M) consultations were provided by IOM psychiatrist, out of them 248 for host and 76 for refugees, while referrals facilitated by MHPSS team. In total 6,108 (4,138 F, 1,970 M) 
 beneficiaries reached through focused MHPSS services, consultations and referrals at health facilities with various mild, moderate and severe conditions. IOM health staff who have been previously trained on mhGAP and other MHPSS tools provided 4472 consultations (3054 F, 1418 M) for persons with mental health conditions at health facilities during this period. To ensure quality of the services and technical support, regular clinical supervision was organized for MHPSS team members, especially for senior counsellors and social workers, who are engaged in provision of clinical services. Supervision was done by experienced national clinical psychologist who received various trainings and technical  guidance from Dhaka University and University of New South Wales in Sydney, Australia.

During the first half of 2021, IOM MHPSS team has reached 34,133 (18,079 F, 16,054
M) persons through 218 community support events/activities, out of them 8,324 from
host and 25,809 from Rohingya communities. The activities included awareness raising
about coping strategies and availability MHPSS services, psychoeducation at community
level, support groups, home visits, socio relational activities, sport and play, traditional,
cultural and art activities by MHPSS mobile teams, community volunteers and Rohingya
Cultural Memory Centre (RCMC) team. However, during last months of the reporting
period, many of community-support activities have been affected by renewed restrictions
related to COVID-19 pandemic.

Rohingya Cultural Memory Center (RCMC):
RCMC centered the voices of refugees by providing them the necessary tools, platform and skill-building opportunities to express the memories, aspirations and dreams (collective and 
 individual) that, together, constitute the Rohingya experience. A skilled RCMC team of creative professionals and mental health experts worked closely with the refugee community to build on their existing capacities in research, storytelling, drawing, photography, poetry,embroidery, visual art, woodwork, metalwork, basketry, etc., and to authentically capture their cultural heritage in text, audio, image, film, etc. During the year 2021 the Rohingya Cultural Memory Centre has focused on the followed specificactivities:
 - Community events
-The team is creating a toolbox of knowledge sharing activities which can be conducted
by mobile teams at various camps, or at RCMC in Camp 18. These include: classes in
Rohingyaheritage crafts such as basket weaving, pottery, carpentry, embroidery,
mandolin-playing, etc.
-Creation of multimedia content published via the RCMC Instagram and Youtube
channels, and the RCMC website (https://rohingyaculturalmemorycentre.iom.int/).
- The RCMC website was launched on May 26, 2021. A digital archive of nearly 1000
objects of Rohingya heritage ,profiles of all artisans engaged by the RCMC and feature
stories can be found on the website.
-The architectural plan of physical centre was finalized and approved by the RRRCs
office during this reporting period. Construction to begin once COVID restrictions are
lifted.

Gender aspects:
They have achieved a recruitment of a gender-balanced team where 7 out of 9 of the
senior counsellors who are engaged are women. This is important since there are more
female beneficiaries than men.  Despite multiple challenges in the recruitment of women, 47 women volunteers (out of 148 in total, including RCMC volunteers) community volunteers from the host and refugee communities were part of the MHPSS team. All genders were encouraged to participate to focus group discussions during the needs assessment exercise to share their needs and views and their active  participation was ensured during decision-making meetings.
During the fire response (spring 2021), mobile PSS and PFA teams provided support to women and girls who could not reach health facilities due to the lack of culturally appropriate clothing.
Mobile child-friendly corners in the health facilities encourage female  beneficiaries to receive counselling while they are with their children.
COVID-19 related restrictions in addition to existing gender perceptions hampered the already restricted mobility of women and girls. For this reason, the MHPSS team provided home visits and community-based activities, ensuring the inclusion of allbeneficiaries in the provision of services. Harmful practices based on gender norms (dowry system, domestic violence, exclusion of girls from education, etc.) were discussed during community-based activities with diversified groups, such as community representatives and traditional healers. The participants were engaged in the dissemination of gender equality messages within their communities.</narrative>
