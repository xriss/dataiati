   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Based on coherent urban regional planning, the City Region Development Project 
(CRDP) was designed to improve the urban environment and increase the growth potential and
environmental sustainability of two city regions, Dhaka and Khulna.

With coherent regional urban planning, the CRDP sought to close the development gap in eight
districts through sustained improvements in the urban environment impacting the quality
of life in 49 pourashavas (municipalities) and five city corporations with potential for
economic growth and tourism.

The expected impact of the project was the enhanced growth potential and environmental
sustainability of the two city regions, and the expected outcome was improved urban
environment and infrastructure services based on effective regional and urban planning.
The outputs were enhanced capacity of crucial urban infrastructure, improved urban
planning, and strengthened municipal management and capacity.</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Asian Development Bank (ADB) approved the City Region Development Project on 10 November 2010. The project is comprised of a loan of $120 million from ADBs concessional ordinary capital resources, and two technical assistance (TA) projects Strengthening Regional Planning and Governance, and Energy Efficiency Improvement. Project implementation was physically completed on 30 June 2018 and financially closed on 29 May 2019. 

The Local Government Engineering Department (LGED) under the Ministry of Local Government, Rural Development and Cooperatives was the executing agency of the project. ADB is Swedens agreement partner.

The following are examples of expected and unexpected results: 

- The project introduced an innovative solid-waste management subproject in Jashore Pourashava that turned into a successful model of the Pourashava itself showing a transformative effect (in making Jashore cleaner). 

- The water supply component resulted in (i) asset creation; (ii) production, pumping, and distribution improvements and system loss reduction, thereby providing 10,320 households in four project areas with regular and reliable service; and (iii) additional water quantity through 138.5 km of piped network. The original target of reaching 202,000 households with access to water supply was revised to 6,550 during revision of the design monitoring framework (DMF), and at completion 10,320 households were covered (157.5% of the revised target). 

- The sanitation component supported the improvement of 15 public toilets across four project locations. 

- The integrated waste management facility in Jasshore Pourashava resulted in asset creation and systemic improvements and developed safe disposal systems for sewerage and has reduced 71% of uncollected solid-waste deposits within the entire municipality region. 

- Besides the construction of new roadside drains, the urban drainage component rehabilitated drainage outfalls, reducing the incidence of waterlogging by 61% through 213.68 km of improved drains and 18.81 km of canal reexcavation in 13 project locations. 

- Because of the infrastructure development in the Pourashavas, property and holding taxes for nine Project Implementation Units (PIUs) were found to be increasing by 9% annually. 

- Energy efficiency cost savings were 7% in Mongla Pourashava and 100% in Savar Pourashava through installation of 3,063 solar-based streetlights. 

- The urban transport component improved mobility, including access to economic opportunities for the poor, by eliminating vehicle idling time and traffic congestion. The travel time in the urban center-based roads fell by 50.7%, but rose by 4.5% in city and adjacent areas. This increase is mainly because the number of vehicles on the city roads have increased since the road improvement, contributing to traffic congestion, which is a reality not to be ignored. 

- Under the urban planning component, the Dhaka Structure Plan 20162035 was prepared by RAJUK (Rajdhani Unnayan Kartripakkha capital development authority). This plan reviewed the existing Dhaka Metropolitan Development Plan, DMDP (1995 2015) and prepared a revised and updated strategic plan for the Dhaka Metropolitan Region for 20162035 considering the shift of underlying philosophies of spatial planning, the current situation, and future vision for the metropolitan region. 

- The project led to on-the-job learning for PIU staff, consultants, and contractors. Financial management systems were improved with double-entry accounting systems, municipal asset register management, and structured budgets that are disclosed to the public, improving transparency, accountability, and governance. 

- The implementation of the Gender Action Plan (GAP) was also successful as 100% of activities were completed. The training programs effectively reoriented the staff of Pourashavas toward the professionalization of municipal services and better urban governance. Safeguard compliance reporting, monitoring, and management were rated effective. 

- The project contributed to other benefits including environmental improvement, business expansion and employment generation, increased working hours, facilitation of from and to the market places, increased commodity price at growers level  however, these are difficult to quantify and are thus not evaluated. 

- The executing agency and implementing agencies have gained sufficient operational and technical capacity. The Pourashavas and city corporations were strengthened as part of the project implementation. Systemic improvements in the administrative capacities of the Pourashavas and line agencies have strengthened their internal processes, such as accounting systems and grievance redress mechanisms, transparency, and accountability of governance. The Department of Public Health Engineering (DPHE) has adequate human resources and institutional capacities for the operation and maintenance of water supply assets that were installed in different Pourashavas, and the water supply interventions have improved the system efficiency and minimized losses, enabling the DPHE to manage a more sustainable system focused on service delivery, benchmarking, and water conservancy. 

- The solid-waste management infrastructure subproject at Jashore Pourashava is functional and an operation and maintenance plan has been developed and human resources dedicated. The plant is already generating Tk200,000 per month from selling the compost produced in the plant. All the Pourashavas have benefitted significantly from the project finance and urban governance system and are continuing with their human resources and institutional capacity augmentation initiatives for better municipal asset management and governance. 

- The project has increased the land values from land pooling, slope stabilization, and water quality improvement, thus contributing to the higher financial revenue of implementing agencies. 

- The project is assessed to be environmentally sustainable as it contributes to water and fuel resource conservation, the control of vector borne diseases, and water and noise pollution abatement, improving the quality of life and the urban environment. 

- The project is also assessed to be socially sustainable, as the infrastructure interventions ensure continuous access to project benefits and economic opportunities. At project completion, local authorities recorded no residual environmental impact and people living along the project sites had neither submitted nor voiced complaints. The project enhanced the social and gender benefits for schoolchildren, women, and local communities through public awareness and hygiene promotion activities. The project introduced the womens representation quota as per project design. - The development impact is rated satisfactory as the project contributed to the impact indicator of increased economic growth and sustained improvement in the urban environment and quality of life in the project areas. 

- The provision of basic infrastructure and services in the project areas contributed significantly to increased access to economic opportunities, inclusive economic growth, social inclusion of the marginalized, and improved overall quality of life indices of its residents. For example, the improved infrastructure has contributed to income generation activities that have increased from a 21%40% trend before the project to a 41%60% trend after project implementation. 

- The project addressed the basic needs of the poor, particularly women, by reducing water fetching time and providing energy that attributed to economic and income generating activities. 
- The urban transport interventions have improved the riding quality and pedestrian safety, e.g., the time spent traveling has fallen by 50% in urban centers to approach the main roads (258.78 km of roads improved). The interventions have reduced waterlogging and installed energy efficient pumps and streetlights; contributed to urban planning for update of the DMDP (Dhaka Metropolitan Development Plan), which is a milestone for the government; reduced environmental degradation; and maintained gender equity. These factors are contributing to improved health and urban environment quality and are thereby helping to achieve the strategic objectives of the project.</narrative>
