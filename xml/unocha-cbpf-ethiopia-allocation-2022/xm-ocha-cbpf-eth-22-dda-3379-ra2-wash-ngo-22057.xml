   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Emergency WASH Response Project for IDPs  and Host Communities of Habru Woreda(Jara Re-allocation Site) of North Wallo, Amhara Region</narrative>

  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">UN-OCHA&apos;s 2022 2nd RA Allocation Strategy paper which is conducted in January assured  the conflict at the border of Tigray and Amhara regions escalated and caused displacement of more than 100,000  individuals mainly in the North Wello zones of Amhara region. I n the site more IDPs to arrive in the coming days and currently,  the zone already  relocated 22,000 IDPs in to Jara IDP site, and eventually relocate the remaining 36,000 IDPs who currently accommodated in the host community. According to assessments in Jara, North Wello on 17 March, the site is estimated to accommodate less than 2,000 people (according to minimum standards), yet over 14,000 IDPs have already been relocated as of 29 March. This has led to overcrowding, poor living conditions, and limited access to basic services.   The site is in an isolated area with absence of basic public infrastructure and facilities. There is no electricity or milling services present in the  site, complicating basic service provision and raising concerns for the contents of food distributions. There has been no restriction of IDP movements in the site. Site plan is already done. Accordingly, Afro Ethiopia Integrated Development developed Emergency WASH project to reduce mortality and morbidity due to high number of IDPs and limited access to safe drinking water, sanitation, and hygiene. 
An OCHA led multi-agency team was tasked to conducted assessment from 23-31 August 2021, to assess the situation and look for humanitarian assistance to the affected communities in Wello. The armed conflict in Wello has displaced an estimated of 106,000 individuals who are currently found in collective centers, and more of the individuals are reportedly living in host communities, according to local authorities, and the number is escalating day by day while the assessment is being carried.  Of which the one is Habru woreda is the one that have been affected by.
Previous surveys and assessments reveal that many communities in the Northern Ethiopia/Wallo  have been directly or indirectly affected by current armed conflict between TPLF and Ethiopian government. Habru woreda&apos;s IDP, and the surrounding communities, have been left vulnerable with inadequate water and/or sanitation services. Jarra site IDPs  been highly scarifying to get/fetch water and even the available water source is not enough for due to the increasing IDPs number in daily base.  
Reports indicate also that lack of access to adequate water supplies, reduction in increasingly cost-intensive (and sometimes inaccessible) human and solid waste evacuation, and use of often contaminated alternative water sources Habru/Jarra are already resulting in increased public health risks.
Accordingly, AEID developed emergency WASH response project for IDPs and host community of Jarra.</narrative>
