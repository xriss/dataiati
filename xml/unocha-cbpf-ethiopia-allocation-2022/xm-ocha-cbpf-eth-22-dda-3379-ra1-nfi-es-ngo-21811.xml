   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Lifesaving Emergency Shelter and Non-Food Items Response for 2580 IDP households In Gode and Kelafo woerdas of Shebele zone of Somali region.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The below normal and failure of the deyr/meher 2021 season has been observed in most of the Somali region. The region is disaster-prone and experienced diverse humanitarian crises that have aggravated the humanitarian needs in the region, and drought is currently the most significant crisis that resulted in extensive loss of livelihoods and massive displacement. Drought forces pastoralists to move significantly further than normal with their livestock to find water and pasture. After the first failed rainy season, the loss of livelihood caused by drought
also resulted in an increase in internal displacement. Somali region hosts more than 871,176 IDPs scattered in different zones and woredas of the region.
Somali region ranks second in the regional targets, having 3.9M people targeted. As the Es/NFI dashboard (published in October 2021) shows, only 1.4M peoples have been reached so far, which is only 37% of the cluster target (3.9M). In Somali region only 23% has been reached and the gap remains 70% with the remaining 7% under commitment. 
The project will target two woredas of Gode and Kelafo which are found in Shebele zone of Somali region. The proposed intervention will support the most vulnerable crisis affected individuals by providing lifesaving emergency shelter and non-food items for 2580 drought affected IDP households including affected persons with disability. The intervention will target HHs whose living standards and ability to pursue normal productive and social activities are low, and who are unable to meet this basic needs due to drought who need emergency shelter and non-food items (ESNFI). 

These all, the process will be done considering the COVID19 precautions both for OWDA staff and targeted beneficiaries in line with the current pandemic disease and its means of transmission. OWDA will ensure to minimize COVID19 pandemic dissemination by putting in place adequate prevention measures like facemasks, handwashing facilities, using sanitizer, and ensuring social distancing during the distribution. The provision of ESNFI is critical to the survival of displaced and host community households as they are at risk of violence, especially women and girls. As the needs assessment revealed women and girls are disproportionately affected by the crises and are vulnerable. Despite the provision of ESNFI, the intervention ensured gender mainstreaming in the designing of project components while integrating activities, such as awareness-raising and distribution of IEC materials on gender equality. While ensuring the involvement of women and girls in every step of implementation, OWDA will ensure distribution is conducted by a gender-balanced team while creating a safe environment.</narrative>
