  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Recurrent drought, flooding, Desert Locust infestation, inter-communal conflicts, displacement, and human and livestock diseases are some of the threats that communities in South Omo faces. Poor performance of the 2021 seasonal rains has negatively impacted water availability. Water sources, especially springs, and ponds have dried up and decline ground water table of wells. According to the Zonal Water Office, potable water coverage is at 40% of the normal coverage in South Omo. Water shortage is seriously affecting Dasenech, Gnangatom, Bena Tsemay, Male and Selamago woredas (over 85,650 people). There are 102 water schemes that are not functioning and need urgent repairs. Authorities estimate that they need 9 water trucks, but there is no capacity to cover these needs. Moreover, the seasonal and flash flood from overflow of Omo River has caused flooding in Dasenech woreda and displaced 45,395 people. Community institutions such as schools, health centers, and water points were also damaged by flood. South Omo zone is chronically and recurrently affected by cholera epidemics and other water borne diseases. This situation further aggravated by poor community access to potable water, poor hygiene practice, low level of sanitation facilities, poor access to NFIs and less improvement on positive behavioral change towards safe sanitation and hygiene practices. As per the Zonal DRMO report out of 288 schools only 45 have water facility, this resulted in school drop out of 6475 students in the current academic year.
The overall situation in South Omo suggests that more focus has to be given to improve access to water and essential lifesaving WASH NFIs, sanitation and hygiene promotion, and WASH services in health care facilities and schools to reduce potential risks. In view of this, the proposed project plans to increase the coverage of clean water, sanitation and hygiene services in the target five woredas of the zone. The five target woredas have been identified based on their high caseloads as per 2022 HRP WASH Cluster.

The proposed project aims to undertake the following key activities in Dasenech, Gnangatom, Bena Tsemay, Male and Salamago Woredas. Detail activities include:

1) Provision of water trucking in Dasenech amp Gnangatom Woredas benefits 24,000 (12,270F) through availing water trucks, availing water storage and arranging distribution points.
2) Rehabilitation of damaged water points - This is aimed to address lack/shortages of safe drinking water to 19,950 communities in five woredas. This will be done by rehabilitating 37 non-functional water schemes and 2 pipeline extensions from existing water schemes with construction of additional water points.
3) Enhancing awareness of communities on safe sanitation and hygiene including provision of IEC material, community and HH awareness sessions through audio vans, posters and HEWs/ community health volunteers and hygiene promoters.
4) Improving access to hygiene and sanitation facilities - Construction of 10 semi-permanent latrines at public institutions and construction of 8 wash basins around rehabilitated water schemes. Provision of handwashing facilities at health centers, schools, and other public places.
5) Distribution of essential lifesaving WASH NFIs to 7,500 households. The NFI kit including water treatment chemicals 90 days, jerry can 20L, bucket, body and laundry soaps. WASH NFIs distribution will be carried out to the most needy and vulnerable HH&#x2019;s, in schools and health centres as Sphere standard. Distribution of HH chlorine tabs in locations where river/pond water is being used.
6) Safeguarding and PSEA &#x2013; awareness sessions and distribution of IEC posters to communities on PSEA reporting mechanisms and staff expected behaviors. Establish a safe and accessible information sharing and complaint handling mechanism.
7) Post distribution monitoring</narrative>
