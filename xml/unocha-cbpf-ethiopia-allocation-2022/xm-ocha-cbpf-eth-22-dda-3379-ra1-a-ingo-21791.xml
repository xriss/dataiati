  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">East and West Hararghe zones of Oromiya Regional States are the two most populus zones of the region with over 6 million people(East Hararghe-3.8 million and West Hararghe 2.6 million). The geographic nature of East Hararghe zone is characterized as 8% high land, 25% midland and 67% low land with the altitude ranges from 500-3405 masl and the temprature ranges from 130c to 280c.Similarly,73% of West Hararghe zone is Agrarian whereas the remaining 27%(4 woredas ) are pastoralist.The agroecology of West Hararghe zone is characterized by 10% highland,38% midland and the remaining 52% lowland.The altitude of the zone ranges from 1200masl to 3600masl.Average annual temprature ranges from 20.50c to 240c.
Both zones are charectorized with erratic rainfalls resulting in recurrent drought emergencies leaving over millions of people to relay on rellief assistance every year. .Due to the huge population pressure,the population density of these zones is estimated at 0.025m2 per person with a land holding size of less than quarter of a hectare per household.
East and West Hararghe zones are recurrently affected by drought with its major impacts on food security and livelihood of the community, water for both human and livestock&#x2019;s and pasture for livestock. During the drought years, competition over resources has been very common among communities within the zones and across the border with Somali region. Such competition used to lead to minor and seasonal conflicts which normally lasts for short period of time and being solved as per the existing cultural way of conflict resolution mechanism mainly lead by the community elders from both communities.. The Assessment conducted by multiagency team suggests that emergency is on the rise and its impact is being reflected on the conditions of loss of livelihoods of the pastoral and agro-pastoral communities across all woredas of East and West Hararghe Zones.According to the recent multiagency Rapid need assessment conducted in February ,2022 west Hararghe zone show that following the complete failure of the previous belg crop and over 35% reduction of the recent Meher crop, over 900,000 people of the zone need food assistance. Out of these, over 450,000 people are those severely affected by the current drought. The food security situation is reportedly deteriorated in the 9-drought affected woredas of Hawi Gudina, Burka Dhintu, Gumbi Bordode, Meiso, Doba, Oda Bultum, Gemechis, Boke, Darolebu woredas of the zone. Out of the 9 woredas affected by drought, the 4 agropastoral woredas of Hawi Gudina, Burka Dhintu, Gumbi Bordode and Meiso are severely affected. Emergency food response is urgently requested for 451,320 people currently affected by drought in addition to the IDPs/returnees and PSNP beneficiaries for the coming 5 months starting mid-February 2022.
