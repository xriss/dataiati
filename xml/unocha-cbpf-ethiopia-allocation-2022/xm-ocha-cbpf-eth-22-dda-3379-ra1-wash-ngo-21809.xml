   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Emergency WASH Response Project for Drought Affected People in Five Districts of East Bale  Zone of Oromia Regional National State</narrative>

  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">According to Geremew Olika, Deputy Commissioner of the Oromia Disaster Prevention Commission, more than Two million people need immediate assistance as the drought struck across East Bale, East and West Hararghe, both Guji zones, Borana and other areas. As the common report of many actors AEID required to conduct quick assessment. According to the assessment woredas in East Bale (Saweyena, Rayitu, Laga Hidha, Gololcha, Ginnir, Dawa sarar amp Dawa 
Kachen) Bale (Delomena, Medawelabu, Guradamole amp Goro) needs immediate WASH assistance for human and animals. Data from the grass root shows, many animals have been died because of the drought. Similarly accourding to UN-OCHA&apos;s drought update#2, the drought is affecting 6.8 people and 2million livestock across the drought affected areas in Ethiopia, 2.9 million  people in the 76 drought affected woredas of Oromia of which 2.6 million needs immediate response. For example, Jeylan&#x2019;s figures show that 270,000 people in East Bale Zone are in need of emergency food and  WASH  assistance. He estimates that half of the around 10,000 cattle in East Bale have already perished. In an interview with Ethiopia Insight in late January, Mustefa Umer, a farmer from Rayitu Wereda, said: &#x201C;This year, we have seen a wave of massive drought and, as a result, our lands did not produce any crops, and we don&#x2019;t have any sources of drinkable water either for us or for our animals. It is infuriating to think that the current conditions will force us to leave the rural areas and that our lands will be left as ruins.&#x201D; To this regard, the purpose of this intervention is to contributing to  the WASH response under way by various humanitarian actors in East Bale and Bale zones of the above mentioned woredas. The project will focus on life saving interventions via provision of safe water by  water trucking, rehabilitation of schemes by water pipelines, water points and spring boxes,  installation of water storage tankers, provision and distribution of WAASH NFIs including water treatment chemicals, provision of hygiene kits, hygiene promotion/publication and distribution of IEC/BCC materials which are gender and age sensitive/,  construction and/or rehabilitation of sanitation facilities including  gender and disability inclusive semi-permanent latrines, distribution and installation of handwashing facilities with pedals.  In this project 20,000 affected people and 2000 livestock will get the service. the project covers five woredas from the East Bale zone(  Saweyena, Rayitu, Laga Hidha, Dawa Kachen and Dawa Sarere ). Out of the total people  targeted in East Bale  zone 4000 people are targeted from each woreda. The number of females targeted are 10,200 and the number of males is 9,800. AEID implements the activities  by giving priority for the vulnerable community members( women, children, disabilities, girls, minorities and elders) .In addition, when the hygiene promotion campaigns  are  conducted WASHCO re-establishment and trainings also be given considering gender balance and WASH Cluster standards.</narrative>
