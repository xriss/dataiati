   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project aims to further scale-up the provision of support and wellbeing of crisis-affected populations in displacement-affected locations in Wag Hamra zone through Camp Coordination and Camp Management (CCCM).  The proposed CCCM intervention will include all four pillars of CCCM including site planning and development, coordination and information management, community participation and capacity building). The intervention aims to improve service provision in sites, coordination of response and increase the capacity of local stakeholders involved in CCCM activities. COVID mitigation will be mainstreamed into site management through Risk Communication amp Community Engagement (RCCE), especially with and through community self-governance structures, site improvements that contribute to infection prevention and control (IPC), such as crowd control measures, decongestion and/or partitioning of communal living spaces.

The project beneficiaries are displaced persons who have fled the ongoing conflict in the Northern part of Ethiopia since November 2020 with additional IDPs still arriving in Wag Hamra. Most people are displaced from woredas and kebeles Wag Hamra Zone bordering Tigray Region while some are from North Wollo Zone and from inside Tigray Region. While the project primarily targets IDPs, the host communities will also be reached through community participation activities such as Risk Communication on COVID 19 prevention. The total number of beneficiaries to be reached through the project is 12,805 individuals (11,854 IDPs and 950 host community members) with 50.1% female and 49.9% male sex disaggregation. 

Activities will be conducted through IOM&#x2019;s direct implementation and a local implementing partner Positive Action For development (PAD). IOM will work closely with  Positive Action For development (PAD), a national NGO, primarily on activities related to Site/Area Coordination and Information Management and Community Participation/Self-Governance of CCCM. In addition, IOM will support PAD to implement Site Development, Maintenance, and Upgrades, according to needs identified during the site planning and feasibility assessments. These upgrades may include installation of fencing, installation of communal facilities, etc. The reason for the collaboration between IOM and PAD is to develop the capacity of the organization as a CCCM partner through coaching and mentoring. The CCCM Cluster was established in 2021 in Ethiopia, and NGOs with capacity to implement quality CCCM programming are still limited. This collaborative project will simultaneously serve the community in the targeted sites, and support sectoral capacity building for PAD. Eventually, IOM can transition out of the role as CCCM partner in these sites, and PAD can take over the role.

CCCM&#x2019;s four pillars include:

 Site/Area Coordination and Information Management, including meetings organized at displacement locations (i.e. Site amp Woreda/Sub-City levels), sharing of site and area-level information products, and advocacy for assistance.
 Site Planning, Development, Maintenance and Upgrades, such as site feasibility assessments, design of site plans for new, converted or extended sites partitioning of communal living spaces installation of communal facilities, partitioning of rooms to improve privacy, Infection prevention and Control (IPC) measures, and other measures for the safety, security and dignity of targeted IDPs
 Community Participation/Self-Governance, including through support of community self-governance structures, running of a Community Feedback Mechanism (CFM), mainstreaming protection, and awareness raising.
 Capacity Building of key stakeholders (for staff, authorities, partners and other stakeholders) on key CCCM concepts and protection mainstreaming.</narrative>
