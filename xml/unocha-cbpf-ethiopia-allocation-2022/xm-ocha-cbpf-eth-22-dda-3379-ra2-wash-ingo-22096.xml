   <narrative xml:lang="EN">WASH Emergency Response for IDPS  in Jara Collective Center, Habru woreda</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Amhara Region Government is facilitating the relocation of hundreds of thousands of people displaced mainly from Tigray and bordering areas due to conflict and violence. One such effort is the relocation of an estimated 60,000 IDPs in Raya Kobo Woreda of North Wollo Zone to Jara IDP site in Dire Roka Kebele of Habru Woreda - which started on 14 March. Currently, Jara site is sheltering more than 23,100 people, and more IDPs are expected to arrive at the camp in the days and months ahead.  The Government of Ethiopia, with partners&#x2019; support, has been providing lifesaving services to the IDPs. However, the growing needs is by far greater than the ongoing efforts. In particular, the WASH response at the camp is surrounded by challenges/problems ranging from lack of reliable water source, fuel shortage, insufficient and short-term WASH facilities, solid/liquid waste management problems as well as non-existent children and dignity kits.  These challenges, compounded by the growing number of IDPs, the need for a higher standard for WASH infrastructure work, and camp management problems have left huge gaps and unmet needs that call for additional capacity and funding.  To respond to the WASH needs of IDPs at Jara site and to implement activities under this proposal, CRS teams up with its local partner Ethiopian Catholic Church Social and Development Commission Coordination Office of Bahirdar-Dessie (ECC-SDCOBD).  
For CRS and its partner (ECC-SDCOBD), the current activity will be among the many projects that they have implemented together, and a continuation of WASH response activities they have been undergoing at Jara IDP site with fund from RRM/UNICEF.

The overall objective of this response is to provide a lifesaving emergency WASH response for 33,000 people in the Jara site. The project aims to improve access to reliable safe water as well as appropriate sanitation and hygiene services thereby reducing the risk of diarrhea and infectious diseases. Furthermore, the project will mainstream protection with a focus on ensuring personal protection and safety of vulnerable groups. Also, the project will be accountable to concerned stakeholders, to the affected population in particular. In line with the 2022 UNOCHA Second Round Ethiopia Humanitarian Fund Standard Allocation strategy paper and WASH Cluster priorities, the project will implement the following activities: 
	Emergency water provision through Water trucking (short- term)
	Water supply system expansion (reservoir construction, pressure line and distribution line works) with complementary funding from EHF/AEID, USADI/BHA amp UNICEF/RRM for borehole drilling and solarization of scheme
	Water storage capacity improvement work 
	Provision of fuel to Hara/Woldiya water utilities
	Provision/distribution of essential life-saving WASH NFIs.
	Construction of semi-permanent latrines and shower houses 
	Sanitation and hygiene promotion works 

The project will be implemented for six-months period(20 May-20 November,2022) and will directly benefit 33,000 people (5,940 Men, 7,260 Women, 9,570 Boys, and 10,230 Girls). 

The project will partner with existing UNICEF/RRM and USAID/BHA, AEID (EHF), and other responding agencies in order to improve the quality of response.</narrative>
