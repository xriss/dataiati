   <narrative xml:lang="EN">TO IMPROVE THE LIVING CONDITIONS AND INCLUSION OF SYRIAN REFUGEES AND MOST VULNERABLE JORDANIANS WITH DISABILITIES IN MAFRAQ GOVERNORATE, ZA&apos;ATARI AND AZRAQ REFUGEE CAMPS.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The overall objective is to improve the living conditions and inclusion of women, girls, boys and men (WGBM) with disabilities, with a particular focus on youth (MampW between 15 - 25) amp children (BampG under 18), W with disabilities, elderly W and M with functional limitations among Syrian refugees and most vulnerable Jordanians in Mafraq Governorate, Zaatari amp Azraq refugee camps. To do so, this project aims to achieve the following:
1- Distribute assistive devices as per the identified individual needs of WGMB with disabilities assessed in Mafraq Governorate, Zaatari and Azraq refugee camps, acknowledging afore-mentioned priorities.
2- Provide specialized physiotherapy services for GampB (under 18 years) with disabilities inside Zaatari amp Azraq camps.
3- Raise awareness among WGMB with disabilities, their caregivers amp families as well as other community members about the rights of the people with special needs, the specialized services provided in Zaatari amp Azraq camps available to WGMB with special needs, the importance of integration amp inclusion of WGMB with disabilities amp the Rights of persons with disability (PwDs) in Mafraq Governorate, Zaatari and Azraq camps.
4-Train amp raise the capacity of Syrian volunteers in identifying PwDs, recognizing their rights, needs amp protection risks in supporting the work of technical staff in advocating for the rights amp inclusion of PWDs within their community.
5-Provide level 2 (Community and Family supports), L-3 (Focused non-specialized support) amp L-4 (Specialized services) MHPSS support to parents and caregivers of PwD amp to CwD and FPSC personel in the field.
6-Set up a long-term inclusive theatre group in Azraq camp for GampB (aged 11-16) to tackle the risks facing some children amp youth with disabilities of under - development, dependence and ultimate social exclusion amp to act as a model for inclusion in the camps amp stepping stone for children towards engagement in other recreational amp educational programs. Further develop the existing theatre group &#x2018;Mark of Hope&#x2019; in Zaatari camp to ensure long term sustainability of the intervention so as they can facilitate more independently their own activities amp performances that teach, foster amp promote inclusion.
8-To actively engage youth within the camp communities to facilitate community based activities (CBA) initiatives that meet the needs of people within the community while also promoting inclusion, build their own capacities amp provide new opportunities/ improve the lifestyles for members of the community.
9-To provide a safe space in Azraq camp for PwDs amp to facilitate MHPSS, a range of recreational amp CBA that allows WGBM to interact with peers amp engage in social, recreational, educational amp community activities.
10-Set up a CBCM about SEA for FPSC in order to prevent any kind of abuse/aggression on the rights holders and provide a self support material (global standards material) for FPSC workers in the field .
To reach these objectives, while guaranteeing the quality amp the relevance of the implemented activities, FPSC will adopt a case-by-case approach for all secondary health interventions based on an individual assessment of each beneficiary in order to determine the exact needs and diagnosis of the person. FPSC will furthermore work in cooperation with other agencies in the camps amp those working in the Mafraq Governorate in order to avoid duplication and maximize effectiveness of the intervention in targeting the individuals most in need. This project addresses the current scarcity in the provision of various services to PwD in Zaatari amp Azraq camps amp Mafraq Governorate. Our priority as regards the secondary health services part of this project is to address the needs of G, B and W with physical disabilities, amp elderly persons with severe functional limitations due to aging or serious chronic diseas</narrative>
