   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Livestock is the main asset for Iraqis in the rural areas and to some extent urban neighborhoods, as they are used both as means of generating income and as a source of food and nutrition. Livestock related livelihoods and associated food supply chains suffered major disruptions under the occupation of ISIL. According to the Ministry of Agriculture in Ninewa, the livestock population is estimated as follows: sheep, goats and cattle are 2,500,000, 300,000 and 180,000 respectively. The last livestock census was conducted in 2008 and since that time herd sizes and livestock ownership has been based on estimates till now. The Damage and loss assessment conducted by FAO in February 2016, showed that a considerable number of livestock was either abandoned and/or looted. It was noted that up to 45% sheep and goats and up to 40% cows were lost. While poultry suffered the highest mortality of about 90%. The livestock medicine/drugs, vaccines and other veterinarian services that were previously available from the government are no longer affordable because of lack of finance. The animal fodder/feed is either unavailable and /or very expensive and small herders are unable to afford it under the current circumstances (FAO 2016).

Livestock is one of the main pillars of the agriculture sector in Iraq, includes cattle, sheep, goats and buffaloes. According to an Iraq-financed livestock survey undertaken between 2008 and 2009 by the Federal Ministry of Agriculture (MoA) and the Central Statistics Office, in collaboration with the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), the population of livestock was 2.55 million cattle, 7.72 million sheep, 1.47 million goats and 0.29 million buffaloes at the time of the study. These numbers clearly demonstrate the economic importance of small ruminants and the great potential it holds through providing livelihoods and employment opportunities in the productive and associated activities. More than 30 percent of sheep and goat herds of Iraq are found in Ninewa, Salah Al Din and Duhok Governorates. Unfortunately, livestock in Iraq has been adversely affected by the ongoing conflict and wars. Many factors have led to the loss of a number of animals, the deterioration of genetic resources and poor management leading to low production rates. These include the cessation of breeding and genetic improvement programmes in the country infections by different types of animal diseases such as peste des petits ruminants (PPR), foot-and-mouth d

The provision of vaccinations and animal fodder/feeds is necessary in order to ensure healthy and productive livestock that would continue to produce milk, especially for children and lactating mothers, provide meat for food and income. The sector however is largely affected by the current conflict and the vulnerable households are unable to provide feed for the livestock due to low purchasing power and at the same time are unable to afford vaccinations in order to maintain health of livestock and prevent the spread of Brucellosis to humans.

The target for vaccinations includes IDPs, returnees and host community households with livestock residing and fleeing conflict in Ninewa districts or its surroundings. While animal feed will target those vulnerable displaced and returnee herders, the entire family will benefit from this assistance with special attention given to women-headed families, children who normally depend on livestock and dairy products to improve their food security and nutrition.</narrative>
