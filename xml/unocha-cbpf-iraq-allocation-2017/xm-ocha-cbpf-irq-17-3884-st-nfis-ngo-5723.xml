   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Windows and Workers is a fast, low-cost/high impact project that restores dignified shelter to men, women and children who have returned, remained or are being hosted in Al Khadra, East Mosul. The two outputs are replacing broken and blown-out windows and curtains, and sourcing workers from the community to conduct and drive the repairs, providing employment and income for 40 vulnerable individuals, as well as injecting additional cash-flow into the local economy.

1000 homes will receive new windows, and curtains installed, reaching an estimated 6000 beneficiaries. CNSF aims to target those most vulnerable first: families who are hosting those that have fled violence in West Mosul and female-headed households.. Additionally, a centre for the manufacturing of curtains by women in the community will be established, with the goal to provide training that enables future livelihoods beyond the lifecycle of this project.

The project aligns with the strategic objectives 2, 3 and 4 of the Humanitarian Response Plan Iraq 2017, and with the second-line priorities of the Shelter/NFI Cluster 2017 (as outlined below). CNSF is a small, local NGO, and has a reputation of reaching those in hard-to-reach areas. It&#x2019;s activities in Mosul align with the HRP strategic priority 1, as part of the larger response in Iraq. With regard to the IHPF 2017 First Standard Allocation priorities, the project takes place in a hard-to-reach area, where new displacement is expected to continue. There has been more than 5000 new IDPs and returnees arriving in Al Khadra in the last few weeks.

The summers and winters in Mosul are brutal without adequate shelter: families need windows and curtains for protection against the heat and sun, or rain and cold. Curtains are a simple addition to make a house a home, and &#xA0;particularly important for privacy, weatherproofing, and for sleep (please see attached Field Assessment). They can also be adapted to provide screens in over-crowded locations, providing protection, privacy and dignity. One community member, when asked about the importance of not only windows but curtains, simply replied &#x2018;No windows without curtains.&#x2019; 

Providing an opportunity for women to work, as well as men, is also needed within Mosul, especially for female-headed-households. &#xA0;This was supported by the community feedback we received in our formal assessments for this proposal in conjunction conversations we have had informally throughout our long working history within the community. People are at a loss with how to find sources of income - let alone find money to repair windows - and female-headed households and young men and women feel particularly vulnerable. The fear is becoming even more so without hope or a sense of purpose. Income-generating activity and learning new skills is a simple but important step towards overcoming trauma, and promoting social cohesion through rebuilding your own life, and those of others. 

CNSF&#x2019;s access and reputation, and previous work in the community, we are well placed to conduct this project. Since January of this year CNSF has conducted immediate shelter restoration in Al Khadra by covering exposed windows with tarpaulin and plastic sheeting, employing local workers and providing assistance and support. To date more than 550 home have received emergency support in this manner, and we currently employ 9 full time staff from East Mosul. This new project aims to take the next step and ensure families have a more secure, private and dignified home. Al Khadra was shelled heavily, due to the strategic location and presence of IS and later, ISOF forces. Windows were blown out by bomb-blasts or indirect fire, curtains are non-existent, or shredded by sniper fire.

CNSF is the only actor providing this aspect of shelter relief, based on information gathered through direct needs assessment and cluster coordination meetings.</narrative>
