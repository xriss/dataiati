  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project aims to provide first line multi-purpose cash assistance to 410 households (approx. 2,460 people) displaced by military operations against Islamic State (IS) in Mosul, and second line cash assistance to 210 households (approx. 1,260 people) in recently liberated areas to assist returnees, vulnerable conflict affected host community, and highly vulnerable protracted displaced persons who are in danger of being without essential services. This will include 10% host families. These activities contribute directly to the MPCA Objectives 1 and 2 and will be carried out as a sequenced response in line with the 2017 HRP MPCA strategy, conducting activities that follow the 1st and 2nd line response strategies. First line assistance will involve a single payment of $400 to each household and second line assistance will involve three payments of $400 to extremely vulnerable households over a period of three months to help them meet their immediate needs, or 2 payments of $400 should beneficiaries be identified who have already received 1st line assistance from another actor. The planned geographic locations of cash grants will be in Hamdaniya and Tilkaif districts of Ninewa, where new displacements are expected due to the ongoing operation in Mosul and there are significant numbers of highly vulnerable returnee and conflict affected host community members in newly accessible areas.

Tearfund has implemented cash assistance in Iraq since 2014, including projects in Dohuk, Ninewa and Kirkuk and reached almost 10,000HH (50,000 individuals) to date. Since January 2017 Tearfund has been implementing a cash assistance response for displaced, returnee and vulnerable host communities in areas of Hamdaniya and northern Mosul district that have become newly accessible during the Mosul operation. This project is therefore evidence-based derived from rapid market and needs assessments conducted in Hamdaniya and northern Mosul districts.

Tearfund will address differing needs and vulnerabilities within the community by applying socio-economic vulnerability criteria during the selection of beneficiaries, in line with Cash Working Group guidelines (and when finalised the criteria determined by the Targeting and Vulnerability Task Force) and best practice. This is in recognition of the unique vulnerabilities faced by different sections of the community such as single male, female and child headed households, divorced and widowed, those with disabilities or chronic illnesses and those missing documents among other disparities. Furthermore, household assessments and Post Distribution Monitoring will seek to identify how cash is used within the household and whether it is likely to create tensions within the household. Beneficiary Accountability is included at all stages of the project to ensure community feedback is received, resolved and integrated where possible.</narrative>
