   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Urgent remedial classes, psycho-social support, mine risk education for conflict-affected children and schools rehabilitations in Mosul
This project is divided into two parts. 
1- Urgent remedial classes, psycho-social support , mine risk education for conflict-affected children
2- Rehabilitations for eight schools in Mosul
This project will support children in newly retaken areas in two main areas in east Mosul 
The first area(Alsamah and Alkhadara Apartment quarters). These quarters were selected because the majority of families living here are vulnerable and highly populated. These quarters were also among the first one to be re-taken, and consequently ISIL fought strongly which caused a lot of damage to the buildings there, including schools. 
2- The second area will be Alrashedya Quarter or sometimes Al Rahedya district. This area is extremely populated quarter. The people of this area are mixed Kurdish, Arabs and Turkmen. The majority of them were farmers. It was liberated at the end of January 2017.This made people suffer a lot till they get rid of ISIL. Furthermore this area is opposite to the west part of Mosul only the river separate this area from the western part. This close distance made ISIS attacked this area many times by mortars which caused a lot of damage to the infrastructure. 
For the catch up and remedial classes .We will conduct  remedial and catch-up classes to children aged between 6-8 years old, who have missed out on schooling due to the conflict, thus have very low levels of literacy and numeracy. These remedial classes will help prepare students for the MoE Placement Test, which is being used to determine what school grade each student should be placed in. 
We will teach the curriculum books to help the students aged between 6 to 8 years. These children supposed to join the school before two years. We will provide training for the teacher so they introduce new methods of teaching and methods of how doing catch-up and remedial classes. We will hire three teachers for each school. Two teachers can conduct catch-up and remedial classes. The other teacher will provide games, sport activities and engaging activities. Via doing this the children will love the lessons. We will teach the children four hours a week and two hours sports and other activities. Total hours will be six hours per week for three months .After three months we will teach another groups so we can increase the number of students to double. We will teach 80 students in each school every three months. The total number of students who will receive remedial classes and psycho-social support will be (640) for three months. At the end of six months, total number will be (1280). These classes will support and enhance the formal education very much because these classes will focus what students had missed during the last period. While the mine risk education will be delivered to whole 6550 students. This education will be delivered by posters and guided leaflets that teach and guide children how to conduct when they see mines or strange items.
For the psycho-social support our psychologist will do weekly visits to school. They will deliver seminars about social cohesion and community spirit. They will talk with children and the teachers to see if they have any problems. In addition we will write our phone numbers in the schools and our e-mails so the children, their families and teachers can call us. The Psycho social Officer can receive requests for assistance directly from beneficiaries or from our coordinators. The PSS Unit will provide both face to face and telephone counseling sessions.
Many activities will be given to the children to promote peace education and social cohesion, especially in terms of ethnic and religious backgrounds, and minorities.</narrative>
