   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The objectives of the proposed project are to meet immediate life-saving WASH needs through rapid and timely humanitarian assistance and to further improve the access to basic appropriate water, sanitation and hygiene facilities and services, subsequently ensuring continued, improved and further equitable access to basic, appropriate WASH for vulnerable, critically affected girls, boys, men and women living in Haj Ali Camp, Al Alam 3 / 4, Al Karama / Sh&#x2019;hamah Camp in Ninewa and Salah Al Din governorates. This project is taking into account the highly anticipated IDP movement to these camps as a result of the military operations to clear Hawija and its surrounding areas from ISIS.

Within the confines of this proposal, RIRP also sees a need to remain flexible in responding to and filling gaps in out of camp and screening/mustering sites within the areas of Al Alam and Shirqat, due to the dynamic nature of the military operation taking place, RIRP has identified these areas as highly likely in receiving IDP movement in the form of ISF mustering/screening sites. RIRP are prepared to re-orientate our implementation to other identified areas with the aim to fill gaps. The emergency needs highlighted within this proposal are based on anticipated beneficiary requirements, however, these can also be adjusted to cover identified gaps as the humanitarian response progresses.

The proposed project aims to provide access to water and sanitation facilities for 72,000 vulnerable IDP&#x2019;s and comprises of the following first-line response activities and takes into account the standards highlighted in the &#x201C;WASH response for Settlement typology&#x201D;: garbage and sewage collection, installation of pre-fabricated, gender sensitive latrines and showers (mustering / screening areas), emergency water trucking with provision of chlorine tablets (wherever necessary), OampM of WASH facilities and networks, provision of hygiene kits and hygiene promotion and daily cleaning of sanitation units.

RIRP has also identified a &#x201C;full cluster&#x201D; response need in the form of a much needed new pipeline from Hajj Ali water treatment plant into Hajj Ali camp. This pipeline will serve the camp itself, reduce or cancel the water trucking needs and also benefit the host community living within the area. The existing pipe currently used to provide Haj Ali camp with water (coming from the Water Treatment Plant) is an 8&#x201D; pipe, which is meant to cover the water needs of the host community as well. The host community surrounding Haj Ali camp comprises of 6 villages with a total of around 5,000 households.
The main pipeline is repeatedly  leaking and needs constant maintenance as it has been exposed to sunlight for one year without being backfilled. After the construction of the pipeline was finalised all of the &#x201C;O rings&#x201D; were dysfunctional which causes most of the leaking and makes constant maintenance necessary. 
To cover the water needs of the host community a total of 21 x 4&#x201D; secondary pipelines are connected to the main pipeline (in addition to 3 x 4&#x201D; secondary pipelines which are meant to supply the camp) This has an additional negative impact on the water pressure within the pipeline. Due to this, there are times where the water tanks in Haj Ali camp cannot be filled with water as the pressure doesn&#x2019;t suffice. 
With the leakage problems and the high number of connected pipelines the operator of the Haj Ali WTP needs to run the WTP pumps for at least 13 hours a day to satisfy the needs of the villages only.
Considering the fact that Haj Ali camp has 7,500 plots which can cover up to 45,000 individuals it is obvious that their needs cannot be met under the current circumstances. The number of IDP&#x2019;s currently hosted in Haj Ali is 30,355 Individuals (Status 06.10.2017).
Therefore the installation of an additional pipeline that will lead directly to the camp will supply the necessary water.</narrative>
