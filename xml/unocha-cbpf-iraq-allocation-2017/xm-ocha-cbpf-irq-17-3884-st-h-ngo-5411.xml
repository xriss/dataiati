  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Ongoing crises are still effecting on Iraqi people where there are 11 million people still require of humanitarian assistance, over than 3 million are still considered  as IDPs who are living in camps, unfinished buildings, rented houses, etc) Those people are still in serious need for the basic intervention such as health, food, WASH, and shelter, on the other hand, and after the achievements that had been done by Iraqi security forces, there are many areas regained by the government so the returning movements has started to these areas and given the absence of the basic services in recent re-taken areas , we are sure that those returnees are also in need for our intervention.

This project is aiming to support three main locations, and they are, Shirqat in Salah Al-Din and Kilo 18 camp in Anbar and Mosul right  it is designed to significantly contribute to supporting the current and expected IDPs, as well as the returnees in Shirqat , Kilo 18 camp and Mosul right side neighborhoods by providing the health services through the, existed mobile medical team in Shirqat and through primary health care center (The PHCC has existed in Al-Nakheeb and it just need to be transported to Kilo 18 camp and that what was mentioned in their last letter (attached in documents section)) in addition to support the existed PHCCs in Mosul right side as Ninawa DoH requested 

In Shirqat UIMS will directly target at least 7800 individuals newly displaced and returnees in Shirqat, including (2184 men, 2340 women, 1560 boys and 1716 girls.) by supporting them with primary health care services, the mobile medical team will be serving (Al-Sakniya ,Gamila and Bsaten Al-Shikh camp ) and that was what we have agreed on with DoH.

In Kilo 18 UIMS will target around 16224 individuals (4540 men, 4870 women, 3244 boys and 3570 girls.))including both the current IDPs and the newly expected families from the western areas of Anbar, service package will consist a primary health care  including nutrition screening and vaccinations , we have included the nutrition one because most of the families who are arriving and still from Ana, Rawa, and Al-Qaim were under siege of ISIL since 2014 so the acute malnutrition is too likely among their children , the planned PHCC is in Al-Nakheeb ,it was providing primary health care services since 2015 and after the notable decreasing in the number of IDPs in Al-Nakheeb , in addition , we have received a letter from Anbar DoH  a few days ag asking UIMS to transport the PHCC from Al-Nakheeb to Kilo 18 camp as the camp needs a fixed health center , so there is no need to establish a new PHCC in Kilo 18, just transporting the existed one in Al-Nakheeb to be in Kilo 18

In Mosul right side, we have agreed with Ninawa DoH to mobilize a mobile medical team in Mosul Al-Jedad are to work beside the destroyed PHCC in order to provide the health services to the current population there. 
The team will be working in this location to cope with increased patient load, we will target (7800 individuals) including (2184 men, 2340 women, 1560 boys and 1716 girls), We have access to Mosul right side as we are currently distributing food parcels there so we will not face any problem in regards to access. (I will send Ninawa DoH letter once we get it) 

For the two Mobile medical teams, they will support  the existed DoH facilities  by working side by side with them and training them on EWARN system and on the proper ways to deal with the influx of IDPs and returnees and supporting them to prepare a plan to cover the needs of the newly expected IDP families , we will prioritize the screening sites in Shirqat like Tal Gamila which already hosting around 6000 families (IDPs and returnees)  and these mobile medical teams will cover more than one area and in close coordination with Salah Al-Din DoH, Health cluster, and the involved partners to ensure that all the needy people will be assisted during this project</narrative>
