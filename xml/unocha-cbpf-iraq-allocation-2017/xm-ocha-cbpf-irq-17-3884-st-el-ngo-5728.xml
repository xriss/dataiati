   <narrative xml:lang="EN">As the crisis in Iraq carries on into its third year, social tensions continue to rise, particularly in areas in which IDPs and host communities face economic or social hardship. Displacement and its subsequent economic repercussions upon host communities directly contribute to conflict between displaced and host communities, according to a recent impact assessment conducted at the cluster. Debt is growing among displaced communities, as well as Iraqi society as a whole, creating greater reliance on a diminishing social protection floor.

Livelihoods needs often lead to social tension erupting in conflict. Over 2 million people are expected to be prone to social conflict. Assessments have shown that both displaced and host community populations which are unable to address their needs or which struggle economically are significantly more likely to have poor relationships with other communities. Where economic grievances may lead to social tensions, specific livelihoods interventions are needed to support vulnerable households. In Anbar and Salah ad-din provinces ALMORTAQA has succeeded in developing early livelihood opportunities for the extremely vulnerable IDP categories during the last and upcoming years with generous support from OCHA-EL cluster, UNDP and some other donors, the benefited groups of this project were able to cover the basic living needs of their families, which resulted in reducing the tensions among the displaced families and their hosting communities in different manners. 

ALMORTAQA will provide Cash for Work for highly vulnerable IDPs and HCs in Remadi in Anbar province (with high flexibility to respond in Western and Eastern Mosul as ALMORTAQA has already conducted assessment &quot;attached&quot; for 58 schools need for rehabilitation and has offices in Hamam Alalil and inside eastern Mosul).

ALMORTAQA is proposed a short-term project to maintain the self-resilience of IDPs and their hosting communities and enable them to cope with the impact of crisis at their areas of displacement in within Anbar province (mainly Romadi) through immediate access to income for vulnerable families and social awareness especially in areas with high risks of tensions within the proposed locations. Through this project ALMORTAQA seeks to enhance the humanitarian response by working with other clusters to increase their scope and impact, ALMORTAQA will consult with Education and WASH clusters to conduct joint efforts for the benefits of the targeted communities through CFW initiatives such as basic renovation for the community facilities mainly for schools including their WASH facilities, water treatment plants, kindergartens that serve the both communities (IDPs and host) and conduct protection awareness on IDP rights, mine risk and doing some sort of rapid needs assessment and dropout identification and students registration/re-enrollment during fluid displacement to identify the needs of the affected population.

ALMORTAQA proposal will aim to conduct rapid assessment regarding social tension and conflict sensitivity as well as to confirm the identification of the potential livelihood opportunities that were selected before through pre-assessment surveys took place for the purpose of developing this proposal. ALMORTAQA will also conduct community outreach initiatives to reduce and/or prevent social tensions among the targeted communities. We will also initiate temporary employment activities for the extremely vulnerable categories for one month (20 days) per each person, such temporary employments will assist in restoring the most useful facilities within the community gatherings as well as to assist and help in the renovation of damaged schools, water treatments plants, cleaning of main roads and community waste water drains. Women will be consulted to identify meaningful C4W activities like identify dropout students, provide hygiene promotion and planting seedlings in schools activities.</narrative>
