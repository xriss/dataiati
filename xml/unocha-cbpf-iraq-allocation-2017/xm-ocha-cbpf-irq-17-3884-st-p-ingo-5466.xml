   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Integrated Protection, Legal and PSS Response for IDPs/Returnees in Mosul, Ninewa</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Heartland Alliance International (HAI) proposes a 6 month project addressing the protection needs of IDPs and Returnees from Mosul, Ninewa Governorate. Through this project,  HAI will identify and prioritize the protection needs of vulnerable population, specializing in detained persons and survivors of trauma and human rights abuses. The project will provide protection monitoring, general protection, legal assistance, psycho-social support (including Psychological First Aid (PFA)), and community awareness and advocacy through 5 mobile teams targeting Hamam Al-Alil (UNHCR) camp and surrounding communities in Hamam Al Alil, Salamiyah camp, Al Shoura District and neighborhoods in Mosul as well as screening and transit sites in these areas. Mobile service teams will consist of one lawyer, one psychosocial (PSS) social worker/case manager, one community protection mobilizer, and a driver. 

HAI will provide 4,800 individuals with direct legal services, including support in situations in which individuals face arbitrary arrests or detentions, particularly minors. 10,000 individuals will be informed of their legal rights through community awareness activities and the distribution of &quot;Know Your Rights&quot; literature. HAI will ensure access to justice through obtaining identity and civil registration documents, including marriage, birth and death certificates, paired with direct advocacy with local authorities such as, Asaish,  and coordination with functioning courts in Hamdaniyyah and Shaykhan. Attorneys with the mobile teams will assist in court filings, representation and information transfer between persons in IDP camps with pending cases, and the courts. In the context of the current conflict, protection requires the establishment of effective communication and coordination mechanisms with relevant stakeholders to assure the safety of IDPs and returnees.  HAI will advocate for access to the courts for a population that often faces constraints on movement due to the current conflict. 

HAI will also provide psychological support services to 6,000 individuals, in addition to 3,000 PFA cases in targeted communities, including those subject to detention and trauma, using evidence based and trauma informed mental health interventions. HAI will coordinate with relevant local institutions,  INGOs and identify/train 10 community focal points to ensure the sustainability of PSS and legal services through relevant referrals.  Focal points will help in the identification and referral of cases. HAI anticipates 20% of direct beneficiaries will receive duplicate services.

Many IDPs have extremely restricted mobility, meaning that awareness raising sessions and community training need to be completed locally by the mobile teams. The mobile teams will provide targeted training on protection principles to community leaders, government institutions and security authorities.  In addition quarterly community awareness sessions will share key rights information, including GBV, child protection, government documentation and housing, land and property. 10,000 &quot;Know Your Rights&quot; pamphlets will be developed on critical rights and referral information for legal and psycho-social services as well as feedback and complaints mechanisms. Targeted KYR campaigns are essential not only to encourage IDPs to access services but also to report abuses in real time which can help protection actors to more effectively target urgent interventions and advocacy.

The project will be implemented in partnership with NCSON based in Mosul and will address the needs identified by UNHCR, HAI and the protection cluster to provide more effective PSS and legal services, in cooperation with local authorities, to vulnerable populations in the zone from  Mosul towards Hamam Al Alil and Salamiya camps. HAI&apos;s mobile teams will maintain flexibility with deployment to locations based upon HAI security assessment and in consultation with OCHA and the protection cluster</narrative>
