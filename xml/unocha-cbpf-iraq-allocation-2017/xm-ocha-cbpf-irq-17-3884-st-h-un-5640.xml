   <narrative xml:lang="EN">WHO will focus on reducing morbidity and mortality on the frontline and in newly accessible  areas by  providing emergency health-care services, medicines, vaccines and supplies, water quality monitoring and by mitigating and responding to public health risks, particularly communicable diseases. Access to high impact essential life-saving health services will be improved for crisis-affected populations. 

A strong referral mechanism will need to be established between the camps and the referral hospitals. The capacity of those hospitals will be strengthened to deal with the increased case load. casualties/trauma care. 
Emergency immunization campaigns against measles and polio, reproductive health services for pregnant women to ensure safe delivery and referral of complicated cases will be given special attention. 

The high risk for communicable disease outbreaks coupled with inadequate disease surveillance system will require robust disease early warning system. 

Ensuring access and interrupted availability of life-saving medicines, medical consumables, emergency health kits, surgical, trauma kits and cholera kits will be prioritized. 

To respond to the multitude of issues mentioned above, WHO has started to embark on a four tier pronged approach explained below which will ensure that comprehensive PHC services and public health risks are minimised, including ensuring that health professionals are well prepared to deal with toxic chemicals exposure in case of use:

1.	Supporting medical mobile and fixed front line health care services in areas where families are expected to flee. In addition to expanding mobile services, fixed facilities will be established and staffed, ready to provide trauma triage and mass casualty management, emergency rape case management, emergency nutrition services, mental health support, and other essential health services including referral. Partners are helping to strengthen the capacity of community-based primary health care centers and hospitals to manage the increased demand for health care. Upgrading the already existing health facilities in areas that are expected to receive large number of IDPs will also be prioritized.  
2.	Pre-positioning life saving medicines and medical supplies for IDPs in camps and in host communities. During the ongoing emergency in Iraq, WHO is continuously supporting MOH, DOH and partners by providing essential medicines, medical supplies and kits through operating three main warehouses in Baghdad, Erbil and Dohuk. WHO with its privileged relationship with MoH, will procure, store and distribute medications to serve its own operation as well as that of the health cluster partners.         
3.	Establishing detection and response mechanisms for disease outbreaks in locations where displaced people are likely to flee. Systems will are being strengthened in local communities to ensure rapid detection, treatment and management of epidemic-prone diseases given the increased public health risk including cholera. Vaccination will be prioritized to deal with the expected low antigen levels of IDPs fleeing Mosul. The following vaccination response is proposed:</narrative>
