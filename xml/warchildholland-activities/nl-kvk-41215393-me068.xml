  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">During the months of July and August 2014, Israel launched a military operation called Protective Edge. During more than 50 days of hostilities Palestinian armed groups and the Israeli Army sustained a military confrontation that left massive destruction all over the Gaza Strip. UNRWA estimates that over 100,000 homes (refugee and non refugee) were damaged or destroyed in the recent conflict, affecting more than 600,000 people. As of 31 October, thousands of the displaced people returned to their houses, however 18 UNRWA school buildings continue to serve as Collective Centers for approximately 32,000 internally displaced persons (IDPs). In addition to it, another 50.000 are being hosted by families all over the Gaza Strip, expanding the number of people in a family &#x2013; contributing to overcrowding and frustration. Displacement proved especially difficult for women and girls, with increased evidence of GBV in shelters, limited privacy, family disputes, compromised dignity, and reduced access to hygiene. The overcrowding and lack of privacy had a harsher impact on women and girls, who are compelled to compromise modesty norms, while feeling scrutinized by others (particularly fathers and mothers). On 27 May 2015, a significant increase in temperature occurred, most vulnerable people around Gaza Strip appeared to be those who lost their homes in the 2014 war and since then are temporality accommodated in Caravans, makeshift shelters and tents. This resulted of many health related issues mainly heat stroke for children, skin rashes, ...etc The continued occupation, waves of conflict and accompanying destruction of (physical) structures negatively affects protection systems that were (already insufficiently) available within the Gaza Strip. This while the need for child protection and psychosocial support has increased. The current system is overstretched and cannot deliver adequate qualitative response to the protection and psychosocial needs of the children and their caregivers. Children in Gaza are witnessing and experiencing displacement and undergo the tense and volatile situation in shelters. Many children are resorting to violence to resolve small conflicts. Their parents and/ or caregivers are focused on survival and are not able to take care of children as well as they previously were. They have difficulties providing clean water, food, hygiene and safety for their children. At the same time, they are also emotionally impacted by the conflict and need to cope with the fact that they cannot provide as well for their children as they would like to/ is required. As a result many children (boys and girls) who fall ill or encounter other difficulties are not accessing the support and treatment they would require. Many children are showing signs of acute fearfulness and distress, while child protection systems and psychosocial support are inadequate. These circumstances require a significant amount of time for children to recover and for psychological wounds to heal. Project targets The project will work to contribute and respond to immediate needs following shocks and increase the resilience of those at risk of forced displacement or forcible transfer through providing a safe areas to support parents, caregivers and children and provide them with protection services including psychosocial services. The project will ensure equal access and participation of both girls and boys, while more emphases will be given to displaced children and children living in the caravans (around 1600 boys and girls are displaced children and 1088 children are from the hosted families). The age group of the children will be from 7 17 years old, however, the Ideal sessions will be given to children from the age group of 9 14 years old. The project will raise the awareness of parents and 40 psychosocial professionals (20 women and 20 men) will also be targeted through the capacity building, refreshers and the supervision provided by the psychosocial specialist. Project Design The project is a 6 months and will be implemented by War Child and 10 partners: Gaza Community Mental Health Program (GCMHP), Basma, Community training center and crisis management (CTCCM), Palestine Trauma Center (PTC) and 6 CFS. War Child will be coordinating, supervising, monitoring and strengthening the quality of the project through training, reflection and monitoring with partners and CFSs. The four NGOs partners BASMA, PTC, GCMHP and CTCCM are responsible for conducting structured recreational activities, while GCMHP is also responsible for supporting the partners and CFSs themselves with psychosocial support and self care for the staff. Project Activities The activities carried out in this project will be: Capacity building and training for Partners&#x2019; facilitators on child safety, the right of the girls to participate, and gender inclusion and gender based violence. Training for facilitators on psychosocial methodology IDEAL. Rehabilitate CFS based on the child protection minimum standards, include proper facilities for children with disabilities. Organize caregiver meetings or open days which help caregivers discuss, share, and exchange experiences and disseminating information regarding their children reaction and how they can be supportive. Conducting psychosocial support activities targeting children and families living in shelters and caravans and refer them to the CFS.</narrative>
