  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The aim of the project is to strengthen relations between the Syrian refugee students and Lebanese students through WCHs psychosocial support methodology that includes life skills, activities facilitating social cohesion and handcrafts activities. The project would conclude with an action plan designed by students for the benefit of the school and/or local community. For this specific project, War Child Lebanon will use a tailor made program compiled from the various Deal Methodologies, addressing issues specific to the context of Chhim students and taking into consideration various ages. The psychosocial support program would combine conflict resolution skills, life skills and handcrafts that can help students from different backgrounds recognize their emotions, gain control over their negative behaviors, communicate in a healthy way with peers and adults, and accept others unconditionally. They will learn skills that will inevitably increase their self esteem, ability to socialize, to build positive healthy relationships with their environment and try to get through difficult situations.</narrative>
