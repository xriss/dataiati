  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Lebanon has experienced a massive influx of refugees in recent years - including more than one million arrivals from neighboring Syria. This huge influx has put further pressure on both Lebanon&apos;s infrastructure and the fragile economic and security situation of the country. This project aims to meet the basic education needs of Syrian as well as vulnerable Lebanese children. By working together with local government and schools, the Accelerated Learning Programme and afternoon schools provide extra learning opportunities for children. After school support helps prevent drop-out, while the children also receive psychosocial support. Their parents and teachers receive additional training to help the children both at school and at home.</narrative>
