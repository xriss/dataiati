   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Problems and Needs in the Area: Every month in 2017, the movement of about 16,000 new Internally Displaced Persons was assessed throughout the territory of South Kivu, and alerts were received indicating the displacement of 48,000 people. 15,500 students from both primary-age (nearly 70%) and secondary-age are deprived of education due to insecurity. 1.9 million people do not have the equivalent of one meal a day. Between January and October 2017, 49,295 security incidents were reported, more than in the whole of 2016 (which were 39,447 reported incidents). Cases of sexual violence are also recurrent, with 1,977 known cases from January to October 2017. The current number of Internally Displaced Persons in South Kivu is 647,000 individuals; about 226,000 persons in Kalehe territory and 188,000 people being displaced in Fizi territory. Both Kalehe and Fizi territories host about 64% of all the displaced persons in the South Kivu province. During the first quarter of 2018, intercommunity tensions and conflicts intensified particularly in Uvira territory where NGOs witnessed the presence of 12,500 displaced persons in the Bijombo highlands. This area, and the highlands of Minova as well, are plagued by recurrent conflicts. In addition, some timid return movements are also observed within the territories in gradual ways. Recently nearly 90% of the 495 households that had taken refuge in Uvira City returned to their home villages. Most of the time the returnees found their houses and crops looted. When returned, they are in high need of assistance and still exposed to the risk of displacement, considering the unpredictable nature of the conflict. Another problem noticed in the South Kivu province relates to financial support. A lack of funding has led to a gradual difficulty for NGOs, the United Nations and other government actors to monitor and coordinate effective responses. Also, budget cuts of some emergency programmes have led to a redefinition of criteria and thresholds of interventions that often cause impossibilities. Thus, we hereby invite DOB Emergency to support our much needed emergency programme in South Kivu.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Democratic Republic of Congo (DR Congo) is still facing instability and recurring conflicts in its eastern part due to activities of armed groups. In 2017 the organization of active armed groups has changed, especially in the border areas between the provinces of South Kivu, Maniema, and Tanganyika. Until then the groups where operating in an individual way. New dynamics of regrouping led to the creation of the National Coalition of the People for the Sovereignty of Congo. Tensions and clashes between the members of this coalition and the DR Congolese army increased rapidly and spread to new areas, beyond those traditionally affected (Shabunda and Kalehe territories). A peak of violence was recorded between June and December 2017 in the territory of Fizi and in the neighbouring territory of Kabambare (Maniema province). The analysis conducted by War Child and other actors in the area identified the following information.</narrative>
