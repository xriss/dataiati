  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Children in the occupied Palestinian territory (oPt) continue to be denied their basic human rights. 2015 saw an escalation of violence between Palestinian civilians and Israeli forces and armed settlers, while the arrest, displacement, detention and even killing of children all remain major issues. With conflict and violence surrounding them every step of the way, its important that children develop leadership and civic participation to address the issues that affect them. This project teaches them to express themselves in an open, non-violent way, so they can participate in a functioning democratic society. Through psychosocial support they develop their self-esteem and self-confidence, while working on relationships with their peers, and learning how to address issues within their communities.</narrative>
