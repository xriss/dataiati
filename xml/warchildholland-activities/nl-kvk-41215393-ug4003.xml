  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Since the outbreak of the conflict in South Sudan in 2013, Uganda has been experiencing increasing numbers of refugees, especially in Adjumani and Yumbe districts of northern Uganda. According to UNHCR, the total registered number of refugees has reached 1 million (17 August 2017), 82% of whom are women and children under 18. In light of the continuing deteriorating security situation in South Sudan, a further influx of refugees is expected. Yumbe district hosts 276,710 refugees in Bidibidi Settlement (UNHCR, 16 August 2017). The 2014 census showed a total of 482,822 inhabitants, which brings the total population of the district to around 750,000 people. The refugee settlement is spread out over 5 sub-counties: Midigo, Romogi, Apo, Kuru and Odravu. The refugees arrived in Uganda starting in July 2016, and come mainly from Central and Eastern Equatoria (Lainya, Kajo-Keji, Yei, Morobo, Torit, Nimule and Juba). They belong mainly to the Pjulu, Madi and Kakwa tribes, while the host community belong mainly to the Angira speaking Lugbara. The population in Yumbe district is mainly Muslim (76%) and the refugee community is largely Christian or animist. In Yumbe District there are limited psycho-social support actors. This, combined with the lack of opportunities and previous exposure to traumatic events puts youth at risk of poor well-being. The Transcultural Psycho-social Organisation (TPO) have indicated that youth in Yumbe score highly on indicators relating to severe mental distress including suicidal thoughts. In the livelihoods sector, the needs to generate an own income and to create the needs for income-generating opportunities and for gainful (self-) employment are high. On the land around the refugee settlement, which is being cultivated by the local community, sorghum, cassava and beans are growing. Persistent dry conditions in 2015 and 2016 have resulted in lower than average yields. The first planting season in 2017 started late due to delayed rains and the first harvest was below average, but sufficient. The second rains in West Nile have started early &#x2013; July and early August 2017 &#x2013; and have been very heavy and above average. This has led to the bean crop struggling &#x2013; it does not like excessive rains &#x2013; and flooding in some areas, but other second season crops have got off to a good start and people are optimistic for a good second harvest. The local community practices shifting cultivation (&#x201C;slash and burn&#x201D;). This means that after growing crops for one season, they let the land lie fallow for several years to recover. With the influx of the refugee population and the increased demand on land this will no longer be possible. This implies that new farming techniques need to be introduced, and there is a need for skilling both host community farmers and refugees on these techniques. The risk of exhaustion of the soil and salinization is present, and this will have to inform the selection of crops to be planted and the livestock to be introduced.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The overall objective of the program is: Increased socio-economic well-being for youth in Yumbe District, West Nile sub-region, Northern Uganda. ABSYR is an innovative approach for youth in Yumbe district to social and economic wellbeing whereby psycho-social and livelihoods support are integrated. The program aim is to support youth from both the refugee and host community in Yumbe district to engage in gainful (self-) employment in agri-business at the end of a 3-year period. To this end, the program will have supported 5,000 youth with life-skills, agricultural skills and business skills development; a production start-up kit; market linkage facilitation; VSLA formation and management; an environmental protection grant; and life skills development through sports. From the 5,000 youth, 20% will also have received additional advanced business support under the program and will have formed small businesses.</narrative>
