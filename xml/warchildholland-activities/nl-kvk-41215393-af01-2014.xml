   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Decades of conflict have left Afghanistan as one of the most dangerous places in the world for children to live. Current figures show that half a million people have been forced to flee their homes and live in temporary settlements - the majority of whom are children. This project aims to respond to the education and psychosocial needs of these internally displaced children. This was attained through offering accelerated learning and establishing a child friendly space to serve the internally displaced in Eastern Kabul. Additionally, family members of beneficiaries were offered training to improve parenting skills, and awareness raising activities on child-rights based issues were implemented.</narrative>
