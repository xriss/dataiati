   <narrative xml:lang="EN">2019 PS4007 Psychosocial and Child Protection for Children and Families affected by Conflict-Related Violence in Area C, H2,and East Jerusalem</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The target areas were selected for this project based on several needs assessments as well as identifying the hotspots of violence in recent events, and based on direct relation with the communities through implementation of projects by SCI and WCH and the CAAC/MRM reports? data on the grave violations and the administrative reports of the CDED, DCIP and Adameer and other human rights organizations, as well as the 2017 needs assessment in Area C undertaken by PCC and WCH. DCIP have published multiple reports documenting the detrimental psychological effects and prevalence of ill-treatment in children facing arrest and detention under Israeli military law, and this project will extend the joint work of WCH, PCC and DCIP.

Area C consists of over 60% of the West Bank where Israel retains near exclusive control, including over law enforcement, access and movement, and planning and construction. The restrictive planning regime applied by Israel in Area C makes it virtually impossible for Palestinians to obtain building permits, impeding the development of adequate housing, infrastructure and livelihoods. Moreover, particularly in the Jordan Valley, access to basic services such as the Child Protection Network (CPN), is hampered, and social norms and harmful practices experienced at home, schools, and in communities put children at further risk. This causes distress and undermines the overall well-being of children. For instance, the behavioural findings from an assessment conducted by PCC in 2017 in Area C of the Jordan Valley revealed that 47% of children assessed had behavioral symptoms, the most prevalent of which was constant fighting and violence towards others. For emotional indicators for the assessed children, 76% of them showed indications of emotional distress, and 97% of them expressed feelings of fear, while 62% reported feeling sadness. While this was in particular for Area C in Jordan Valley, different risks of violence children under Area C face continuously affect their lives. In the absence of other opportunities, boys in particular resort to physical labour in the neighbouring Israeli settlements and sometimes experience child labour related illness and disability as a result (for example due to unprotected exposure to pesticides during farm labour). Girls on the other hand are vulnerable to other negative coping mechanisms including high levels of child marriage.
Program participants will be children, families, caregivers, volunteers and community members from the areas of the West Bank including East Jerusalem heavily (and in many cases chronically) affected by violence related to occupation.
Through the project, volunteers and community members, including those in CBOs, will be trained in identification and referral of children displaying signs of child protection concerns and psychological distress, due to their exposure to occupation related violence and stressors including military arrest and detention. Also as the project targets vulnerable communities located in Area C of the Jordan Valley, beneficiaries are most vulnerable boys and girls, men and women living in these communities and affected by Israeli military occupation. Specifically, the project will reach girls and boys, between 6 and 18 years old, who are survivors and/or at risk of abuse and their caregivers.
