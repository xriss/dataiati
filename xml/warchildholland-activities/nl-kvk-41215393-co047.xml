   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Colombia has endured decades of internecine conflict between armed groups including the national army, guerrillas, drug mafias and paramilitary organisations. Children and young people in large parts of the country continue to live under the constant threat of violence. This project creates Safe Spaces for children in communities controlled by armed groups, and promotes their rights in communities and schools. The children receive psychosocial support and learn how to deal with conflict. As they learn to use their voices and stand up for themselves, they also work together with adults to learn more about their (Afro-Colombian) culture and traditional games.</narrative>
