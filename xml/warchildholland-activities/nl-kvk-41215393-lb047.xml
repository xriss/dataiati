   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project is supporting the continuation of War Child&apos;s ongoing emergency program in Syria, focusing on the psychosocial component, and expanding its reach through community involvement. Aligned with IASC MHPSS Guidelines, the psychosocial intervention implemented by War Child&#x2019;s CBO partners will be scaled up to address both 1) individual coping strategies and 2) community support mechanisms. The proposed project will complement the continuing program and partnership between War Child and local Syrian partners, and will focus on enhancing the &#x2018;self-care skills&#x2019; of children, adolescents and their caregivers while strengthening community support structures. &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; The civil war in Syria has created many vulnerabilities for children. Half of school age children are no longer in school. They need support to continue their education, to help strengthen their coping mechanisms to deal with the circumstances, and to safeguard their wellbeing for the medium to long term. Children in Syria are living in a highly unstable environment where they are regularly exposed to various protection risks (which vary depending on the community). War CHild&apos;s partners provide the children with a safe and participatory space to learn, play and be supported.</narrative>
