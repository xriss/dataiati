   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project includes training for human rights activists, radio programs, community drama sessions, and debates for  local leaders, traditional leaders and stakeholders, as well as TLC?s core funding. Uganda&apos;s government has contributed little to the situa
tion of human rights, and has even civil actively limited political rights. Journalists have been harassed, and have been accused for the demagogy. Radios are under special attention of the Government, because radio reaches 90 % of the population. Due to  
the threats the media self- censors widely their broadcasts. However, in Uganda , there are dozens of independent medias. The project&apos;s target area in Toro Kingdom, the freedom of expression is limited all the time. The project aims to strengthen the TLC a
nd the capacity of human rights activists , to inform the public about human rights, and strengthen the TLC?s networking. The expected impacts of a forum for discussion about human rights , a functioning network of human rights activists and their increase
d capacity, increased awareness and discussion of human rights in the community, as well as reduction of impunity . As direct beneficiaries of the project are 300 human rights activists to be trained and more than 2 000 community members participating in c
ommunity events, well as activists participating 50 radio programs. In addition, the project provides practical support and legal advice to victims of human rights violations (at least 300 cases).Twerwaneho Listeners Club was grounded in a radio program ma
de by local human rights activists in 2006. Program -makers and listeners founded and registered Twerwaneho Listeners Club in 2008. In the core TLC&apos;s activities is the sensitizaton of human rights of the local population, in particular of the freedom of ex
