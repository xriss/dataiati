   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The purpose of this project is: access to safe reliable drinking water, socially acceptable sanitation, and increased awareness of hygiene, for 130 households in two communities of Pujward cluster in Roshan district.The main partner in this project is the 
community of Pujward. Their role is to be the initiators and drivers of development in this project and the community. The project was conceived because of a request by the community elders and the community will have substantial involvement for the durati
on of the project. The target community is in a very remote part of Afghanistan where access in the winter is very difficult.The Ministry of Rural Rehabilitation and Development is the other partner in this project and their role is to make sure the projec
t fits overall national development goals, and to provide a place where appropriate collaboration with other stakeholders can take place.This project will bring clean water to the Pujward village cluster, build toilets and provide health/hygiene education.
 A school will also be provided with water, toilets and hygiene education. Because of the lack of toilets it is particularly difficult for women with regard to privacy. An important gender related benefit of the project is the reduction in stress and time 
for women in looking for private places for defecation.The goal of the project is to reduce the incidence of water-borne disease. With better health comes more productivity, less money spent on medicines and an overall increase in quality of life.</narrative>
