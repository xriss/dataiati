   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Since President U Thein Sein?s official 1/11 Call to Peace, the space for civil society to contribute to the comprehensive peace process between the government and EAGs has?theoretically?widened considerably. The ongoing peace process is no longer meant to
 be the exclusive, closed-door enterprise concerning only top-level decision makers that have characterised past attempts to solve the six-decade conflict. Civil society?s engagement in the comprehensive process is vital to dealing with 65-years of entrenc
hed mistrust and fear ? to move the country forward through reconciliation and a more sustainable peace. While Myanmar?s peace process is still deep in the nationwide ceasefire stage, civil society engagement has remained opaque with few practical entry po
ints ? leaving a broad swatch of the population concerned and skeptical of the process and its outcomes.  Objectives: Local communities in fragile contexts have enhanced capacity to prevent and resolve violent conflicts, using inclusive mechanisms and focu
sing on the respect for human rights.Activities: ? Support of civil society Changemakers ? particularly women and youth. ? Formation of Myanmar Changemakers Initiative ? engaging youth from target locations as well as across Myanmar.? Exchange and sharing 
of ideas between Cambodia, Finland and Myanmar Changemakers.  ? Support provided?both technical and financial ? to youth formed collaborative community and one national level project intended to advance the vision and mission of the Myanmar Changemakers In
itiative.? Support provided?both technical and financial?to women?s civic engagement groups/network across project locations linking with national level initiatives.  Right-holders /beneficiaries: Particularly women and youth, also duty-bearers.   Implemen
ting partner:As a vital means to effectively implement the proposed new R2P pilot project/process, FCA intends to partner with new and highly experienced peace focused organisations. FCA needs to expand the partnerships to additional partners with peace bu
ilding process capacity to effectively commence and advance the R2P thematic focus. These partner organisations are yet to be identified.  The new engagements will require a partnership assessment to take place.</narrative>
