   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Northern Uganda has suffered from the consequences of a civil war during two decades. The poverty rates in the area are double compared to the rest of the country and the food insecurity is severe. Now the situation has calmed down in the area and the peop
le have been able to return back to their homelands. The strategy of the project is to form self-help groups, whose skills and capacities to work together are increased. The primary purpose of the project is to improve the food security in the area e.g. by
 establishing gardens of food crops. Another purpose is to increase the income of the households by bringing new production models to the area. The practices of the agricultural production are taught in a practical way (Farmer Field Schools). The project i
ncludes education of peer support facilitators and establishment of demonstration gardens for the cultivation of new plants and varieties and for experimenting new farming technologies. Farming practices are organic and are based on such production inputs 
that the farmers are able to finance themselves in the future. The crop production includes cultivation of grains, vegetables, root vegetables and fruit trees. The rainwater harvesting systems will be improved and they are built for household use and agric
ultural production. There are abundant shea nut trees in the area for processing edible oil. The women of the area may make their own income from oil production if its processing and marketing are supported gradually. It is possible to practice beekeeping 
and honey production in the forests of the area, which increases the incomes of the households. All the activities aim to promote gender equality in production and decision-making. Beneficiaries, purpose and expected results of the project will be specifie
d during the planning phase that precedes the project implementation phase. The project is implemented by ISF?s local partner organization Foundation of Women Affected by Conflict (FOWAC).</narrative>
