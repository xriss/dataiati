   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Justice Rapid Response (JRR) is an international intergovernmental facity aimed at enhancing the capacity of the international community to ensure accountability for the most serious international crimes and human rights violations. Information and evidenc
e gathered through high-quality investigations is essential for delivering justice for such crimes which in turn is crucial for ending impunity for such crimes and for ensuring access to justice for the victims. The project supports the following activitie
s of the JRR : 1) direct investigative and prosecutorial assistance to States relating to the most serious international crimes, 2) expert roster development through support for organizing a training crouse on the investigation of SGBV crimes under interna
tional law in Senegal and a training course on the integration of forensic sciences in international investigations in the Republic of Korea and 3) strategic outreach and alliances activities.  The project promotes in a concrete manner the objectives of Fi
nland&apos;s Development Policy relating to the prevention of human rights violations related to conflicts and to the prevention of impunity associated with the most serious international crimes. The project also promotes the objectives of Finland&apos;s National Ac
tion Plan on Women Peace and Security (1325). Continued support to the JRR is specifically mentioned as a means to advance the objective of the Plan relating to the fight against impunity. Almost all investigations (95%) to which JRR has deployed experts c
oncerned investigations on serious crimes and human rights violations committed in countries that are ODA countries. At least 40 % of the participants to the training courses are from ODA countries but the proportion of participants from these countries wi
ll be more than 70% for the forensic sciences course. Those trained will be added to the roster from which experts will be deployed to investigations in almost only ODA countries. The training courses and other activities of the project are aimed at enabli
ng high-quality investigations in these countries. The final beneficiaries are therefore institutions societies and victimes of the most serious crimes in ODA countries. The projects are therefore ODA compatible on the basis of the final beneficiaries.</narrative>
