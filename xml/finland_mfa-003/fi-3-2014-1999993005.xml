   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The realisation of the objectives of Finland&apos;s development policy requires support from citizens and their confidence in the effectiveness and potential impact of any actions taken.  The MFA&apos;s Development Communications Unit is responsible for raising publ
ic awareness about global development issues and the objectives themes and results of Finland&apos;s development policy. Effective development communications require that medium and message meet citizen and stakeholder needs that texts be written in clear langu
age and that each message be tailored to its target group.  Information is made available not only through traditional official channels but also via social media and at public events.  Specific programmes are being prepared to help the media learn about d
evelopment issues and development cooperation.  The Development Communications Unit (VKO-40) awards travel grants for journalists and photographers to help them learn about development issues and see how Finland&apos;s development cooperation is carried out in 
practice.  The purpose is to introduce journalists and photographers to Finland&apos;s development policy and to promote the publication of articles on developing countries across different media.  Journalists are also invited to accompany the Minister for Inte
rnational Development on his visits to the developing world.The Development Academy is an introductory programme for journalists organised by the Unit annually.  The objective is to deepen the participants&apos; knowledge of global development issues and to inf
orm them of Finland&apos;s development policy and development cooperation as a whole. The Development Academy comprises about 15 journalists representing different media in different parts of Finland.    Based on opinion polls the majority of the Finns obtain t
heir knowledge about development cooperation through the media.  The Development Academy and journalists&apos; travel grants contribute to closer contacts with journalists covering development matters.The Team Finland network makes use of the twinning of Finnis
h and African journalists in its communications and building of the country as a brand.  Journalists&apos; networking promotes communication between Finnish and African journalists and training events in for example matters concerning the freedom of the press.</narrative>
