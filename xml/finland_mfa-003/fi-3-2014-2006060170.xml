   <narrative xml:lang="EN">During the years 2012 - 2014 Finnish- Namibian (friendship) society run program - My school. The aim on the program was to strenghen art and handigraft education in school. The program had very strong link to Namibian culture herit and society.During the M
y school program  lot of teachers were trained and motivated to start art and handigraft education in schools. The very strong idea was to wake up teachers to understand that art and handigraft education is not a separate area in education. It has very str
ong link to all learning processes. It is also motivating children to learn and study academic subjects.During this My school program Namibian and Finnish education experts together  design and wrote a book of art and handigratf education. This book is pri
nted in year 2014 and published in press conference during the autumn 2014 and at same time it is also launced to the leaders of education sector and ministry. The program have had strong commitment from Namibian education&apos;s leaders.During the year 2015 th
e aim is to do training program to the teachers and principals and at very conrete way to train them to use the manual and book in teaching practice.This is the only way to implement the whole idea of the program to all schools. Teachers education is not v
ery high level in Namibia. So teachers need very strong guidelines how to use the book in their teaching. The principlas of the schools are key persons. It is very much up to them how the book is taken in schools and how art and handigraft education is imp
lemented to the general education.So this one year training program is implementing finally all the work done during the years 2012- 2014 to the schools. During year 2015 a partner of Finnish Namibian Society NIED is  training teachers to use the book of o
f art and handigraft education in practice.It is purpose to educate teachers in all regions of Namibia (9 worshops). In autumn 2015 the program is also evaluated totally.</narrative>
