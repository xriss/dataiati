   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project is a continuing phase for a project the Embassy supported with the Local Cooperation Fund in 2010. The first phase looked at equality in primary education in Argentina using Finland as an example. One of the critical findings was the lack of qu
ality in teacher training and teachers? qualifications and their influence in promoting inequality in the right to education. The qualitative differences in teacher education and teacher competence are notable in Argentina. This problem is addressed in the
 second phase of the project by looking at teacher training in Argentina the Argentine educational policies and decision-making. By using results of studies carried out international comparisons and the Finnish teacher training as examples a book will be d
rawn up on the subject. The purpose is to have recommendations and concrete proposals to create an educational policy for the future which would secure the right to education by ensuring the high standard of education in the whole country through a high qu
ality teacher training. The project will include bringing an expert on education from Finland to Argentina (funded by Unicef Argentina) to lecture on the Finnish education system and teacher training for Argentine policy-makers and those responsible for te
acher training. The embassy?s share of the project funding is 73 % and the rest of the funding will be carried out by Unicef Argentina. The project?s direct beneficiaries are the officials responsible for education policies at national and provincial minis
try of education and other experts principals and teachers of teacher training institutes as well as other experts and students of the educational sector. The long-term goal is to provide tools for the permanent and fundamental change in education policies
 concerning teacher training.</narrative>
