   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Rwanda&apos;s constitution guarantees everyone equal treatment before the law, and the right to an attorney, but not legal assistance at public expense. Rwanda has since 2003 been reformed judiciary for example tightening the qualifications of the judges and in
creasing the autonomy of the judiciary in decision-making. Parallel to the Rwanda&apos;s national judicial system there has also been developed the community courts Abunzis, in response to the need to ensure better implementation of the legal remedies for the m
arginalized population groups. The equality of the access to justice lacking in Rwanda, government-guaranteed public legal aid services as well as Abunzis are difficult to reach and bureaucratic. In addition, the ongoing problems are caused by corruption, 
excessive processing and  the high cost of judicial process. Also the fundamental rights are violated by preventing the introduction of witnesses or accusing the same crime twice. The project aims to promote the realization of human rights protection of th
e poorest and most marginalized sections of the population by improving access to justice, as well as increasing the awareness of the authorities on human rights and the rule of law. The project will focus the victims of violations of human rights of the p
oor and the marginalized (especially women, children, the disabled, minorities and indigenous members) to raise awareness and promote legal in Kigali.  Inara Legal Aid Service (INALAS) is founded by self-employed lawyers in February 2009 in Kigali city. Th
e organization&apos;s goal is to support the state rule of law principle in accordance with the promotion of the right to equal access to juctice  and informing people of their rights.</narrative>
