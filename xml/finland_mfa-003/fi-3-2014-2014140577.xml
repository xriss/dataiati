   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This is a programme on the follow up of the recommendations of United Nations study on Violence against Children (UN-VAC), and it is currently being implemented through 4 regional projects, and it aims to contribute to the prevention and elimination of VAC
 in Africa, Asia and Latin America. VAC is one of the most serious problems affecting children.  Much violence is still hidden, and children and their representatives often are not able to report acts of violence for fear of retribution by their abusers an
d due to lack of independent, child friendly and safe reporting mechanisms. The UN-VAC study recommendation urged states to ?prohibit all forms of violence against children in all settings.? Many governments and key actors in these regions have taken steps
 to address violence against children, making commitments through international and regional instruments. However these efforts have been slow and uncoordinated. Besides, very few efforts are made so far at regional level to strategically address VAC. Henc
e, this programme strengthens the capacity and networking of civil society organizations, children and youth groups and law enforcement institutions, and creates opportunities for shaping a joint advocacy platform to lobby for increased commitment towards 
effective child friendly and gender sensitive child protection mainly at national and regional levels.  The overall programme implementation is led by Plan regional offices in Asia, Africa and Latin America, in close collaboration with regional and nationa
l CSO networks and children and youth groups.</narrative>
