   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project focuses on Gender Based Violence (GBV) that is a serious violation of human rights as well as social and health problem concerning all sectors of society. Namibia has a high rate of GBV and it presents a major obstacle to attaining gender equa
lity. Project objective is to empower Council of Churches in Namibia (CCN) its member churches and the communities to address GBV. Churches play an important role in overcoming GBV as they hold great authority and are able to influence on social issues in 
all levels of society. Gender equality is one of the human rights objectives agreed upon in the United Nations. Gender justice is also one of the cross-cutting priorities of the World Council of Churches All Africa Conference of Churches and Southern Afric
an Development Community. Altogether poverty and other forms of injustice impact unevenly on men women and children and thus there is need for actions that promote gender equality. Project respects also other cross-cutting development policy objectives.The
 final beneficiaries of the project are victims and survivors of GBV the potential victims of GBV and the communities they are part of. While gender-based violence is usually targeted at women and girls boys and men may also be victims of GBV. Men should n
ot be recognized only as offenders but victims of the culture of violence as well. GBV can occur within the family or community and is perpetrated by persons in positions of power. Other beneficiaries of the project are the CCN and its member churches that
 will learn new approaches and methods as well as strenghten the networks to respond to and address the challenge of the GBV. The project does not create any new structure or institution but will be positioned at the existing structures of CCN and its memb
er churches. Key activities include 1) effective project management and administration, 2) creation of holistic view on Gender Development including GBV among CCN and churches Think Tank meetings rapid assessment development of awareness raising tools and 
materials awareness raising for church leaders and training of facilitators, 3) trainings and kick-off events for community members pilot programmes for women men and youth counselling programmes for victims and perpetrators and peer support 4) nationwide
