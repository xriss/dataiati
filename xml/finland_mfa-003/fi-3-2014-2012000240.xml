  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The relevance of the emission measurement development need is increasing with the various pulp mill plants existing and planned in Uruguay. There is a lack of capacity at the national level in Uruguay to perform emission measurements. Hence the control age
ncy Ministry of Housing Land and Environment is reluctant to promulgate generic emission standards due to the lack of official and readily available capacity to enforce the regulation. Uruguay needs its own solid capacity in emission measurements and quali
ty assurance of automated measuring system.  The overall objective of the project is to improve the level of emission monitoring for industrial sources as well as vehicle emissions raise the level of emission measurements in Uruguay close to international 
level and develop the system towards more harmonized measuring policies and procedures nationwide. The project purpose is to improve the competencies of emission measurements of LATU. The project will concentrate on training the LATU experts on specific me
asurement methods for particulates gaseous components as well as dioxins/furans and heavy metals. Furthermore different determination techniques and methods will be taught to tackle monitoring and control of odour from different sources as well as develop 
measurement methods for vehicle emissions and regulation related to these emissions. The direct beneficiaries of the project are the personnel of LATU whose capacity and knowhow is developed as well as the emission monitoring and regulating authorities. Pu
blic in general will benefit from the project through a potential improvement in the air quality with the improved emission monitoring and control.The project partners are VTT and LATU. Duration of the project is 3 years 2012-2014 and budget 400.000 Euros.</narrative>
