   <narrative xml:lang="EN">CED will produce together with Social Activities Integration 30 000 improved cooking stoves and replace one third of the 100 000 most polluting cooking stoves in the Greater Mumbai area with them. If this first stage of the project will be succesfull CED w
ill apply further funding for two other 3-year continuation projects the aim of which is to replace also the remaining highly polluting stoves with SAI stoves (=extremely clean-burning stoves planned and designed by the world- famous improved stoves expert
 Saibashkar Nakka Reddy together with the SAI personnel). If the project and its continuation phases will succeed in replacing the 100 000 most polluting cooking stoves in the Greater Mumbai areas with SAI stoves this should both benefit the 100 000 poores
t households in the area (because they will need less cooking energy) and improve the air quality in an area inhabited by more than 20 million people.  We do not have precise numbers but it seems likely (obvious) that the mentioned 100 000 highly polluting
 cooking stoves are responsible for a significant perecentage of all parcticulate emissions released into the air in the Greater Mumbai area. The 100 000 highly polluting stoves cannot be replaced with better stoves without subsidizing the production becau
se they are used by the poorest households that cannot afford kerosene electricity or liquid gas and that have not this far even been able to invest in better coing stoves. According to our prior experience (based on 2 500 SAI stoves that have already been
 manufactured and sold for the poor households in Mumbai by SAI) the poor families will by and adopt improved clean-burning and energy-saving stoves if their price is reduced to an affordable level (from their perspective) with a subsidy of 5 or 5.5 euros 
per cooking stove. This means that might be possible to significantly improve the air quality in the Greater Mumbai region by investing 0.025 euros per inhabitant in subsidies on improved cooking stoves sold for the poor families.  Or at least SAI our coop
eration partner in Mumbai thinks that it would be possible to achieve something like this with approximately 500 000 euros in 9-10 years.</narrative>
