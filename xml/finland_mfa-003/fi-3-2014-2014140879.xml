ange 13-24. It is conceived as a pilot to inform further scaling up of such approaches at a system level. The project is targeting 2000 youth Syrian learners of the age range 13-24 (with a focus on age group 13-15) as well as 1000 Lebanese Youth affected b
y the Syria crisis to benefit from the project directly. The acquisition and development of knowledge skills and attitudes for life and work will support learners in advancing their life and careers in their local communities while also preparing them to c
ontribute to reconstruction efforts in Syria as appropriate. The project will also benefit the national authorities such as CERD and GDVTE/MOEHE as well as key stakeholder institutions in the public and private sectors (i.e. NGOs and Business Associations)
