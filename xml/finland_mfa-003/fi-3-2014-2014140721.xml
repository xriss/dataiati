   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Since 1990 Somalia is affected by a bloody protracted civil war which continues sporadically in some pockets of the country until now. This war has affected directly or indirectly almost every one of the 8-10 million Somali population. It has not destroyed
 only lives and properties but also ruined all that had value including social infrastructure of the country. As a result the whole social fabric of the society has collapsed including both the specialised and basic education services. In fact the civil wa
r affected the learning facilities through destructing the educational centers in all over Somalia. Many educators left the country as a result of insecurity hence lack of advanced education with unified curriculum.  There is a need for rapid increase in e
nrolment occurrences with consideration of distributions of students  and the extent to which current patterns will satisfy Somali manpower.The Sahed association draws from the experience that the already ongoing healthcare-project has brought. SAHED has b
een active in the Middle Regions since 2000 carrying out health care education invalids assistance community mobilization and awareness raising activities. The focus of the new project is to enable high school graduates from Galgadud region school to conti
nue their post secondary education. This new project is going to establish vocational education facility in Dusamareb. The long-term objective is to enhance sustainable development of the education empower local people and to reduce extreme poverty. The ob
jectives are to be reached through a long term project (1+3+3 years) and the Sahed Association is now applying for funding for the first phase which is a 1 year period of launching and focusing the plan for the continuation of the project. The activities o
