   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Shield for Justice Foundation is a registered Trust from 2012. The first Initiative to build the capacity of HRDs to conduct witness protection was undertaken in 2010. In the first year of its existence (2011) the project was hosted by Independent Medico-L
egal Unit (IMLU) prior to its incorporation. The overall objective of the organization is to enhance access to justice and accountability free from intimidation and compromise and also enhance access to justice for victims and witness through empowerment a
nd facilitation of safety measures. Following the 2007/2008 post- election violence it became apparent that there was no framework that existed to protect persons with crucial and critical information for the investigation. The Shield for justice Foundatio

erpetrators seeking to pervert the cause of justice-The Uwezo Project ? seeks to create awareness for specific groups around the country to enhance provision of services at local regional and international levels and also undertake policy and legal advocac
y that could tilt the regime to ensure that the government of Kenya undertakes its duty of witness and victims protection.Objectives of the proposed project: ?To facilitate the provision of legal medical psychological sociological and all other reasonable
