   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The basic idea of the integrated river basin management project in Sudan is to map out the needs of people residing in the catchment area and making use of its natural resources and managing them in a sustainable manner which transcends regional and sector
 boundaries. In this way the project aims to promote renewable natural resources-based economic development at the village level. The aim is to ensure that in the catchment area there is an even distribution of all natural resources and the ecosystem balan
ce is maintained. The objective is to promote the involvement of renewable natural resources-based economic development for sustainable land and water management in the village communities in Atbara and Dinder regions in total of approximately 65 000 house
holds.Sudan Integrated River Basin Management project is designed as part of the Nile Basin Initiative to work as a part of the Eastern Nile development program. This project will be implemented nationally in Sudan but similar projects are also carried out
 in Egypt and Ethiopia. Thanks to the regional dimension of the project the results will have a wider impact on the development of Blue Nile downstream and of the surrounding environment as well as on the relationships of the Eastern Nile countries. The pr
oject has national and regional reach and contributes to maintaining stability and prevents crises in the area.The project is carried out jointly with the World Bank and the Sudanese Ministry of Water. The project also provides technical expertise through 
a consulting company.</narrative>
