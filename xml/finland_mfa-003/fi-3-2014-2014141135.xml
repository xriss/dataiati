   <narrative xml:lang="EN">There are many challenges concerning the realization of sexual and reproductive health and rights in Uganda. One of them is the deep rooted HIV-epidemic, which reflects the unsufficient usage of condoms, another the amount of sexual abuse and violence that
 girls and women suffer from. Surveys done by ISF?s partner show that Ugandan boys and girls start sexual relationships very early: both boys and girls have their first sex contact around nine years of age. Significant amount of first contacts are sexual v
iolence. The project was implemented in two phases: Phase I 2008-2010 and phase II 2011-2013. According to the evaluation in 2014, the project has been thematically highly relevant. It has impacted positively the lives of the beneficiaries of the project. 
It has reduced violence against women and children, and especially sexual violence against girls, it has increased children?s access to education by reducing school drop outs in Wakiso district and in its two sub counties, Gombe and Busukuma. The main stra
tegy of the project was to increase knowledge and develop positive attitudes and practices through training of girls, boys, women, men and different authorities. The thematic areas of the trainings included equality in gender relations, health, education a
nd organization of the family and community life. The project focused on the elimination of gender based violence in general and had a special focus in reduction of sexual violence and violence against children, specifically girls. The project also contrib
uted to the reduction of teenage pregnancy and improvement of sexual health of children and adults. The purpose of the project was to reduce risky sexual behaviours among boys and girls aged 8?14 years and improve the sexual life of their families and it b
enefited over 10 000 persons.The project was implemented by ISF?s local partner organization Concern for Children and Women Empowerment (COFCAWE).</narrative>
