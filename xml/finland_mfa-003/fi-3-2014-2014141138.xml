   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Northern Uganda has suffered from the consequences of a civil war during two decades. The poverty rates in the area are double compared to the rest of the country and the food insecurity is severe. Now the situation has calmed down in the area and the peop
le have been able to return back to their homelands. The project aims to transform the attitudes towards agricultural production to more systematic and professional. The change in the attitudes would give rise to new kind of production that uses local reso
urces efficiently and sustainably to improve the food security and to increase the incomes of the households. This work makes good use of production groups, which purpose is to make development initiatives, promote the social integrity of the communities a
nd increase common activities. The agricultural production is made more effective by practical learning (Farmer Field Schools) and the approaches are environmentally friendly. Each group will get their own demonstration plot and it is expected that the gro
ups will use them for cultivating food and cash crops as well as for experimenting new species and production techniques. One of the project activities is the building of a water harvesting system. A committee is also administering and sustaining the water
 systems. The project includes the formation of Community draught resilient Committees, which are in charge of coordinating water supply use related community level questions. Women?s participation is especially taken into account in all project activities
. Beneficiaries, purpose and expected results of the project will be specified during the planning phase that precedes the project implementation phase. The project is implemented by ISF?s local partner organization Christian HIV and AIDS Prevention and Su
pport Organization (CHAPS).</narrative>
