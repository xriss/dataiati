   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Rapid, uncontrolled population growth due to internal migration from rural to urban areas characterizes El Alto. The majority of this multicultural city&apos;s population is indigenous, aymaras being the biggest group (74% of the population). The city has a you
ng population: 40% are underaged, and over 70% less than 30 years old. Nevertheless, children&apos;s wellbeing is being neglected because the culture is very adultcentric. Children and youth are undervalued which together with numerous social problems is making
 the youth passive and uncommunicative. Education based on memorization and respect for the teacher&apos;s authority does not encourage youth to think independently or express their opinions.  Taksvarkki ry and it&apos;s Bolivian partner Compa have been implementing
 the project &apos;Art and social change&apos; since 2010. The objective of the first phase of the project has been to increase youth wellbeing and raise debate on migration-related issues in order to promote intercultural equality and justice in periurban neighbour
hoods of El Alto districts 1, 4 and 6. The cornerstone of the project are art workshops in Compa&apos;s cultural centers and local schools. Through different forms of art (theater, music, dance, circus etc.), the youth reflect the society around them and prepar
e artistic productions to communicate about their neighborhood&apos;s problems. The artworks seek solutions to problems and challenges the youth encounter in their everyday life, and collectively build new kinds of positive migrant identities. The activities co
ntribute to horizontal intercultural relations, empowering youth and developing their self-esteem, self-expression and critical thinking skills, and offer children and youth a safe environment to act together with their peers as part of the community.In th
is second phase of the project the activities in Compa&apos;s cultural centers and schools continue. In addition, the second phase builds sustainability for the project activities by providing capacity building for the project staff and Compa&apos;s youth network, b
y sharing experiences and good practices on participatory methods for art education, and by providing methodological training for teachers. Through the trained teachers, these methods that aim at empowering children and youth and developing their expressio
n are taken into use in schools so the impact of the project will grow beyond Compa&apos;s immediate sphere of influence.</narrative>
