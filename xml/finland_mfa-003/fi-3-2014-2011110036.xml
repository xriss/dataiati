   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The maternal and infant mortality rates in poverty-ridden Somalia are amongst the highest in the world: According to  UNICEF one out of 12 women die of pregnancy related causes and only 9% of births are attended by a skilled birth attendant. Due to Somalia
&apos;s malfunctioning government and lack of education NGOs bear great responsibility of organizing healthcare for the population. Hence the long-term objective of this project is to strengthen the provision of public healthcare and to improve maternal/sexual 
health in Somalia. These aims coincide with the UN Millennium Development Goals of improving maternal health reducing child mortality and promoting gender equality and empowering women.  To achieve these objectives the project continues the operation of th
e FinSom Maternity Clinic in Afgoye near Mogadishu and gives trainings to traditional birth attendants (TBAs) and community health workers (CHWs) in different locations in Somalia. Additionally as a new element the project also aims at upgrading the suppor
t services given to rape victims by establishing a hotline at the Afgoye Clinic.By improving maternal health the project works directly towards reducing inequalities which is one of the cross-cutting themes of Finnish development policy. Furthermore when w
omen achieve better health they are better equipped to participate in society and hence the project also promotes gender equality. Therefore an additional long-term development goal of the project is to encourage women&apos;s participation in society and decisi
on making.The day-to-day implementation of the project done by African Care&apos;s local partner Volunteers for Medical and Development Service (VMDSO) based in Afgoye. The FinSom Clinic has been governed jointly by African Care and VMDSO since 2012 and around 
1300 babies are delivered and circa 15 000 outpatients treated there annually.The direct beneficiaries of the project are the women living in the Afgoye area who now have the chance to deliver in a safe environment with the help of trained staff as well as
 the victims of sexual violence who can make use of better support services. Direct beneficiaries also include the TBAs/CHWs who receive training within the project and the women and children they treat. In addition the surrounding communities will benefit
 since the trained TBAs/CHWs as well as the mothers treated at the Clinic are expected to spread the knowledge they have acquired in their own communities.</narrative>
