  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">IDA is a network representing members that are organisations of persons with disabilities. IDA?s unique composition as a network of international persons with disabilities? organisations allows it to act as an authoritative and representative voice of pers
ons with disabilities in the United Nations (UN) system.The proposed project aimed at ensuring that the post-2015 development framework fosters meaningful inclusion of persons with disabilities reflecting a human rights-based approach and that DPOs and the
ir allies have access to resources and accountability mechanisms to advocate for its implementation in conjunction with the Convention on Rights of Persons with Disabilities. The invisibility of persons with disabilities in the Millennium Development Goals
 (MDGs) framework its programmes and policy designs and the statistics supporting the monitoring of its implementation are some of the key reasons for the lack of inclusion of persons with disabilities in development.To ensure that the post 2015 developmen
t agenda will be inclusive and that DPOs will have access to adequate support for demanding its implementation IDA will work with its global and regional members its allies especially the International Disability and Development Consortium and its members 
as well as the UN agencies and supportive UN members states to ensure that:-Voices of persons with disabilities and their allies are taken into account in the negotiation of the set of goals and associated targets of the post-2015 development framework -Th
e post-2015 development agenda process increases momentum and incentives so that relevant UN bilateral and multilateral development agencies develop normative strategic and operational frameworks that are meaningfully inclusive for persons with disabilitie
s- Strengthened use of UN treaty bodies and the Universal Periodic Review as accountability mechanisms for Member State commitments to inclusive development and the human rights of persons with disabilities- Improved technical capacities of regional DPOs N
GOs and UN development agencies to support global and national stakeholders to make development programmes and policies inclusive within CRPD implementation in low- and middle-income countries.</narrative>
