   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Widow&apos;s Mite Elderly Village to Malawi</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Malawi is one of the poorest countries in the world. Especially the elderly live in utmost poverty of whom most are women. Because of the HIV/AIDS- pandemic caretakers of most of the families have died and grandparents have been forced to take care of the 
orphans. This is difficult because of the lack of financial recourses and of local prevalent beliefs in villages that old people who live long must be practicing witchcraft. This is also one of the reasons that the elderly are discriminated against and mis
treated in their village communities and their everyday life as parents of the AIDS-orphans is a struggle for survival.The overall objective of the project is to secure the elderly a life with human dignity to prevent discrimination and to increase the equ
ality of the elderly in the society. Our goal is to support the State of Malawi to launch their own Policy for Elderly and to help them achieve UN?s millennium goal to halve poverty by 2015. The reduction of the poverty of the elderly also directly impacts
 the situation of the AIDS-orphans.The project will follow the cross cutting objectives of Finnish Government&apos;s development policy by advancing the human rights of the elderly and reducing their discrimation and by strenghtening escpecially the situation o
f the old women. The project battles against HIV/AIDS in the district of Mchere both by offering the health care services and intervening  the economical problems which the HIV/AIDS has caused them by empowering the elderly financially. The project aims to
 create a new concept for the care of the elderly in Malawi with the implementation of an elderly village.The main functions will be:? clinic:  providing health care services for the elderly and AIDS orphans? hostel: housing units for the most severely neg
lected elderly people? rehabilitation program: holistic rehabilitation for elderly? economical empowerment program: vegetable garden and domestic animals? training and sensitization program: training the stakeholders of the project (attitudes knowledge)The
 project is implemented by Out of Africa?s local partner in Malawi Kalibu Ministries.The main beneficiaries are about 1000 old people from the 114 villages of the district of Mchere who need help as well as the AIDS orphans under their care.</narrative>
