   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In connection with the launching ceremony a press conference will inform the general public, including potential members, about the existence and start of the development project of the domestic workers union of Mozambique. Already before this a basic info
rmation leaflet will be produced, and this can be used in other public meetings and organizing work. In the weekend meetings organized in neighborhoods where domestic workers live potential new members will be invited and basic rights education started, in
 order to inform people about domestic work decree of 2008 as well as contents of ILO C189 ratified in 2011, leading to preparations of national ratification campaign to be started in 2016. OTM-CS research unit and national institute of statistics will be 
requested to help investigate how many people work in the sector, this to establish the potential membership. Towards the end of the year a three year project cycle will be planned, and the project will be transformed into a Red Nose Foundation funded one 
with a budget significantly higher than the allocation of the preparatory year 2015.The situation of domestic workers in very fragile and vulnerable and the work is almost invisible in society, although tens of thousands of people work in the sector. Stren
gthening the union and developing its intervention capacity and visibility will increase rights awareness of the workers and their possibilities to defend themselves against inappropriate treatment. As immediate results domestic workers know about their ri
ghts and the union that is there to defend them. The union gains new members and leverage and in the long run also organizational and financial sustainability.The beneficiaries of the project are domestic workers of Mozambique. The partner, the Mozambican 
domestic workers? union is the only union of the country in this sector, and its members work in cleaning, taking care of children and elderly, washing, cooking, gardening, private household security guarding, repairs and maintenance, shopping and running 
other errands as well as caring for pets. Most workers are young and predominantly women. The union is affiliated to the national centre OTM-CS and the International Domestic Workers? Network.</narrative>
