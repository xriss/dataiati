   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Haiti suffers from severe food insecure and depends on importation for several basic products. Currently, 1 200 000 eggs are imported daily from Dominican Republic. There is a lack of investment in the agricultural sector and rural communities have weak pr
oduction skills. Haitian Ministry of Agriculture has started promoting egg production in the country, but the current production is not nearly sufficient for the demand of a total population of 1 million in the Southern departments of Haiti. The project st
rengthens egg production in the department of the South through capacity building, provision of layers and other inputs to local producers, and the establishment of a production unit managed by a cooperative. This will improve the livelihoods for the local
 people in vulnerable rural communities, particularly youth and women. The project will also contribute to the overall food security in the region, as an increase of locally produced eggs will help to decrease prices and improve accessibility to eggs.  Act
ivities: ? Eggs value chain and market analysis in 5 departments ? Establishment of a central unit that provides local producers access to layers and chicken feed ? Training of 800 youth and 450 women to produce 20 eggs a daily (training on sustainable pou
ltry and egg production, basic business skills) and establishment of household units? Establishment of a cooperative  to manage the central unit and sell eggs? Technical support on production unit management and marketing, including a business plan, Traini
ng and support to advocacy ? Opening of a chicken feed plant to produce food for chicken for the regionThe project will promote the right to livelihoods of 800 youth and 450 women. It will benefit indirectly their families and communities, as well as the c
onsumers in the 5 departments. Implementing partner:KORAL (Konbit pou Ranfose Aksyon Lakay) and Christian</narrative>
