   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Improving Palliative Care in Ilembula Lutheran Hospital</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project aims at strengthening Home Based Care and Palliative Care (HBC+PC) already existing in connection to Ilembula Lutheran Hospital. Prevalence of HIV/AIDS is very high in the catchment area and despite fair availability of ARV-treatment many AIDS-
patients are in poor condition and in need of home-based palliative care. Although HIV/AIDS is common there is still a remarkable stigma attached to it and the patients are in danger of being severely marginalized. In addition to HIV/AIDS palliative care a
lso addresses patients with cancer or other life-threatening chronic illnesses (such as heart failure COPD diabetes mellitus physical disability etc.). Overall objective is to ensure as high a quality of life as possible of people living with life-threaten
ing  illnesses by providing them adequate pain relief other necessary medication and physical care as well as psychosocial and spiritual support. This will be achieved by improving the quality of care through training the staff and volunteers of the HBC+PC
 team and the hospital and by ensuring adequate resources for continuation of the work. Of the cross-cutting development policy objectives reducing inequality of all kinds is particularly focused. Gender equality is not taken into account as a separate iss
ue, the selection of the patients is based on their disease and need for care only regardless of their sex age religion ethnic group economic situation etc. There is no obvious influence in the climate sustainability in this project. The project is based o
n ongoing work and existing basic structures and aims at improving and strengthening them. The key project activities will be: to strengthen the HBC+PC team by further educating the current team members as well as recruiting and training new ones, to  teac
h hospital staff about palliative care, to start basic teaching about palliative care as part of the training of nurse students in the nursing school, to identify the problems in ensuring the availability of the necessary drugs,  and to renovate and equip 
a new palliative care unit (4-6 bed ward + office room) within the hospital. The main beneficiaries are the patients and their families the members of the HBC+PC team the hospital staff and the students in the nursing school. If successful the project may 
also create in Ilembula Hospital a Centre of Expertise in Palliative Care which could then act as an example and training site for other units too.</narrative>
