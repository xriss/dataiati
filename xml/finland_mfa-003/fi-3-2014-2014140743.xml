   <narrative xml:lang="EN">&apos;Health Information System Development in Tanzania. Collaborative Project.&apos; - preparatory phase</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Funding for the preparatory phase of the FCMS project in 2015 is applied to complete the necessary investigations in defining the requirements for a health information system and evaluating the existing systems together with the Tanzanian partners. An eval
uation framework will be defined that covers requirements of the users and health organizations ministerial guidelines as well as general requirements of data security openness and scalability of HIS. As a result of these evaluations the Tanzanian partners
 will be able to select the system to be further developed and implemented in the later phase of the planned project from 2016 onwards.Christian churches and organizations have a major role in health care in Tanzania. It has been estimated that the Evangel
ical Lutheran Church in Tanzania (ELCT) alone carries out about 15% of health services in the country. They often also lead the way to new practices. In this case development of an ICT and open source based Health Information System was started in ELCT abo
ut 5 years ago. The system is already piloted in two ELCT hospitals but it is not yet ready for a wider distribution. The aim is that the HIS would help ELCT health care units both in health administration and in patient care. Compatibility with the govern
ment system is also vital e.g. in sending of collected statistical data directly into it. For further development ELCT needs specialized ICT skills and knowledge beyond its own resources.The aim of the planned project is to help Tanzanian partners in compl
eting the development of an appropriate and user-friendly hospital information system by providing skillful human resources for collaboration in improvement implementation and piloting of the system. The project will provide training and support to local m
edical staff and ICT-specialists to maintain teach and further develop the HIS. Local entrepreneurs will also be given training in marketing delivering and supporting the usage of the HIS.Health Ministry of Tanzania considers appropriate Health Information
 Systems (HIS) crucial in strengthening of health care. Its own Health Management Information System (HMIS) was conceptualized in the early 1990&apos;s. The main aim was to establish a comprehensive routine data collecting system to evaluate monitor and improve
 health care delivery. However there are still huge challenges in the implementation and maintenance of appropriate compatible health information systems.</narrative>
