nd hygiene importance of sanitary health food reproductive health for seeking appropriate medical care when required malaria treatment HIV/AIDS knowledge vaccination program maternity clinics...The project will be utilizing the existing structure further e
xixting operations. The aim is to complete the area with couple of buildings which will cover among other things teacher&apos;s officies. Additionally existing buildings will be acquired more furniture and materials as well as equipment for teaching. A school w
