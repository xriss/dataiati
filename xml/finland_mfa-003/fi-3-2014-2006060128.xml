   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The objective of the project is to improve the educational and nutritional status of Orphaned and Vulnerable Children (OVC) and to sustain their welfare through the economic empowerment of their mothers or caregivers. The main beneficiaries of the project 
are disadvantaged and OVC children enrolled in Maedot&apos;s Alternative Basic Education (ABE) Centres as well as their mothers or care givers and other family members. The project will benefit 1200 OVC children (550 male and 650 female) and their families in t
he worst slums of Addis Ketema and Gullele Sub-Cities of Addis Ababa and urban and rural Woredas of Woliso and Zeway Woreda of Oromia Region. Although primary education is free in Ethiopia OVC are unable to attend school because of poverty. Even if the chi
ldren are enrolled in school they may not be learning because they are hungry or unable to concentrate due to their difficult situations at home. Through this project OVC are provided with access to Alternative Basic Education nutrition and tutorial suppor
t. After the three year cycle these children are able to integrate into formal education. They receive a nutritious meal at school and their mothers or caregivers are trained to prepare more nutritious food from locally available ingredients. Project susta
inability is guaranteed by ensuring the economic empowerment of the OVC mothers or caregivers who are provided with training and organised into saving and credit cooperatives. The mothers and caregivers are trained in basic business and leadership skills. 
The project highly encourages the involvement of women in economic activities and leadership affairs and promotes gender equality. As the women are able to support their families through their own income their decision making power in household affairs is 
increased and their status in the family improved. The local authorities are closely involved in the project and the local communities will also be sensitised about the issues of OVC. Psycho-social support to the OVC and their families is organised through
 community support groups community volunteer workers and child clubs.</narrative>
