   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Bonthe Island is one of the poorest and most isolated areas in Sierra Leone. The impacts of climate change such as the unprecedented rise in temperature and the frequency and severity of rainfall conditions on Bonthe Island, highlights the extent to which 
humans and their livelihoods have become vulnerable. This is likely to have an impact on the natural resources and environment on which livelihoods are derived. For example, heavy rains cause flooding of settlements and farms, while high temperatures have 
caused crop failure. Flooding also prevents rice farming for many households. Climate change is likely to also cause shifts in crop growing seasons which will have implications for food security. The objective of the project is to improve community resilie
nce and enhance adaptation to climate change on Bonthe Island by supporting sustainable livelihood options. The expected results are 1) Agriculture production increased and diversified, 2) Basic management skills (in business farming group dynamics) improv
ed, 3) Market linkages enhanced, 4) communities resilience against climate change impact built through alternative livelihoods activities.The beneficiaries are provided with training, education and awareness on environmental issues including climate change
 and disaster. They will be trained in the production and processing and storage of vegetables and crops as well as in intercropping technics, and organic manure production and applications. Beneficiaries will be supported with the requisite farm equipment
 and tools and will receive continuous technical support that will lead to a more productive and diversified cropping. Poultry farming is introduces as an alternative source of income for vulnerable women. While engaging the beneficiaries to improve on the
ir livelihoods coping strategies, the project will raise the awareness of the beneficiaries on key issues like human rights, gender equality and equity, and HIV/AIDS.Rights-holders /beneficiaries: Rural and peri-urban poor  Implementing partner: Green Scen
