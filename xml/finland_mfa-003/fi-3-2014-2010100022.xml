   <narrative xml:lang="EN">At the second stage of the Afmadow project the main aim is to strengthen the existing health care centre. We have supported the renovation of the building and the equipment and also the hiring of staff and giving any relevant training during years 2011-201
3. Including the Afmadow prenatal clinic we?re also supporting the development of laboratory facilities in clinics of nearby regions, Dobley Qoqani and Diif. This support is by supplying equipment needed for laboratories such as microscopes and also traini
ng during years 2014-1016 a total of 24 new laboratory professionals and 24 midwifes. In addition general training will also be given to 40 regular staff members in the prenatal clinics and also to a group of health care professionals every year. These nee
ds of improvement were discovered during a trip of delegates to Dhobley in 2012. They discovered that there was a severe lack of general medical equipment and a working laboratory facility.As the general aim in the next stage of the project is to improve t
he supply of health services in Afmadow and surrounding areas and to increase health knowledge and training of health care workers -  we are also planning to set up a circulating clinic for Afmadow and areas nearby which would provide health checks for vil
lages once a month. This moving clinic would consist of two health professionals and equipment for general health checks and medications to improve the health care in the region.As a request from the associates in Afmadow we are also planning to provide an
 ambulance to the Afmadow prenatal clinic. There are none in the area at the moment and having an ambulance would improve the ability to provide health care in urgent situations in which serious cases could be transferred to bigger cities more efficiently.
 These prenatal centers are important for the development of health care amenities in the area and also providing general knowledge to improve health related awareness in the regions.  The aim is that these improvements would provide a good base for a sust
ainable development of health care services.</narrative>
