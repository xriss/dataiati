   <narrative xml:lang="EN">-Sport Sans Frontieres is registered since 2002 in Kosovo. SSF actions in Kosovo are directed to Kosovo?s youth and aim to reduce discrimination by providing spaces and opportunities that bring together ethnic communities through sport physical activities 
and games. Recognised as a neutral organisation Sport Sans Frontieres is acting as a facilitator of dialogue. Web page: www.sportsansfrontieres.org.-Education and training systems in Kosovo both formal and informal cannot currently meet the demand and the 
needs of Kosovo?s children and youth both in terms of quality and quantity. Most pupils only attend class 4 hours a day as two classes must rotate the same day through the same classroom with the same teacher. . Children and young people spend too little t
ime in the classroom and consequently have too much unstructured free time with little to do. This time could be used to organize sports and artistic activities non-formal education and awareness-raising sessions. Thus the project also intends to develop t
he use of sport as a tool to educate children from diverse backgrounds. The children benefiting from sport activities are learning basic values such as tolerance fair play respect of the rules and team spirit that are important for their development and wi
ll help them shape their personality.-The expected results of this project are: a) The dialogue between the different communities is enhanced, b) Volunteers have gained valuable skills, and c) Children have acquired new values knowledge and life skills.-Th
e main aim of the project is to contribute to social inclusion of youth in society especially of children and youngsters from minority communities. The project has three specific objectives:  1. Create bridges among communities 2. Empower youth 3. Provide 
children with informal educationSSF activities will take place in 12 localities: Gracanica Kacanik Kamenica Mamusha Mitrovica Peja Roma Mahalla (in Mitrovica) Strpce Shtime Skenderaj and Tuneli i Pare. Activities will also start in Mitrovica North, In the
