   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Unemployment is high in Mongolia. Desertification is making it harder for farmers and herders to make their living off the land so some abandon their traditional lifestyle and move to the surrounding areas of the capital. However there are not enough jobs 
available in the capital. The long-term goal of the project is to increase the people&apos;s participation in income generating activities decision-making and thus to decrease poverty in environmentally sustainable ways.The project consist of two direct objecti
ves:  1st objective: ?Community groups are financially self-sustained and participate actively in decision making?. This happens by empowering community groups in trainings on decision-making and income generating. The main beneficiaries are community grou
ps from the current project (groups 54 by end of 2013). They need more support to become sustainable.  Current  project has also found new solutions since a possibility to decrease unemployment is to prevent it which leads to the 2nd  objective ?Farmers an
d herders have knowhow on improving their farming products and preventing desertification?. Desertification is a grave problem for herders and farmers but it can be impeded. Impeding desertification and recovering the soil with alfalfa also produces excell
ent nutrition for livestock which decreases herders&apos; losses. Thus SYL&apos;s local partner IEC will teach people new farming skills and help them to maintain their source of income. History shows that farming has unused potential but people need the knowledge h
ow. There is a need to develop a new training model with a few day&apos;s farming skills trainings for farmers and herders who cannot spend 3-4 years at school. The participants of these trainings are 360 farmers and herders from Tuv aimag Arkhangai and Songink
hairkhan.Human rights have been important from planning phase on as beneficiaries were involved. The project helps people to achieve right to income but also encourages to fulfil their obligations and demand administration to fulfil their obligations. As f
or cross-cutting themes environmental sustainability is strongly represented in preventing desertification. Gender equality and inequality decrease through the activities as about 60% of participants are women and all have low income level.</narrative>
