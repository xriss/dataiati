   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The objective of the project is to strenghthen inclusive democracy and youth participation in politics in Tunisia. This will be done through the Tunisian School of Politics (TSoP) which aims at enhancing political youth&apos;s capacity and constructive, policy 
oriented engagement in politics. The TSoP targets young people already active in political parties and consists of courses that provide youth politicians with increased knowledge of multiparty politics and democratic practices. The school provides particip
ants with the necessary skills and tools to influence political decision-making in a more effective manner. Moreover, through the TSoP, Tunisian youth politicians gain practical experience in policy development and public consultation. The TSoP is expected
 to improve the visibility of youth representatives of political parties to the electorate through supporting them in developing clear and concise policy proposals and making their voice heard in political decision-making as well as within their mother par
ties. When youth politicians have the necessary means to advance issues important to young Tunisians in politics it is anticipated that youth issues will gain a more central place in Tunisian politics and that awareness among young people in the democratic
 system and political parties will be enhanced. This in turn is expected to lead to increased youth participation in politics.</narrative>
