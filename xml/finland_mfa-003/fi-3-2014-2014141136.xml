   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Domestic violence is still one of the most significant national health problems in Uganda. This project addresses this issue with its purpose which is to change  the attitudes of duty bearers and right holders in such a way that they denounce domestic viol
ence at the end of the project. The expected results are that the knowledge and skills on domestic violence of duty bearers who are part of referral system have improved and that they take more constructive action, and that rights-holders awareness on dome
stic violence has increased. During the project adults and out of school children are trained to act as peers to inform communities about domestic violence and its prevention. In addition, training sessions about for instance gender, conflict resolution an
d human rights are organized. Relevant stakeholders, such as local leaders, police, health workers and opinion leaders are involved in the trainings. The project benefits directly 554 persons and indirectly an audience of over 5 million people , through me
dia and advocacy work. Journalists are also activated to participate in the project. In order to the external journalists, the local partner organization implementing the project uses its radio channel MamaFM and the newspaper supplement The Other Voice as
 channels in the project. The project is implemented by ISF?s local partner organization Uganda Media Women?s Association (UMWA).</narrative>
