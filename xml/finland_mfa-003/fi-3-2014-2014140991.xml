  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Finland supports the UN Trust Facility supporting cooperation on Arms Regulation UNSCAR with 150 000 euros to be used in 2015. The role of the facility is to support the implementation of commitments on Small Arms and Light Weapons (SALW). In practice inte
rnational NGO&apos;s receive funding for projects that support development of security structures in developing countries. The aim of the projects is also to reduce diversion of SALW to terrorists and others that would use SALW irresponsibly. As outcomes the il
licit trade in arms would also be hindered. In many developing countries and fragile states the poor security situtation do not allow a sustainable development to take place. The proliferation of SALW fuels conflicts and makes efforts to solve and stop con
flicts even more difficult. This creates a threat for the continuation of a more stable environment in a post-conflict situation. Illicit trade in arms and small arms violence cause also substantial economic problems and hinder the realization of human rig
hts. Through implementing the projects a more secure and safe environment for sustainable development is created. Small arms violence is often targeted towards most vulnerable groups including women and children. When reducing access to illicit arms and vi
olence basic human rights such as right to life and livelihood are better secured. Concretely with the help of the projects SALW are marked so that they can be traced which in turn reduces diversion. In addition systems and structures for effective export 
control of arms will be developed which will reduce illicit trade in arms. At the same time developing countries are encouraged to accede to international conventions and agreements and to implement them which also creates a more stable environment for sus
tainable development. The expected beneficiaries are the people in developing countries including vulnerable groups that are suffering from armed violence in excess. As the security situation becomes better in partner countries it is also expected that sec
urity situation becomes better regionally. When it becomes more difficult for terrorist to acquire weapons it is potentially possible to improve global security. http://www.un.org/disarmament/UNSCAR/</narrative>
