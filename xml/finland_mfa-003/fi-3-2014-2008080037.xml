   <narrative xml:lang="EN">HIV/AIDS continues to pose a serious threat to people living in southern Somalia: according to some estimates approximately 75.000 people are HIV positive. Somalia being a weak state its statistics is poor, in reality the figure is much higher. Communities
 in Banadir and lower Shabelle regions have limited access to education and health care. Large parts of these communities are still not correctly informed on health issues hygiene and STIs. People&apos;s knowledge of HIV/AIDS is commonly based on false beliefs 
and incorrect information spread by healers. Using a condom is a taboo and people living with HIV are stigmatised.The direct objective of the project is to raise awareness and capacities of target communities to fight HIV/AIDS. In the long term the achieve
ments lead to non-rising/decreased prevalence rates in the project area and the surrounding communities. The partner organisation in the project is  KASAB - Community Empowerment Programme. This project is a continuation to the ongoing project of six years
 financed by Ministry for Foreign Affairs.The main beneficiaries of the project are the youth and the so called bridge populations e.g. female tea vendors IDPs truck drivers and Khat dealers. Investing in the youth means investing in the future. The Nation
al AIDS Forum healthcare workers and community health promoters are also direct beneficiaries. The project empowers women by targeting especially female tea vendors who will become increasingly aware of the risks and ways to protect oneself from HIV/AIDS. 
In case of HIV/AIDS in the family women are the ones responsible for the extra resources for coping with the situation. Marginalised IDPs will be given attention. By raising awereness on HIV/AIDS the project aims to reduce stigma around the disease and tha
t way contribute to social inclusion of the often discriminated HIV positive and to social and economic equality in the long run. HIV and climate change being profoundly linked communities with stronger response to AIDS epidemic are also better equipped to
 social resilience against climate change threats.The key project activities include identifying and training volunteer community health promoters training healthcare workers and risk groups organising HIV/AIDS campaigns and events and preparing and broadc
asting a drama to be sent in the local radio and printing an educational booklet on HIV/AIDS.</narrative>
