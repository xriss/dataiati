  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project supports sustainable development in the Argentinean Patagonia by enhancing usage of removable energy and recycling of biowaste. It&apos;s executed in two localities, in the village of Chacay Oeste in the province of Chubut and in the town of Sierra 
Grande in the province of Rio Negro. The aim is to reduce greenhouse gases by replacing fossil fuels by environment friendly and simple sun energy technology and by promoting recycling of organic waste. The purpose is to enhance the living conditions of di
sadvantageous citizens and promote sustainable development. The specific objective is to safeguard the functions of a village school in Chacay Oeste by guaranteeing the supply of energy for its needs.In Chacay Oeste live approximately 60 members of the ind
igenous people&apos;s community Mapuche-Tehuelche. The village has the only school available for the children from the surroundings and it has around 50 pupils who come from the village and farer away from the steppe area. The number of inhabitants of the villa
ge has been growing for actions taken to promote school attendance of children in rural areas. This has caused such an increase in energy consumption that the school faces trouble in reception of energy. There isn&apos;t alternative energy source available for 
it and the capacity of the village isn&apos;t enough to satisfy the energy needs of the entire village.  These problems endanger the function of the school and the education of numerous pupils from the steppe area. Through this project the school and the whole 
village will be benefitted by better supply of energy with sun energy collectors and ovens. Also compost heaps will be installed for the recycling of biowaste. The community members will be capacitated of the maintenance and usage of the installations as w
ell as separation of waste.In Sierra Grande with approximately 7600 habitants the project concentrates on capacitation of disadvantageous  groups with limited resources local civic organizations and for example technicians from the provincial and municipal
 environment office. Also in Sierra Grande sun collectors and ovens and compost heaps will be installed in most disadvantageous neighborhoods. The local government has committed to support and enhance project&apos;s activities in order to secure them in the fut
ure as well. The experiences gained thought the project will be taken advantage later on by replicating its activities in other small urban centers of the region.</narrative>
