   <narrative xml:lang="EN">ZHC: Addressing Honey Producers? and Processors? Financial and Marketing Needs</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Project initiatated by Zambian Honey Council to address the financial and marketing needs of their members: honey producers and processors. The motivation for the project rose from the realisation of the fact that if beekeepers are to change from subsisten
ce honey production to honey production as a business they will need access to working capital. Currently working capital is from nearby sources such as a family member / friend / well wisher but will eventually need to change to a loan from a financial in
stitution. If increased honey production is to be promoted trainings in quality production increasing number of beekeepers and improved market linkages linked to access to finance becomes prudent so as to have a constant supply of quantity and quality hone
y on the market (meeting local demand).Specific objectives of the project are:- Help beekeepers increase access to commercial finance through the promotion of savings and credit honey production groups.- Improve honey packers access to credit through the u
se of invoice discount scheme hence increasing their purchasing power (bee products) from beekeepers leading to a constant supply of honey on local markets (supermarkets).  - Improve the marketability of Zambian honey through the promotion of ZHC quality a
ssurance mark. - Improve supply of quality and quantities of honey by beekeepers through strengthening seven (7) ZHC district and establishment of additional area associations. - Improve quality through adoption of ZHC field standards as national standards
 in the country.Women participation is set at 30% in all out lined activities. Within governance issues gender issues will be mainstreamed with at least 30% women leaders in the districts + area associations set up.</narrative>
