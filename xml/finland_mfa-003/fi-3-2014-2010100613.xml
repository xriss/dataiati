   <narrative xml:lang="EN">&quot;The Project Purpose is to increase the engagement of Fida partners in Eastern Africa on advocacy issues through awareness raising and trainings.  Advocating for human rights brings about positive changes, strengthening civil society and creating a legitim
ate space for the protection and promotion of everyone&apos;s rights. Inadequate knowledge on advocacy and absence of leadership guidelines in advocacy has hold back the Church partner from advocacy actions. Fida Partners in Eastern Africa are Full Gospel Churc
hes of Kenya (FGCK), Pentecostal Churches of Uganda (PCU), Free Pentecostal Church of Tanzania (FPCT), Ethiopian Guenet Church (EGC), Ethiopian Full Gospel Believers Church (EFGBC), the Community of Pentecostal Churches in Burundi (CEPBU), Association of P
entecostal Church of Rwanda (ADEPR) and the Pentecostal Churches in Central Africa (CEPAC). The project will be implemented by Fida Eastern Africa Advocacy Programme through these partners. The target groups are the partners and the people who have had the
ir human rights trampled on like people with disabilities, people living with HIV, children and the voiceless. These people are included in the training and articulate the issues themselves (&quot;&quot;human rights by people&quot;&quot;, not only &quot;&quot;human rights for people&quot;&quot;)
. At the same time, the partners are challenged to advocate for, with and through those whose rights are violated. It is the right of every person to be safe from harm, to be treated fairly and with dignity, to live the life they choose, and to have an act
ive part in their community and wider society. Human rights has to do with core values that is important for all people based on fairness, respect, equality, dignity and autonomy. The project will empower Fida Partners in Eastern Africa through awareness a
nd trainings on advocacy and support them to develop policy guidelines on advocacy interventions. The project will develop training materials to be used by partners in training and conduct trainings on the manual. Partners will be supplied with every neces
sary material on advocacy responses. The project will monitor and report on the advocacy implementation process. The project aims at contributing to the reduction of violation of human rights through increased involvement of partners in advocating for huma
n rights.  The expected impact is that those who were voiceless will have a voice through the empowered partners and their rights honoured. By the end of the program there should be an improvement</narrative>
