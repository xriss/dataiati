   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Traditionally the role of older people in Namibia has been to advise their families and communities and to receive care and respect by their children. Today their role is often overlooked. Elderly people need immediate social support and practical assistan
ce but it is likely that public support will assume greater dimension only over the coming years. Immediate objectives of the project are: 0) Effective project management and administration 1) Strengthened capacities of Evangelical Lutheran Church in Namib
ia (ELCIN) to develop community work approach to vulnerable elderly people 2) Successfully performed pilot projects that contribute to empowerment of most vulnerable elderly people and 3) Raising awareness of the various roles elderly people could have in 
the society. Human rights and gender equality are strongly emphasised. Namibia has seen the breaking down of the moral fabric within communities which causes a lack of respect for elderly people. Older women in particular have to deal with a double battle 
as they face abuse and inequality because of their age and gender.The project does not create any new structure or institution as it will be positioned at the office of social service by ELCIN. Along with the project ELCIN will be capacitated to create a n
ew community work approach for the most vulnerable elderly people.   The ultimate beneficiaries of the project are the most vulnerable elderly people over the age of 60 and their communities. Particularly attention is paid to marginalised elders without fa
mily members and vulnerable kinship caregivers who unexpectedly find themselves in the position of raising a second family. In both cases elderly people are subject to abuse. Major indirect beneficiary is the ELCIN.The key project activities include buildi
ng the capacity for effective project management supporting administration with well developed monitoring systems conducting needs and resources analysis designing pilot projects on the basis of the analysis training personnel and volunteers in ageing rela
ted issues developing new models and working methods conceptualising community housing building targeted home-dwelling pilot building community adult education programme building foster grandparents programme organising oral history workshops creating syne
rgies with youth work in communities organising youth-elderly workshops and building networks for effective sharing and awareness raising.</narrative>
