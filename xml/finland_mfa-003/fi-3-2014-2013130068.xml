  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Human Rights Network for Journalists Uganda (HRNJ-U) is a network of over 300 members that delivers on the protection promotion and upholding of media freedoms and rights for journalists in Uganda. Throughout its years of existence the network has remained
 focused to the mapped out institutional mandate of enhancing the promotion protection and respect of human rights by defending and building capacities of journalists to effectively exercise their constitutional rights and fundamental freedoms through the 
media. The network also partners with the East and Horn of Africa Human Rights Defenders Project (EHAHRDP) and EHAHRDP has given positive feedback on the network. The challenges facing journalists in Uganda are serious and they have created unwarranted ram
ifications on the sector?s enjoyment of fundamental civic freedoms as well those of its practitioners. The challenges include an unfavorable regime that has consistently criminalized the work of journalists and the media violence targeting media practition
ers torture government censorship poor remuneration of journalists inadequate knowledge and skills about human rights and the law inadequate resources to meet courts? charges especially for those indicted.The reason for launching the project is to deliver 
Justice to journalists whose rights are violated through litigation measures.  Apparently impunity of individual and institutional perpetrators thrives in the country that deliberately attack journalists in their duty lines. And HRNJ-U is seeking to deal w
ith the situation by undertaking proactive litigation measures to ensure that justice for journalists is realized.</narrative>
