   <narrative xml:lang="EN">SkillsFAST brings together 3 institutions from Finland (SHALIN HAMK and Lumivio Oy) 6 cooperatives from Kenya 2 vocational schools (Tanzania + eSeeker Uganda).  The Tanzania vocational school has a strategic partnership with Muhimbiri National Hospital whi
ch will use the vocational training skills to boost the rehabilitation process for former Methodone users.  eSeeker Uganda provides vocational training in renewable energy to youth and adults. The project is coordinated by Twaweza Communications Twaweza us
es communication as a tool for social transformation within Kenya and has collaborating partners in Tanzania.The main idea of the project is to harness the different competencies and capacities of the complementary stakeholders/beneficiaries into a program
me that delivers supportive services to vocational schools as well as the other partners.  The project cross-diffuses knowledge into the existing cooperative networks and wider society.  At the vocational level the project advances the value of the existin
g curriculum and promotes renewable energy and food systems as a pedagogical practical study.  The project also introduces the teaching of solar energy as an enterprise.  At the cooperative level the project consolidates the knowledge on sustainable techno
logies which is then integrated into the learning circle.  At the same level the Cooperatives get additional technical support allowing them to be competitive in their niche market. Each of the project players has a supportive role to the project ecosystem
. The project is centrally managed and coordinated by Twaweza Communication who also offer their expertise in social  transformation to broaden the projects impact and outreach.SHALIN and the Kenya cooperative network provide the platform through which fie
ld tested information on renewable energy and food systems is packaged for education by HAMK.  HAMK transforms the information into educational modules which are then utilised by both GOIG and eSeeker vocational training (Centers).   Lumivio Oy provides th
e solar start up kits and supporting information (instructional material) the instructional material is transformed into pedagogic content by HAMK in collaboration with the vocational centers who then teach the module.  In Kenya the solar enterprise start 
up kit is introduced directly to the coop network through the trainings and support coordination offered by Twaweza communication.</narrative>
