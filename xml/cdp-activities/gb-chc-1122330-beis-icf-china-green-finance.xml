   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Project purpose: Increased TCFD aligned disclosure amongst financial institutions (FIs) and listed companies at national level and accelerated engagement in Shanghai, Beijing and Guangdong, leads to greater transparency of the green finance market in China. Context and Need for the Project: The project contributes to the ICF China goal to support and incentivise China&#x2019;s transition to a more environmentally sustainable growth model through green finance1, in alignment with the Paris Agreement goals as well as SDG targets 8.4 and 12.62. CDP has identified that the Chinese market needs coordinated pro-ESG investment signals from three stakeholder groups: 1. Regulators who will not impose audacious regulatory requirements without evidence that companies (and FIs) can deliver on ambitious environmental goals. 2. Investors (and FIs3) who cannot rigorously assess the levels of risk within their portfolios and are not incentivised to shift capital towards green investments in the absence of strong evidence of companies&#x2019; carbon footprint and environmental impact 3. Finally, and closing the loop, companies that will not change their business model nor adopt low carbon business objectives without evidence that ESG investments may lower the cost of capital. Fundamentally, it has become clear that disclosure by companies is a vital prerequisite to embedding management of climate risk &#x2013; and risk disclosure - within FIs. The UK is uniquely positioned as a funder due to its unique eco-system of FIs, repositories of world class green finance knowledge and its leading role in financial and non-financial disclosure globally.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Rationale for the choice of project locations: The key stakeholders including People&#x2019;s Bank of China (PBoC), China Security Regulatory Commission (CSRC), Green Finance Committee (GFC), Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) and many investors and state-owned enterprises are headquartered in Beijing. It is important to keep engaging with those stakeholders to support the green finance development in China. Shanghai is the financial centre of China and it also has a tradition of pilot-testing advanced practice. With the help of the Green Finance Development Committee (GFDC) of Lujiazui Council, Shanghai, the project will expand the coverage of advanced information from the central government to Shanghai and the Yangtze River Delta, to improve the transparency and low carbon transition in this dynamic region. Guangzhou is the capital city of Guangdong Province whose GDP ranked 13th in the world if calculated as a country (higher than Spain). Being close to Hong Kong and Macau, Guangdong Province has been one of the most open provinces in China with strong relations with the other countries and regions. The China Emission Exchange which runs the carbon market in Guangdong has done advanced work to pave the road toward a low carbon transition. Launching the pilot in this region, aligning disclosure with TCFD and also sharing best practice with Hong Kong and Macau will both improve the transparency and harmonisation of green finance practices across China.</narrative>
