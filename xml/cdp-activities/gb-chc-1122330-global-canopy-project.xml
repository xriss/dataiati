   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The subgrantee will develop a research report which highlights relevant data currently being captured by global disclosure systems (e.g., CDP) for the assessment, measurement and disclosure of nature-related risks and opportunities in palm oil and where possible other forest risk commodity supply chains. The report must capture information relevant to Palm Oil supply chains as it will help feed into technical guidance being developed as part of a Global Canopy led TNFD-Aligned Palm Oil Pilot.</narrative>
