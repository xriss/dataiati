   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The World Food Programme (WFP) has applied to Sida for funding of 165 MSEK to carry out the three year project &quot;Safety Net Activities&quot; in Sudan during the period 2019-2022. Sida has decided to fund the first two years of the project with 133 milion SEK. Possible support to a third year will depend on the outcome to the evaluation to be carried out during the second year of the project.

The intervention aims at 1) Offering asset-creation activities and technical assistance through safety nets to help food-insecure households to reduce risk and adapt to cliamte change 2) Provide capacity-strengthening support for farmers and local, state and national agricultural institutions 3) Air services are provided for the humanitarian and development community.  

The intervention has a budget of 165 MSEK and is contributing to WFP&apos;s Country Stategic Plan 2019-2023. In addition to the contribution to WFP, 200 000 SEK is set aside for increased monitoring as well as methods development.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The intervention will mainly contribute to fulfilling SO 3 of WFP&apos;s Country Strategic Plan, which objective is that food insecure people in targeted areas and food systems have increased resilience to shocks by 2024.&#xA0;
This will be achieved by the following broad activities, which each include a number of different outputs:
- Offer asset creation activities and technical assistance through saftety nets to help food insecure households to reduce risk and adapt to climate change.
- Provide capacity strenghthening support to farmers and local, state and national agricultural institutions.
Sida also intends to support SO 4 of WFP&apos;s CSP, with the aim that humanitarian and development actors and national systems have improved access to logistics and transports to travel across Sudan.</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">Three installments have been disbursed so far. The first installment of 35 MSEK was disbursed in December 2019. The second installment (25 MSEK) scheduled in May 2020 and the third installment (20MSEK) scheduled in September have been delayed due to the Covid-19 restrictions and disbursed in October 2020.Activity period 1 January 2020 to 31 December 2021.
Despite the Covid-19 which broke out two months after the launch of the preparation phase of the resilience project, WFP has been able to set necessary adaptation and presented a special plan for implementing the planned activities with minimum delays and losses. The mitigation measures to contain the spread of COVID-19 has already started in March 2020 and in April, authorities halted government services and shut local markets and restaurants in Khartoum, that was followed by partial and total lockdown in many states. In response to these restrictions, intensive follow up has been carried out by Sweden staff in order to work with the WFP for adjusting the project implementation modalities with the emerging situation. During this complicated situation, WFP has operated with incredibly limited capacity and restricted movement. Despite challenges the following adjustments have been undertaken: WFP has been utilizing more remote communication channels such as billboards, mobile SMS and radio for communicating messages and delivering a selected number of the trainings to the targeted beneficiaries. Special materials have been designed by the project team to adapt all PHL activities to the COVID-19 context which incorporated respective guidelines from the WFP Regional Bureau as well. To be shared with Sida soon. WFP has put in place some precautionary measures that included social distancing, hygiene awareness and provision of hygienic materials.Sweden has received reports of the PHL baselines for North and west Kordofan.
Update on the different components and activities: Baselines and LF: Sida has received reports of the PHL baselines for North and west Kordofan, the remaining baseline survey is undergoing and supposed to be finalized for both PSN and PHL in October 2020 but not received yet.WFP reported that the baseline for Kassala and White Nile was conducted partially before the project Log frame (LF) was developed. Because of this, some additional PHL questions will be part of the new PSN baseline.Logical Framework (LF): A partially completed LF has been shared with Sweden, to be completed in October 2020.
PSN: Several light asset creations have been carried out even during the Covid-19 restriction period, including terraces construction and rehabilitation, dams cleaning, water harvesting. Activities have been undertaken with respect to the social distancing and COVID-19 precautions in Kassala. WFP has transferred up-front payments to the beneficiaries of PSN. Although we understand the challenges accompanied with the implementation of the PSN during the Covid-19 movement restriction period, but transferring up-front payments was not in compliance with the project plans, as CBT should be combined with seasonality of livelihood activities and Community Based Participatory Planning (CBPP) for ensuring long-term resilience building. However, WFP has reported that they have clearly communicated with the beneficiaries by different means of communication that the up-front CBT is conditional to their work. WFP has also informed that they received good feedback from beneficiaries. We have been informed by WFP that the cash transfer value will be increased to ensure that participants continue to receive adequate and sustainable assistance. As informed by WFP, an analysis on the transfer value has been conducted by referring to the casual labor wage rate, LFB and MEB as a basis to determine the CBT value for PSN. The updated transfer value was adjusted from SDG 1,500 to SDG 3,500. WFP informed that the number of beneficiaries will remain the same. It is assessed that the adjustment related to the inflation and economic crises is deemed reasonable at this stage as reports from the UN show that the average price of the local food basket increased by nearly 200 per cent compared to 2019, and the cost of health services increased by 90 per cent in 2020.
Selection and recertification of the project beneficiaries at the community level: this exercise was implemented in Kassala and North Kordofan by undertaking the CBPP refresher exercise. Further follow up is needed to ensure the efficiency and the transparency of selection.Skill up-grading interventions (trainings, capacity building to beneficiaries): This was initially planned to start in April; however, it is now planned to be continued towards the end of 2020, with full respect for COVID-19 measures. PSN baselines and LF: WFP will conduct joint baseline survey and refresher for both PHL and PSN.
PHL:The component has been subject to changes and delays as follow:The baseline for North and West Kordofan (NK; WK) was submitted to Sida, baseline for Kassala and White Nile has been partially conducted.Social Behavior Change and Communication Campaign (SBCC) has been adjusted with the covid-19 social distancing measures utilizing more remote channels such as billboards, radio and selected number of trainings. Several SBCC events have been moved to 2021. WFP has developed material designed to adapt all PHL activities to the COVID-19 context and will incorporate respective guidelines from the WFP Regional Bureau as well. WFP to share a copy of the material with Sida once ready. For ensuring social distancing and other covid related measures WFP plan to increase the number of training courses in order to decrease the number of participants in each session.A new activity was proposed by WFP ad approved by Sweden, which is to conduct two studies for the purpose of measuring the impact of the PHL on the households in Sudan with special emphasis on the impact of PHL on nutrition. The two studies will be financially covered by the reallocation of some other budget lines including the un-implemented SBCC in 2020 and some travel expenses. One study will be conducted by The Agricultural Research Corporation (ARC) called Agricultural Research Corporation Study and aims to evaluate the efficiency of the hermetic bags (See ANNEX II in the project update). The second study will be jointly conducted by the University of Zurich and Al Gezira University titled: Impact Study on Food Security, Nutritional Health and Poverty. (See ANNEX III in the project update). Submission of Baseline and the LF for PSN was planned be completed in September/October, but not received yet.Budget: The first instalment 35 MSEK disbursed in December 2019 has been spent but beyond the timeline.The second instalment scheduled to be disbursed in June 2020 (25 MSEK) and the third instalment scheduled to be disbursed in September (20MSEK) have been both postponed for the justifications mentioned above. The two instalments have been merged and disbursed to WFP in one disbursement in October 12. WFP has requested a budget reallocation for the PHL section, where they requested the approval of the following reallocation: The total of USD 324,833 has been moved from the PHL budget to 2021. The amount was deducted from the budget line: Social Behavior Change and Communication Campaign (SBCC) and the travel budget line.Budget allocated for the Social Behavior in 2020 has been deducted from USD 725,740 to USD230,000 due to inability to implement all the SBCC in 2020. USD 295457 has been reallocated to be used for a new activity: Studies (Zurich, ARC, Environment) USD 100,000 has been reallocated to be added to monitoring cost. Following the dialogue with WFP teams, Sida has approved the budget reallocation in the PHL budget and will send a written approval.</narrative>
