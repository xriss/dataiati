   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Knowledge for Health (K4Health) Project is the flagship health knowledge management project of USAID&#x2019;s Office of Population and Reproductive Health. K4Health is implemented by the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health&#x2019;s Center for Communication Programs, FHI 360, IntraHealth International, and Management Sciences for Health, in collaboration with a host of other partners around the world. The project inherits a rich store of expertise and resources from predecessor projects going back nearly 40 years.

K4Health meets the knowledge needs of health program managers and health service providers, both directly and via capacity strengthening of institutions and organizations. K4Health strategically connects people, institutions, ideas, and technical information, focusing on creating and continually improving platforms, products, and services that support knowledgeable program managers and service providers. This is accomplished through capture and synthesis of evidence as well as other knowledge management techniques such as knowledge generation, curation, and dissemination.</narrative>
