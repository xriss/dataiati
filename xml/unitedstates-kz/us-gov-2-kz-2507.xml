    <narrative xml:lang="EN">The U.S.~strategic aim in Kazakhstan is to seek to maintain Kazakhstan&apos;s development as a stable, secure, democratic, and prosperous partner that respects international law and agreements, embraces free-market competition and the rule of law, and is a respected regional leader with increasingly robust economic and people-to-people relationships with the United~States. Kazakhstan has made measurable progress toward these goals, and U.S.~assistance has played an important role in supporting this progress; however, there are still critical areas where U.S.~assistance is needed. FY~2017 assistance will focus on promoting an effective civil society and strengthening the capacity of non-governmental organizations, promoting the rule of law and human rights, and increasing access to independent media. U.S.-funded programs will also seek to strengthen border security, combat transnational crime, and promote the professionalization of defense services. Proposed Global Climate Change Initiative (GCCI) funding will support a lower emissions development pathway for Kazakhstan. U.S.~assistance will foster support for U.S.~values, including respect for human rights, including the free exercise of religion or belief, people-centered development, and transparency and accountability in governance. U.S. assistance will build resilience and reduce vulnerability to Russian aggression, increase European integration, and provide continued support for enduring programs.</narrative>
