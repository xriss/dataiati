   <narrative xml:lang="EN">- Delivery of quality healthcare services to an IDA country: The access to healthcare in non-metro cities of India, such as Nagpur (where Zulekha Hospitals is setting up the project) is low, when compared to the regional and global standards.   - Strong demonstration effects on the healthcare industry: The Project will demonstrate best-practice standards in clinical and managerial aspects in a smaller city such as Nagpur, which current lacks adequate thresholds in these areas.   - Increase in South-South investment: As with the IFC investments in other MENA based healthcare operators, Zulekha Hospitals currently has a strong brand name and market presence in the UAE. The Company&apos;&apos;s investment into India will foster much needed South South investment into the country (especially into a non-metro city of India) where there is significant and unmet demand for quality healthcare services.   - Increasing employment: The Project will increase employment in emerging markets, especially in non-metro cities where there is widespread unemployment, and available employable resources.   - Support to women: IFC investment in the Project will support a business promoted and managed by women. In addition, the business also has a high potential to employ women across the healthcare sector from doctors to paramedics staff to administration and support staff.Delivery of quality healthcare services to an IDA country</narrative>
