   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Increasing safe and equitable access to formal and non-formal education services for Syrian crisis-affected children (5-17 years, girls/boys)</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Shafak in coordination with Education and Protection Clusters aims at increasing resilience and affected people&#x2019;s access to basic Education.
The proposed project is part of the SA aiming at delivery of life-saving interventions through the regular programming targeting the displaced and the vulnerable host community in northern Syria. Based on recent assessment conducted, the project addresses Education in Emergency within the Protected Education Emergency and defines the priority areas, maintaining the following two main objectives: 
 scaling up equitable access to education services and
 enhancing the quality of education services
The proposed intervention feeds into the overarching goals of ensuring access to safe, equitable and quality education services for children affected by the crisis in Idleb Governorates (Idleb, Maaret Tamsrin, Harim /Dana) targeting almost 8 schools in the aforementioned areas. Shafak intervention aims to provide education related services for approximately 2400 beneficiaries. All supported schools will have safety and security plans established, resourced and practiced. All activities will be age and gender disaggregated, as has been done in the needs assessment.
Shafak humanitarian response is guided by two main parameters: i) protection and vulnerability criteria of groups at risk and 2) geographical severity of needs.
Overall absorption capacity will be increased through the following: 
Non-formal Education
Shafak will be focusing on increasing access to non-formal education and increasing the absorption capacity of education services, which will be made through the provision of catch up, remedial and literacy and numeracy classes. These classes will run in 2 cycles to be conducted after school timing throughout the year and focus on getting children up to their expected learning levels and ideally lead to pathways to formal education.
The project will use the standard curricula of the Syrian Interim Government.
Psycho-social Support (PSS)
Shafak is an active member of the Child Protection Sub-cluster. It has been discussed with the Child Protection Sub-cluster specialist and will be discussed further during the detailed planning stage. The curriculum used (I-DEAL) is endorsed by the Child Protection Sub-cluster.
Back to Learning Campaigns
Back-to-Learning (BTL) campaigns will be covered by Shafak where 2 BTLs (at the beginning of the project and in the break after the semester) will be conducted to increase awareness among parents and local communities on the importance of education. They include an outreach team (members and a team leader) who will conduct awareness-raising activities, and open day activities.
School Repair
School repair is limited to light repair in classrooms, common spaces and WASH facilities. The WASH component will be discussed further with the WASH Cluster coordinator during the detailed planning stage. Contractors/suppliers will be engaged through a local tender process that follows Shafak standards and procedures. This minimum scale repair will take place in two stages: at the beginning of the project, to enable students to continue their learning without disturbing the educational process, and in the midterm of the educational year, when school is on break.
Capacity Building
The teachers&#x2019; and education personnel&#x2019;s capacity-building will focus on:
-child-centered and protective pedagogy 
-structured PSS and
-enhancement of teachers&#x2019; and education personnel&#x2019;s capacity to deliver quality formal and non-formal education through trainings on teaching remedial and catch-up classes, literacy and numeracy skills (using the ASER). Shafak will make sure all recruited staff and education personnel will not be paid by any other party.
Shafak will make sure that it has facilitated training to approximately 136 teachers and education personnel on key areas such as child-centered protective and interactive methodologies and classroom management.</narrative>
