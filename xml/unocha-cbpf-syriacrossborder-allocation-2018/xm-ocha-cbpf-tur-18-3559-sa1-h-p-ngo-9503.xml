   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Deliver multi-sectoral humanitarian services (health  protection) to the affected people in Afrin district - Aleppo.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The collapse of the health system in northern Syria has pervaded every component of the healthcare continuum and has resulted in a breakdown of the availability of human resources, pharmaceuticals, vaccinations, medical supplies and equipment and other key components of the health system. Health services in northern Syria are provided mostly by NGOs, which play a crucial role in ensuring access to populations that otherwise would be left behind in their access to services. However, health services face acute problems including lack of health structures, poor articulation of emergency and referral systems, overlaps in coverage, duplication of services and poor articulation among primary and secondary levels. Meanwhile, the collapsed civil services and the prolonged crisis have remarkably impacted the people in Syria, especially the vulnerable groups. The recent military operation in Afrin district had impacted mostly women and girls. Multiple incidents of Gender-based Violence GBV have been reported through the existing health and GBV facilities
In Ain al Arab, Bahar managed to cover more than 40 communities with GBV services. After the end of the last project, services were closed and populations in the majority of these communities are no more having access to GBV services. Nowadays, Bahar is waiting for the final approval to launch 2 health centers and a mobile clinic in Ain Al Arab district. Through this project, Bahar will manage to integrate the planned health services with the protection services that will be delivered through this project.
This project aims to provide the people of Afrin Ma&apos;arin, and Ain Al Arab, both host, and IDPs, with crucial and life-saving health and GBV services in order to reduce the morbidity and mortality rates in the target areas as well as prevent GBV and respond to survivors. The project is multi-sectoral and includes both health and protection services in an integrated manner in Afrin district, protection services in Ain Al Arab district, and health services in Ma&apos;arin-A&apos;zaz. The project will contribute to maintaining the delivered services in Bahar health and GBV facilities and centers as follows:
-Bahar PHC 2 Level 2 (L2) Afrin district-Afrin sub-district-Afrin city center
-Bahar PHC L2 Afrin district-Ma&#x2019;btali sub-district-Ma&#x2019;btali city center
-Bahar PHC L2 Afrin district-Bulbul sub-district-Bulbul city center
-Bahar PHC L2 A&apos;zaz district-A&apos;zaz sub-district-Ma&apos;arin community
-Bahar GBV services in Afrin district-Afrin and Ma&apos;btli sub-districts in integration manner with the available health services
-Bahar GBV services in Ain Al Arab city-Ain Al Arab district in integration manner with planned health services that will be delivered by Bahar in the same area.
Through the GBV component of this project Bahar will be able to sustain the GBV services that were being delivered during the last 9 months in Afrin and Ain al Arab, including specialized services embodied in case management, focused PSS, and referrals, as well as, BO will be able to continue working on GBV prevention and mitigation levels applying a community-based approach concretizes in awareness raising sessions, IEC campaigns, and non-focused PSS which all will be implemented within the WGSSs and through outreach teams using diverse means of implementation such as individual and group sessions, door to door visits, brochures distributions, group discussions, and social events bearing in mind that men and key people will be also engaged in awareness sessions on GBV since they represent the major part of decisions makers who can play a positive role in leading entrenched advocacy for fighting GBV among society. Moreover, Bahar will aim to empower vulnerable women and girls by providing vocational training on sewing in Afrin, Ma&#x2019;btali, and Ain Al Arab WGSSs, and educational courses in Ain al Arab. The health services are designed to last for 6 months, while protection services will be delivered throughout 10 months.</narrative>
