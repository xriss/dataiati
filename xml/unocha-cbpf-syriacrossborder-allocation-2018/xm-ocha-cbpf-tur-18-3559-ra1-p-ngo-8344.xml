   <narrative xml:lang="EN">IhsanRD in coordination with GC,Shafak and protection cluster aim to alleviate suffering, enhance protection and build resilience of individuals and communities. The project is designed to respond to the influx of new IDPs displaced to Idleb and in response to the Northwest Emergency Response Allocation Strategy Paper. This will be done through 1) the creation of standardized mobile teams providing protection, CP, and GBV services 2) the expansion of existing community centers (WGSS and CFS), and 3) improved coordination of the emergency response in Idlib governorate and western-northern Aleppo governorate. In particular, the 3 organizations will leverage the combined technical expertise and geographic coverage to provide a harmonized and comprehensive approach to the provision of prevention and response services for new IDPs in northern Syria. 
The expected outcome of the project will be to: Enhance the prevention and mitigation of protection risks, and respond to protection needs through provision of integrated emergency protection services, including GBV, CP and MA. This will be done through:
- Provision of integrated emergency protection services through mobile teams including protection specialized services
- Expansion of existing protection facilities which will focus on IDP&apos;s through regular center activities and case management services

Protection Services: In providing services, each organization will implement an agreed mobile team structure and training plan for new staff. Mobile teams will target areas with high numbers of new IDPs and adapt locations based on the changing needs. Activities will include prevention and response services. Existing static facilities will be expanded under the project to follow an integrated protection model, with the inclusion of protection, CP, or GBV services as relevant. 

Capacity Building: Protection training will be provided internally for new staff of the mobile teams and center expansions. Trainings will be coordinated between the 3 organizations to make use of existing capacity and reduce duplication. External trainings of 1 to 2 days will be provided to non-protection humanitarian actors to encourage referrals between the sectors. 

Coordination: Coordination will take place with actors in Syria and in Turkey at district level, as well as higher level coordination with Shafak, Ihsan and the protection cluster. It is understood that the target locations have numerous existing actors but coordination between them remains weak. Shafak, Ihsan and Global Communities are currently focal points for Idleb City, Jebel Saman, and Harim districts respectively, building on our capacity to provide integrated protection services. Each organization will work within their respective districts to provide coordination with other protection actors to ensure sufficient coverage of priority areas with high numbers of new arrivals. In addition, we will coordinate within our respective districts with non-protection actors to facilitate referrals, share information about protection services, and engage in joint activities such as distributions,Each organization will have dedicated focal points in Syria and Turkey.

Ihsan&#x2019;s project aims to provide protection related services for approximately 39,413 (MT and Expansion) beneficiaries - 30,000 Approximately through 9 emergency mobile teams, 9,285 through 2 community centers activities (WGSS and CFS), and 128 through capacity building. The project will create 7 new mobile teams in Jebel Semaan District, tentatively targeting the following communities: Jeser Al-shoghor, Kafar Ouied, Armanaz and Jarablus. The project will also expand 2 CFS/WGSS activities  in Enjara and Armanaz  location to expand and fill the gaps of CP/GBV protection services and support the 2 exist mobile team by materials to expand the protectio</narrative>
