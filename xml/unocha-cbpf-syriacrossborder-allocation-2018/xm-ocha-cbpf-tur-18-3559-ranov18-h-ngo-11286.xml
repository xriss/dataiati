   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In Jabal Smaan District 387,561 persons are risking to lose a vital service if &#x201C;Al-Huda Hospita&#x201D; stops its services. Due to the collapse of the health system in Northern Syria jeopardizes the continuity of care by lack of human resources, pharmaceuticals, vaccinations, medical supplies and medical equipment to serve most vulnerable people. 

Availability of health services in Northern Syria is ensured mostly by NGOs. Despite this, health continues to have acute problems including lack of health systems structures,  weak emergency and referral systems.  On another hand, isolation of primary health care from secondary Health Care risk to create a rupture in health service continuity and in a nutshell risking to loose quality of health services and by that risking to loose lives. 

According to OCHA , since late 2017 North-West of Syria received several influx of internally displaced people (IDPs) from different parts of the country, exacerbating already existing high levels of needs. These new displacements had a noticeable effect on the number of people in need of humanitarian assistance in North-West Syria, which increased from over 2.3 million in August 2017 to almost 2.7 million people over a year from which 6 % are in the area of intervention considered in this proposal. According to CCCM report and OCHA, in September 2018 over 84,000 people were newly displaced in Syria. Most recently, an estimated 53,000 people were newly displaced in Idleb resulting from renewed conflict in the first half of September 2018. As of October 2018, out of the total number of people in need 1.9 million are displaced people (IDPs). The impact of the winter season   increase humanitarian needs especially for displaced people, affecting water and sanitation in camps, health, food, and winterization services as life-saving humanitarian services. 

On another, shortage of funds supporting such a vital and urgent service is also major dominator for SKT to apply to this reserve allocation to saves lives. 


The Proposed project aims to respond to immediate emergency requirements for most vulnerable communities as well as cover the vital gaps in the health system. The proposed project aims to improve the access of IDPs and host communities in Western rural side of Aleppo to emergency health care services by running one secondary health care hospital located in western Aleppo. Al-Huda Hospital plays a vital role providing vital and life-saving health services to the vulnerable population from Jabal Smaan, Daret Azza, Haritan and Atareb sub-districts. The proposed hospital is out funds since June 2018 and is risking stopping to provide its services if no urgent fund allocated to continue operating. 
This proposal aims to cover the running cost of primary and secondary health services provided by Al-Huda Hospital as well the emergency referral services by supporting the running cost of three  ambulances.

In close coordination with  Health Cluster partners, Aleppo Health Directorate and local councils the hospital was found critical and an urgent support is needed to save lives. 


The proposed project will follow the logic of 2018&#x2019;s SKT baseline to ensure a high level of gender equality and maintain General Assembly resolution 57/306 (PSEA) related to Protection from Sexual Exploitation and Abuse (PSEA). On another hand, this equality could be jeopardized by any unpredictable change in the field and/or flow of patients due trauma and illness cases and medical priorities/triage.</narrative>
