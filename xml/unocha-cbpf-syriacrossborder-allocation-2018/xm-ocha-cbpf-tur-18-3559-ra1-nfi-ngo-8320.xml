   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Emergency Life-saving for Idlib by providing Multi-Purpose Cash Grants (MPGs)</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project aims to provide emergency assistance to recently displaced populations by providing Multi-Purpose Cash Grants (MPGs) to the most vulnerable IDP families which displaced within the last 2 months due to the continuous dispute and conflict in their areas, which caused big displacement influxes towards Idleb.

The project is considered as a rapid response for those affected IDPs to help them cope with the harsh conditions and secure their needs in a dignified way, by distributing one-off cash grant with a value of 150 $ per HH. The project and the grant amount was designed to allow beneficiaries cover their Shelter and NFI needs for the first month of displacement, such as renting a house, purchasing NFI items and etc. since this cash modality will give them flexibility in choosing items they need and to give the project an ability to meet all changes in beneficiary needs.

Through the proposed project, Violet seek to target 1466 newly displaced toward Idleb governorate due to the last escalation in northern Syria. The beneficiaries will be selected in close coordination with the local councils and civil authorities  in the targeted areas based on the vulnerability and eligibility criteria including displacement duration criteria, since the newly IDPs are the most vulnerable groups to the shocks. Also, the project will prioritize the women headed households as well as the households with children, disabilities, pregnant, and lactating women. 

Violet cover the areas (Idleb and Saraqab communities in Idleb sub-districts, as well as toJarjanaz and Ghadqa communities in Ma&apos;ret Al Nu&apos;man sub-district, moreover to Has in Kafr Nubul sub-district.) reaching 1466 vulnerable and newly IDP HHs without any duplication by cooperation with others humanitarian actors there. Since Violet, through its &#x2018;on the ground&#x2019; operation team and its prior experience in Idleb governorate will be able to access the locations and markets during the project implementation.

Due to the lack of the banking system in northern Syria, Violet will identify the money transfer agents through conducting a competitive process after assessing the markets and the vendors&apos; capacities in the local markets. where the identified vendors will be responsible for delivering the MPG&apos;s amount to the beneficiaries in the different locations. 

The distribution of cash grants will be conducted in two steps, the first, Violet field team will distribute vouchers to the beneficiaries, each voucher has beneficiary name with a unique number, the next step, the beneficiary will redeem the voucher with its cash value (150 $) from the transfer agency immediately, since staff from the agency will be accompanied to distribution team in all distribution points.

Prior to the MPG distribution, a rapid market assessment in terms of availability of the SNFI items, prices, and the accessibility will be conducted to make sure the local markets are functioning and to ensure all beneficiaries have a good and equal accessibility to the different goods and services.</narrative>
