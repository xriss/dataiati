  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The collapse of the health system in northern Syria has pervaded every component of the healthcare continuum and has resulted in the breakdown of the availability of human resources, pharmaceuticals, vaccinations, and medical supplies and equipment. Availability of health services in northern Syria is ensured mostly by NGOs. Despite this, health continues to have acute problems including lack of health systems structures, poor articulation of emergency and referral systems and poor articulation of efforts among primary and secondary levels.
Coordinated efforts of health services in northern Aleppo has the potential to save lives in one of the most challenging areas of northern Syria affected by the humanitarian crisis since 2011: the Euphrates Shield area. This area has already 950,000 people, from which up to 60% are IDPs that came in the last 4 years. Several waves of displacement continue to reach this area. The last arrivals were from Douma/Eastern Ghouta area are estimated in around 60,000 new IDPs who are living in dire conditions affected by lack of basic needs. The situation is even more constrained due to the limited number of humanitarian organizations that can operate in the area. The severe gaps in healthcare provision and the limited response of agencies operating in the Euphrates Shield area calls for an improved response based on PHC strengthening. 

The Proposed project aims to cover the gaps in primary health care services, specialized maternity, and pediatric secondary Healthcare, and Intensive Care Unit services and child protecction targeting IDPs and Host community severely affected from the last military operation in Northern Aleppo and new IDPs waves reached the target area from Duma and Homs areas. 

The proposed project will cover a catchment population of 550,000 people divided into 60% IDPs and 40 are Host Community residency. The proposed project will make ensure a high level of gender equality and Protection from Sexual Exploitation and Abuse ( PSEA) mechanism to report directly on any possible issues related to this,
