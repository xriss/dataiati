  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Global Communities in coordination with Shafak, Ihsan and the protection cluster aim to alleviate suffering, enhance protection and build resilience of individuals and communities. The project is designed to respond to the influx of new IDPs displaced to Idleb and in response to the Northwest Emergency Response Allocation Strategy Paper. This will be done through 1) the creation of standardized mobile teams providing protection, CP, and GBV services 2) the expansion of existing community centers (WGSS, YEP and CFS), and 3) improved coordination of the emergency response in Idlib governorate and western-northern Aleppo governorate. In particular, the 3 organizations will leverage the combined technical expertise and geographic coverage to provide a harmonized and comprehensive approach to the provision of prevention and response services for new IDPs in northern Syria. 

The expected outcome of the project will be to: Enhance the prevention and mitigation of protection risks, and respond to protection needs through provision of integrated emergency protection services, including GBV, CP and MA. This will be done through:
- Provision of integrated emergency protection services through mobile teams.
- Expansion of existing protection facilities

Protection Services: In providing services, each organization will implement an agreed mobile team structure and training plan for new staff. Mobile teams will target areas with high numbers of new IDPs and adapt locations based on the changing needs. Activities will include prevention and response services based on the emergency response package and making referrals according to the cluster&apos;s SOPs. Existing static facilities will be expanded under the project to follow an integrated protection model. Mobile teams will provide PFA and awareness activities for protection, CP, GBV and MA, as well as provided specialized services where appropriate.

Capacity Building: Protection training will be provided internally for new staff of the mobile teams and center expansions. Trainings will be coordinated between the 3 organizations to make use of existing capacity and reduce duplication, with trainers and tools agreed on jointly. External trainings of 1 to 2 days will be provided to non-protection humanitarian actors to encourage safe and appropriate referrals between the sectors. 

Coordination: Coordination will take place with actors in Syria and in Turkey at district level, as well as higher level coordination with Shafak, Ihsan and the protection cluster where necessary. It is understood that the target locations have numerous existing actors but coordination between them remains weak. Shafak, Ihsan and Global Communities are currently focal points for Idleb City, Jebel Saman, and Harim districts respectively, building on our capacity to provide integrated protection services. The primary focus of coordination will take place within each organization&apos;s respective districts to provide coordination with other protection actors to ensure sufficient coverage of priority areas with high numbers of new arrivals. In addition, we will coordinate within our respective districts with non-protection actors to facilitate referrals, share information about protection services, and engage in joint activities such as distributions. Each organization will have dedicated focal points in Syria and Turkey.

Global Communities&#x2019;s project aims to provide protection related services for approximately 27,500 beneficiaries through 5 emergency mobile teams and 9 community centers (WGSS and CFS), and 93 through capacity building. The project will implement 5 mobile teams in Harim District, tentatively targeting the following communities: Salqin, Harim, Dana, Kafr Deryan, and Termanin. The project will also expand 9 CFS/WGSS in Atma, Qah and Sarmada location to expand CP/GBV/protection services.</narrative>
