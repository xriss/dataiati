   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Emergency Response to address the food insecurity by improving access to adequate food for 1250  IDPs and Host HHs in Afrin.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project will provide life-saving humanitarian food assistance to 900  HHs of the most vulnerable forcibly displaced HHs from EG, Homs and Damascus arrived to Afrin sub-district in 2018. In addition, the project will support 350 most vulnerable host HHs in order to avoid any bias and internal conflict between IDPs and the host communities.
GAN was providing HHS in Eastern Ghouta and Damascus with food rations and FSL projects for four years before their evacuation, so it is tracking them to their final destination in Idleb and Afrin. On June 2018, GAN distributed 100 cooked meals to EG IDPs and in September it distributed ready to eat ration to 200 EG IDPs HHs.  During providing lifesaving assistance to them, GAN found that many IDPs from Homs who arrived before to Afrin are in need so it included them in its distribution plan. In implementing this project, we will engage with communities and local authorities such as Afrin local council to identify and prioritize beneficiaries, so assistance can be delivered quickly to allow  effective and efficient response to the acute food security needs of the new arriving IDPs from EG, Homs and Damascus and the most vulnerable host HHs. GAN had already been implementing a cash voucher transfer-based project in Northern Syria (Ma&#x2019;ret AlNuman) and Turkey/Gaziantep, therefore we will utilize this experience and lessons learned in this project. The project will last for 5 months through a restricted voucher modality (e-voucher) with the aim of saving lives and ensuring continued and regular access to food by a monthly 50$ which will last for three months with the total of 150$ for each HH. Each HH head will receive an e-voucher card to with guidance package (includes the assistance terms, list of vendors, list of items, instructions, and voucher NFC card) and two orientation sessions during the first preparatory month. The HH head will be able to use the e-voucher card immediately after the training sessions at the beginning of the second month. It is worth mentioning that all the activities of assessing the market for the second time (GAN conducted a market assessment in Afrin and it will be attached), selecting beneficiaries, contracting vendors, contracting the e-voucher service provider, recruiting MampE officers, training the vendors and beneficiaries on the cards and distribution of terminal POS to vendors will happen together during the first month. Starting from the second month, the beneficiary will be able to buy with 50$ his/her needs among 40 specified spices with restricted amounts that are allowed in the e-voucher card to fulfill the calorie standard set by the WFP. The project will utilize the restricted voucher modality using (e-voucher system) as a main component for the implementation and GAN conducted a market assessment in Afrin sub-district and found that there is a suitable market for every 200 HHs. Compared to other alternatives of disbursing cash, including paper vouchers, GAN chose to implement through e-voucher system based on many reasons, such as saving the dignity of beneficiaries and creates a safe space for IDPs to be engaged with the host communities,as to prevent of food basket selling which is frequently happened. the e-voucher system increases the variety of food spices which has a good health and nutrition impact on beneficiaries for example they will be able to buy fresh meat, chicken, and vegetables beside what they need of groceries, at the same time the system will prevent buying not allowable items such as cigarettes. However, GAN conducted a feasibility study which will be externally attached under the name (Comparison between Food basket and e-voucher). the preparation time for this process will be as or less than the food baskets preparation time as for our past experience.
 MampE plan will be conducted during the project with PDM and a clear complaint mechanism for beneficiaries against vendors and employees</narrative>
