   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Increase safe and equitable access to formal and non-formal education for children (5-17, boys and girls) in northern Syria.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Takaful will lead a consortium with Ataa and Watan organizations, as sub-implementing partners, through the entire project&apos;s duration which primarily aims to support formal and non-formal education for 16793 (5-17 boys,girls) who are dropping out or at risk of school drop-out, through supporting schools that have ended fund or will end in Jan, in addition to providing the dropped-out children with non-formal education. 
This project is critical due to its significance in mitigating social risks that might lead to educational gaps if they were not dealt with immediately. These risks include early marriage, recruitment into armed groups, and child labor.
The project is based on three major interventions: 
1-Takaful will cooperate with Watan and Ataa to support formal education in 14 schools that are located in Dana, Khan Shaykun, Teftnaz, where those schools include 5543 students (boys and girls) and their fund has ended or will end soon. The intervention minimizes the risk of students dropping out, where monthly incentives to teachers will be provided, as they don&#x2019;t have any alternative fund in addition to providing schools with heating materials, and operational costs. 
2-Due to the fact that Azaz District has high priority, high severity scale, low access by other NGOs, and large numbers of IDPs, Takaful will support the educational process in this district through providing 1250 Out of School Children (OOSC), boys and girls, IDPs and HCs with non-formal education in 5 schools through catch up classes using curriculum B for one-semester. Those intensive sessions will help OOSC to catch up with their peers in the formal education.
Teachers will be provided with incentives, as they don&apos;t receive any financial support from any other NGOs, monthly operational costs, and heating materials to face the cold of winter.
PSS weekly sessions will also help children, who spent long time away from school, ridding of the harsh experience of war conditions and motivate them to continue their study at school. 
The five targeted schools will be equipped with safety and security tools, also, the project will involve 84 children with disability , who drop out of school, and overcome the difficulties that they may face through providing them with transportation service in addition to providing schools with tools for children with disability. 
Learning materials will be distributed to students, boys and girls. distributing teaching materials to teachers and teaching resources for school. 
Moreover, teachers will receive light training sessions on non-formal education, curriculum B, child protection, and PSS. 
3-Takaful will work in Azaz District due to the great need of supporting the formal and non-formal education within 25 schools that include 10000 students, boys and girls,IDPs and HCs where those schools suffer from poor capacities and need urgent assistance in order to increase their absorption capacity for more students. Where receiving more dropped out students can be guaranteed through providing safety and security tools, disability requirement, 
student kits will be distributed students, teacher kits and teaching resources, light training sessions on non-formal education curriculum B, child protection, and PSS. 
As the project aims to meet the urgent needs of education, we will implement the activities directly from the first day. 
Plan B will be implemented if we couldn&apos;t reach some schools or they receive support from another NGO, by selecting schools with the same criteria in other sub-districts (Aghtrin, Saraqab, Benesh) where we have full access. 
We coordinated with protection cluster to provide protection activities in the project. A methodology was adopted according to the cluster&apos;s guidance, taking into account safe access to children with disability. 
At the end of the project, we will work with other organizations and Education Directorate to ensure that the process continues by providing other sources of supp</narrative>
