   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project consists of two phases that will take place in the rural of Maarat An Numan Sub-district in Idleb province:
1-The summer phase:
1-1-Provide 1128 school-aged children (482 boys/ 646 girls) with catch-up classes of the recent IDPs in the 4 targeted communities:
a-Maar Shurin (Primary Maarshurin school) expected to receive 165 children (66 boys,99 girls)
b-Maasaran (Eastern Maasaran or Abd Alkareem AlKasem) expected to receive 308 children (139 boys,169 girls)
c-Ghadqa (Ahmad Kablan school) expected to receive 307 children (138 boys,169 girls)
d-Telamnas (Saleh ALIsmael school) expected to receive 348 children (139 boys,209 girls)
the targeted children are who recently came from military encircled areas and didn&apos;t have regular access to safe education in a protective environment, so provision the catch-up classes and recreational activities with learning supplies and school bags will increase access to education. On the other hand: out of school children and students who are at risk of dropping out will be integrated into the existing education system and will be protected from many child-protection risks including the risk of early marriage and child labor, recruitment and exploitation, Edu staff will be supported by incentives (36 teachers, 12 admin staff, 8 cleaners) for one month to ensure provision of a quality education.
1-2- Minor rehabilitation of the assigned five schools (Abd Alkareem Serjawi in Maar Shurin, Amro Ibn Alas and Abd Alkareem AlKasem in Maasaran, Ahmad Kablan in Ghadqa, Khaled Kawas in Telamnas), the rehab will include (windows, doors, boards, students and teachers&#x2019; desks, and light rehab of wash facilities) as well as providing extra 210 students&apos; desks to accommodate more students.
These rehab activities will improve and increase the safe access to schools and ensure children are receiving education in a safe and protected environment. As parents might not send their children to schools due to the inappropriate school condition. Rehabilitating the targeted schools will make sure that school capacity is increased and more students can benefit its education services.
2- provision of formal and non-formal education for the academic year: supporting the five assigned schools by education directorate in Maarat An Numan as a priority of supporting the crowded schools in rural areas. 
the targeted schools are the same rehabilitated ones that have about 113 classrooms and had served about 3790 students (2018 boys, 1772 girls) last year.
First, 8 BTL campaigns will be conducted in the targeted communities before and at the end of the academic year, to raise the awareness about the importance of education for both boys,girls and flag the risks of not enrolling children in schools.
ASER test will be conducted to help us better plan and focus on the needed type of educational activities based on ASER results,also to capture the intervention impact.
GAN will establish one durable child-friendly space in each school (total 5) to conduct PSS activities 1 time a week for each class.
in addition to provide students (boys and girls) with learning materials like stationery, pens, notebooks and school bags, in the line with distributing hygiene dignity kits for girls (between 11-17) and normal HKs for other students (boys, girls) in the targeted school and providing teachers and facilitators with teaching materials, and also equip schools with first-aid kits and fire-extinguisher as part of the safety and security plan.
those activities increase access to schools and provide a safe and protected environment for learning.
Edu staff will be provided with incentives for 9 months (138 teachers, 26 admin staff, 5 child protection officers,1 child protection supervisor, 20 activity facilitators and 16 cleaners) of both genders, GAN will coordinate with ED to ensure the payments are not duplicated by other.
