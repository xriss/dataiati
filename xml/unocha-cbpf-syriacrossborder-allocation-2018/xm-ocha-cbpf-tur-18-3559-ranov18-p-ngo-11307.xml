   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Protection Response through Integrated Mobile Emergency Services (PRIMES)/ Shafak</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Project Summary: Shafak in coordination with IHSAN, SEMA, HRO, Global communities and The Protection Cluster aim to alleviate suffering, enhance protection and build resilience of individuals and communities. The project is designed to respond to the influx of new IDPs displaced to Idleb and in response to the Northwest Emergency Response Allocation Strategy Paper. This will be done through 1) the creation of standardized mobile teams providing protection, CP, and GBV services 2) the expansion of existing community centers (WGSS and CFS), and 3) improved coordination of the emergency response in Idleb governorate and western-northern Aleppo governorate. In particular, the 5 organizations will leverage the combined technical expertise and geographic coverage to provide a harmonized and comprehensive approach to the provision of prevention and response services for new IDPs in northern Syria. 
The expected outcome of the project will be to:
Enhance the prevention and mitigation of protection risks, and respond to protection needs through provision of integrated emergency protection services, including GBV, CP and MA.
Each organization will implement an agreed mobile team structure and training plan for new staff. Mobile teams will target areas with high numbers of IDPs and adapt locations based on the changing needs. Activities will include prevention and response services, Identification of GBV and CP cases, referral to specialized (GBV and CP) and non-specialized services, and provide direct support to high priority cases. Existing static facilities will be expanded under the project to follow an integrated protection model, specialized GBV serveries will be delivered in a wider range by the team in the facility, while outreach teams will be able to identify cases and refer them to the proper specialized service needed, RE sessions will be conducted in all locations of new IDP&#x2019;S by outreach teams after liaising with UNMAS avoid duplication. 
Capacity Building: Protection training will be provided internally for new staff of the mobile teams and center expansions. Trainings will be coordinated between the 5 organizations to make use of existing capacity and reduce duplication. External trainings of 1 to 2 days will be provided to non-protection humanitarian actors to encourage referrals between the sectors. 
Coordination: Coordination will take place with actors in Syria and in Turkey at district level, as well as higher level coordination with Shafak, IHSAN, SEMA, HRO, Global communities, and the protection cluster. It is understood that the target locations have numerous existing actors but coordination between them remains weak. Shafak, IHSAN, SEMA, HRO, Global communities are currently focal points for Idleb district, Azaz district, Jebel Saman district, Jisr As Shugur district, and Harim districts respectively, building on our capacity to provide integrated protection services. Each organization will work within their respective districts to provide coordination with other protection actors to ensure sufficient coverage of priority areas with high numbers of new arrivals. In addition, we will coordinate within our respective districts with non-protection actors to facilitate referrals, share information about protection services, and engage in joint activities such as distributions. Each organization will have dedicated focal points in Syria and Turkey.
Shafak&#x2019;s project aims to provide protection related services for approximately 31,500 beneficiaries through 5 emergency mobile teams, 400 for referrals, 150 with direct assistance and 82 through capacity building. The project will implement 5 mobile teams in Idleb district, tentatively targeting Idleb district. The project will also expand 1 WGSS in Maart Tmisreen location to expand in providing GBV/protection services and 1 CFS Child Friendly Space in Idleb- Bennsh.</narrative>
