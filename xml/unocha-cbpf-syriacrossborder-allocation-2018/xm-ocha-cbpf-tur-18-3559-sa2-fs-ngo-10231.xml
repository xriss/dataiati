  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The proposed action will protect food security and livelihoods through the rehabilitation of agricultural infrastructure and creation of Cash-for-work income generation opportunities in Idleb. Specifically, the action will protect the livelihoods of conflict affected households &#x2013; both displaced and host-communities &#x2013; through rehabilitation of critical agriculture infrastructure and Cash-for-work (CfW) programs. 
The CfW program will rehabilitate the Al Roj plain irrigation system in rural Idleb which serves 700 hectares of agricultural land and approx. 510 farming households across nine villages in Jisr-Ash-Shugur, Ariha and Mhambal sub-districts of Ariha.  Planned works are informed by a rapid infrastructure survey and technical visits by Big Heart engineers completed during July 2018, in addition to Key Informant Interviews with Water Association members and farmers. Discussions have also been held with Hand in Hand and the Qatari Red Crescent (QRC), both of which have also provided support to the targeted irrigation system, with QRC completing initial reconstruction works on the southern system (targeted under this proposal) and Hand in Hand currently in the final months of a project focused on rehabilitation of the northern section of the system, sectors 8 &#x2013; 17. Based on the information gathered during July 2018, proposed works will focus on rehabilitation of irrigation channels from sector 1 to 8 in the southern part of the Al Rouge plain irrigation system, with total 20 kilometres rehabilitated over the project duration. This will include works to clear channels and remove sediment and stones along approximately 15 kilometers to improve system efficiency and ensure optimal water delivery to agricultural land. In addition, essential levelling and repair works will be completed along approx. 5 kilometres of the system. This will address damaged areas and ensure optimal water flow and system efficiency. Reinforced concrete tiles will be introduced in these areas to reinforce damaged sections of canals. An insulating layer (MC0) will also be introduced between concrete slabs to address any joints or cracks and ensure channels are water-tight. Approximately 18 sluice gates and valves will also be repaired as required in order to ensure optimal control of water flow across the system.  These rehabilitation works will support agricultural production in the area and protect the long-term livelihoods of 510 farming households/ 3,060 direct beneficiaries. 

Planned rehabilitation works will be completed using CfW which will provide conditional cash transfers and income generation opportunities directly benefiting 960 people. Total 120 unskilled workers (of which 80 responsible for clearing irrigation systems and 40 dedicated to support leveling and reinforcement of damaged sections) will each complete three months of work, working an average of 22 days per month for a total of 66 days over the three-month duration. In addition, 30 semi-skilled workers will also work an average of 22 days per month over the five-month rehabilitation implementation period, giving a total of 110 days worked per semi-skilled CfW beneficiary. Ten of these will act as team leaders for the clearance times with the remaining 20 providing support to skilled workers for  the more technical leveling and repair works. Finally, ten skilled workers will lead on the leveling and concrete works required to repair an estimated 5 kilometres of the system. All CfW activities will be completed under the technical supervision of Big Heart engineers and the Water Associations. Skilled CfW beneficiaries will also each work an average of 22 days over the five-month rehabilitation implementation period, giving a total of 110 days worked per skilled CfW beneficiary. This approach is in line with Big Hearts food security programming by providing repeat assistance for a minimum of three months to allow greater impact on household food security than one-off assistance.</narrative>
