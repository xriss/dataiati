   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Winter Heating Support to Vulnerable Populations in Jebel Saman, Badama, and Jisr-Ash-Shugur</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In line with the SNFI cluster priority areas, Global Communities will provide critically needed liquid and solid heating fuel [via vouchers] and stoves [in-kind distributions] to an estimated 1,600 vulnerable households in Jebel Saman sub-district in Aleppo Governorate, and Badama and Jisr-Ash-Shugur sub-districts in Idleb Governorates in Northwest Syria.  Beneficiaries will be selected in accordance to established vulnerability criteria, including prioritization of female-headed households, families with disabled or elderly family members, families with more than six persons living in the home, families with children below six years old, families with severely ill members, and households where the majority of employment-age family members are unemployed.

We will prioritize female headed households targeting approximately 60% women-headed households and 40% male headed households, applying vulnerability criteria to select the specific households. In calculating the number of men, women, boys and girls for each household, we assume that an average household of six consists of one man, one woman, and four children. There will naturally be some variance among numbers when the actual household beneficiaries are selected and verified. 

Although, beneficiaries will primarily be selected based on their vulnerability, we will aim to balance support to both the IDP and host community. Often when aid is not provided in a balanced manner, or specifically targets just one group, conflict can erupt in the community between the host and IDP population. With the conflict in its eight year, the resources of the host community has in many cases been depleted and there are also vulnerable people among them who need assistance. 

The proposed targeted locations for this project will be according to the locations prioritized by the Emergency Shelter and NFI Cluster (priority areas 1 and 2) in Idleb (Badama and Jisr-Ash-Shugur sub-districts) and West Aleppo (Jebel Saman sub-district). 

The project is designed to be six months, the plan is to cover the heating fuel and stoves for the targeted population during the harsh winter from December 2018 to February 2019. This project is designed to be cost effective to OCHA, and leverages existing operations and program resources to maximize efficiency.  We have included minimal support costs, and limited costs for administrative and operational support staff.

Global Communities will implement this project directly, drawing on our existing knowledge of and relationship with the target communities. Global Communities will procure and distribute winterization items to beneficiary households.  
This project is designed to have good impact on the markets and the health of the targeted population, as it will refresh the local markets, and mitigate the use of the negative coping mechanisms for heating [i.e. burning clothes, shoes, plastic, etc.] 
For particularly vulnerable households, such as elderly or physically disabled headed households, we will provide assistance to install the stoves if the families are not able to utilize or properly install the stoves themselves.
Procured and distributed winterization materials will be at minimum promoted by the Emergency Shelter and NFI Cluster- Turkey hub.</narrative>
