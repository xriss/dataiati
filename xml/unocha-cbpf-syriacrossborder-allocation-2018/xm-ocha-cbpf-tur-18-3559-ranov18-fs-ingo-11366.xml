   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Emergency Food Security Vouchers in Idleb</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Triggered by displacement, conflict and food accessibility, food insecurity is high in Idleb Governorate with concerning trends of increased food-related negative coping strategies, particularly among displaced households. To meet the food security needs, GOAL proposes a Food Distribution project that will target 4,771 highly vulnerable households (28,785 individuals) in 34 town and villages in the sub-districts of Harim and Salqin (Harim district). The selected modality is food voucher distribution which has consistently been preferred by GOAL beneficiaries in distribution and post-distribution monitoring activities and has shown positive impacts on the local markets and vendors. The selected locations are currently facing a funding gap in GOAL&#x2019;s larger Food Security Programme funded by Food For Peace (FFP), leaving many people in need without assistance. The other sub-districts in Idleb are covered under GOAL&apos;s Food Security Programme funded by FFP except the 34 villages in the sub-districts of Harim and Salqin of the Harim District, Idleb Governorate - targeted under this proposed action.

The project will be implemented over a duration of four months starting March 2018 and will comprise three rounds of food voucher distribution to highly vulnerable displaced and host community households meeting the Food Security Programme beneficiary eligibility criteria. Priority will be given to displaced households, especially households headed by single or widowed women, unaccompanied minors, persons with disability and elderly persons. The most marginalised beneficiaries will be eligible for additional support (such as home delivery) as well as referral to other services identified through a service mapping exercise in the targeted locations. GOAL Syria Social Workers will accompany distribution teams to identify and refer households / individuals in need of protection or other assistance that is beyond GOAL capacity. Indirect beneficiaries of this proposed project will be GOAL selected shopkeepers that will benefit from a more stable income throughout the life of the project, as well as improve their capacity to assess and meet local market demand. 

In the selected areas, GOAL has already been delivering food voucher distribution programming with support from FFP and other donors as part of its larger Food Security Programme since 2014 with a current caseload of 7,812 households, and GOAL has capacity to conduct regular market analysis and monitoring. The proposed activities, locations and beneficiary targets have been consulted with the Food Security Cluster and GOAL Syria field-based teams. As per usual, GOAL will continue working with Local Councils to reach out local communities and ensure communication with direct aid recipients. Distribution and Post-Distribution monitoring activities will inform further adjustments needed to GOAL Food Security programming.</narrative>
