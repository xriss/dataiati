   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Provide life-saving food assistance for newly internally displaced people in northern Syria.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">After the escalation of hostilities in rural Idlib and  Aleppo in Syria that  caused large waves of displacement and according to  (CCCM) Cluster tracked 272,345 displacements arrived to the central and northern parts of Idleb governorate.
The project aims to support the food security of the newly internally displaced people in Idleb district (Idleb city, and Saraqab) through providing them with standard food baskets of 64.46 kg (which will cover 1700 Kcal per day for each individual) for three months to meet their basic food needs.
The project targets 3300 IDPs families (16500 individuals (2640 male, 3960 female, 4554 boys, and 5346 girls)) in two sub-districts
Idleb city 2700 food basket for 3 month (2160 male, 3240 female, 3726 boys, and 4374 girls)
Saraqab 600 food basket for 3 month (480 male, 720 female, 828 boys, and 972 girls)

As the primary objective of this reserve allocation is to provide life-saving needs to newly internally displaced people, so, targeted sub-districts was selected because they include large numbers of IDPs according to the last CCCM reports and according to the priority needs of the IDPs in our need assessment reports as we have IDPs tracking teams in the mentioned areas, therefore, we have full access to respond to IDPs in these areas.

Takaful alsham will procure food baskets from Syria in accordance with the procurement procedures stipulated in the procurement policy which is consistent with HF procurement procedures, the specifications and quality of food basket&apos;s items will be good and pre-identified, and then baskets will be transported to our warehouses located in the distribution areas. Food baskets will be stored in safe and suitable warehouses, where Takaful has 4 warehouses in Idleb, Takaful&apos;s warehouses were selected with enough and safe distance, and provided with required safety and security equipment.

Beneficiaries will be selected among the most valuable IDPs (male and female) according to special criteria which focus on their social and economic situation. MEAL team assure that selected beneficiaries meet the pre-specified criteria by visiting beneficiaries&apos;&apos; locations.

The distribution of food baskets will be conducted on monthly basis in agreed and pre-identified dates where every beneficiary knows in advance the date and place of distribution by providing them with coupon contains all related information (name, ID, family information, address, place and time of distribution) in addition to brochure describe the contests of food baskets.

The distribution will be conducted in specified food distribution points (FDPs), safe FDPs will be chosen, away from the military centers with enough and safe distance and beneficiaries have easy access to them, each FDP must contain required tools and services (safe entrance and exit, extinguisher, first aid kit, toilets for men and women, plastic sheet for shading, iron bars to organize waiting queue, chairs for elderly beneficiaries, water for drink, and box for complaints), these procedure respects the dignity of the beneficiaries.
For beneficiaries who have difficulties to reach to distribution points such as families headed by child or disabled persons, the baskets will be transferred to their location using light vehicle, the expected percentage of these beneficiaries is %10, so about 330 baskets will be delivered to beneficiaries&apos; locations.

 In addition, in each distribution point Takaful will paste posters included (each ration commodities with weights, and the evacuation mechanism during the emergency situation).

After finalizing the distribution, MEAL team will conduct post distribution monitoring (PDM) with sample of beneficiaries to measure the effectiveness, efficiency, and accountability to affected people.</narrative>
