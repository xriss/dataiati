   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Scaling-up GBV prevention and response in flood affected communities of Nasir County, Upper Nile State</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The primary trigger of the 2019 SSHF 2nd Reserve Allocation is the devastating impact of flooding across South Sudan and Nasir County in Upper Nile is among the worst affected Counties consider for scaling-up humanitarian response.
The project will target most vulnerable populations in flood affected communities to have increased access to life saving GBV response and prevention services and risks of GBV are reduced through improved community based GBV interventions. The main outputs are that 2,250 most vulnerable women and girls will have access to lifesaving, appropriate GBV case management, referrals, PSS services and other services such as MHPSS provided in four (4) WGFS&apos;s and about 2,700 community members in flood affected communities will be engaged in community-based GBV risk mitigation programming. After receiving Dignity Kits from UNFPA, around 500 vulnerable women and 400 adolescent girls would be reached through Dignity Kit programming

The project will fund the establishment of 4 WGFS in Nasir.  The project staff will identify a safe, accessible and confidential area in collaboration with women and girls to set up the WGFS which will be staffed with supervisors and GBV case workers where they can provide PSS, individual case management and information. Hold initial FGDs to provide information on services and general introduction and agree on activities, days and times for sessions with women and girls. Provide GBV case management and individual PSS, including care for child survivors. In recognition of the barriers of direct help-seeking among GBV survivors due to fear, stigma, and a lack of information, provide both basic and more tailored PSS at the safe spaces: Boys and men will be reached through group and individual psychosocial support. This will be done by having group and one on one sessions for men and boys, beneficiaries will include survivors of GBV, male families/relatives of survivors of GBV.

Basic PSS, skills-building activities and information sessions will be available to all women and girls. In addition, case workers will carry out age-appropriate group support sessions for vulnerable women and girls. These structured sessions are designed to be short-term, quick-impact interventions to build coping and resilience among women and girls and support social networks. Provide material support to individual survivors according to their needs (e.g., clothing, pads).
CHADO will develop and distribute IEC&apos;s materials with key GBV messages in line with community needs and concerns. Facilitate 12 community meetings to strengthen community based protection systems to enhance accountability and respond to GBV and conduct 3 safety audits to address safety needs and concerns for women and girls and to assess emerging risks. The safety audit reports will be used to advocate with other service providers to remove or mitigate identified risks. Based on the findings, CHADO will carry out community safety planning to respond to threats to the safety and security of women and girls. It will involve various groups, including adolescent girls, adult women and men, in identifying risks and putting in place simple measures to protect women and girls.
Focus Group Discussions will be conducted with community members to assess risks, protection concerns and other issues. CHADO will build key relationships with affected community structures and other service providers. To ensure no affected community is left out, 12 outreach missions will be conducted to disseminate information on available services in hard-to-reach flood affected communities. About 60 community leaders, community policy makers, church leaders, Government officers, law enforcement officers and traditional leaders will be train to enhance their understanding and knowledge on GBV protection policies, procedures and accountability.</narrative>
