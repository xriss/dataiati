   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Emergency livelihood support for (5800 HH= 34,800 individuals)severe food insecure population in Canal/Pigi County through provision of fast growing and nutritious vegetable seeds, fishing equipment and capacity building activities.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">6.94 million People in South Sudan are estimated to face crisis (IPC3) food insecurity or worse in May-July 2019 projection period (IPC Analysis, May 2019) with Canal/Pigi being one of the severely affected counties. This is associated with delayed main season rains that invariably will affect availability of fish, wild fruits and crops at the harvesting time and into the lean season the season is expected to get worse.
Canal/Pigi County has been affected by complex disasters ranging from internal and external displacements, droughts and destruction of livelihoods and means of survival for the inhabitants. 
To reverse the deteriorating food security situation and save lives of the pockets of population projected in IPC 5 (10,000 people) in the County, CAFAD proposes an emergency project to support 5800 Households (3596 women, 1,724 men, 199 girls and 281 boys) with fast maturing, nutritious and quality vegetable seeds and fishing equipment. This is expected to benefit 34,800 persons estimating that each of the target household has 6 household members.
The most at risk population are IDPs (50% of the target beneficiaries) and returnees (20%) who have not been integrated into the community and settled mainly in the rural areas of Diel, Kurwai, Kueryang and Kuemdhuol and other locations on the western side of the County along river Nile and its tributaries where they can access fish for consumption but they lack the requisite fishing hooks, nets and monofilaments. They also require capacity building on fish hygiene, preservation and marketing skills (CAFAD Diel Focus Group Discussion 10th December 2018). Households hosting IDPs will also be targeted with the intervention making up 30% of the total beneficiaries. 
CAFAD plans to distribute quality vegetable seeds and farming tools (maloda and sickle) to vulnerable women, girls, boys and men on time at the onset of the dry season and into the lean period. Each beneficiary is expected to receive a combination of vegetable kit (Okra, onion, watermelon, amaranthus, cabbage and carrot seeds), farming tools (maloda and sickle) and a fishing kit (Monofilament, box of hooks and a pair of twine for making fishing net)
CAFAD will liaise with UNFAO for the timely release of the above inputs and transport them (within three days upon notification as per FAO SOP in relation to release orders) from Juba warehouse to Bor for further shipment to the distribution points in Canal/Pigi by the logistic cluster via barge river transport.
For the purpose of project inception, CAFAD shall mobilize and sensitize the communities at County, Boma and payam level through their representatives women leaders, youth, payam administrators, commissioners and RRC to determine identification and beneficiary selection. Consultative meetings shall be carried out during inception, implementation and exit points of the project and reports submitted to relevant stakeholders. 
In collaboration with local authorities (RRC, payam administrators, boma heads) OCHA, FAO and other stakeholders CAFAD will identify and register the most vulnerable households in OCHA approved payams in Canal/Pigi County (Alam, Atar, Belewach, Kaldak, Korwach, Mareng, Nyanthokmalual and Wunlem) in a format to be agreed between CAFAD and the local authorities and submitted to FSL secretariat and FAO for approval. 
During distribution, CAFAD shall provide technical information and guidance to the beneficiaries on best use of agriculture and fishing kits being distributed. This will cover handling of inputs provided with support of visual aids and captions with instructions. Also good agronomic practices, seed production and preservation techniques, post-harvest processing and store management, family nutrition with special emphasis on food preparation, processing amp utilization will be covered in the trainings.</narrative>
