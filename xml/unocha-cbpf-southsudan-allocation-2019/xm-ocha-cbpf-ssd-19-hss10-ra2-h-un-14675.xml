   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Provision of Life-Saving Integrated Health Services to Floods Affected Populations in Uror, Nyirol, Canal/Pigi, Pibor, Mayom, Twic East, Nasir Counties in South Sudan.</narrative>

  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The aim of the project is to contribute to the reduction of excess morbidity and mortality caused by the common communicable diseases, vector-borne diseases and epidemic-prone diseases in the floods affected counties. This will be achieved through the provision of life-saving integrated health services, strengthening of the capacities of the health workers working in the flooded counties and strengthening of disease surveillance in these counties. Through its mobile medical teams, WHO will be offering integrated mobile health services in the floods affected counties of Uror, Nyirol, Canal/Pigi, Pibor, Mayom, Twic East, Nasir.  The mobile clinic will offer outpatient consultations for the common conditions, minor procedures, screening and treatment for malnutrition, EPI services, and referral services. WHO will also conduct a rapid assessment of the effects of floods, its magnitude and the needs of the affected community to guide response by the partners. This will be done through the deployment of national rapid response teams and WHO mobile medical teams. The rapid response teams will also conduct verification and investigation of suspected outbreaks among the affected communities.
In addition, WHO will enhance surveillance and reporting from the floods affected areas to enable the public health surveillance in the country to detect epidemic-prone diseases outbreaks and guide timely and appropriate response by the ministry and the partners. The routine surveillance system will be enhanced through the deployment of mobile phone-based EWARS reporting by the static and mobile clinics attending to the needs of the flooded areas. This will enhance weekly reporting by facilities to ensure early detection of and response to disease outbreaks.
WHO will also conduct a risk assessment for measles and cholera in the floods affected counties to guide on whether or not a preventive vaccination campaign will be required. WHO will guide the planning process of planned preventive vaccination campaigns, secure adequate vaccines and conduct preventive campaigns as guided by the risk assessment findings.  Currently risk assessment for Pibor county for possible Oral Cholera Vaccination is on going.
Through its network of experts, both within and outside the country WHO will conduct targeted and focused capacity building of health workers working in the health facilities serving the floods affected communities. 
The capacity building will be done on the running of mobile outreach programs, disease surveillance and outbreak response, case management, and infection prevention and control (IPC). WHO will also undertake water quality testing and surveillance to ensure the safety of the drinking water sources, and conduct training for health workers on measures on infection prevention and control within health facilities.
This project will be complemented by CERF funded project which will provide emergency health kits for the provision of mobile integrated health services. CERF project will also support other partners responding to floods affected counties with emergency health kits.</narrative>
