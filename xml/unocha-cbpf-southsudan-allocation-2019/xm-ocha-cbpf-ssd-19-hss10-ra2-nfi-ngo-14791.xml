   <narrative xml:lang="EN">ES/SNFI Humanitarian Support to Flood-affected Persons in Jonglei State</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project will primarily provide needed emergency shelter and essential non-food items to 56,000 flood-affected person in Jonglei in Pibor, Bor South, Twic East, Uror, Duk and Ayod. Though the response is primarily S/NFI, HDC will also be able to distribute WASH and FSL kits to promote integrated response as done already in Pibor.

It is not normal for humanitarians to respond to floods in South Sudan as they are seasonal but because of the unusual downpour since June 2019, it has resulted into devastating floods across several counties in the Upper Nile region as stated below
&#x2018;Seasonal flooding during the rainy season in South Sudan is a fact of life for many communities, and &#x201C;normal&#x201D; flooding is dealt with through coping mechanisms. However, the seasonal flooding experienced since June 2019 is much more significant than normal, and has become extremely dangerous to people who are already living in IPC phases 3 and 4. In the past few months, the torrential rains have worsened the living conditions of people in the affected counties and put people at greater risk of disease and suffering. The rains are more severe than have been seen in decades, and a failure to act quickly to support people in need would mean an erasure of gains made, leaving people more vulnerable in areas where needs are already severe.&#x2019; SSHF Strategic paper &#x2013; RA2 2019.

The response to address the identified needs will align with the cluster specific objectives and strategic objectives of HRP 2019 that promote timely and integrated multi-sector assistance to reduce acute needs. The close coordination and support from cluster coordinators and State Focal Points (SFPs) ensures that analyses of needs are multi-sector. HDC will use Community Focal Points (CFPs) and work closely with local leaders to promote active community participation and engagement throughout the project cycle. The use of experienced CCE / Protection Officer will ensure GBV and protection mainstreaming, evaluate through rapid monitoring and support field staff and CFPs in the implementation.

To promote integrated response as required by allocation strategy, HDC will be able to distribute WASH and FSL kits during the response. The items will include FSL fishing kit, WASH Aquatabs water purification tablets and water filtering clothes

HDC response team will compose of static and roving officers and all response will be sector integrated through joint missions.
The roving team will provide capacity support to the field team and up to date knowledge of the cluster response methodologies on floods.
The roving team who will be based in Juba will inform the S/NFI State Focal Points (SFPSs) or during national or state cluster meetings of HDC&#x2019;s planned responses.
The number of static project staff will also be boosted and also receive support from other project staff in the location. This will ensure that ongoing projects (e.g. current SSHF) are not stalled as they concentrate in responding to emergency floods.

In the field, the analysis process will include use of standard cluster tools to assess the needs and security environment for safe response.
-The recruitment and continuous use of CFPs and enumerators from the community in collaboration with existing community groups will ensure accountability to affected population and community participation and engagement is promoted. This also results in knowledge retention, sustainability of the project and building of positive coping mechanisms as negative ones are discouraged/discarded.
-FGDs, HH interviews and KIIs done to reach those in need.

-During response, verification and registration of the beneficiaries will be done through house-to-house visits for an almost accurate targeting.
-During distribution of S/NFIs, CFPs, community leaders, casuals from the community, CCE/protection staff and all stakeholders will be involved for a fare and dignified process.</narrative>
