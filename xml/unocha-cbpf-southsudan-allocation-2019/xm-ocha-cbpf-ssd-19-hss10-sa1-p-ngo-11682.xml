   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Strengthening local production and use of Fuel Efficient Stoves to prevent and mitigate vulnerabilities of women and girls at risk of GBV in Nasir County, Upper Nile State and Koch County, Unity State.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project will target a population of 4,200 (3,940 females) and dis-aggregating by gender (104 Men, 2,524 Women, 104 Boys, 1,416 Girls) of all age groups (5-17 years Children both girls and boys totaling 1,520), (18-59 years including the elderly men and women totaling 2,680) putting into consideration gender sensitivity, the groups includes IDPS, host communities and the returnees in Koch.
About 880 women and girls will be trained as ToT in the molding of FES and other aspects of energy saving strategy that will enable them provide similar trainings to other members of the community sustainably and about 260 men and boys will benefit through direct community education engagements including about 3,274 women and girls.CHADO is targeting 55 women and girls in each of the following 8 communities in Koch County, Unity State (Mirmir, Gany, Bang/Pachuol, Kuachlual, Koch town, Jaak, Rier and Baow) while in Nasir County, Upper Nile State, 55 ToT&apos;s will be trained in each of the following 8 communities (Burebiey, Jikmir, Mandeng, Makak, Kuerengke, Bentik, Nyatot and Torkech).
In this project CHADO intends to respond to lifesaving and resilience needs of the communities of Nasir and Koch by disseminating lifesaving information on available services provided by partners to survivors through referrals using established referral pathways. 
For vulnerable populations, including women and girls to benefit from an improved protective environment through community engagement, advocacy and GBV risk mitigation strategies and reviving or bringing back the age-long culture of pottery-like crafts which is the molding of fuel efficient stoves using clay and other local materials.  The activity has proven to bridge the age bracket between older women and younger ones especially the adolescents&#x2019; girls, it has led to behavior change and mentoring. The women and girls who are engaged in FES activities are less likely to experience GBV since the firewood collection patterns reduces significantly.
The FES programming has proven success in previous SA1 GBV Project where women and girls who used Fuel Efficiency stoves reported that the stoves were easy to mold and use and children were no longer at risk of burns, reduction in indoor smoke pollution. Generally, the communities involved in FES programming experienced reduced risks of attacks of women and girls fetching firewood, this usually leads to enhanced safety perception of the individuals encouraging harmony and peaceful co-existence
In addition CHADO will provide a structured community engagement (FGD&#x2019;s and community meetings) to train women and girls groups on the benefits of FES and other energy saving strategies in both Koch and Nasir. Community engagement activities will target 3,320 persons including 260 men and boys. This activity will boost communities&#x2019; participation in FES programming. 
With the allocated resources CHADO will develop IEC materials with key GBV prevention and risk mitigation messages in line with FES programming to an estimation of the whole community including IDPs, Host Communities and returnees. 
CHADO will facilitate training workshop for 240 (140 women) community resource persons on FES programming including partners on how they can integrate FES strategy into their own programming including health, Livelihood, Nutrition and Education. This also doubles as a major community entry activity and AAP strategy.
Finally CHADO will conduct 16 FES awareness raising sessions including GBV prevention and risk mitigation campaigns. The campaign raising sessions is aimed at bringing about community buy-in and taking responsibility to ensure that GBV is recognized as a major challenge and that no one has to suffer from it.</narrative>
