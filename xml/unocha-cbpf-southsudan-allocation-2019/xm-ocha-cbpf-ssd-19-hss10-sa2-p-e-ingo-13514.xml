   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This multi-cluster project seeks to strengthen the Housing, Land and Property rights of the displaced affected communities including internally displaced person, returnees and vulnerable community in Jonglei state through preventative and remedial mechanisms and to provide Emergency School Feeding for children in schools in hard to reach areas of Duk through multi-sectoral emergency interventions to increase students&#x2019; attendance and nutrition, encourage girls retention, to support local markets where possible, and to provide female and youth income-generation and spread lifesaving nutrition and hygiene practices. 

Insecurity of land tenure and limited access to agricultural land are some of the major obstacles to the provision of sustainable solutions for vulnerable displaced populations across South Sudan. The project will prioritise land tenure security and facilitate the development and acquisition of legal land tenure documentation for enhanced shelter and livelihoods initiatives. Capacity building for humanitarian and local actors on HLP rights will be done to ensure that this is mainstreamed within the interventions of other stakeholders. Trainings and advocacy on HLP will also help to ensure rights holders, duty bearers and decision makers are empowered to claim, promote and exercise HLP rights and subsequently address HLP violations such as land grabbing, multiple land claims, forced evictions among others. Prevention of HLP rights violations will be approached using community structures in dispute settlement, advocacy and through information, counseling and legal assistance. The project will assist displaced persons attain durable solutions through the prevention of further displacement by supporting them to overcome legal obstacles related to accessing and controlling housing, land and property rights. The project will strengthen dispute resolution for community structures through collaborative Dispute Resolution (CDR) trainings to ensure alternative dispute resolution mechanisms are used to resolve HLP specific cases in the first instance and litigation as a last resort. To further enhance collaboration and multisector responses to forced evictions, the project will work closely with the protection and shelter cluster and other humanitarian actors. As the community-based protection systems are often male dominated and often discriminate against women, NRC will prioritize female beneficiaries during information sessions and legal assistance considering their vulnerability levels. 

The proposed school feeding intervention will assure children&#x2019;s continued access to food while continuing their learning and creating a positive pull factor which keeps boys away from fighting and enhances girls&#x2019; protection. This project will also contribute to monitoring children&#x2019;s nutritional intake, guaranteeing that food intended for them is indeed consumed by them. Additionally, the proposed mechanism will create income generation for School Mothers/Grandmothers who will also be a positive female presence in school in addition to training teachers/PTA to spread lifesaving skills related to nutrition and hygiene practices. The action also includes a small youth component to encourage positive community engagement while creating income, to fill needed roles in the school feeding mechanism and to provide skills for youth. Essential life-saving messaging on hygiene, nutrition and protection will also be disseminated by the action. For the proposed project, male and female IDP, returnees and host community children, aged 6-18 in school communities in affected IPC 4/5 areas will be primarily targeted as those in need of nutritious school feeding. Teachers, PTAs members school mothers/grandmothers and youth food monitors from the community will be reached directly with training. Procurement of food will be done at Juba level, however, local bidders from Jonglei will be encourage to apply to minimize transport cost to Duk.</narrative>
