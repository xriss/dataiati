   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Provision of Integrated emergency and life-saving nutrition services to under 5 children, pregnant and lactating women and girls and other vulnerable groups in insecure and hard to reach communities in Leer, Pigi, Fangak and Nassir counties of South Sudan</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Pigi, Fangak, Leer and Nassir counties are shown to have some populations likely to tip into phase 5 of IPC classification between January and March 2019. The locations are known hot spots for violence and as a result experience fairly fragile health architecture which translates into protracted morbidity. The immediate or primary causes of malnutrition as elaborated in the UNICEF conceptual framework for malnutrition truly manifest. Since there is a vicious cycle of malnutrition in these locations, the project will seek to offer the Minimum package as prescribed by the Nutrition cluster in South Sudan with strong linkages and integration to address access to healthcare, safe drinking water, livelihood support and to also ensure that eminent challenges such as protection issues are equally addressed in a coordinated manner with professional care providers. Nile Hope will seek to provide services that meet the CERF criteria namely SAM treatment, MAM treatment, MIYCN interventions and community mobilization to support and strengthen uptake of the three services. Through the community mobilization aspect, the organization will seek to improve accountability to affected population (AAP) by ensuring there is active participation from the community and ownership. The community participation with continuous active case finding and referral, behavior change communication and continuous capacity building and advocacy for activities that enhance community resilience. Standard surveillance package including setting up a project steering community to support with project monitoring and support will be put in place. The recruited personnel for this project will be trained on the revised CMAM guidelines, MIYCN, Community mobilization strategy and basic monitoring and evaluation paying attention to data collection, reporting and supply chain management
Nile Hope already runs nutrition services in these locations and will focus on accelerating efforts meant to mitigate the triggers that lead to deteriorated nutrition status. To mitigate against WASH triggers, all facilities will have toilets, hand washing facilities and the nutrition team will work closely with the hygiene promoters to ensure that hygiene messaging pervades the whole catchment area and water cleaning tablets as well as other WASH kits and soap are given to households.  There will be protection mainstreaming and referral linkages between nutrition and food security and livelihood programs. The program will also have a strong linkage between the health program and nutrition by ensuring that PHCUs and PHCCs are in agreement to screen children and PLWs visiting them for malnutrition and making the necessary referrals. Beneficiaries in the nutrition program requiring health interventions such as immunization, supplementation or treatment of other prevailing ailments will be referred appropriately to the health facilities too. Nile Hope will rely on the core pipeline support as well as the support from the Logs cluster to acquire and deliver the critical supplies required for service delivery. The FLA with WFP and PCA with UNICEF for the project locations are in place. In the selected locations, WFP also supports CNVs who will assist with the community mobilization component.</narrative>
