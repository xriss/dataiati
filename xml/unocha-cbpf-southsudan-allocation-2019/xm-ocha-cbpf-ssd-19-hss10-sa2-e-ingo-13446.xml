   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Increase access to inclusive education, improved learning quality and strengthening community capacity to support learning outcomes of children affected by emergencies through provision of WASH infrastructure, awareness and trainings to prevent water borne diseases, EVD and psychosocial trainings in schools in Kajokeji and Koch Counties, South Sudan</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project aims to meet the immediate, medium and long-term educational needs of the target communities in Kajokeji and Koch counties. PAH will select 12 schools in Kajokeji and 8 in Koch for its activities totaling to 20 schools. PAH will target schools that no partner is supporting with WASH with limited WASH infrastructure. In Kajokeji PAH will target Andejo, Keriwa, Logo, Morsak, Liwolo, Ajio 1, Mangalatore, Comboni, Andasire, Go&apos;do, Bori and Lobule primary schools. In Koch PAH will target Kuachlual, Koch Girls, Bieh, Lablabni, Mirmir, Rier, Guol and Ngony primary schools.
PAH will target schools for WASH in schools that are already supported by other donors (such as UNICEF) for teachers&#x2019; incentives, textbooks, teaching and learning supplies and schools with large WASH needs to reduce the risks of child labor and early marriage, to reduce the level of waterborne diseases, and increase school&#x2019;s attendance. In Koch PAH will operate from World Relief compound as PAH had similar WASH activities in Koch in 2017 . In Kajokeji PAH will operate from Kajokeji town as it has previously conducted WASH activities as well as a Shelter / Non-food Items Cash Based intervention project in Korijo camp. Where not possible in the field, PAH will share office and accommodation with other partners.
Holistic package of messaging on disease prevention, sanitation and hygiene, training of teachers and communities on nutrition related to health and psychosocial support trainings will be conducted. 
Addressing WASH needs will improve enrollment and continuity of learners in school as lack of basic essential services such as water, sanitation and poor hygiene can lead to diseases outbreak that pose threat to the children. PAH will mainly do this by:
a) Rehabilitation/installation of hand washing facilities: The hand washing facilities will be established or the existing ones repaired to support hand washing at critical times in the schools.
b) Rehabilitation/Establishment of latrines: focus on sanitation in school/learning spaces with aim of cholera prevention, preparedness and response through provision of emergency latrine where no school latrines is available. Gender disaggregated sanitation facilities will be improved in 20 schools through both construction and rehabilitation of existing latrines. Health clubs will promote good hygiene among the learners to keep them safe from water borne diseases.
c) Provision of soap and Calcium Hypochlorite (HTH) used for disinfection of contaminated boreholes and in case of cholera and Ebola outbreak, used for disinfection and hand washing
d) Training of school-based community groups (Parents Teacher Associations (PTAs), School Management Committees (SMCs), teachers and adolescents/youth) to undertake chlorination, hygiene messaging on cholera symptoms, modes of transmission and prevention, referral to treatment/health facility. School health clubs (SHCs) will be setup and trained led by students with the facilitation of teachers in schools. The communities, PTAs, school authorities, teachers and adolescents/youths will be targeted with trainings on cholera prevention, preparedness and response cholera referrals and reporting of suspected cholera cases in these areas. Ebola prevention, symptoms will also be among the messaging  especially in Kajokeji county
e)Establishment/repair of non-functional water points nearby schools and construction of rain water harvesting systems to ensure that the schools/learning spaces have access to safe water for drinking and personal hygiene and ensure that there is water for the hand washing facilities to be used
f) Provide psychosocial support through trainings targeting specifically teachers, school&#x2019;s authorities, parent-teacher association members, local administration. Protection information sessions will be held at schools and community levels, in relation to Education, child&#x2019;s rights and protection risks on community and school level.</narrative>
