   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project aims to provide Survival Kits /Emergency shelter/ NFIs both in-kind and in Cash modalities to the most vulnerable people specifically the unexpectedly new displaced, newly returnees, and some host communities. This is a proposed 6 months project starting from 1st March 2019 focusing on the distribution of SK/Shelter/NFI kits using rapid response mechanism (mobile Teams) to reach out 9100 beneficiaries in Unity state. The proposed counties within the selected state are Panyijiar, Mayendit, and Rubkona. The project will promote timely delivery of assistance through deployment of mobile teams in line with humanitarian priorities for 2019 as outlined in the HRP as well as the nature of the emergency in South Sudan. NRC&#x2019;s mobile response teams will be ready for deployment within 8 days to conduct assessments and within 14 days for full-fledged delivery of NFIs and emergency shelters either in-kind or Cash depending on the location.
The project team will work in close coordination with S/NFI cluster and its activities will be informed by the gaps identified through the assessment missions in which NRC will participate and/or carry out alone depending on the situation between Mar 2019 and Aug 2019. 
NRC was involved in AAP since 2018 through the Shelter cluster, where trainings on AAP, Communication and Community Engagement was conducted in Ibba county, in Dec, 2018. Currently NRC is one of two focal points for AAP in Shelter cluster, and is involved in Communication and Community Engagement working group. Lately NRC delivered a presentation on AAP in the Shelter cluster meeting for all partners to introduce them more on what have been done and the way forward. Building on this, NRC will be conducting AAP as first step before the assessment or the intervention phase, and will ensure the diversity during training, to make sure that the community and the local authority are fully aware with all details, including their roles and responsibilities. The project team will work on raising the community and local authority&#x2019;s engagements and it will empower them to cope with the faced challenges. Using the AAP approach, NRC will adapt the project to the specific needs of men, women, girls and boys and respond accordingly or refer to relevant service providers in case the needs cannot be covered by the response. NRC use its check list of protection mainstreaming to complement the multi sector assessment. The distribution of life-saving Shelter and NFI kits or Cash, will be done in distribution sites which will be identified together with the community and will put into consideration the minimum standards of protection. Since NRC is also working in WASH, Food security and education sectors therefore a synergy will be sought when responding to the shelter/NFI needs.
The project team will ensure that women and girls are not exposed to risk of sex and gender based violence (SGBV) at the distribution points and within short walking distances from the beneficiaries&#x2019; homes. In case drinking water is not available in nearby locations, water will be provided by the NRC team at the distribution sites. Elderly, physically incapable, pregnant women and others who require special attention will be prioritized during distribution so that they are served early and comfortably. Feedback desk will be provided at each distribution site so that beneficiaries register their complaints with NRC on the entire project process and quality of the supplies/Kits. NRC will complement its distribution by community awareness campaign and information sessions. NRC will conduct post distribution Monitoring (PDM) in at least at 50% in locations of distribution. NRC will also do market assessment for all the locations in order to check the market capability to satisfy people&#x2019;s basic needs. Market assessment shall focus on the items and their alternative availability, and unit prices for each item. Based on the result, the distribution amount will be determined.</narrative>
