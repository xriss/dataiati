   <narrative xml:lang="EN">(MA) Community-based Risk Education as a preventive intervention to host community, returnees, and IDPs in Pibor and Duk Counties, Jonglei State.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">It&apos;s estimated that approximately 150 previously unknown hazardous areas are discovered each month which, compounded by the legacy of current contamination in Pibor, and Duk Counties  (927,628 sqm), endangers the lives of girls, boys, women and men (IMSMA, Jan - June 2019). The population census records 65,588 people in Duk,  and 148, 475 in Pibor in 2008. This totals to 214,063 people who are exposed to death or injuries by mines/ERW in an area of 40,184 (Duk,6,911, Pibor 33,273) SqKm. IMSMA reports shows that a total of 58 (16 killed, 42 injured) people were affected by mine/ERWs related activities in both counties. For this reason, CINA&#x2019;s RE project will target host communities, IDPs and returnees. RE activities seeks to reduce the risk of injury from mines and ERW by raising  awareness and promoting behavioral change, including public information dissemination, education and training at community level. It will be the role of Risk Educators to move from community to community, schools, churches etc sensitizing and raising the awareness on safety and prevention messages about the mines/ERW. Sad to note, the conflicts which have been experienced by the people of South Sudan have made civilians to loose life, fight one another, and commit many atrocities. The decades of conflict have seen the land of South Sudan with explosive hazards and many SqKm of land have been unsafe for settlement, cultivation and/or movement. CINA RE project will employ preventive measures to deal with injuries which come as lack of knowledge especially to the returnees and IDPs who may not be well conversant with the local marking signs. The purpose of this project is to help the host communities, IDPs and returnee living in Pibor and Duk Counties to be safe and live without threats associated with mines/ERWs. The project will benefit 40,000 at risk people (6,400 women, 9,600 men, 9,600 girls, 14,400 boys) including the elderly, IDPs, returnees, host community who have a lot of potential in socio-economic activities which can be of benefit to the societal economic building. This is out of the 214, 063 population in both counties. This project will ensure safety of all beneficiaries and encourage them to provide feedback on the relevant of RE materials, messages and other concerns about RE activities as means of AAP and coordinate with MA SC all RE activities. CINA will deploy MRE team in both Duk and Pibor Counties. From experience, this approach is more sustainable because CINA normally strives to work with local structures as much as possible. For Duk County, the MRE teams who were already engaged in implementing the UNICEF RE activities will be reinstated to continue with the RE. The MRE team will also be having static presence. There will be CP activities for 6 months in this allocation too, therefore the RE team being on standby will just be officially notified to report on duty on Sept 10. For Pibor, it is to be noted that CINA will also be implementing General Protection (GP) activities with the SSHF SA2 2019. Therefore, having static presence will be of a competitive advantage as the teams work together. By the time that GP project shall have completed its phase of 6 months activities, they will be equipped with teambuilding skills ready to continue until the project life cycle of 9 months.Due to the location dynamics of Pibor, CINA will have the program team visit the location quarterly to offer technical support, advice and training before returning to their duty location. The education background of the population also calls for recruiting locally so that the teams can explain in-depth RE messages to the beneficiaries who may not be well versed in English versions. More coordination will be done with the other humanitarian actors so that the RE information sharing reach more people. Recruitment will be initiated in the last week of August 2019.</narrative>
