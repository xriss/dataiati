  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project will provide lifesaving GBV services and prevention of GBV in Koch and Uror counties of Unity and Jonglei states targeting 9,982 (4,139 W, 3,103 G, 1,141 M, 1,599 B). Pregnant and Lactating women, girls will be reached with GBV messaging in the WGFS, food distribution sites and at health facilities including men and boys during community special days in addition to the community mobilisation. CARE seeks to implement GBV prevention, response and risk mitigation activities by providing quality and timely age appropriate case management and psychosocial support to GBV survivors. The CARE will work to mitigate and respond to the needs of women, girls, men and boys affected by conflict through frequent joint community-based safety audit assessments, address risks identified, and strengthen community based support mechanisms, create safe and meaningful access to relevant services, and advocate with other humanitarian actors on GBV mainstreaming  This project is designed to improve responses to cases of GBV, enhance the ability of survivors to timely access available services and heal/recover from GBV. CARE will work in collaboration with local partners women groups and key stakeholders and will renovate / establish and operationalize 4 women and girls&#x2019; safe spaces (WGFS) and provide periodic individual and group psycho social support for women and girls. This will include dialogue sessions, psychosocial support through group counselling sessions, skills building, alternative fuel strategies through production of fuel e&#xFB03;cient stoves, The FES training in Uror sought to reduce the risk associated with frequent movement to firewood collection sites, which exposed women and girls in various GBV and protection incidents including but not limited to killing and sexual assault. The improved stoves help the users to have firewood saving of 50- 60 percent when compared to the traditional open three stone stoves. The stoves are built using local material such as clay, anthill soil and sand for the body construction, the WGFS also facilitate the production of reusable sanitary pads using locally available materials, information sessions on pertinent issues to women girls on access to available services, sexual and reproductive health issues on safe deliveries, family planning and post abortion care, personal hygiene, menstrual hygiene management, decision making and peer to peer support. CARE will utilize 3 existing women and girls&#x2019; friendly spaces in Koch and establish 1 new WGFS in Uror for the provision of psychosocial support services, skills building activities, recreational and life skills activities for adolescent girls, group information sessions, and provision of social cohesion and support networks for women and girls. Within the women and girls&#x2019; safe spaces, specialized, age-appropriate, group-based support will be made available to women and girls who fear to come forward to access available GBV services This project will also support the healing process of GBV survivors by providing community based case management and psychosocial support services and engage men and boys in community dialogues and awareness raising sessions on GBV, its effect and consequences and their roles in prevention. CARE staff will be trained on GBV guiding principles, referral pathway and the GBV IASC guidelines. Further, community outreach on GBV and available GBV services will be done to promote uptake of services. Close collaboration with local service providers like DRC, UNIDOR, IRC etc. will be promoted to protect women and mitigate issues affecting them. This project will offer an opportunity to provide the much needed humanitarian services in Koch and Uror where the community are in high need of Gender Based Violence services. CARE will encourage health-seeking behaviours among GBV survivors, facilitating referrals, and creating supportive structures to prevent GBV.</narrative>
