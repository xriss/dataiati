   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Enhance access to life-saving non-food items and safe, appropriate emergency shelter to returnees, IDPs and vulnerable host communities through resilience and positive coping mechanisms strengthening in South Sudan.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Polish Humanitarian Action (PAH) will provide life-saving emergency shelter materials and life-sustaining non-food items to the most vulnerable populations, focusing on internally displaced persons (IDPs) and returnees, in Uror, Nyirol, Duk, Panyijar, Mayendit, Koch, Leer, Kajo-keji, Fangak, West and Yei counties and other priority locations in South Sudan, through mobile response modality lasting up to three months which will contribute to the reduction of protection risks, livelihood building and reduce exposure to diseases attributed with poor shelter conditions and lack of non-food items. 
The Project will support the existing coping mechanisms of the local community and will build resilience towards other shocks, that have indirect effect (such as the worsening economic situation) through a component of a cash-based intervention in Bor South County where PAH currently implements WASH projects.

Both modalities will be supported with resilience building skills trainings, including trainings on sleeping mat weaving, producing fuel-efficient stoves, and making briquettes to limit environmental degradation from charcoal overuse and also reduce protection risks to women and girls due to regular collection of firewood. Environmental awareness campaigns will also be done. Wherever feasible, beneficiaries enrolled in the trainings will be linked with the vendors to enhance their livelihood opportunities and strengthen local markets, saving costs of transportation and storage.

PAH will conduct in-depth need assessment with the involvement of protection staff and the participation of the target populations through consultative community meetings, key informant interviews, focus group discussions with men, women, boys and girls, household level and individual interviews, and direct observations conducted by the assessment teams at household level and at markets putting strong efforts on quality market assessment and price monitoring in locations where CBI will be feasible. 
Static project in Bor South will include detailed multisector needs assessment to identify the needs, affected gender, age and diversity groups, the vulnerabilities of the targeted community and coping strategies employed by the affected population. The project design aims to integrate with other sectors for holistic response, including Education, with WASH component. The activities will be planned and implemented jointly with Nutrition, FSL, Health, Education, and S/NFI actors working in Bor South County. PAH will target 15,000 beneficiaries (6750 IDPs and 8250 returnees) focusing on female headed households, unaccompanied elderly, people with no links to the community, separated children, women at risk (pregnant and lactating mothers), child-headed households, people living with disability and returnees whose properties were damaged and looted during the conflict.

PAH teams will comprise of experienced ES/NFI officers and protection personnel (50 percent women and 50 percent men). One protection officer will participate in 70 percent of interventions with close coordination and collaboration with the Protection Cluster. The team will implement the interventions jointly with other partners&#x2019; especially local partners on ground, more specifically ES/NFI, WASH, FSL and Protection actors and in close coordination with the respective clusters. State Focal Points (SFPs) and cluster coordinators will be involved in the planning, coordination and reporting of the interventions.

Post-distribution monitoring (PDM) exercise will be conducted 1 month after the intervention (where possible) by the MampE team to measure the impact of the projects and to determine if the assistance reached the most vulnerable groups. During and after the intervention, a complaint mechanism will be in place. Detailed monitoring of CBI activities in Bor South County will also be done and reports shared with the Cluster partners and CWG.</narrative>
