   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Responding to emergency shelter and NFIs needs of severely conflict affected populations in Central Equatoria State</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project will respond to the need of the most vulnerable 6,250 individuals in Yei County, targeting with mobile response IDPs (70%), returnees (20%), and host population (10%), focusing on people with protection concerns and acute needs (newly displaced and vulnerable populations in secondary displacement). The most vulnerable HHs - PLW, elderly and disabled persons, women and child headed households- will be targeted by cash and in-kind assistance. The project will contribute to reducing vulnerability and acute shelter and basic NFI needs among the most vulnerable women, men, girls and boys (SO1) and protect vulnerable women, men, girls and boys through provision of specialized and integrated services (SO2) through distribution of essential emergency shelter material (1,380 individuals, 230 HHs) and basic NFIs (2,680 individuals, 446 HHs), and replacement of S/NFI which have outlived its life span, and repairing/reconstruction of temporary shelters (1,250 individuals, 208 HHs). During the distribution, LCED will involve GBV and health partners operating in Yei, in order to deliver protection and health messages to the population, including but not limited to sensitization on GBV, HIV/AIDs and vector-borne diseases (malaria, Ebola). Multi-sectorial survival kits will be included in the distribution in the event of the worst case situation, focusing on populations with the most acute need, which have high protection concerns, lack community ties and/or have not received humanitarian assistance in a long time.
Concerning shelter construction/reconstruction and distribution of shelter material, in some remote areas shelter framing material is available but not accessible to the beneficiaries (women, elderly), who experience protection concerns on the road, including harassment and looting, and it is not possible to implement a CBI due to lack of functioning markets. In such areas LCED will procure shelter framing material locally for estimated 10% of the total shelter response, keeping it to a minimum according to the S/NFI cluster strategy which emphasizes the use of the pipeline supplies. Local material is preferred to pipeline items due to higher quality and lower cost of local supplies and transportation, and the possibility of revitalizing the local market. 
LCED will also contribute to support at-risk communities to promote and sustain their resilience to acute shocks and chronic stresses (SO3) through cash assistance. CBIs will be implemented in areas where the people in need have access to a functional market but lack purchasing power, targeting 15% of the beneficiaries with restricted, unconditional cash vouchers for the purchase of emergency shelter material (312 individuals, 52 HHs) and NFI (628 individuals, 104 HHs). Market and needs assessments will be conducted in order to determine the best areas where to implement this. After defining the ES/NFI package for the targeted beneficiaries, according to their needs, LCED will engage vendors identified in the targeted locations during the market assessment, in order to set the price of the items, according to actual prices in the market.
LCED will strengthen the collaboration with the S/NFI SFP in CES in order to improve humanitarian coordination and avoid duplication in Yei County, also enforcing the collaboration with other cluster partners. In fact, as a former member of the SAG, LCED is well positioned to lead humanitarian interventions applying the cluster methodology. Additionally, LCED is in contact with the GBV CS and UN OCHA sub-country office in Yei, with whom it will collaborate to ensure humanitarian coordination and follow referral pathways. LCED will continue incorporating protection in its activities, involving protection partners in the field, through incorporation of risk mitigation measures, and referrals. The organization will also participate in multi-cluster needs assessments and refer needs/gaps to the ICWG for cluster mobilization.</narrative>
