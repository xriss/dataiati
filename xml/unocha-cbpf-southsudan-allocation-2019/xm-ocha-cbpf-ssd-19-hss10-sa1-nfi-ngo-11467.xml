   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Providing Emergency Life-saving ES/NFIs for Conflict Affected
Vulnerable populations in Kajo-Keji,  and Yei, in  South Sudan</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project aims at providing life-saving NFI and emergency shelter items to the most vulnerable newly displaced IDPs, refugees, returnees and host communities in Kajo Keji, and Yei areas of Central Equatoria state. The populations living in these areas have experienced displacements due to the clashes by armed groups operating in target locations. For example, the recent fighting incident that happened between September and October 2018 in Yei spilled over into Kajo Keji causing a huge displacement of the local population into Korijo IDP settlement in Liwolo County west of Kajo Keji. On the other hand, the crises from Mukaya, and some parts of Yei and Sokare in Liwolo payam forced the local population to take refuge in Korijo IDP settlement as well. With this huge wave of displacement, Korijo settlement has become one of the biggest IDP settlements in Kajo Keji. The fact that Kajo-Keji and Yei are closer to Uganda and Congo Border has led to increased spontaneous inflow of returnees and refugees into Kajo Keji through Moyo, Mijale and Yei. Due to war, farming activities and the markets got disrupted while the roads remained insecure hindering transportation of essential food and non food supplies to Yei and Kajo-Keji. As a result, the 2018 September &#x2013; October IPC release, classified Kajo Keji as IPC4 while Yei was classified as being between IPC3 and IPC4 -which depicts emergency and high need for an intervention in various sectors including NFIs/ES. Despite the recent Peace Agreement signed in Khartoum, large areas of Kajo-Keji and Yei continue to remain in conflict state. The needs of the population are likely to escalate in contested areas in the coming months while those areas experiencing relative peace will continue to receive returnees and refugees from Congo and Uganda. Due to increasing NFI/ES needs-collaborated by Titi&#x2019;s Foundation assessments, IOM&#x2019;s DTM, REACH SURVEYS and IRNA conducted in Yei on 18/10/2018. According to the IRNA assessment, Korijo settlement in Liwolo in Kajo Keji is hosting a population of 40,294 newly displaced IDPs who are in need of non-food and emergency shelter assistance. The Displacements when coupled with inflow of Refugees and Returnees from Uganda and Congo into Yei and Kajo-Keji has led to increased NFIs/ES needs. In light of this, there is urgent need to preposition NFIs supplies that can be distributed to these in need populations. Titi foundation as one of the NFIs/ES partners has demonstrated the ability and competence to deliver NFIs/ES assistance to the most vulnerable populations in these hard to reach areas. In its recent intervention in 2018, Titi Foundation distributed non-food and emergency shelter materials to 766 households in Kajo Keji. The foundation has significant presence both in Yei and Kajo-Keji .Titi Foundation has functional offices in the two locations and has also established very good grass-root relationship with the local population and authorities. In addition, Titi has got an existing agreement with URA (Uganda revenue authority) to use Uganda routes to use Uganda Territories to deliver humanitarian services to these border areas like Kajo Keji and Yei, therefore solving problems related to access. Through SSHF funding, Titi foundation in its planned intervention will distribute in-kind live-saving Non-food and emergency shelter items (blankets, plastic sheet mosquito nets, kitchen sets, and sleeping mats) to beneficiaries in order to improve their living conditions .The supplies are critical in ensuring that the beneficiaries are protected from harsh weather conditions and other protection related risks. The project will target 6,667 beneficiaries (1,334 HHS) with distribution of life-saving NFIs/ES kits that will be provided through the cluster common pipeline. The project will seek to engage target communities as well as empower them during the entire lifespan of the project to build their resilience and capacity to absorb shocks.</narrative>
