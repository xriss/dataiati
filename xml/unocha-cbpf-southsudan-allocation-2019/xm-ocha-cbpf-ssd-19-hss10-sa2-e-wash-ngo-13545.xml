The project will be linked to complement each other with particular focus on provision of MHM kits among women and girls. PCO will create synergies with Health, Nutrition, FSL and Protection among others. The centrality of gender-sensitive and protection in all programming, which includes actions on prevention of sexual exploitation and abuse, mitigating GBV against women and girls will be a key pillar of all planned actions

Wau municipality which is a government controlled area, PCO is the only partner implementing food for education (FFE) programme supported by WFP reaching 27 schools since 2018. However, in greater Baggari which includes Bagarri, Bazia, Ngiza, Baselia and Ngodakala which is an IO controlled area, there is no WFP supported school and so this project will focus in this area. 
In Raja County, PCO has been supporting schools with scholastic materials. Currently, there are 19 functional schools with 5 schools being supported with WFPs FFE through HARD and AFOD respectively however, PCO proposes to support 4 schools in Diem Zubeir and Boro Payams which are not reached with WFPs FFE support but are supported by HARD and AFOD with teacher&#x2019;s incentives. 
PCO will mainstream Cross cutting issues such as environmental conservation, gender equality and women empowerment, acknowledging the different roles of girls, women, men and boys and how they are differently affected by conflict mainstream protection, Accountability to Affected Populations through our robust community dialogues, beneficiary empowerment, communication mechanisms, active participation, rightful and unalienable entailment. In addition, the centrality of gender-sensitive and protection in all programming, which includes actions on prevention of sexual exploitation and abuse, mitigating GBV against women and girls.</narrative>
