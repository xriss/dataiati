   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project aims to provide Survival Kits /Emergency shelter/ NFIs in in-kind modality to the most vulnerable people specifically, the unexpectedly newly displaced, newly returnees, and the most vulnerable host communities. The project will focus on the distribution of SK/Shelter/NFI kits using rapid response mechanism (mobile teams) to reach a total of 10,000 beneficiaries in Central Equatoria and Northern Bahar El Ghazal states. The proposed counties within the selected states are Kajo Keji, Aweil East, and Aweil South. The project will promote timely delivery of assistance through deployment of mobile teams in line with humanitarian priorities for 2019 as outlined in the HRP as well as the nature of the emergency in South Sudan. NRC&#x2019;s mobile response teams will be ready for deployment within 8 days to conduct assessments and within 14 days for full-fledged delivery of NFIs and emergency shelters.
The project team will work in close coordination with S/NFI cluster, cluster focal points, and its activities will be informed by the gaps identified through the assessment missions in which NRC will participate and/or carry out alone depending on the situation between Sep 2019 and Mar 2020. 
NRC was involved in AAP since 2018 through the Shelter cluster, where trainings on AAP, Communication and Community Engagement was conducted in many locations where NRC have intervened. NRC will be conducting AAP as first step before the assessment or the intervention phase, and will ensure the diversity during training, to make sure that the community and the local authority are fully aware with all details, including their roles and responsibilities. The project team will work on raising the community and local authority&#x2019;s engagements and it will empower them to cope with the faced challenges. Using AAP approach, NRC will adapt the project to the specific needs of men, women, girls and boys and respond accordingly or refer to relevant service providers in case the needs cannot be covered by the response. NRC use its check list of protection mainstreaming to complement the multi sector assessment. Distribution of life-saving Shelter and NFI kits, will be done in distribution sites which will be identified jointly with the community and will put into considerations the minimum standards of protection and shelter due diligence guidelines. Proposed project interventions will complement NRC&#x2019;s ICLA project activities addressing HLP specific needs of IDPs, returnees and vulnerable host community in Kajo Keji and in Aweil East and South.

The project team will ensure that women and girls are not exposed to risk of sex and gender based violence (SGBV) at the distribution points and to have the distribution site within short walking distances from the beneficiaries&#x2019; homes. In case drinking water is not available in nearby locations, water will be provided by NRC team at the distribution sites. Elderly, physically incapable, pregnant women and others who require special attention will be prioritized during distribution so that they are served early and comfortably. NRC will complement its distribution by conducting awareness training on HLP rights and Collaborative Dispute Resolution (CDR) during community capacity building, ensuring alternative dispute resolution mechanisms are used to resolve HLP specific cases.  Feedback desk will be provided at each distribution site so that beneficiaries register their complaints with NRC on the entire project process and quality of the supplies/Kits.  NRC will conduct post distribution Monitoring (PDM) in at least at 50% in locations of distribution.</narrative>
