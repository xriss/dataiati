   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Enhancing the provision of  critical  life saving assistance and child protection services to 10 ,600 conflict affected  boys and girls, in Mayendit and Panyinjiar Counties</narrative>

  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Unity State is one of the most affected States by the current crisis in South Sudan, that has resulted in people being forcibly displaced from their homes, majority, who are now living in UNMISS Protection of Civilians Sites (POC) or moved to other safer places, where they are housed by host communities as IDPs.  The conflict has led to breakdown in social structures, schools closed down, a few opened but the attendance of pupils is too low associated with insecurity.  Lack of salary to teachers has affected the education system as teachers have resorted to other means of survival. Children have become vulnerable to various types of violence, abuse, exploitation and neglect and are also at risk of injuries, disability, physical and sexual violence as well as psychosocial and mental disorders, even losing their lives. Southern Unity State is only accessed by air during rainy session and the present situation has worsened the transport as movement by road is more prone to attacks. This has led to few basic commodities available on the market being very expensive 
In responding to the above mentioned needs, UNIDOR is proposing to provide critical lifesaving child protection services to conflict affected boys and girls in Mayendit and Panyinjiar Counties. The proposed six months&#x2019; emergency intervention is designed to:
i)	Increase boys, girls and women access to lifesaving comprehensive case management, family tracing and reunification (FTR) and psycho-social support (PSS) services and child protection services to reduce risks of protection. 
ii)	Integrate child protection monitoring and mainstreaming into the protection intervention to improve the overall context analysis and integration of child protection principles in the intervention that will be scaled up to respond to the identified needs.
iii)	Enhance understanding and analysis among humanitarian actors on the child protection context and needs. 
UNIDOR will utilize existing internal emergency response capacity to staff these teams to provide timely, effective and efficient child protection and protection response in Southern Unity. This will offer an opportunity to provide much needed humanitarian services in areas without protection services.  This child protection intervention has been especially designed to be integrated within UNIDOR&#x2019;s already existing child protection program in  Payinjiar and Mayendit counties. The project will focus on strengthening Community- Based Child Protection Networks (CBCPN) and facilitating access to information and appropriate services. These CBCPN will support children&#x2019;s well-being through local structures or traditional ways, while acting both as response to child protection concerns and as prevention, by helping communities reduce risks and better protect children from violence, abuse, neglect and exploitation. In addition, the CBCPN will identify and refer vulnerable children in need of individual support. Adolescents and youth will be engaged in providing peer support, recreational activities and referrals to the FSL programming as an entry point to develop future intervention with Children Associated with Armed Forced/Groups. UNIDOR already has an existing coordinated intervention with VSF Suisse and Germany, in which UNIDOR identifies children informally released from Armed Forces/Groups and VSF provides reintegration and economic recovery interventions, in the form of vocational training. The project will be field focused, child centered and will be family and community driven.
Being a National Organisation, 90% of UNIDOR staff are South Sudanese nationals who are well conversant with the environment, weather, traditions , cultures, and the political aspects in Unity State and this offers a distinct advantage when it comes to provision of continued services and interventions even when the area is relatively insecure as the staff move with communities.</narrative>
