In line with the Cluster Objectives, Health Link South Sudan will implement specific approaches under the 4 Health Cluster essential time critical and lifesaving activities below 
1.	Provide essential primary healthcare services focusing on major causes of morbidity and mortality. 
HLSS will set up 1 Mobile team  manage by highly qualified and experienced technical mobile personnel  to improve access to critical lifesaving health care services in Bor South. There will be  1 mobile team in Bor South. The team will conduct integrated mobile outreach at least once every week while providing a range of lifesaving services including but not limited to curative consultations, EPI, ANC and BEmONC services, Screening for SAM/MC, and conducting appropriate referrals.
Health Link South Sudan also intends to Support 1 health facilities in Bor South County, 1 PHCU (Bor PoC) under this project. Whereas the maintenance of 1 health facilities and establishment of 1 mobile clinic units is not adequate to reach every segment of the population, HLSS will complement these approaches by participating in 1 RRMs along with the Health Cluster if supported to response to critical emergency health needs as they evolve in any part of the County.
2.	Timely prevent, detect and response to epidemic prone disease outbreaks- 
Under this activity, HLSS plans to support weekly reporting through IDSR and EWARS for Bor PoC with emphasis on timeliness and completeness of all reporting. To strengthen the capacity of the staff, training in integrated emergency preparedness and response including case management, infection prevention control (IPC) and surveillance will be conducted.  HLSS has emergency team that will ensure adequate preparedness and response to any outbreaks within the Country. Potential diseases of importance will include Malaria, Measles, Cholera, Meningitis, Hepatitis E and Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) among others. HLSS also intends to work with CHD and SMoH to enhance facility and community surveillance system and risk communication through public campaigns to be able to pick up the first case and timely raise the alert in the project area to MoH and other partners. 
3.	Integrated response for health/WASH/Nutrition/Food Security and Protection.
Integration of WASH, Nutrition, Food Security and Protection at  health care facility will be central to the implementation of this project. HLSS plans to conduct training of health care workers in Infection Prevention Control (IPC), wastes management and WASH in health facilities while ensuring adequate hand washing facilities, well maintained pit latrines and using fully coded waste bins for temporary disposal of segregated medical wastes before finally disposing through high temperature incineration or burning in designated pits. HLSS also intends to manage SAM with Medical Complications at Bor PoC SC as well as provision of CMR services.
