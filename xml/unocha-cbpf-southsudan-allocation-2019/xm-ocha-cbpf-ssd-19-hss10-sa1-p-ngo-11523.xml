   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Provision of an integrated emergency GBV and General Protection life-saving assistance to the most vulnerable population, host communities, Returnees and IDPs in Ganyiel, Panyijiar County.</narrative>

  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This integrated GBV and GP project is line with the Humanitarian Response plan 2019 and the accompanying SSHF strategy informed by IPC, HNO, Inter-cluster working group and OCHA. The joint GBV and GP project will cover Southern Panyijiar (Ganyiel). The project targets 7,500 beneficiaries. Of this total, 66% (4,950) will directly focus on GBV component. These are segregated by gender as follows: women 2000, girls 1800, men 600 and boys 450.  33% (2,550) being GP component will directly benefit 600 women, 400 girls, 1000 men and 550 boys. The project focuses in Ganyliel in Southern Panyijiar County and its surrounding bomas such as Patuor, Pachienjok, and Tayar port. In this integrated project, the GBV component of the project will focus on establishment of accessible Women and Girls Friendly Spaces (WGFS) from where survivors will receive case management and psychosocial support services. Dignity kits will also be provided within the WGFS.  WGFS will also act as resource centers where general protection activities targeting boys and men will take place. The General protection component of the project will strengthen and build resilience of the affected members of the communities (host communities, IDPS and returnees).  This will be achieved through series of community engagements, risk monitoring and reporting as well as training community leaders with focus on youth, women and girls.
Ganyliel  Payam in greater Panyijiar has been a receiving point of IDPs fleeing from neighboring former Lakes State, Leer and Mayiandit either as result of conflict started in December 2013 or inter-communal feuds and revenge killings. The recorded random killings, rapes, displacement, sexual violence and disappearance of girls and women, revenge killings, recruitment of boys in the armed groups such as SPLA-IO are key pressing issues making this county more volatile and priority. Due to conflict and lack of support system, youth are living with trauma and that is evidenced in the way they demonstrate emotional vulnerability. It is against this backdrop that GP component will enhance prevention and preparedness programming to mitigate risks associated with this traumatic experience. The integration of GBV and GP as one project will harness efficiency through scaling up of women friendly spaces in Ganyliel and another two Bomas of Dakom and Taiyor port, which will serve women, girls, men, and boys in segregated sessions.The approach will include promoting community-based protection as well as community awareness and sensitization on women and girls rights involving men, boys in the communities. This community- centered approach will enhance promotion of GBV and protection specific awareness hence minimizing biased harmful cultural practices against women and girls. The space provided at WGFS will enable women and young girls share their stories to help them recover while having access to psychosocial support, case management, and safe referrals. All sessions will be conducted and led by females&#x2019; staff of CH.  Men and boys will utilize the WGFS/resource centers for specific sessions to provide training and recreation activities aimed at relieving stresses and trauma from the conflict. As strategy in achieving the desired outcome, women and girls will be actively involved in GBV programming in order for them to provide immediate lifesaving assistance to survivors, create and raise awareness and advocacy reaching to the wider communities through local networks.  The GP component will also focus on providing critical support to at-risk community members aiming to promote and sustain their resilience to acute shocks and chronic stresses. The project will succeed reaching to targeted beneficiaries due to relative peace currently enjoyed as result of R-ARCSS signed in September 2018. Besides, the project will enhance participation of women and girls in Peace building and peaceful co-existence through capacity building of local women groups.</narrative>
