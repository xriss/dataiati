   <narrative xml:lang="EN">INTERSOS will continue to provide Shelter and NFIs support to vulnerable targeted beneficiaries through mobile response and static presence. Two Emergency Response Teams (ERT) will operate in Eastern Equatoria, Unity and Jonglei States while static presence will be coordinated through with two S/NFIs State Focal Points in Jonglei and Eastern Equatoria states. 
INTERSOS will provide lifesaving shelter and NFIs in-kind support in response to specific needs of 8,350 IDPs and conflict affected populations. Deep field locations with recent displacements having populations in dire need will be the priority of INTERSOS in the distribution of life-saving S/NFI. 
INTERSOS will provide support to 300 households (approximately 2,000 beneficiaries) of protracted IDPs, vulnerable HC and returnees in the countiy of Bor South through CBI interventions. 
INTERSOS has gained significant experience in CBI interventions in South Sudan, piloting and implementing since 2017 cash programs in Torit, Magwi, Kapoeta South and Bor South where a combined 1400 Households and more than 8,600 individuals have been served, and is currently implementing (under SSHF 2018 2nd allocation) CBI activities in Magwi and Torit counties for a total of 1965 HHs.
INTERSOS will consider the specific needs, concerns and priorities of women and girls, men and boys of different age. people with disability, pregnant and lactating women with the aim of incorporating protection principles during the project implementation. As a short-term intervention, the impact on the population and on the contextual dynamics is sensitive and delicate balances are at play, for this reason the team will ensure accountability processes to the affected population The intervention must be clearly defined and protection concerns taken into consideration so that distributions respect community dynamics, do no harm. Feedback mechanisms will be established in line with the distribution method and the location dynamics. Beneficiaries will be identified using South Sudan SNFIs cluster criteria. In addition, INTERSOS will endeavor to give priority to child-headed households, women, persons with disability, the elderly and other vulnerable people in Emergency Shelter and NFI distribution. NTERSOS has gained a lot of experience in mobile teams&#x2019; interventions and is currently running two mobile protection/GBV projects in South Sudan. This gives to INTERSOS the opportunity to conduct joint assessment and responses when needed in order to better respond to the complex needs of the beneficiaries. 
This CBI intervention will enable most vulnerable groups to receive Shelter/NFIs support as per their needs in order to restore their dignity and improve their living conditions. The project team will also comprise of Cash Transfer officer who will lead implementation and monitoring of cash Transfer programming activities. INTERSOS will use a mix of restricted and unrestricted vouchersin order to meet the  needs of the beneficiaries. The beneficiaries will receive a restricted voucher that can be used to redeem a set of pre-determined items in the market (from selected traders).HHs the beneficiaries will also receive an unrestricted voucher that will give them the ability to chose from a set of items (at a price pre-determined between INTERSOS and the traders) available in selected shops.
The combined value of the two vouchers will be of 55 USD per HHs, this value has been estimated by INTERSOS based on the experience of previous. Moreover this value was choose because enable the intervention to have an overall cost for the CBI intervention of around 25USD/person in line with cluster recommendation.
INTERSOS&apos; CBI officer will be responsible for CBI interventions in Bor South and he may conduct, in coordination with the Cash Working Group and other partners, market assessment in different location to explore the feasibility of Cash based S/NFIs interventions.</narrative>
