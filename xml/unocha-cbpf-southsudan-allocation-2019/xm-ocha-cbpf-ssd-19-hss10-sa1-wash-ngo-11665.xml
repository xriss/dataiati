   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Improving health and protection of vulnerable displaced populations of CES through integrated WASH services and assistance.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project will target 6,250 IDPs, returnees and host community members in Yei county (CES) using a mobile response mechanisms to provide timely and equitable access to water, sanitation and hygiene services, and to enhance protection and dignity of women and girls through WASH services and assistance. 
Firstly, the project will provide access to safe and clean water to 4,500 individuals, through in-kind distribution of WASH NFIs (water storage containers, water filters and soap) to the most vulnerable 2500 individuals (416 HHs) among the IDP/returnee population and host community, and through rehabilitation/repairing of 10 water points to serve a total of 2,000 people (people per borehole 200:1 according to the Sphere standards). The identification of the beneficiaries for the in-kind distribution will be done in collaboration with GBV/protection, health and nutrition partners, in order to better identify their needs and vulnerabilities. LCED will form and train 5 Water Management Committees (WMCs) of 6-8 members each -including representatives of the most vulnerable groups, sub-chiefs and local authorities- who will be responsible for the repairing and maintenance of the water points, under the technical supervision of the LCED staff. 5 Relief Distribution Committees (RDCs) of 6-8 members each will also be formed and will assist LCED for the identification of beneficiaries for the distribution of WASH items and during the distribution itself. The RDCs will also be responsible for providing a feedback and complaint mechanism for the beneficiaries, as part of the AAP strategy included in this project. Furthermore, 500 children in schools and temporary learning spaces will be trained as hand-washing ambassadors for feco-oral disease prevention. Each ambassador is estimated to reach an average of 50 people with hygiene promotion messages, for a total of 5,000 indirect beneficiaries. 
Secondly, 20 toilets and hand-washing facilities will be rehabilitated/repaired in Yei county, ensuring that the structures are secure and gender-appropriate, providing access to proper sanitation and hygiene to 1,000 individuals (people per latrine 20-50:1 according to the Sphere standards). The project will prioritized toilet and hand-washing facilities, as well as water points, near health and nutrition centers and school/temporary learning spaces, in collaboration with health, nutrition, education and protection partners on the ground. The RDCs will be responsible for the identification and repairing of toilet and hand-washing facilities.
Finally, the project will target 500 women and girls of reproductive age with MHM kits, in order to improve their living conditions and help girls to stay in school. This will contribute to enhance dignity and protection of women and girls, together with the repair/rehabilitation of water points, toilet and hand-washing facilities, which will be in secure locations, protected and gender-appropriate. Community consultations including FDGs mediated by LCED staff will allow to identify mechanisms of self-protection already present or to be activated at community level. In the same way, RDCs and WMCs will be responsible for ensuring that sanitation facilities and water points remain secure and protected, especially for women and girls, to set rules at community level for this to happen, and to take appropriate measures in case such rules are broken.
LCED will strengthen the collaboration with the WASH partners in CES, in order to improve humanitarian coordination and avoid duplication in Yei county. Additionally, LCED is in contact with the GBV CS and UN OCHA sub-country office, with whom it will collaborate to ensure humanitarian coordination and follow referral pathways. LCED will continue to incorporate protection in its programming, and to collaborate to health, nutrition and education partners in order to provide integrated solution wherever possible.</narrative>
