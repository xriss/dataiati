  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project will address the present acute WASH needs in Mangateen IDPs settlement by re-enforcing the existing coping mechanisms.
The current lack of WASH services has forced majority IDPs to recognize ways of survival after end of the completion of UNICEF then RRF funded 2 x 3-month projects in mid-February 2019. However, despite the previous exit strategy there are still gaps of WASH services that pose a risk of public health issues.
At least 65% of the water fetched by IDPs for their families is not safe though the quantity is also below WASH minimum standard.
With majority of IDPs also living in shared shelters, poor hygiene and sanitation practices in a setting without solid coping mechanism let cause public health risks in Mangateen. Moreover, Juba is one of the two cholera hotspots type 1 in South Sudan, feared for outbreaks especially in the end of the dry season and beginning of the rainy season about to begin in April.

This project targets approximately 5,000 IDPs in Mangateen settlement with a minimum WASH services promoted with a community approach. Building from the existent such in particular the self-arrangements of the moms for the water collection, NSDO will enhance and formalize WASH committee groups that will be trained by NSDO to help IDPs during their attempt to meet the WASH needs. Community Management Committees will persuade healthy coping mechanisms among IDPs members. Arrangements will be done for IDPs members to clean the existing sanitation facilities on daily basis and collect solid waste generated at household level and within the camp to a collection point near the road.
NSDO with the SSHF support will address the water quality insurance by promoting an appropriate cost-effective chlorination and related-training for the monitoring at both collective points of use and household level, providing in a first step the WASH supplies for the WASH Cluster Core Pipeline. Indeed, target will be both households and water points where IDPs get water from private water trucks arriving in Mangateen, currently now taking the unsafe water from the river, as well as from other water sources where IDPs get water from the host communities.
Also, hygiene and sanitation promotion activities will be conducted at household levels.

While IDPs will be collecting garbage from inside the campy to collection points, NSDO transported will solid waste and liquid waste will be from collection points to the dumping sites by. Repairs will be done to improve sanitation facilities (latrines and bathing shelters and hand-washing facilities will be improved.
In order to improve the quantity of available water for the settlement, the project will also explore opportunities for sustainable water supply in Mangateen though conducting a hydrological survey during the project period, and the report analyzed for possibility of constructing water yard for sustainable safe water supply in Mangateen.</narrative>
