  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Despite a revitalized peace agreement signed by government and opposition leaders in September 2018, fighting and other forms of conflict between government forces and various rebel forces have reportedly continued. The agreement envisions a transitional government, providing for an eight-month pre-transitional period, followed by a 36-month transitional period. Such recurrent conflicts in Unity state have led and kept massive displacement of population in the regions majorly to the POC in the Bentiu. The livelihoods of the population, health and education structures were extremely devastated in this state. Rubkona County is one such County where the impact of the crisis caused serious breakdown of the health system. The health facilities have operated at sub basic level, thereby offering services not corresponding (suitable) to their intended level of care, or others have been abandoned either due to lack of very basic services, health care workers or both. Consequently, it is not uncommon to find communities in Rubkona county who are living far beyond the recommended 5-kilometer radius within an existing health facility. Furthermore, the health care services delivered in Bentiu hospital, which was meant to provide secondary and tertiary health care remains at a very basic level currently providing only outpatient consultations, BEmONC, vaccinations, diagnostic services and short care for inpatients with very critical conditions.  
With the relative calmness, peace and security stability registered in the region, several people have since begun voluntarily returning from the nearby regions, and as well more are also leaving the PoC in Bentiu to settle in their ancestral areas within Rubkona county and other closer areas. To cater for existing and anticipated health care needs of the IDP&#x2019;s and returnees, efforts are still required to rebuild and restructure the health system in Rubkona county to better cater for the current additional health needs. Priority bottlenecks to access and utilize essential health services include unavailability of essential and quality.

To cater for existing and anticipated health care needs of the IDP&#x2019;s and returnees, efforts are still required to rebuild and restructure the health system in Rubkona county to better cater for the current additional health needs. Priority bottlenecks to access and utilize essential health services include unavailability of essential and quality health services at community, PHCUs, PHCCs and hospital levels, inadequate essential commodities and supplies, inadequate health workforce, weak health information systems and poor health. social determinants such as conflicts, gender inequality, Gender based violence (GBV), poverty, illiteracy and poor road networks all contributing to poor health indicators in Rubkona County. Cordaid already has health related projects and activities in the intended areas of implementation, this grant will be implemented by Cordaid directly to bridge the huge health gaps in Rubkona health facilities tapping into the existing staff and capacities of the organization for fast tracking of activities in the County. Therefore, Cordaid would like to consider provision of Integrated Health Care services to vulnerable populations, strengthened health emergency health response capacity to distant communities from Rubkona and Bentiu towns   This will be through strengthening   Bentiu State Hospital  as a secondary referral point  in addition to providing other services such as  support to the  the GBV clinic and nutrition OTP and SC services</narrative>
