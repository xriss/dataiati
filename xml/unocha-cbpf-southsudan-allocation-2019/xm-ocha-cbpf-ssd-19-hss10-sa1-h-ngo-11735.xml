   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Ensure lifesaving emergency healthcare services that reducesmajor causes of morbidity and mortalities</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Republic of South Sudan continued to be affected by complex emergencies resulting from prolonged conflict, broken health system, emergence of communicable diseases and climate change affecting livelihoods of the citizens. The signing of the Revitalised ARCISS on September 12 2018 is hoped to pave ways to provision of basic emergency services including healthcare services to the IDPs, host community and returnees who are in dire needs to access live saving emergency health services. This Project aim to address the major causes of morbidity and mortality through ensuring lifesaving emergency healthcare meeting 2019 HRP and health cluster objectives through mobile outreaches services deliveries. THESO has resolved to continue providing live saving emergency healthcare with dignity to IDPs, returnees and host community in 2019 following the humanitarian code of conducts across the country despite the documented high number of attacked on healthcare and extensive looting and damage of health infrastructure. The effect of South Sudanese poor health situation increasingly contributed for recurrent occurrence of morbidity, mortality and sufferings among vulnerable people in under 5 children and pregnant and lactating mothers continue to be unacceptably high. A high proportion of childhood mortality is rooted in malnutrition which is the underlying cause of death for neonatal, pneumonia, malaria, diarrhoea, and measles related cases. South Sudan is acknowledged to have some of the worst health indicators in the world. The under-five mortality rate is 135 per 1,000 live births, whilst maternal mortality ratio is the highest in the world at 2,054 per 100,000 live births (SSHS 2006). 

Assessments made by The Health Support Organisation (THESO) and corroborated by other humanitarian agency reports (UNICEF, IOM, and WHO) indicated that there is a big gap at reaching the IDPs, returnees and host communities both under government and opposition control areas in Panyikang, Mundri West, Twic East and Uror counties. Insufficient access to health, water, and sanitation services combined with gaps in livelihoods and food security brought major contributing factors towards the high prevalence rate of malnutrition in the area and malnutrition associated illness (e.g. ARI, Measles, Diarrhoea and Malaria). The weekly IDSR reports and monthly HMIS reports shows increase in prevalence of endemic and communicable disease such as malaria, measles, and Hepatitis E in various location such as Mayom, Rubkona, Yirol East, Fangak, Aweil. (WHO). There is doubt in having sustainable funding for health facilities in Twic East, Uror and Panyikang counties in 2019, and will not cover all health facilities if funded RRHP 2018). Moreover, presence of increased number of returnees can contribute for occurrence of emerging and re- emerging diseases due to breakdown in immunisation services and weak diseases prevention and promotion services. 
THESO South Sudan, in collaboration with government structures at State and County level, will use  strategic approach of mobile outreaches to provide lifesaving emergency healthcare services to the IDPs, returnees and host communities in dire needs of humanitarian assistance in Uror County.</narrative>
