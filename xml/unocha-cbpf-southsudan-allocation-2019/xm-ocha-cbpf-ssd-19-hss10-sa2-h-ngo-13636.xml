   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Implementation of the R-ARCISS by warrying parties is giving humanitarian actors full access to all beneficiaries across the country at a time when both government and donors are giving negligible contribution to the national health needs of 1.8% [SSNB 2018] and 10% respectively [Health Cluster]. Lack of national health sector blueprint based on the 6 WHO building blocks of Health system as given rise and huge burden of epidemic prone diseases such as Malaria, Cholera, Meningitis, Anthrax and vaccines preventable diseases such as Measles, Yellow Fever, Whooping Cough, Rubella [Health Cluster]. The ongoing returns of IDPs and refugees to their homeplaces in Morobo from within and neighbouring countries is increasing the risk of outbreaks and is worsening the already overstressed broken health system with lack of access to basic services such as healthcare, water, education, food etc. [IOM DTM 5 March 2019].  With the ongoing Ebola outbreak in Eastern Dr Congo, Morobo is the nearest South Sudanese border area close to Dr Congo with closer proximity to locations such as Ariwara which is just 40 miles away with an ongoing outbreak confirmed on June 30 2019. [USAID 18 July 2019]. The current flooding in Bor South and Twic East is putting at risks the returnees and host communities of waterborne and water related diseases that can leads to outbreaks such as Malaria and Cholera, etc. [IFRC 22 June 2019]. South Sudan is acknowledged to have some of the worst health indicators in the world. The under-five mortality rate is 135 per 1,000 live births, whilst maternal mortality ratio is the highest in the world at 2,054 per 100,000 live births (SSHS 2006). 
THESO has been responding to the emergency health needs of 0ver 30,000 population in Paluony Boma of Yuai Payam &#x2013; Uror County from March 2019 with funding from SSHF SA1 allocation.  In Morobo County, SSHUA is only going to support 3 out of the 18 health facilities with HPF3 funding. Facts finding assessments made by SPEDP reports indicated that there is a big gap at reaching the IDPs, returnees and host communities in Morobo county [SPEDP July 20 2019]. Being a high-risk priority location for Ebola outbreak response, THESO is prepositioning itself to support in awareness creation promoting health and control as well as response in case management in case of need. This SA2 allocation Project aim to address the major causes of morbidity and mortality through ensuring lifesaving emergency healthcare meeting 2019 HRP and health cluster objectives through 2PHCUs services deliveries in Morobo County working closely with the developmental and humanitarian partners on the ground. With present on the ground THESO wish to continue providing lifesaving emergency healthcare with dignity to IDPs, returnees and host community with SSHF SA2 funding. 
Insufficient access to health, water, and sanitation services combined with gaps in livelihoods and food security brought major contributing factors towards the high prevalence rate of malnutrition in the area and malnutrition associated illness (e.g. ARI, Measles, Diarrhoea and Malaria). The weekly IDSR EWARS reports and monthly HMIS reports shows increase in prevalence of endemic and communicable disease such as malaria, measles, and acute watery diarrhoea in Morobo (WHO). THESO in collaboration with government structures at State and County level, will use strategic approach of PHCUs to provide lifesaving emergency healthcare services to the IDPs, returnees and host communities in dire needs of humanitarian assistance in Morobo County.</narrative>
