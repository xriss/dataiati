   <narrative xml:lang="EN">IRW South Sudan, through this project &#x201C;Restoring life-saving WASH services to the conflict affected population (IDPs, returnees and host communities) in Yei County&#x201D; will support the most vulnerable conflict affected people in Yei County of Central Equatoria State in South Sudan. This project will help improve access to potable water for 10,500 people (3,640 girls, 2,646 boys, 1,778 men, and 2,436 women). The project aims at reducing the suffering of the affected people from water borne diseases and other burdens related to lack of access to basic WASH services, these includes inadequate access to clean drinking water and appropriate gender sensitive sanitation and hygiene services. The WASH component of the intervention is expected to increase and improve access to and use of clean drinking water, sustainable gender appropriate sanitation and hygiene services and will help to reduce the rate of diseases and improve health conditions and dignity of the affected population. 
People affected by the protracted conflict ( IDPs , returnees and host communities ) in Yei county are living under poor humanitarian conditions, this situation is marked by poor living conditions and dire need of humanitarian assistance due to lack of access to adequate life supporting services . The need assessment conducted by Interagency during the month of Nov. 2018 shows that Otogo and surrounding Payam&apos;s major source of water used to be boreholes. The assessment further reveals that all the 11 boreholes across the six bomas of Otogo payam are nonfunctional as such the  population of 8, 190 people does not have access to clean waters supply except water from seasonal streams and un protected shallow wells. IRW-SS also conducted a rapid needs assessment in the area, which shows that people are of the view that cases of water borne diseases and diarrhea in children lt 5 years is so high , lack of access to PUR and chlorine tabs for water purification and treatment contributes to communities taking unsafe water . WASH NFIs, hygiene kits and women dignity (MHM) kits is a high need in the targeted area. 
About 11,943 HHs ( 17,253 people ) have voluntarily return into Yei town from the neighboring countries of Uganda and DRC , while 38,000 HHs ( 47,758 people ) registered as IDPs currently in Yei while about 50,479HHs ( 68,647 people) registered as host communities currently in Yei town ( source: Relief amp rehabilitation commission office and IOM ) all are in dire need of humanitarian assistance .


This emergency response link to life &#x2013; saving and building resilience of the affected people will target a total population of 10,000 people, of which 6,000 people from IDPs, 3,000 people returnees and 1,000 host communities will be provided with clean water (sphere: 7.5 l-15 liters/ person/day) also the same population of 10,000 people is expected to have access to gender appropriate sanitation and hygiene services and WASH related NFIs. Targeted women of child bearing age and girls of adolescent age will be targeted including those women taking care of children admitted at nutrition centers will be provided with MHM and general hygiene kits to increase hygienic management and preserve their dignity during this critical periods. The response will also focus on improving access to clean drinking water in health facilities and nutrition and stabilization centers .The response will extend hygiene promotion activities in households, public places. Health facilities, nutrition and stabilization centers will be fully targeted with relevant hygiene messages too. Moreover, IRW-SS also consulted the relevant government ministry and humanitarian actors working in the targeted area.</narrative>
