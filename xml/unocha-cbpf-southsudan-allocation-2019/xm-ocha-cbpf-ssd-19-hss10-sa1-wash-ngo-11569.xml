   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Scaling up provision of safe water, sanitation and Hygiene promotion needs through an integrated approach in nutrition and protection sectors to the conflict affected IDPs, returnees and the  vulnerable hosts in Leer and Mayendit North Counties Southern Unity State is paramount because of the adverse effects of wars and conflicts experienced. The functional water points including boreholes and protected hand dug wells are overused with the massive influx of returnees and this has on a great scale contributed to the often breakdown, overcrowding and a source of conflict especially between the visiting communities and the host communities. The inadequate water situation has led to increased queuing time at the viable water sources causing reduced per capita water consumption (under 10 L/person/day), increased consumption from unprotected surface water sources, reduced time for other essential tasks and also can be a source of conflict. The sanitation and hygiene situation both at the communal level and institutions like OTP/SC is also demanding due to the fact that most sanitation facilities were destroyed during the conflicts and also over use on the existing facilities leaving the vulnerable IDPs, returnees and the hosts to practice open defecation. This project targets 16500 (men, women, girls and boys) conflict affected communities including IDPs, returnees and hosts in Leer and Mayendit North Counties by scaling up provision of safe water, sanitation and Hygiene promotion needs through an integrated approach of WASH in nutrition and protection sectors. Improved and equitable access to safe and sufficient drinking water will be achieved through rehabilitation and repairing 30 non-functioning boreholes and 4 protected hand dug wells inside or near the schools, health facilities, child friendly spaces and nutrition centers. Improved sanitation and hygiene will be achieved through rehabilitation of 15 institutional latrines near or inside the Nutrition centers and child friendly spaces as part of integration accompanied by thorough  hygiene and sanitation training during household visits and campaigns on best hygiene practices like hand washing with soap, treatment and safe storage of drinking water and proper disposal of human excreta and other solid wastes. The rehabilitation and repairs of all water points and sanitation facilities will be done in Leer and Mayendit North Counties after a GBV risk analysis with the focus groups discussion with women and girls, conducted by female staff on the safety and best location to minimize the occurrence of GBV cases and risk of sexual exploitation of women and girls since they are the primary beneficiary and more vulnerable. Training of adolescent girls on menstrual hygiene management will also be done in schools which will contribute to their sense of dignity and ability to participate in school activities which will at long run improve their attendance and retention in school. Rehabilitated latrines will have doors and locks to enhance privacy and dignity and the super-structure will be made up of iron sheets which is stable to enhance security and  reducing the risk of collapse, exploitation, such as sexual exploitation and abuse. WASH training of nutrition teams  will be done in order to support good hygiene practices in the household especially where  CMAM cases have been detected. Hygiene Kits distribution will also target the mothers and caretakers of SAM/MAM children and PLW in the OTP/TSFP centers, following consultation with the nutrition team who will be very vital in the process of beneficiary identification.</narrative>
