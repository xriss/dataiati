   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The unprecedented intense and sustained rains experienced in South Sudan since June have affected 908,000 people, leaving over 420,000 in need of immediate assistance. The extreme floods had a devastating impact in 7 States, among which Jonglei and Unity have been some of the worst hit, with Akobo, Mayom, Mayendit, and Abiemnom designated priority areas for humanitarian response scale-up.

In Mayom, over 42,000 individuals (7,000 HH) fled their homes due to the floods, according to IRNA&#x2019;s October report. Homes have been submerged and destroyed and 14 schools have been damaged with over 5,914 children affected. In Mayendit, an Inter-Agency Flood Crises Assessment Report from August notes that Malkuer Payam has been particularly affected, surpassing the community&#x2019;s coping capacity. Houses, schools, and sanitation facilities have been destroyed and crops totally damaged. 1,563 individuals (520HH) have been affected, including a high number of female headed HH, children and youth. Malkuer primary school was temporarily closed due to the damages. In Abiemnom, the condition of the roads to Agok and Mayom has been further worsened by the floods and repeated security incidents. Owing to the lack of a landing airstrip, the area is currently only accessible by helicopters. According to the RRC, over 10 schools have been affected by the floods. 
INTERSOS will support 17 affected schools in Mayendit, Mayom, and Abiemnom by installing 2 new classrooms (1 TLS), 20 stances (10 blocks of latrines), and 10 handwashing facilities, and rehabilitating 12 classrooms (6 TLS), including the rehabilitation of 10 stances (5 blocks of latrines). INTERSOS has conducted a rapid assessment in the affected schools and will proceed with another assessment during the project inception to validate previous findings. The response will benefit IDPs, Host Communities, children, women and vulnerable groups and will complement INTERSOS&#x2019; intervention in Mayendit and Mayom while also extend to other affected schools.
 
According to an IRNA report from October, 13,620 (2,270HH) individuals have been affected and lack basic supplies in Akobo East. Women were identified as the most vulnerable group as daily activities such as collecting firewood, fetching water or even the heavy removal of properties damaged by the flood have become a challenge and leave them further exposed to risks of GBV. There are reported cases of rape that occurred while women and girls were moving their properties or fetching water. Lack of access to dignity kits exposes women and girls to contamination and psychosocial stress and trauma. The floods have also disrupted the communities&#x2019; livelihoods, increasing food insecurity and poverty, major drivers of GBV.
INTERSOS will provide lifesaving assistance to address critical GBV needs of the most vulnerable populations and prevent and mitigate protection risks. INTERSOS will rehabilitate two Women and Girls Friendly Spaces (WGFS) where case management will be provided to 65 survivors in conformity with the principles of confidentiality, safety, respect and non-discrimination, and PSS will be delivered to 1,375 GBV survivors and at-risk individuals, through peer-to-peer counseling and other sharing and participatory activities. The WGFS will host income-generating activities (IGA) for 960 IDP women and adolescent girls to support their disrupted livelihoods. 900 dignity kits will be distributed on a need basis to prevent stigma and contribute to sanitation. Lastly, INTERSOS will organize awareness raising campaigns to inform about existing services and de-stigmatize help-seeking behavior. The campaigns will target 2,625 women and girls but also 875 men and boys to ensure effectiveness of preventive work, and peer dissemination of messaging. The response will complement INTERSOS ongoing GBV intervention in Akob</narrative>
