   <narrative xml:lang="EN">International Medical Corps (IMC) is an US-registered independent affiliate organization of International Medical Corps UK (IMC UK), with which IMC UK shares the same name and charitable objectives and mission. IMC UK and IMC work together to deliver assistance programs in an accountable and effective manner in pursuit of their commonly-held charitable objectives. IMC UK will engage IMC to implement its Programs in the field, with IMC UK oversight, according to the terms and conditions of any agreement that results from this proposal and the terms of the parties&#x2019; administrative service agreement. IMC maintains a branch office in Croatia, IMC Split that provides administrative and operational support to IMC UK and to the Programs on the ground, including but not limited to financial management, procurement management/international procurements, and logistics.

IMC has been providing lifesaving services in southern Sudan and South Sudan to people affected by conflict for more than 20 years and plays a vital role in building the local capacity of healthcare staff, community health workers, traditional birth attendants, and youth and community leaders to ensure the sustainability of these services. IMC provides comprehensive services covering primary healthcare, reproductive health, mental health and psychosocial support, secondary healthcare including inpatient services, nutrition services, protection and gender-based violence services including the clinical management of rape and safe referrals, and specialized education programs for the training of nurses and midwives. 

Currently, International Medical Corps supports 32 health facilities and three midwifery and nursing health science institutes across five states in South Sudan. Through these facilities, International Medical Corps is providing vital primary and secondary healthcare services to IDP, refugee, and host community populations, as well as disease outbreak preparedness and response. 

Through the proposed project, International Medical Corps will continue to support increased access to and quality of  comprehensive primary health care services delivered to Wau IDPs and host communities in Twic, by  increasing community awareness through trained community health workers, continued staff capacity building, providing essential drugs and supplies, and ensuring 24/7 services in the health facility supported. IMC will also strengthen disease surveillance, intensify timely response to confirmed disease outbreaks, and provide Clinical Management of Rape (CMR) services. Malaria treatment and prevention will be a priority as well as prompt response to epidemics, particularly measles and cholera. International Medical Corps will maintain a permanent minimum stock of essential and lifesaving emergency drugs purchased through the proposed grant and other complementary grants. 

As women and children are highly vulnerable segments of the population, especially in terms of health risks, they often have limited access to health care services. Women face various social, attitudinal and physical barriers to access friendly reproductive health (RH) services which can increase their vulnerability to many RH related problems and complications. In order to address these barriers, IMC will increase community awareness through trained CHWs to increase the ability of the women of reproductive age  to access services.</narrative>
