   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Supporting SGBV prevention and response in Bentiu, Rubkona County, Unity State</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The supporting SGBV prevention and response project will cost $139,923.90 and will be implemented in Bentiu, Rubkona County, Unity State. It will benefit 7,090 internally displaced persons and the host communities comprising of 4,290 women, 775 men, 1,525 girls and 500 boys. According to ECHO Daily Flash of 4th December 2018, over 120 women including the elderly and girls as young as 10 years and pregnant women, sought emergency assistance in Bentiu (Rubkona County, Unity State), reporting that they had been raped, and brutalised in the 10 days between 19th and 29th November 2018. In addition to being violently raped, the survivors were whipped, beaten or clubbed with sticks and rifle butts. They were also robbed of money, clothes, shoes and anything else of value that they might have possessed, and which they may need to support their families. Even their ration cards to receive food distributions were taken and destroyed by their attackers. These incidences of sexual and gender based violence coincide with an increase in population movements as people try to reach food distribution centres. The above incidences and those that remained unreported indicate that women and girls continue to face violence in Bentiu as they walk long distances during food distributions resulting into loss of safety and protection mechanisms and loss of livelihoods. As such, a holistic GBV prevention and response is urgently needed, specifically for women and girls. Therefore this project will provide life-saving GBV prevention and response and risk mitigation activities through the extension of existing protection interventions in Bentiu to ensure a holistic approach to addressing community GBV concerns of women, girls, boys and men are addressed through:
(1) Conducting a risk assessment to understand the level of vulnerabilities
(2) Collaborate with existing partners to utilise the existing Women amp Girls Friendly Spaces 
(3) Provision of GBV case management services including focused Psychosocial Support Services for survivors of GBV 
(4) conducting legal aid services through awareness, assistance, education and counselling 
(5) Identifying and training community paralegals to conduct protection awareness and GBV prevention and response through neighborhood assemblies 

We will also ensure that all our activities take a &#x201C;Do No Harm and conflict sensitive approach&#x201D;. IDPs and local host communities will be targeted, as well as all other survivors and all those at risk of SGBV.
STEWARDWOMEN has been implementing protection and economic empowerment programmes since 2012 in Eastern Equatoria and Central Equatoria States. When coming up with this intervention plan, we consulted with National GBV sub-cluster, DRC and Hope Restoration who have presence in Rubkona and Bentiu. We shall use our 8 years GBV programming experience to scale up GBV prevention and response, to implement this project and document lessons learned.
STEWARDWOMEN brings a unique strategic partnership and exclusive strength and capacity as a women&#x2019;s organization to this project. STEWARDWOMEN will work hand in hand with already existing GBV implementing partners in Bentiu, Rubkona County especially IRC and DRC. At the start of the project, STEWARDWOMEN will hold consultative meetings with IRC and DRC on the geographical target locations, to understand the context of Bentiu and learn from their vast experiences of GBV case management. We shall also collaborate with these agencies to provide training for our case workers. STEWARDWOMEN will establish her program in collaboration with existing services such as situating our legal aid clinic in some of the WGFS and providing weekly legal counselling and education at these centres.</narrative>
