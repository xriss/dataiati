   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project aims to undertake protection monitoring and assessment activities to identify the dynamics and the critical protection gap, needs of the affected population and share the reports with protection cluster and other humanitarian actors for possible multi-sectoral intervention and response. It builds on the previous project to extend the proposed activities to locations that were not covered by the previous SSHF project especially hard-to-reach areas. Our targeted audience is IDPs, returnees and the host communities in Leer and Mayendit counties with more attention to community-identified to be at risk or
experiencing right violation, vulnerable individual or household at risk of abuse, exploitation, and neglect caused by the recycling of violent in Southern Unity. It will also Identify the trends and improve information sharing regarding the overall humanitarian situation in which the finding will be used to make an informed decision on humanitarian response and in project design. The project will also contribute to the identification, prevention, and mitigation of protection risks through community-based protection mechanism in hard to reach areas within the two counties mentioned above. Focus and
particular attention will be on Leah, Tay, Nyoat, Woutier, and Padeah. IDPs in these locations had been suffered in terms of getting services due to the remoteness of the locations and insecurity where the beneficiaries were not able to access humanitarian assistance and services. MHA has conducted protection monitoring and needs assessment in October 2018 in Leah, Islands in Leer, as well as Langbielnyier and Padeah in Jan 2019 along with NRC emergency response team. It was found that a large population was living in deep far villages and Islands due to fear of their lives, they have limited access to humanitarian assistance because sometimes, they lack information of when and where they
should access them. Another factor is that the locations are too remote/far away from where the services are being provided by the humanitarian actors. This has created a gap in term of communication and information which in most cases contributes to their being missed out from registration. Based on the
finding, the assessment report can be found in the document tab.MHA will continue with the implementation of the activities listed below
1: Protection Officers and Protection Assistants will conduct weekly protection
monitoring including identification, registration, and referral of extremely
most vulnerable persons to services providers and provide direct material
supports when necessary as well as to invite other partners with reassures to
response to the identified needs in a timely manner.
2: Protection assessment targeting the hard to reach areas in the two counties
especially places which were not accessible last year due to the insecurity. 
3: Establish a community base-referral mechanism and train the community
base-protection member including communities&#x2019; leaders that will enhance and build community preparedness to mitigate protection risks and implement a risk reduction plan.
4. To disseminates the information on the availability of services so that
beneficiaries do not miss the registration and other services. Awareness-raising campaigns aiming at eliminating the negative coping mechanism, the right of individual or groups to be respected and access services without discrimination. This activity will be targeting different sections of the community in the targeted locations with follow up from MHA to ensure that it is understood and any the complaint is addressed in a timely
manner.</narrative>
