   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Emergency Food Security and Livelihoods Response for Conflict-Affected Populations in Mayendit County of Central Unity State.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project will support communities (IDPS, returnees and host communities) a total beneficiaries of 20,748 and (3458 HHs) with emergency food security and livelihoods assistance to alleviate suffering by scaling up the provision of emergency main season crop kits, vegetable and fishing kits for vulnerable households in Mayendit County. Priority payams with estimated beneficiaries are Dablual (3,972), Thaker (5616)  Rubkway (5940) Tutnyang (5220).This population shall be segregated by gender during the distribution of kits as well as reporting.

This project will provide emergency support that aim at limiting the increase in vulnerability and extreme use of negative coping mechanisms which threaten the lives of the most vulnerable. In line with FSL Cluster priorities for SSHF 2019 1st standard allocation, Coalition for Humanity (CH) will distribute livelihood protection inputs in areas where majority of the population in Mayendit County lies in IPC 3 amp 4-emergency phases with significant already in catastrophe phase (IPC 5). Indicators show a continuously declining situation and which has seen little intervention from humanitarian actors due to conflict that make most the areas and local population inaccessible. Humanitarian food assistance is paramount to avoid further deterioration. The project will target 20,748 most vulnerable IDPs, returnees and host population in Mayendit North by distributing to them variety of crop seeds and vegetable kits or fishing kits. 

The overall aim of this intervention is to prepare farmers for the main farming season so that there is enough food for the families in the coming lean season. To achieve this, support will be provided to support farmers on immediate kits distribution as well as undertaking transition to recovery activities such as supporting them on food surplus storage, food preparation and utilization. The project will provide support to over 300 farmers groups with information related to report of crops pests, especially fall army worms and other devastating pests/insects or diseases that affect crops productivity.

The project outcome will contribute to reversal of more than five years of limited farming in the area by creating awareness with possible reversal of already very direct situation as per the latest IPC report which put significant part of the county under catastrophe or famine phase (IPC 5). Most of the population in this County is expected to continue being under catastrophe or famine phase (IPC 5) comes January and March 2019. 

This project is timely, as the population in Mayendit county has gone through highest level of insecurity and conflict from 2013 to late 2018. Their coping strategies and resilience have been completely weakened since most of them were staying in remote or hard- to- reach areas due to safety concerns. The project will address the immediate food security and livelihoods needs  of most vulnerable people in selected IDPS, returnees and host communities who will directly or indirectly benefit from this project. The project will benefit indirect beneficiaries estimated at 10,149 HHs or 60,894 people from various livelihoods activities such as skill-based trainings, farm inputs, and provision of quality seeds and fishing kits for families residing around rivers or swamps. This project will ensure integration of other sectors such as general protection, SGBV and WASH activities to ensure that both direct and indirect beneficiaries realize maximum benefit.</narrative>
