   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Water, Hygiene and Sanitation (WASH) emergency intervention to alleviate suffering of severely affected communities in Aweil East</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Aweil East county in Northern Bahr el Ghazal  state is among the counties in South Sudan that has continuously recorded high levels of malnutrition and high prevalence of water borne diseases. Centre for emergency and development support (CEDS) is proposing to implement an emergency water sanitation and hygiene project in this county with an objective of reducing the incidences of water and sanitation related morbidities through increased access to sustainable sources of safe drinking water, provision of sanitation facilities and items, and promoting safe hygiene practices. In total the proposed project will reach a total of 15,950 vulnerable men, women, boys and girls directly and 61,500 beneficiaries indirectly from the host communities. The project will involve rehabilitation of boreholes in and around nutrition Outpatient therapeutic programme (OTP) and stabilisation centre&apos;s, construction and renovation of toilets in nutrition centres, clearing of bushes around selected water points. This project will also secure WASH NFI&apos;s and distribute to targeted beneficiaries and carry out hygiene and sanitation promotion through community hygiene promoters and mother to mother support groups. As a result of the proposed activities, it is expected that the targeted beneficiaries in and around the nutrition centers will have an increased access to safe drinking water from the renovated water points and as well have reduced cased of gender based violence against women who visit the water points with security lights set up and surrounding bushes cleared. Moreover the targeted beneficiaries in the nutrition centers will have an increases access to sanitation facilities as well as WASH NFI&apos;s and the community members targeted with hygiene and sanitation messaging will have enhanced knowledge on safe hygiene and sanitation practices.  

This proposed project will contribute to the allocation strategy 1 and 2 as well as WASH cluster objectives. In contribution to the allocation strategy and the cluster objectives, the project will provide timely integrated WASH services to the vulnerable malnourished children and their caregiver at the nutrition sites and thus reducing their acute water and sanitation needs. At the community level moreover the vulnerable community members will be having access to water and also be provided with information of safe hygiene and sanitation practices and thus reduce the acute needs at the community level. At community level, this project targets to ensure safety of women and girls accessing the water points at community level this these vulnerable women and girls will be protected from sexual and gender based violence

CEDS will be in a better place to implement this project in Aweil East county because apart from being sub national cluster lead in NBeG, CEDS has a long standing track record of more than 5 years successfully implementing similar emergency WASH activities including drilling and rehabilitation of water points, construction and renovation of sanitation facilities in addition to hygiene promotion in this county. The organization also  has technical expertise including hosting the sub national WASH cluster coordinator and a contextualised understanding of the WASH needs in this county and NBEG state in general. As a local NGO, CEDS has also created a relationship with the community members, local administration and other key community leaders which will enhance the implementation of this project.</narrative>
