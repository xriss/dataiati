   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Improving access to nutrition services for the flood affected households in Ulang</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">GOAL has been implementing quality health and nutrition services in South Sudan since 1985. In Ulang GOAL has been operational since 2007 and is thus well established in the communities with pre-existing bases and staff at each site where GOAL is currently already implementing TSFP and other FSL interventions. GOAL continues to forge strong relationships with local authorities and thus will be building on the existing goodwill as well as staffing levels and strengthen the team to improve quality of the service delivery.

In this project, GOAL will be focusing on reducing risk and vulnerability to the sudden impact of the flash floods by promoting equal access to nutritional services. This project is not a standalone intervention from the current WFP supported activities but will focus on supporting populations whose access to services have significantly been disrupted to ensure there is continuity of delivery of nutrition services. GOAL will facilitate mobile outreach, and rehabilitation of affected TSFP centres, and WASH promotion. There 6 mobile services that will be primary target areas in the following Payams, Yomding, Ulang central, Doma and Kuich and another 6 existing TSFP sites in Nyagora, Barmach Rirnyang, Bimbim and Doma plus Kuich that will be rehabilitated. GOAL will facilitate linkages towards creating a more holistic and sustainable approach to achieving the planned outcomes for this project by working with relevant partners through national and local level structures particularly in the MoH, local authorities and traditional leadership. 

GOAL will aim to strengthen the delivery of basic essential nutrition and water and sanitation services messages at community and facility level as well as support and preserve the state national implementation capacity by working with existing, local structure in the health and water and sanitation sectors, which will help maintain the main foundations for a speedy recovery of targeted beneficiaries from the devastating impact of the floods.

At service provision level the project will be working and supporting CHD in the implementation of the response plans. GOAL will ensure a close coordination with other national and international partners to engage with the Government, UN Agencies on the interventions to ensure efficient use of resources required to build a successful response plan to achieve the described outcomes of the cluster response strategy. 

This project will also where possible mainstream and support fully integration of nutrition into the existing primary services and improve access to and quality of these health and nutrition interventions. The project will integrate with the current nutrition partners in the area whereby beneficiaries in the health facilities will be supported to access nutrition services from these partners. For example, we will refer SAM cases on to UNKEA Further, GOAL will attempt to integrate hygiene and sanitation at nutrition facilities.

This project will also link with the FSL project GOAL is implementing on building resilience (RECOVER). This will contribute increasing capacity of communities to be able to recover from the impact of floods.

GOAL will apply its comprehensive standards on accountability to various stakeholders engaged in this project, including beneficiaries. GOAL has a functional Feedback, Complaints Response Mechanism (FCRM), providing a platform for communities to air views on support and services provided by GOAL and response to any unintended consequences for project participants. This strategy assists GOAL to improve its programming by maximizing community engagement and empowering them to make collective decisions and actions concerning their communities and the services provided.</narrative>
