  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Rural Health Services&#x2019; proposed project aims to contribute to the fight against excess morbidity and mortality caused by common communicable and non-communicable diseases as well as injuries sustained from sporadic con&#xFB02;icts, across Pibor County, through ensuring access to quality essential lifesaving and integrated primary health care services to women, men, girls and boys, plus SGBV services to vulnerable host communities and IDPs/returnees in and around Pibor payam (Tenet, Kavachoch, Bee, Manyirany, Manyimen, Manydakel and Akello) of Pibor County, Jonglei State. 
Access to lifesaving primary Heath care Services in Pibor County has been a challenge and critical gaps exist people are forced to walk long distances to reach health care services in Pibor PHCCs. Whereas, other populations in Pibor South and Pibor North  are almost left without essential lifesaving health care services and the women are not protected against SGBV. 
Through this project, RHS plans to establish and operate 2 Mobile clinics in Pibor South and Pibor North Payams, to provide integrated essential lifesaving healthcare services to the population of Tenet, Kavachoch and Bee of Pibor south and Manyirany, Manyimen, Manydakel and Akello of Pibor North. This is expected to save lives by providing timely integrated assistance and services to reduce acute needs among the most vulnerable women, men, girls and boys in the area. The clinics will provide integrated services including curative consultations, ANC, Vaccination to children less than 15 years, screening of under-5 for malnutrition and treatment of MAM and referral of SAM cases to Pibor Town PHCCs for stabilization and better management, epidemic prone disease surveillance and Health Promotion and Education. RHS will also train key project workers at the 2 mobile clinics in Infection prevention and control and in disease surveillance and preparedness as well as response to epidemic disease outbreaks with focus on cholera, Measles, Ebola amp yellow fever as well as Malaria, meningitis, and Hepatitis E. 
In line with the Health cluster objective 1 of Saving lives by providing timely and integrated multi-sector assistance and services to reduce acute needs among the most vulnerable women, men, girls and boys, RHS intends to ensure adequate provision of essential lifesaving  emergency integrated healthcare services, and aims at addressing the major causes of Morbidity and mortality among children under 5 (Malaria, diarrhea and Pneumonia), basic emergency obstetric and Neonatal care, (BEMONC) services, SGBV services through Clinical Management of Rape Cases (CMR) to women and girls. This will be achieved further through the continuity of curative consultations care services at the mobile clinics. Other activities will include but not limited to conducting clean, safe and hygienic deliveries by skilled birth attendants, minor surgeries, provision of basic HIV services, IPT, LLITNs and micro nutrient supplementation, growth monitoring and nutrition assessment children less than 5, screening and supportive treatment for MAM/SAM, provision of psychosocial first aid and referral of complicated to Pibor PHCC.
