   <narrative xml:lang="EN">School meals for conflict affected children and youth (boys and girls) in areas most affected by food insecurity and hard to reach in Jonglei (Bor South, Nyirol and Uror), South Sudan</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">SCI will implement this project in the counties of Bor South, Nyirol and Uror, The proposed interventions aim to ensure that all children and youth, especially children with disabilities, have access to quality education and are retained in schools in line with INEE minimum standards and according to HRP priorities for 2019. To support children&#x2019; enrollment and retention in schools, SCI will provide school meals to 6,100 (3,965 boys and 2,135 girls) in 20 selected schools (Bor South 6 Nyirol 7 and Uror 7) building on the current interventions in Nyirol and Uror. Provision of meals to learners will ultimately reduce risks of cognitive underdevelopment and malnutrition and provide access to safe and protective learning environments. A take home ration to 300 girls on a monthly basis, based on daily attendance. Readymade food (biscuits) will be provided to 2,985 (2,089 boys and 896 girls) children in Bor South while those in Nyirol and Uror will continue feeding under the current SSHF2 during the first month while procurement is taking place. This will ensure that operational delays to establish on site facilities and procure food do not impact food service delivery to children.

School level community meetings will be conducted. These meetings will set up priorities and establish effective and accountable food delivery and monitoring modalities for school meals and take home rations. SCI will collaborate with school authorities, local leaders and communities to conduct wide spread sensitization and community mobilization within the communities of the target schools. These efforts will focus on the importance of education, good nutrition, and deworming, improved hygiene and sanitation practices and enhanced participation of women in all project activities. We will engage community members through community talks and dissemination of information/education materials in collaboration with other clusters/partners/sectors. To engage parents and caregivers, 99 (64 Males: 35 Females) PTA members in Bor South will be provided orientation training on effective and accountable food delivery, distribution, monitoring and nutrition. Community members, including teachers (28 18 Male/10 female), PTA members (308 200 males/108 females), head teachers 28 (18 Male/10 female) and local authorities (30 19 males/11 females) will be trained in psychosocial support (PSS), child protection, nutrition, WASH, life skills, health and food handing. The proposed interventions will leverage on other SCI SSHF projects (CP, Nutrition, Health and FSL) implemented in same locations. Under the CP project, PTAs, teachers, head teachers, local authorities and children will be trained on how to identify children at risk of abuse. Working with the nutrition team, OTP messages and training will target the same schools and teachers, head teachers, PTAs, local authorities and children. These messages and training will increase understanding of how to support health and nutrition within the home and community. Community nutrition volunteers will visit schools to provide key messages about school health and nutrition. The project will integrate health messages into school level activities through displaying poster messages and conducting awareness campaigns. SCI will collaborate with clusters to disseminate nutrition and WASH visibility materials in all target schools. The project will build on existing UNICEF education funded activities currently implemented in same locations and schools to increase integration, build synergies and reduce costs. A procurement plan with lead times has been developed (attached). SCI will support the project through its Lankien and Bor offices. The rub halls in Lankien and Bor will be used to store food before it reaches the schools. In Lankien, the food will transported by the Logistics cluster in addition to using charter flights. All operations will be based on SCI operational strategy and risk analysis (attached).</narrative>
