   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Improved provision of equitable access to safe water, sanitation and hygiene for IDPs and host communities in the Greater Bagari, South Sudan.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Oxfam proposes a response to the immediate needs of conflict affected IDPs and the surrounding host communities in Greater Bagari, Western Bahr el Ghazal with integrated WASH services. Being in line with the cluster allocation strategy and primary HRP SO(s) 2019, the proposed project will provide improved water, sanitation and hygiene to an integrated approach with nutrition and GBV. 
This project integrates WASH with Nutrition response in which WASH services will be provided to six Outpatient Theraputic Program/ Stabilization Center (OTP/SC) sites in Greater Bagari (Ngo Dakalla, Ngissa, Ngoku, Farajalla, Mboro center and Kadafara). The boreholes near the OTP/SC sites will be rehabilitated and flushed to provide safe and adequate water to the patients in the nutrition sites. Six blocks of latrine (one male and one female stance) with handwashing facilities will be constructed in the targeted nutrition points to ensure safe sanitation facility to the mothers and children visiting the nutrition site. In addition, 20 Nutrition Volunteers from nutrition partners will be trained in hygiene promotion who will conduct awareness session to the mothers/ guardians of children under 5 admitted for SAM in the OTP sites. They will be provided with hygiene kits when the children are discharged to ensure that the hygiene practices learned in the OTP sites are followed even after their return. This will also encourage mothers of SAM affected children to visit OTP sites for treatment of their children. 1200 SAM affected children&#x2019;s will be targeted for hygiene kit distribution and awareness in this project. If the number of SAM admitted children is less, children with MAM (under 5) will also be considered for hygiene kits and awareness. Hygiene kits will be requested from core-pipeline propositioned in Wau.
As Greater Bagari has been out of humanitarian access for six months between June to November 2018 with few convoyed access in October. There is heavy need of WASH services in the area. Many boreholes are damaged and water yield has decreased. This project proposes rehabilitating and flushing 19 existing boreholes in several nearby communities to provide adequate water supply. Twenty-three (23) water management committees (9 members each) will be trained in safe water chain and 24 pump mechanics will be trained for repair and maintenance of hand pumps. Tool boxes will be provided through the core pipeline to the community leader or chief to be pre-positioned. These committees will be trained in management and maintenance of boreholes to enhance ownership and sustainability. This will also help to enhance/build local capacities and resilience to organise themselves and maintain their water resources. As nearly 99% of the population practices open defecation (ICWG assessment in Fanjar, 2018), sanitation awareness will be conducted through public health mobilisation meetings. 10 community hygiene promoters will be trained on hygiene promotion who will conduct hygiene promotion in the communities as well as encourage people to build household latrines. 500 HHs will be targeted for the household sanitation program where plastic slabs and digging tools will be provided through the core pipeline. 400 adolescent school girls will be provided with Menstrual Hygiene Management (MHM) kits along with orientation during distribution. The recent conflict in June 2018 in Greater Bagari has pushed the communities deeper into the bushes as they feared living near the roadside where the chances of being attacked was high. Since most of the boreholes are along the road, women and girls must walk 3 to 4 hours to fetch safe water. This has increased their exposure to Gender based violence (GBV). Oxfam proposes drilling four new boreholes in the secure and accessible location in Greater Bagari following gender risk analysis to reduce their exposure to WASH related GBVs. In addition, WASH related GBV awareness sessions in communities will be conducted.</narrative>
