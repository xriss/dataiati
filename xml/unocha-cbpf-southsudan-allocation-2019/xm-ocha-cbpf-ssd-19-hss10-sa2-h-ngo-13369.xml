   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Primary health care service delivery is a key component in achieving sustainable development goal on universal health care for all. The delivery of primary health care in South Sudan has been challenged by ongoing political uncertainty compounded by lack of enough trained  health personnel, medical supplies poor health financing and inadequate health infrastructure.
Nasir County in the last few months has seen influx of returnees and according to IRNA done in March 2019, there are more than 64000 returnees reported to have come from the refugee camps neighboring Ethiopia. This has therefore increased pressure on the limited health services delivered  in the county.
Flooding in the county during the rainy season also has detrimental effect on the overall morbidity and mortality. This increases Water borne diseases as open defecation practice sweeps human waste to the water points thus contaminating them hence increase in diarrhea diseases and malaria due to the conducive mosquito breeding environment brought about stagnated water. 
Immunization coverage remains very low in the country  and cold chain availability remains at 50% (UNICEF Cold Chain Mapping, 2019) and the utilization of ANC services is still very low with 4812 women attending at least one of the 4 ANC visits and only 369 attending the 4th visit in April 2019 (Health Cluster April 2019 Bulletin). This has predisposed the vulnerable children to infections from vaccine preventable infections and increased maternal mortality rates.
Referral systems in the county remains a major challenge due to poor road infrastructure and expensive water transport systems. This has negatively impacted on the service delivery of the basic health care package. 
Aweil East County is also affected by flooding during the rain season and health service delivery is hindered by long distances to the health facilities.  Low routine immunization coverage has led to Measles outbreak in the county which has increased the vulnerability of the Children under five years. 
This project therefore wishes to address this health challenges in the two counties by provision of primary health care in the counties through one Mobile Health  Unit in Burbiey  Nasir County and 2 mobile units in  Aweil East County.
The mobile health interventions will ensure delivery of basic health package which include ANC services to the  pregnant mothers, immunization services, curative consultations to vulnerable and affected populations this will include management of Acute watery diarrhea and malaria, Health education to encourage behavior change communication, and capacity building of both the health and county health department staff to improve service delivery. reproductive health services will be offered through distribution of condoms to the affected and vulnerable populations
Integration of WASH activities like improved hand washing and more training on infection prevention ad control will be prioritized to reduce cases of WASH related infections.
All the health facilities will provide growth monitoring services, and referral of the SAM and MAM cases to OTP sites and stabilization centers for management.
This Project wishes to reach 15915 individuals with life saving health interventions in Nasir and Aweil East Counties.
To ensure accountability to affected population, inceptions meeting will be conducted in the targeted location, quarterly consultative and community dialogue meeting will be conducted to introduce the project to the community, identify emerging needs and to provide feedback to the affected population.
Project staffs will be trained on DO NO HARM principle to ensure that they perform their duties in accordance with the laid guidelines
TADO has been reporting timely to the county health department and to the health cluster and this will continue to ensure that proper planning for health service delivery is done by the government and the health cluster.</narrative>
