   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Emergency Provision of mobile health interventions to vulnerable and affected populations in Nasir County.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">South Sudan has been hard hit by the political crisis since December 2013 and continues to struggle with the crisis. This has affected the delivery of essential health services to the vulnerable populations. Recent hostilities between the host community and refugees in the Kule Refugee camps in Ethiopia has led to refugees returning to South Sudan. Nasir County is greatly affected by this ongoing influx, which requires immediate intervention. Areas most affected in Nasir County include Makak, Benytik and Lire Payams. Health service delivery remains a big concern in the county with essential health services lacking. Immunization coverage remains one of the lowest in the county with WHO projecting less than 23% immunization coverage in Nasir county. This has led to sporadic outbreaks of vaccine preventable diseases. Childhood illnesses like Malaria and Pneumonia remains a great challenge in the county. ANC services and deliveries in health facilities attended by skilled birth attendants remains very low and poor referral pathways remain a challenge to health service delivery. long distances to the health facilities is a big barrier to populations seeking health care interventions with sick people having to walk long distances and for long hours to seek health services.  This project wishes to address these issues by provision of essential mobile health services to the vulnerable populations in Nasir county.
The project will provide mobile health interventions by supporting 3 mobile clinics which will be used to deliver health services to the affected and vulnerable populations in Nasir county. The specific locations will be Makak, Benytik and Lire Payams. Integration of WASH services in the health facilities will go a long way in ensuring that WASH preventable diseases like Cholera and acute watery diarrhea are prevented.
The project will seek to improve access and utilization of essential health services.  Some of the health services to be provided in the facilities include:
	Integrated management of childhood illnesses
	Antenatal care services
	Immunization services 
	Health education and behavior change communication to improve early health seeking behaviors.
	Training of health staff on infection prevention and disease surveillance mechanisms
	Timely reporting of all health activities.
These services will be integrated with Nutrition services like screening and referring to Nutrition centers cases of acute malnutrition and also good WASH practices among the communities.
The project targets 12000 beneficiaries among this 3800 men, 4600 women, 1500 boys and 2100 girls. Out of the 12000 beneficiaries, the project wishes to target 1800 host communities, 2900 IPDs and 7300 returnees. There will be more than 60000 indirect beneficiaries to be targeted in this project. 
To ensure accountability to affected population, inceptions meeting will be conducted in the targeted location, quarterly consultative and community dialogue meeting will be conducted to introduce the project to the community, identify emerging needs and to provide feedback to the affected population.
Project staffs will be trained on DO NO HARM principle to ensure that they perform their duties in accordance with the laid guidelines.
Timely reporting will be essential and the project activities will be captured and reported in time to ensure that disease surveillance is well done and possible disease outbreaks are detected in time and responded to.</narrative>
