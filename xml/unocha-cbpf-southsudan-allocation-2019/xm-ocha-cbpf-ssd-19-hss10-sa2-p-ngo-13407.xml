   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Provision of Mine Risk Education (MRE) to Girls, Boys, Women and Men amongst Hosts, Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) and Returnee Communities in Canal/Pigi, Jonglei State &#x2013; South Sudan; to enable them Live within Safe and Secure Environments</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Explosive hazards prohibit civilians from a safe and secure environment in which they can access life-saving services, collect water, firewood or other daily subsistence needs or cultivate land or fish. In essence, landmines and unexploded ordnance (UXO) inhibit the ability of women, men, girls, and boys to meet their basic needs and access opportunities to survive. There is a critical need for risk education, survey and clearance to enhance the safety of vulnerable populations, and ensure that key transit and settlement locations are free of mine and ERW contamination. Through the survey and clearance of these items as well as the provision of mine risk education, lives will be saved and injuries will be reduced. Particular focus on implementation of activities will be in locations prioritized due to high numbers of IDPs, returnees and host communities, as well in places that have not received MA services due to conflict, insecurity, or lack of access. 
As per Protection Cluster Analysis, approximately 150 previously unknown hazardous areas, contaminated with mines and Explosive Remnants of War (ERW) are discovered each month which, compounded by the legacy of current contamination in South Sudan (nearly 27.4 million sq. m), endangers the lives of girls, boys, women and men. Mobile populations, including IDPs and displaced civilians that are returning to their places of origin, are particularly at risk of death or injury involving mines and Explosive Remnants of War (ERW). In partnership with UNDP, MTT has been providing MRE education to the hosts, IDPs and returnees in Canal/Pigi for the last three months. The signing of the Revitalised Agreement on the Resolution of the Conflict by the previous adversaries in October 2018 led to increased and steady flow of return. There is need for continuity and extension of Risk education about the remnants of war and unexploded landmines in places to which the population is returning. The returnees are taking advantage of security to rebuild their livelihoods. This project will complement and takeover from the project that ends on 30 November 2019 (11634), whose staff will be paid for 6 instead of 9 months of this project, thus avoiding duplication. Peer education will be continued across all gender and age groups. However, there will be two teams, each composed of four people. Areas of operation will clearly be demarcated. The First team is operating in Doleb, Panam, Chapnil, Obel, and Kadak or Khorfulus (5 areas) covered in the current project number 11634 ending in November 2019. There is need for continued MRE from December 2019 for the benefit of returnees. The second team will be assigned to operate in Wutlem, Wutlieth and Mareng (3 areas) bomas in Chwai, previously sealed by the conflict. They are populated more by new returnees than hosts. To reach people in all areas with key MRE messages, our teams will employ primary and secondary approaches. Primary approaches will be employed for groups most-at-risk &#x2013; community members living in or close to contaminated or areas suspected to be hazardous. Primary approach will include direct presentations in meetings. Secondary approaches will involve holding workshops with the most influential members of the community who will act as change agents. Examples are religious leaders, teachers and other opinion bearers. The outcome will be increased capacity of the target population keep themselves safe, ability to identify and report suspected objects, including areas in which they will most likely be found. The information will be shared with MRE teams who will transmit it to relevant authorities including NMAA and UNMAS for further action. The team will directly coordinate with other sub clusters like Child Protection and GBV and other clusters such as Education, WASH, Nutrition, and Health. The project aims to reach as many members of the community as possible with protection messages.</narrative>
