   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Provision of Integrated Emergency Lifesaving Healthcare Services for Most Vulnerable populations of Pibor County of Jonglei State.</narrative>

  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">United Networks for Health is an HRP partners for 2019, is a dual mandated organization that provides development and emergency response. Based on our experience in emergency respond, UNH has developed this project titled &#x201C;Provision of Integrated Emergency Lifesaving Healthcare Services for Most Vulnerable populations of Pibor County of Jonglei State.&#x201D; This project is developed following consultative meetings UNH team had with the State MOH, County Health Department, authority at different levels and affected populations.
According to the South Sudan health cluster report (2019 HNO released in October 2018), it is estimated that 70,489 (35.5%) people of Pibor (women, men and children) needs humanitarian healthcare services in 2019, the population targeted for 2019 humanitarian healthcare services is 39,474 (56%), the target for this project is 12,455 (31.6% of the target for 2019) while the remaining proportion will be achieved by the health development partner on the ground with support from SSHF.
According to the IPC result released on September 28, 2018 by National Bureau of Statistics, Pibor County is in IPC 4 in the first quarter of 2019 and this may deteriorate further during the long spell of lean season which will worsen the malnutrition situation as well the vulnerability of the affected population. The GAM rate for Pibor is also at 20.8% (SMART survey conducted in October- November 2018) which is above WHO levels hence couple with food insecurity will worsen the health indicators in the County.
Access to lifesaving healthcare services is still challenging in the Pibor county, the development partner on the ground implementing the Rapid Results Health Project (RRHP) with financial support from World Bank has not restored services in most of rural health facilities as there is no surety of financial continuity in 2019 out of the 36 health facilities only 10 are functional (Pibor CHD December 2018 report) leaving most vulnerable population with no access to essential healthcare services. Most of the vulnerable population live in the rural areas (very hard to reach) with no access to lifesaving healthcare services, EPI coverage is limited only in Pibor headquarter and major centers, no CEmONC service, IDPs are integrated in the host communities exerting pressure on the limited available healthcare services. 
UNH has strong networks in Pibor, will work together with the CHD, health partners on the ground and other actors (nutrition, protection, WASH and food security) to ensure synergies. The main objective of this project is to provide lifesaving emergency healthcare services to the most vulnerable populations of Pibor County, improve quality of life and reduce morbidity and mortality through provision of holistic health care services through mobile clinics. UNH will constitute and capacitate two mobile units (1 each in Gumuruk and Lekuangole), the team will provide selected healthcare services at the mobile clinics in hard to reach areas and also support the fixed facility at Gumuruk and Lekuangole. These teams will also participate in any Rapid Respond Mission activities that will be conducted in Pibor. The project targets the most vulnerable groups in the population (IDPs and vulnerable host commodities). Directly a total of 12,455 (1,871 IDPs and 10,584 host communities) will be reached with essential healthcare services. 1,871 IDPs- 152 men, 149 women and 791 boys and 779 girls vulnerable host communities 10,584 857 men, 844 women, 4,477 boys and 4,406 girls will benefit from this project directly. Generally the whole community in the catchment areas will benefit from the response directly and indirectly. For successful respond, UNH will require USD 100,000.06 to facilitate the response in the period of 6 months thereafter the development partner will continue with the services to ensure sustainability and provision of essential healthcare services in hard to reach areas.</narrative>
