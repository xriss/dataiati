   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Emergency School Feeding Program to Crisis-affected Children in Ayod County - Jonglei State and Ulang County - Upper Nile State</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This 8-month intervention seeks to provide school feeding and critical WASH in schools through multi-sectorial emergency response to reduce hunger and malnutrition, disease and cognitive underdevelopment to 5,745 enrolled and out-of-school children and youth (aged 6-18), support local markets and encourage female retention and spread life-saving nutrition/ hygiene in Ayod County (Jonglei) and Ulang County (Upper Nile) of South Sudan. Having achieved increased scale in 2018 maintaining it is now vital to sustain gains achieved through ended SF programs in these counties. Lunch cereal meals will be provided during school days as a coping mechanism to keep children in schools and enroll out-of-school learners on condition that they attend regularly. The intervention seeks to make schools protective against harm and insecurity to vulnerable children reduce child hunger and nutritional deficiencies at school and so elevate strain on the family food supply and open livelihood opportunities and improve learners&apos; concentration. The project will adopt WASH surveillance and nutrition screening with activities including setup/rehabs of latrines complete with hand washing facilities alongside cholera messaging and distribution of soap and purification tablets. CMD will utilize WASH core pipeline for WASH NFIs. Food procurement model will be through tendering linked to local vendors with procurement in Juba acting as a backup plan in the event of disruption or likely cost-overruns (for Ulang CMD will consider procuring in Gambella as was in SSHF SA1 2017 and transport using boats. CMD will engage LOGS cluster for delivery through Bor and Rumbek hubs and where possible utilize dry season to transport through roads. The programme will engage incentivised local caregivers, trained on food handling. Refresher training will be done to Youth Food Monitors and involved to assist in monitoring the food chain supply in target schools in coordination with school heads/PTAs/SMCs. Cross cutting issues such as WASH, Nutrition, cholera messaging, GBV, Health and Child protection will be integrated alongside key life-saving messaging on food crisis/ rationing and cholera prevention. Activities will be immediate, first with dry feeding on high energy bars and biscuits (HEB) as procurement/delivery of food items and feeding structures light repairs is fast-tracked. It will specifically address critical WASH gaps in 21 primary schools through rehabilitating existing water points to improve school water supply rehabilitate school latrines and hand washing facilities and promote hygiene to avert disease outbreak. This component aims to avert the spectre of contagious or infectious diseases such as cholera, TB, HIV/AIDS and even ebola. WASH in schools activities will complement school feeding programme by improving nutrition through hygiene promotion. 1,724 learners aged 6-18 (37% female) are targeted in 6  schools of Ulang, a county already flagged as being one step below famine (IPC Phase 5) acute food insecurity where 52% population is reported as spending entire days without food. 4,021 beneficiaries are targeted in Ayod schools supported through SSHF SA1 closed in December 2018. The proposed approach prioritizes counties not covered by WFP school feeding programme and will target functional schools in hard to reach areas (whereas WFP school feeding programme schools only supports schools which are accessible by road). CMD&#x2019;s solid experience in undertaking large-scale interventions and its unparalleled country-level knowledge and relationships at the grassroots will guide this intervention. The project will utilise ongoing EiE, WASH and Nutrition interventions in Ayod use shared staffs to reduce on costs. CMD has an ongoing EiE intervention in Ulang through other donors supporting teachers&apos; incentives, learning and teaching supplies. Lessons learnt from previous SF interventions will inform our actions and strengthen implementation.</narrative>
