   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Regional Emergency Response - COVID-19 and human rights
The intervention seeks to strengthen OHCHR&#x2019;s capacity to prevent and respond to serious violations of international human rights and humanitarian law, including in the context of COVID-19; and at the same time, support the wider United Nations effort to become more effective in anticipating, preventing and responding to crisis and conflict.
Two outcomes are presented for the intervention:
i) decision-makers at the global, national and regional level take preventive measures and early action to address serious violations of international human rights&#xA0;and humanitarian law, including negative socio-economic and other human rights impacts of COVID-19 response and recovery measures, with a focus on vulnerable populations:
ii) Enhanced access to early warning analysis of the human rights situation by national partners&#xA0;in impacted regions
To deliver on this commitment, OHCHR will improve how it identifies, manages, analyses and leverages human rights information to support strategic and operational decisions. This is accomplished by putting human rights officers and information management professionals in the field &#x2013; the Emergency Response Teams &#x2013; to support operations and engage with information channels in humanitarian and development as well as human rights contexts.
Targeting resources to support field presences is expected to lead to more actionable data and information, with OHCHR better able to identify emerging risks and promising practices; and provide the situational awareness required to inform the timely, evidence-based, strategic and operational decisions made by the United Nations System and Member States.&#xA0;
Contingency Fund
The intervention seeks&#xA0;to strengthen&#xA0;OHCHR&#x2019;s capacity to respond to human rights deteriorating situations currently arising from pandemic and to ensure that a Human Rights-Based Approach is integrated in all UN responses at the global, regional and country levels.
In the context of the ongoing OHCHR&#x2019;s COVID-19 response, the Contingency Fund would be used to enable the deployment of a temporary surge capacity (local recruitment/deployment of a temporary Human Rights Officer) in an OHCHR field presence (in person and/or remotely, as travel restrictions allow) to assist UN Country&#xA0;Teams/Humanitarian Country Teams.&#xA0;
OHCHR would activate the use of the Contingency Fund at the initiative of High Commissioner in response to:- Unexpected deteriorating or potentially deteriorating human rights situations- A request by a Representative of the United Nations system in a country&#xA0;- A request by an OHCHR Head of Field Presence; in support to inter-agency efforts, including during&#xA0;a humanitarian crisis.</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">OHCHR narrative reports cover the activities and results from OHCHR&apos;s Emergency Response Teams (ERTs) and the Contingency Fund (CF). The nature of emergency responses and contingency funds, which is identified by both Sida and OHCHR in the Appraisal, is that results are mainly on the output level. The planned outcomes could be out of the hands of OHCHR. Therefore, most reported results are at the output level. However, it is clear that the contributions have strengthened the information and capacity on human rights and contributed to UN Country Teams understanding and to certain extent also action in relation to human rights. 

ERT 01-11-2020 - 30-06-2021

The ERT project continued OHCHR&apos;s strengthening of its Headquarter&apos;s and Regional Office&apos;s early warning systems and prevention capacity as well as information management capacities to deliver information and analysis to inform response on the ground. Currently, there are four active ERT&apos;s deployed in Regional Offices in South-East Asia, West, Central and Southern Africa with plans of extending the ERT&apos;s to six regional offices in Central and South America in September 2021. 

The activities in South-East Asia consisted of human rights early warning, prevention and emergency response. The initial focus has been to set up systems to support human rights early warning and prevention work. Especially with focus on partners and humanitarian action. 

In West Africa, the ERT for West Africa has provided regional and country focused early warning and risk analysis. Priority areas were identified in coordination with the 16 countries covered by the Regional Office. The team created a diversified tight network with regional, local and international partners, building on and expanding the pre-existing connections of the West Africa Regional Office. 

The activities in Central Africa were taken up in June 2021. The human rights officer was recruited and has taken up functions and is currently developing the teams work plan in cooperation with the newly established macro-economist capacity. With focus on the human rights impact of COVID-19 in the region in the following 6/12 months, the ERT will alert and advise national decision-makers as well as UN agencies on specific economic and social issues connected to the pandemic. In addition, the ERT also aims to establish early warning and prevention mechanisms to react to potential human rights crises and provide  support for preventative actions. 

In the Southern African region, OHCHR has provided early warning and prevention analysis at the regional and national level for 14 countries in the region to put human rights at the heart of the COVID-19 crisis and the internal OHCHR Prevention Strategy. The ERT worked to enhance investment on economic, social and cultural rights (ESCRs), the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and prevention, including a number of political, socio-economic, humanitarian and security developments.  

Since the reporting, the new ERTs were established in OHCHR regional offices in Yaound&#xE9;, Santiago de Chile and Panama. Swedish funds contributed to this increase. In the annual appeal for 2022, OHCHR states: &quot;In 2021, ERTs led and supported the creation of prevention platforms in Zambia and the Gambia, strengthened the human rights and prevention analysis in the COVID-19 response in Central Africa, contributed to UN regional crisis risk analysis in South East Asia, and highlighted risks related to elections and the migration crisis in Central America. New ERTs were established in our regional offices in Yaound&#xE9;, Santiago de Chile and Panama, to join the ones already established in Dakar, Bangkok and Pretoria.&quot; 

As part of the Swedish support, back stopping capacity has been strengthened at Geneva which has meant that swift support has been provided in different media monitoring tools, GIS etc not least to the newly established teams. 

Contingency Fund 01-11-2020 - 30-06-2021

The activities that are highlighted for the CF in 2020 include deployment of surge teams of human rights experts for monitoring in internal conflicts and/or in elections with risk of violence or human rights violations in the countries: Guinea, Cote d&apos;Ivore, Uganda, Ethiopia, Kyrgyzstan and Nagorno-Karabakh. The total staff deployed was four male and six female staff, nine of them being RDR members.

The deployed staff arranged workshops to reinforce capacity in human rights monitoring, capacity building of the civil society and National Human Rights Institutions, established dialogue and interviewed stakeholders and political representatives as well as responding to the conflict in Ethiopia by analysing and reinforcing UN advocacy with the Government to protect civilians.</narrative>
