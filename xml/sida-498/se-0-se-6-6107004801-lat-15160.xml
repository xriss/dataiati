    <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Office of the Special Rapporteur for Freedom of Expression (OSR) at Inter-American Comission of Human Rights (IACHR) is the expert office in the region with a mandate of promoting freedom of expression and on proving expert advice to the IACHR regarding precautionary measures and petitions to Inter-American Court of Human Rights related to the protection of this right. IACHR/OSR work involves the adoption of standards for freedom of expression and right to information, its implementation in the countries of the region and journalists&apos; safety and protection including work to bring cases addressing issues of violence against journalists and impunity before the Inter-American Court of Human Rights. IACHR/OSR submits comments and recommendations to States and publishes an annual report on freedom of expression by country in the region.
Some examples of results per outcome:
Outcome 1: Increased access to international justice for journalists and victims of violations of the right to freedom of expression and to freedom of expression related to other rights, to reduce impunity regarding these crimes and to disseminate Inter-American standards on this matter.
- During the reporting period, IACHR/OSR worked to bring more cases addressing issues of violence against journalists and impunity before the Inter-American Court. In 2017-2018, the OSR supported 14 cases which were brought to the Court.
- In addition to the visits done by IACHR/OSR during 2015-2016 (Honduras, Bolivia, Mexico), the Special Rapporteur conducted three more official visits in 2017 to Guatemala, Paraguay and Mexico, in order to monitor the situation concerning violence against journalists and follow up on State recommendations, in addition to conducting trainings with civil society organisations.
- Several trainings were conducted during 2016-2018, including an online course (MOOC) for Latin American judges. 2,418 participants were admitted to the 2018 version of the online course. In the period October 2017-May 2018, the OSR, in coordination with UNESCO and national judiciary schools, organised 4 onsite trainings on the right to freedom of expression and access to public information in Panama, Honduras, Mexico and Guatemala.
- The OSR published the 2017 annual report on Freedom of Expression in the region, which drew upon more than 900 incidents of violations, illegitimate restrictions, or threats to the exercise of the right to freedom of expression.&#xA0;
Outcome 2: Established standards regarding the promotion of rights of excluded and discriminated groups in mass media, including women.
- OSR has, together with the Rapporteur on the Rights of Women of the IACHR, prepared a thematic Report on women journalists and freedom of expression which was adopted by the IACHR in October 2018. The report is based on&#xA0; a series of interviews with experts from the region on freedom of expression and gender. It focuses on the specific risks that women journalists in the exercise of freedom of expression face, and State&apos;s obligations aimed at guaranteeing this right under the Inter-American standards. The role played by other actors, such as media and NGO&apos;s, was also examined. The preliminary findings were presented at UN Commission of the Status of Women (CSW62) session in March 2018 and the report was officially launched in January 2019.
Outcome 3: Established standards and guidelines for the implementation of public policies to ensure and promote the realization of the right to freedom of expression and access to information for children and adolescents.
- A thematic report on Children, Freedom of Expression and Media has been drafted. To prepare the report the IACHR/OSR in 2017 supported and coordinated of a 3-day international seminar on freedom of expression, media and the rights of children and adolescents 360 participants attended the event, including media, journalists, academics, youth and state representatives.&#xA0;
Outcome 4: Better understanding and better protection of the right to access to environmental information promoted among judges, lawyers, public officials, and CSOs.
- Supported by the adoption in March 2018 of the Escazu Agreement (Regional agreement on acess to information, public participation and justice in environmental matters), the right to environmental information has been strengthened in Latin America and the Caribbean. The OSR was therefore able to disseminate environmental standards in different trainings focused on access to information, monitor the topic for the annual report and design a project (2018-2020) that deals specifically with the right to environmental information in the context of extractive industries. In 2017, monitoring was strengthened through several public hearings and seminars regarding access to information, the environment, and extractive industries.
Outcome 5: Recommendations and lessons learned disseminated among judges, lawyers, public officials, and CSOs; on the exercise of the right to access to information regarding cases of discrimination and violence against women, and access to justice.
- In 2017, IACHR/OSR launched a questionnaire to inform a report on the situation of access to public information and discrimination against women which was published on September 28, International Day of Access to Public Information. 9 states provided input to the report, in addition to 5 CSOs and 4 human rights institutions. The responses indicated that in many of the states unified systems of information of gender-based violence has not been put in place. The existing systems are fragmented and databases/statistics not updated. The CSOs reported also serious limitations on side of the women to access information regarding their rights to a life free from violence and discrimination despite the actions taken by the states aimed at disseminating information on the rights and providing advice to women.&#xA0;Based on the report, the Special Rapporteur issued a series of recommendations calling on States to continue to conduct campaigns on the right to public information and to train women and CSOs on the mechanisms available to make requests of information to the States.</narrative>
