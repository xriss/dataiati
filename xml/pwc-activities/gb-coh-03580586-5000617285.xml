   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Capacity Building for International Negotiation (CaBIN) is a &#xA3;6m programme funded by BEIS, with a purpose to build the capacity of the least developed and most climate vulnerable countries to participate in the international climate change negotiations process. By doing so, the programme supports a vision of a fairer, more inclusive negotiation process that ensures the meaningful participation of developing country negotiators, supporting the ambition to keep global warming to less than 1.5 degrees and reducing the prospects of rapidly escalating climate extremes and severe risks for vulnerable people and systems. The programme will take place between 2019 and 2022 and will be delivered through an alliance of subcontracted partners who will provide a range of training, advise, support and capacity building based on evidenced needs and demands of negotiators and negotiating groups. Our partners include Legal Response International, IIED, Independent Diplomat, Germanwatch, Ricardo, INTRAC, ODI, Climate Analytics and the Caribbean Climate Change Centre. In addition to tailored capacity building and logistical support, the CaBIN alliance will also work together ti generate learning on effective support to negotiators, enhance communication efforts and report on the impact of the programme to BEIS. PwC is the lead contract holder, responsible for programme design, programme and fund management and supporting the programme&apos;s external engagement. The unique value of PwC services to BEIS include the efficient allocation of funding based on needs, and an independent delivery mechanism protecting the political neutrality of the UK government funding in an otherwise political space.</narrative>
