   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Syrian crisis had resulted in over one in three schools being damaged, destroyed, no longer accessible or occupied for shelter and other purposes. In public schools in certain locations such as in northern  Hama,  Homs and  Dara&quot;a, classroom sizes reach 150 students per teacher.
One of the main sector plans is the expansion and rehabilitation of protective and safe learning environments including gender-sensitive WASH facilities in school and school inclusiveness for children with disabilities by integrated their especial needs in rehabilitation works such as installing ramps and defined spaces in school yard. In addition to provision of school furniture, supplies, and water tanks.
 The protracted crisis in Syria has resulted in over 5.8 million school-aged children and over 120,000 teachers to be in need of education assistance inside Syria, 61% of whom are in acute and immediate need. 
Children who are out of school face increased protection risks including child marriage and the worst forms of child labor. For this reasons GOPA-DERD will arrange Back to Learning campaign in the target areas in order to engorged parents to send children to schools.
The project&#x2019;s main goal is to provide support to vulnerable persons by addressing the most critical humanitarian needs. This project will support people in need, especially school-aged children via improved access to safe and protective spaces through small-scale rehabilitation of schools in the targeted areas through rehabilitation, equipping and furnishing of partially damaged existing schools in Homs and Deir az Zur, and to improve the learning spaces through implementing small-scale rehabilitation, including gender-sensitive/inclusive WASH and disabilities facilities and ensure receiving safe and adequate access to safe educational environment.
GOPA-DERD is currently implementing a project to rehabilitate schools in cooperation with the SHF from 1st Standard Allocation 2020. Unfortunately, due to the several changes in the exchange rates of the Syrian pound in the central bank of Syria and the local market, GOPA-DERD was not able to achieve the project&#x2019;s target for six schools due to the sudden increase in prices for the rehabilitation materials in local markets.
Therefore, in coordination with the education sector and SHF, the project target was modified to target only three schools, and the rehabilitation works for those schools are ongoing, but the rehabilitation works for other schools are on hold till GOPA-DERD can secure additional funds, even though GOPA-DERD obtained government approvals for these schools and prepared the necessary BOQs related.
The project is planned to target two schools with an estimated number of 1000 students to be targeted in the following areas:
1- Schools pending from previous project (16863) 2020 1st Standard allocation.
-	One school in Deir Ba&apos;alba Shamali - Home neighborhood Code are N 0237(Dirar ibn al-Azwar school for elementary and secondary stage). The school consists of 16 classrooms with two administration rooms that need rehabilitation works, in addition to rehabilitate of WASH facilities.
-	One School in Deir-ez-Zor / Tashreen_ Harabesh (admin4 Pcode N0427) ( Mahmoud Batman School for  elementary and secondary stage). this school consists of 18 classrooms with 6 administration rooms that need rehabilitation works,

GOPA will engages the community in work plan and project objective and review of the project as their suggestions will be consider.
During the meeting, GOPA team will explain to beneficiaries project work plan, project objective, complaints mechanism and encourage families to send their drop out children to school in order to join schools in the next academic year.
before completing the rehabilitation works and equipping of the schools, back to learning campaign  will be prepare in coordination with MoE and local communities in order to encourage the communities to send their children to school in coming</narrative>
