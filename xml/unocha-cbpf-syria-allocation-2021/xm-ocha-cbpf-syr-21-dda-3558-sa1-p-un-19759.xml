   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Provision of Comprehensive GBV Prevention and Response Services to the Crisis Affected Women and Girls in Dara&#x2019;a and Quneitra Governorates.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Through this project, UNFPA proposes to sustain the provision of life-saving comprehensive Gender-Based Violence (GBV) services, including GBV case management, and psychosocial support to women and girls at risk, including GBV survivors at the two existing Women and Girls Safe Spaces (WGSS) in Daraa and Quneitra respectively. Furthermore, at the two WGSS, UNFPA seeks to sustain the provision of training programs for women and young mothers aimed at building life skills including sessions on basic business and financial management.  Vocational training will be tailored to the needs of women including the provision of startup kits for women who will have successfully completed a full cycle of the training program. UNFPA has in the recent past completed a vocational training survey and put together a guidance note which will guide the organization and coordination of the training at the two WGSS. In addition, UNFPA seeks to organize integrated information dissemination sessions on selected topics in GBV, Reproductive Health, Menstrual hygiene. The information dissemination sessions will focus on emerging GBV risks and available services targeting women, girls, men and boys. The sessions will be organized at the two WGSS and also by the integrated GBV mobile reaching the surrounding communities in order to promote access to GBV services. An integrated GBV/RH mobile team comprises a gynecologist, midwife, GBV case worker, PSS worker and a team of community outreach assistants. Services delivered include GBV case management, Antenatal and postnatal care services Individual and group information dissemination sessions for all targeted groups (men, women, and adolescent boys and girls). Through this project, UNFPA specifically proposes to procure winterized kits for vulnerable women, girls, men and boys in both Daraa and Quneitra. The kits will not only be provided for protection during the harsh winter season but will also serve as entry points for the provision of integrated GBV and RH services through information dissemination sessions during distributions. Furthermore, UNFPA seeks to promote the wellbeing, dignity, and resilience of pregnant and lactating women (PLW) through the provision of monthly e-voucher in partnership with the (WFP), enabling 5,000 PLW (3,000 in Daraa and 2,000 in Quneitra), including women living with disabilities to purchase hygiene items of their choice from selected vendors in the two locations. The CVA aligns with ongoing GBV interventions in these locations where 2-supported WGSSs provide a wide range of GBV services mentioned above. UNFPA will distribute messages on available GBV and SRH services, COVID-19 infection prevention, and on seeking medical treatment for COVID-19 symptoms. In case of disclosure of GBV incidents, safe and timely referrals will be provided to UNFPA-supported WGSS in the specific governorate, to access comprehensive GBV prevention and response services, including mental health and psychosocial support (MHPSS) and clinical management of rape (CMR) as needed. Beneficiaries are individual pregnant and lactating women from the WFP 2021 operational plan meeting the following selection criteria: are beneficiaries of WFP&#x2019;s General Food Assistance, targeting food insecure households are pregnant or lactating, certified by proof of pregnancy or an official birth certificate confirming the infant is under six months of age and have not previously benefited from the program. Based on the current US Dollar (USD)-Syrian Pound exchange rate, $6 per month is added to each WFP e-voucher for hygiene items and paid in Syrian Pounds this rate may fluctuate as the minimum expenditure basket (MEB) survey, conducted quarterly, is used to determine the USD rate. With the current economic volatility in Syria, flexibility is needed to ensure beneficiaries can secure the supplies they need.</narrative>
