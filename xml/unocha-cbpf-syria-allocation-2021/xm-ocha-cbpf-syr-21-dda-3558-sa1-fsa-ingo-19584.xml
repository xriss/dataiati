  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The food security situation in Syria has steadily worsened over the past three years. Today, two out of three Syrians are in need of some form of food and agricultural assistance, with an additional 1.8 million at risk of falling into food insecurity. Based on current COOPI experience accrued in southern Syria in Food Security and Agriculture (FSA) sector, the present intervention will address the worsening of the humanitarian situation in the identified area of Rural Damascus Governorate. The proposed action will contribute to the Humanitarian Response Plan (HRP) specific objectives SO1 &#x201C;Provide life-saving and life-sustaining humanitarian assistance to the most vulnerable people with an emphasis on those in areas with high severity of needs&#x201D; through distribution of 700 unconditional restricted food vouchers over the 8-months period with the value of 140.000SYP  per month. The value of the voucher is calculated based on recommendation of FSA sector and it is 70% of MEB food gap which is recommended for long-term distribution. 
The most vulnerable households in two target sub-districts: Markaz Darayya (severity scale 3) and  Az-Zabadani (severity scale 4 ) will be supported with unconditional restricted vouchers in order to have an access to variety of food and cover food gap of MEB during the period of 8 months. The project will ensure immediate and consistent access to food. In addition, project will positively affect the local economies by increasing demand for food and through promoting community economic opportunity and the participation of village shops in the voucher scheme.
The project targets Moderately food insecure households for monthly life-sustaining assistance, The project will focus on the most vulnerable households (HHs), especially women headed HHs, HH with elderly people, PwD, vulnerable returnees, families with high number of children, IDPs, etc. HH with significant food consumption gaps or marginally able to meet minimum food needs only with irreversible coping (Food Consumption Score: 28.5 &#x2013; 42, Income/Expenditure Share: 65% &#x2264;75%).
The distribution will be according to the sector recommendation of the feeding period of 30 days and a minimum of 8 distributions to the assessed same food insecure households, meeting a minimum of 70% daily kcal intake, through the food voucher modality, as more dignified form of assistance. The list of items available to be procured will be printed on the voucher and will include items recommended by Food Security Sector for meeting a minimum of 70% daily kcal intake, list will include as well items recommended for supplementary food assistance ensuring inclusion of the needs for the most vulnerable people such as children, Pregnant and Lactating Women, wD and vulnerable elderly to receive access to supplementary food assistance for the top up enhancing dietary diversity and access to fresh food.
In order to evaluate HH food security improvement, COOPI will use following FSA indictors:
- House demographic indicators during baseline survey
- Vulnerability status of household members during baseline survey
- Access to income during baseline survey
- Food security indicators, through conducting Coping Strategy Index, Food Consumption Score and Household Hunger Scale
During selection process, beneficiaries will be selected through referral of the beneficiaries lists by the SARC and local communities/municipalities. Before the distribution COOPI team will conduct cross check of the referred beneficiaries in coordination with SARC through house-to-house visit. Prior distribution, baseline for indicators will be collected simultaneously with the first round of food consumption score and coping strategy index survey. In addition through Post Distribution Monitoring upon each distribution, COOPI will evaluate impact of food consumption. Through active beneficiaries feedback and participation, quality and the level of satisfaction of the provided assistance will be evaluated.</narrative>
