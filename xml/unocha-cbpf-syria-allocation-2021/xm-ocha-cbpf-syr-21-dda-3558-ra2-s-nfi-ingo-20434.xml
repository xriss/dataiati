   <narrative xml:lang="EN">800 affected population in Shaar Aleppo city live in dignity in 150 rehabilitated damaged houses</narrative>

  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The 2nd RA Objective is to Support protection against winter by addressing the returnees&#x2019; needs who reside in damaged housing that lack the main elements of protection from harsh weather conditions, coupled with the Shelter SO: Reinforce an enabling protection environment and community cohesion by improving housing and related community/public infrastructure.
Rescate designed this project to rehabilitate 150 damaged houses to meet the dire needs for shelter intervention in Shaar area. Rescate return to the same area is not only for listing it on the priorities of the Governorate, but also due to the long-required procedures for obtaining approvals if the intervention is in rural areas. It might take more than 6 months which is RA length. 
MOLAE divided Shaar to 3 zones, 1st amp 2nd include 3,000 houses and ~18,000 residents, the 3rd includes 2,000 houses and ~12,000 residents.
Based on severity 4/Jabal Saman, PiN for shelter and NFI: 5.88) and population disaggregation mainly to IDPs, and returnees, most of them suffer lack of the main elements of protection from harsh winter. This need is exceptionally urgent with winter approaching. The significant shortage of fuel as a means to heat homes across the country and deteriorated economic conditions which have hampered household ability to seal houses compound vulnerabilities including caring for the elderly, children, and people with disabilities.
Rescate has targeted 605 houses in the 1st zone with Damaged houses rehabilitation under shelter cluster, and due to the huge needs in the other zones, Rescate is planning to target the 2nd zone to ensure integrated intervention in the area to facilitate living conditions for many returnees families with dire need due to the exasperated expensive rehabilitation costs to support the affected population with living costs due to lack of jobs and day/work.
The targeted population in Shaar are suffering major destruction in their houses as a result of 5 years conflict, the deteriorating socio-economic situation due to the huge inflation in the Syrian economy, which is exhausted by the sanctions, as well as the  devaluation of the Syrian currency. COVID-19 lockdown has deepened the economic impact of this conflict on the vulnerable inhabitants, especially the low-income people. As a result, most of the returnees do not have the sufficient solvency to rehabilitate their damaged houses. Therefore, most of them are either hosted by other families, or have rented houses in other districts, which indirectly effect the inhabitants of these districts. The houses in Shaar suffer from fully or partially wrecked walls and concrete damages.
Moreover, most of the houses have no or damaged doors and windows due to the conflict in the area.
The fresh water and the sewage networks in the houses are fully or partially damaged and there is no resilience means to withstand water rationing like water tanks.
Besides, some of the houses are burned and have damaged walls and ceiling plasters. The electricity networks are also heavily damaged in most of the houses.
Rescate is planning to target 150 with damaged houses rehabilitation activity to:
 Enhance the return movement for the people in Shaar.
 Involve the returnees and inhabitants in the rehabilitation works which will be a short job opportunity.
The intervention is planned to be sustainable rehabilitation as the original design of the houses and the common areas to become safe and provide essential protection, privacy and mostly protection from winter conditions for the most vulnerable people by using good materials and best practices in implementation under Rescate supervision.
It is worth mentioning that Rescate has intervened in 390 damaged houses in the area since 2019 and 215 are included in the ongoing project in partnership with UNOCHA-SHF.</narrative>
