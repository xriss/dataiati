   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project main goal is to contribute towards the resilience and cohesion of communities and households by improving housing in the targeted communities through rehabilitation of damaged apartments or providing emergency shelter kits in Rural Hama, Rural Daraa, Rural Lattakia, and Tadmor

The project aims to support to sustainably rehabilitate housing to affected and returned families in the most vulnerable areas. The response modalities used will include in-kind and direct assistance to implement small-scale rehabilitation works for private apartments of returnees and affected people in the targeted areas.
Since the con ict in Syria before nine years most of the population has been forced to the flee their homes often multiple times which affected the quality of life and exposed them to multiple risks and violations of their rights, there have been countless deaths and devastating injuries, illness and no humanitarian dignity.
These results are obvious particularly in areas that are receiving newly returnee families. Despite the large destruction and damage to facilities and buildings, an active returning movement of IDPs has been noticed to the project target areas.

GOPA is currently implementing a project to rehabilitate apartments in cooperation with the SHF from 1st Standard Allocation 2020 also in rural areas, Unfortunately, due to changes in the exchange rates of the Syrian pound in the central bank and the local market, GOPA was not able to achieve the project&#x2019;s target of rehabilitation of 275 apartments due to the high price for the rehabilitation materials in local markets..
Therefore, in coordination with the shelter sector and SHF, the project target  was modified to target only 175 apartments, and the rehabilitation works for those 175 apartments are on going. but the rehabilitation works for remaining100 apartments are on hold till GOPA can secure additional fund although GOPA obtained government approvals for these apartments and prepared the necessary BOQs related.
