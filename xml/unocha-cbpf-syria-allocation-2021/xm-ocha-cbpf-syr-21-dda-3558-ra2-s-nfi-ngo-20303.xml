   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Enhancing the provision of winter clothing to the most vulnerable social groups in Aleppo and its countryside</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">During the Syrian crisis this year is considered to be the most difficult economic conditions that the country is experiencing, especially with the spread of the Corona pandemic (COVID-19), people suffer from a severe need for many of the basic necessities of life, and with the approaching of winter the family&#x2019;s needs increased, such as: winter clothes, blankets, fuel for heating etc....., those needs have become a huge heavy burden on the population especially in the countryside, where the people are new returnees and they don&apos;t have enough clothes and blankets for the winter.
Vulnerable families stayed in partially damaged houses are more endanger to winter conditions and these houses often provide little protection from chilly cold weather.
Our staff has become a qualified and has excellent experience in dealing with SHF, through a number of projects,  and in the way of work, communication, implementation mechanisms, and reporting.
Where we implemented a number of projects with SHF, in the last one the number of beneficiaries reached about 30000, that is, we have a good ability to implement projects in an excellent manner and in accordance with legal principles.

This project aims to distribution of essential and critical winter and core NFIs through vouchers kind to approximately (4000) beneficiaries

Mechanism of Action:
During the first month of the project, detailed assessment of the actual needs (of the rural population, as most of the beneficiaries in the eastern areas of the city have been evaluated by the charity) will be carried out, as the Social Evaluation Committee consists of four persons (each two as a team) who will conduct the assessment and determine the need through one month based on conditions and criteria that will be adopted in order to provide the services.
In order to provide services as quickly as possible, the charity has a large number of people registered at the eastern areas of the city, their social status has been studied, and they are: widows, orphans and people with special needs, who are among the most vulnerable social groups.

Then, based on the evaluation, the beneficiaries will be divided into three segments (men, women and children &#x201C;boys amp girls&#x201D;), each segment will have a special kit that includes some winter clothes suitable for it.
The vouchers method will be used, which will be distributed to the beneficiaries (each one according to his segment) to receive clothes from suppliers.
Of course the cash vouchers will be strictly defined in terms of the type of cloths, number, place of suppliers, etc... and will be distributed according to 3 kits (detailed in the budget category), Note that the contents of each clothing kit have been selected according to priorities of 	2nd Reserve Allocation 2021.
The beneficiaries who received the  cash voucher will be visited to get their feedback by the evaluation committees in March and April.</narrative>
