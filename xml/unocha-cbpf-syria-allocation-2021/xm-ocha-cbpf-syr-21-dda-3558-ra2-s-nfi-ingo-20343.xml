   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Winterization Recovery Assistance for People in need (WRAP)</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Winterization Recovery Assistance for People in need (WRAP) project will target 2,832 HHs consisting of approximately 14,160 individuals   (2,125 men, 4,249 women, 3,895 boys, 3,891 girls, including young children, children, adolescents, young adults, middle-aged adults and older adults, from which approximately 2,125 will have a disability) with winterization assistance. A voucher methodology will be used to provide the necessary items to protect households from the cold winter months in the governorates of Rural Homs and Idlib. Vouchers will be redeemable for a variety of items recommended by the NFI sector including winter clothing, winter jackets (males and females), fleece blankets, plastic sheets and boots. Vouchers will be redeemed from local vendors who will be selected based on availability of items, quality, cost, accessibility and located close to the targeted population.

Targeted areas in Idlib are Tama&#x2019;anah with total severity score 3 and winter severity index of 5, and Khan Sheikhoun which was identified through field visits and has a severity score of 3 and is located next to Tama&#x2019;anah. In both these locations, ADRA has an active presence through the ongoing distribution of water tanks and is well placed to provide the required assistance. 

In Rural Homs, the WRAP project will prioritize Al Qaryaten (with an overall severity score of 4 and a winter severity index of 6) as well as Mahin (with a total severity score of 4 and a winter severity index of 5). 

ADRA has access to the targeted areas through other interventions including:
- Qaryaten: Livelihood activities and school rehabilitation.
- Mahin: Health center rehabilitation and water tank distribution.

Beneficiaries will be selected based on vulnerability assessment prioritizing Female Headed Households (FHHs), people with disabilities (PwDs), elderly people and people with health concerns. 

Coordination has taken place with Shelter/NFI sector office in Damascus and sub-sector office in Homs governorate, assuring no overlap with partner&#x2019;s interventions and ensuring that proposed locations are identified as a priority. ADRA also coordinated with SARC, who were present during needs assessment field visits to the targeted areas, and with key persons in areas including potential beneficiaries and local authorities.

ADRA is currently working in the targeted locations and has experience in both the NFI sector providing winter clothes and blankets in Hama and Rural Damascus in the initial stages of the crisis and has significant experience in the establishment and implementation of a voucher system, providing food vouchers to over 10,000 HHs for 8 months in Homs and Rural Damascus in 2020/21 as well as ongoing programming in Homs for 658 HHs. The project is included in the HRP under code HSYR20-SHL-179193-1.</narrative>
