   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Project title: Ensuring safe drinking water to the vulnerable people in El Hassakah city</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project consists in providing safe amp sustainable drinking water to the host community and IDPs centers in Hassakah city in NES and in western and northern part of Rural Aleppo.
NES:
Starting in Sept 2019 as per what is called Turkish offensive attack on north east Syria, It was reported that more than 165,000 IDPs left their home fleeing the conflict from the villages between Ras Al Ain and Derbasia (two towns in North East Syria). Some of 70,000 children affected by the fight were among the IDPs. The IDPs main destinations were Hassakah city and Tel Tamer town. 
The water source of Hassakah city is a pumping station called Alouk pumping station (Alouk is a village with a distance of 70 km from Hassakah located at the Turkish-Syrian borders). The station completely stopped on 9th of Oct 2019 as result of the volatile security and damages in the power lines. UNICEF in cooperation with WASH partners in NES succeeded, that time, to conduct the needed repairs and reoperate Alouk delivering water to Hassakah city. However, Alouk has been examining frequent pumping stoppages, since the said date, resulting from lack of maintenance, unreliable powers source, lack of fuel, security concerns preventing the operation team from operating the station or using the water as a weapon of war. Duration of the stoppages were significant and lasted for few weeks.    
During Alouk stoppages,Hassakah population suffered the water shortages with water share less than 10 l per capita per day. Hassakah is accommodating most of the fleeing IDPs in more than 25 IDPs shelters. Thus, more burden has been put on the water system. 
Alouk pumping station located at the front line and susceptible to unpredictable damages. This fragility of Allouk station along with existing IDPs camps in Hassakah governorate which depends on water trucking. has been complicating the water shortage/demand in Hassakah.
As Alouk station operation is irregular and fragile and the ground water in Hassakah is saline, UNIEF is suggesting an alternative mid-term response to install 9 reverse osmosis units in Hassakah city. 
The ROs will work as a contingency measure in the city to accommodate the needs of the IDPs and to partially substitute the deficit in Alouk&#x2019;s water production. The RO stations will directly provide 65,514 individuals including 8,112 people with disabilities with safe drinking water. Most of the beneficiaries are women and children.
Northern and western of Rural Aleppo:
The conflict in Afrin resulted in displacement of 132,300 IDPs most of them are women and children settled in collective shelters and IDPs camp/informal camps in Nqerin, Tal Refaat and the surrounding villages like El Shahba where Fafin camp is located. Moreover, due to the intensive fight in Idleb and northern part of rural Hama approximately 23,736 IDPs fled the said locations and settled in the western part of Rural Aleppo particularly in ATareb and the adjacent villages.
Currently, UNICEF is conducting water trucking to meet the minimum humanitarian drinking water needs of the abovementioned IDPs and suggests to continue this intervention alleviate the suffer of the targeted IDPs/their host community and mitigating the risk of water borne diseases outbreak. The proposed intervention is to truck 36,541.00 m3/month of drinking water, for a duration of 6 months, to the benefit of 69,185 individuals including 6,918 people with disabilities.
It is worth mentioning that the severity scale in the targeted locations is 4 out of 5. 
Implementing the suggested activities will ensure availability of lifesaving drinking water services to prevent WASH-related morbidity and mortality among the population in the targeted area. At the end of the project some of 134,699, most of them are women and children, will have access to at least 15 l/P/day of safe drinking water.</narrative>
