   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Providing access to safe and inclusive education in collective shelters and communities in Hama and Homs.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The overall objective of the project is to increase equitable access to quality education in a safe and protected environment for crisis affected children and youth in Hama and Homs Governorates of Syria. 
The proposed intervention targets 851 children in 9 collective shelters in Hama and Suran sub-districts of Hama, and 1389  children in 3 locations in Hama (Madiq Castle, As-Saan, Eastern Bari) and 1 location in Homs (Tadmor) that have high numbers of returnees and more returnees are expected in the months to come. In addition, there has been an influx of IDP&#xB4;s from Idlib. 
The proposed action will provide access to education for 2.000 children who are either already out of school (OOSC), or at risk of dropping out of school. This will be done by delivering age and grade appropriate catch-up and remedial classes, using MoE approved content, including the accelerated curricula B. The selection of beneficiaries will address gender and disability considerations and seek to integrate children who lack legal documents and identification. To support access to education, 2240 children in targeted localities will benefit from school kits, students kits and hygiene kits in order to prevent them for dropping out of education. To identify the OOSC and to bring most vulnerable children back to education, the project will utilise Back to Learning Campaign and Cash for Education (CfE) modality. CfE will be used for a small group of children and their families who are missing schools due to poverty and child labour. This activity will be carefully monitored in terms of cost-effectiveness and will generate data and knowledge for future programs. 
Quality of education will be reinforced through this intervention by ensuring that teachers receive a training before they engage with remedial or catch-up classes. These trainings are based on INEE&#x2019;s Teachers in Crisis Context (TiCC) training package, intended for underqualified teachers in crisis contexts. TiCC includes modules on planning for teaching, teaching strategies, classroom management, special needs of girls and boys in learning environment and inclusive learning. Teachers will also receive trainings in child safeguarding and key child protection related themes such as GBV. A total of 52 teachers will be trained during the course of this project.
Protection considerations will be strongly mainstreamed in the proposed project. Safe, physical school environments will be created through rehabilitation of 60 classrooms and 25 WASH facilities in 4 schools. The rehabilitations will ensure that currently overcrowded schools will have an adequate number of safe, equipped classrooms and disability inclusive, gender segregated WASH facilities. The equipment of classrooms and facilities will take into account the specific requirements imposed by COVID-19. The project builds protective environment by supporting the psychosocial well-being of conflict affected children. Teachers will receive training in understanding the fundamentals of PSS to enable them to identify symptoms of distress in children and support their further referral for support. A referral services and pathway mapping will be conducted together with the school community to enable this. Interactive and participatory protection events will be organised in each school and shelter on key topics - early marriage and GBV, Child labour, ERW and COVID-19. 
The risk of spread of COVID-19 will be mitigated through distribution of hygiene material including soap, sanitizers, gloves and masks. Pictured hand washing posters will be provided and placed in key locations near hand washing facilities. Disinfectant will be provided for classrooms to ensure the environment stays clean. In case of school closures due to COVID-19, teaching will be provided to students using remote methods.</narrative>
