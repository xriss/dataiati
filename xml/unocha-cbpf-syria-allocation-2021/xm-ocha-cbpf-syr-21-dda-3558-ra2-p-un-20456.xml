   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Through this project, UNFPA proposes to expand the provision of life-saving comprehensive Gender-Based Violence (GBV) services, including GBV case management, and psychosocial support to women and girls at risk and GBV survivors through establishment of Women and Girls Safe Space (WGSS) in Al Hassakeh Governorate, in Yarobeah. The project will particularly focus on Al Yaroubiya and Al-hol Sub district in Al Hasakeh governorate due to the fact that there are extremely limited protection services.  Furthermore, through the WGSS and Integrated RH/GBV Mobile Teams (IMTs), UNFPA seeks to establish the provision of training programs for women and young mothers aimed at building life skills including sessions on basic business and financial management. Vocational training will be tailored to the needs of women including the provision of startup kits for women who will have successfully completed a full cycle of the training program. UNFPA, in the recent past, has completed a vocational training survey and put together a guidance note which will guide the organization in coordinating  the training at the  WGSS. In addition, UNFPA seeks to organize integrated information dissemination sessions on selected topics in GBV, Reproductive Health, Menstrual Hygiene Management (MHM). The information sessions are intended to increase the awareness of the community on GBV, RH and MHM and informing them about the existing services, the benefits of reporting incidents of violence to the nearby facilities and time sensitivity of service provided to incidents of sexual violence. The information dissemination sessions will also focus on emerging GBV risks targeting women, girls, men and boys. The sessions will be organized at the WGSS and by the integrated GBV mobile reaching the surrounding communities to promote access to GBV services. An integrated GBV/RH mobile team comprises a gynecologist, midwife, GBV case worker, PSS worker and a team of community outreach assistants. Services delivered by the IMTs include GBV case management, Psychosocial support, Antenatal and postnatal care services Individual and group information dissemination sessions for all targeted groups (men, women, and adolescent boys and girls. Furthermore, UNFPA seeks to promote the wellbeing, dignity, and resilience of pregnant and lactating women (PLW) through the provision of monthly e-voucher in partnership with the (WFP), enabling 29,400 PLW in all Al Hassakeh Governorate, including women living with disabilities to purchase hygiene items of their choice from selected vendors in all Alhasakeh governorate. The CVA aligns with the proposed GBV interventions in these locations where the WGSS will provide a wide range of GBV services mentioned above. UNFPA will distribute messages on available GBV and SRH services, MHM, COVID-19 infection prevention, and on seeking medical treatment for COVID-19 symptoms. In case of disclosure of GBV incidents, safe and timely referrals will be provided to UNFPA-supported WGSS in the specific governorate, to access comprehensive GBV prevention and response services, including mental health and psychosocial support (MHPSS) Beneficiaries are individual pregnant and lactating women meeting the following selection criteria: are beneficiaries of WFP&#x2019;s General Food Assistance, targeting food insecure households are pregnant or lactating, certified by proof of pregnancy or an official birth certificate confirming the infant is under six months of age and have not previously benefited from the program. Based on the current US Dollar (USD)-Syrian Pound exchange rate, $8 per month is added to each WFP e-voucher for hygiene items and paid in Syrian Pounds this rate may fluctuate as the minimum expenditure basket (MEB) survey, conducted quarterly, is used to determine the USD rate. With the current economic volatility in Syria, flexibility is needed to ensure beneficiaries can secure the supplies they need</narrative>
