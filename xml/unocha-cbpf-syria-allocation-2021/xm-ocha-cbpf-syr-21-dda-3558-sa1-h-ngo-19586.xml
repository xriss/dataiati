  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">According to HNO 2021 reports, areas which located on  rural of  Homs including (Al-Dar-ALKaberah, Farqalas ,Qaryatein and Maihn) are considered ate high severity of needs due to low availability of basic services while most of health facilities are partially damaged or out of service on the mentioned areas . These locations also typically have overburdened and weak health systems and lack sufficient primary and / or secondary health care, in addition to poor education options (overcrowded schools), poor and damaged water and sewage networks as well as limited livelihood opportunities. the previous violence actions and harsh living conditions result in a very low quality health environment and causes health declines of individuals suffering from those cruel events. On the other hand, host communities, IDP&apos;s, and returnees to Rrural of Homs are lacking livelihoods or any income resources. Thus, they can&#x2019;t recover from health declines they are facing they can&#x2019;t even meet their basic needs. In addition, the disturbance of exchange rate caused an unreasonable increase in medical services prices, especially, that many governmental  medical facilities are out of service as mentioned before, while the demand on these services is in increase. All the aforementioned factors caused a massive flow of individuals seeking for medical support.

During 2020, Lamset Shifa have conducted many Cooperative activities with SHF and World Health organization  to provide patients with primary and secondary health services  in towns and cities of rural of homs, during 2020 and the last four months Lamset Shifa was served more than  54,000 beneficiaries with many type of medical services  including medical consultations and medication on child health, internal and chronic diseases and RH in addition to MHPss ,surgical interventions and Dialysis sessions.  services through 3 medical mobile teams who targeted the following areas in Northern Rural Homs: Makrumiyeh , Hashemiyeh . in addition to al-Rukban Areas of Second destinations inclusive of: Mheen, Rayyan, Al- Forqlous, houlay,and Al-Qusayr sub-districts. while the family well being center  located in Adar e continues to provide health and psychological care services in addition to free physiotherapy services to the people of the city and the neighboring villages and cities in addition to one  affiliated Dialysis center in Homs, al-Kossou which provide free dialysis sessions to the most vulnerable groups who are located at the mentioned areas.

Lamset Shifa was able to respond to all people who seek the association&#x2019;s support using the fund of the WHO and  SHF 1st standard allocation funds . Currently, due to  huge number of beneficiaries who ask for critical medical intervention , Lamset Shifa has warries and fairs that it couldn&apos;t be able to meet the needs of all people who ask the association support  because the ongoing agreement between LSA and SHF will be closed on next September 2021, taking into consideration that these needs are increasingly raising as people fail to meet their basic needs. 

The proposed project aims to Expand and ensure continuity of covering all types of lifesaving  health services for people in need, including host communities and returnees who are located in Rural of Homs especially AL-Dar al-Kaberah ,Mahin Farqalas ,Qaryatein .In order to ensure that the provided  services is efficient, patient will receive primary health care services including medical consultation, medicine and diagnosis investigation which is supported by WHO fund. Then, cases which require secondary health services will be referred to hospitals to conduct the surgeries or any other treatment recommended by the doctors. Therefore, secondary services that needed to be funded by OCHA to serve more than 1836 beneficiaries are conducted by the following:
1-Orthopedic surgeries
2- neurological surgeries.
3- artificial limbs
4 &#x2013;incubation new born.
5- General surgeries
