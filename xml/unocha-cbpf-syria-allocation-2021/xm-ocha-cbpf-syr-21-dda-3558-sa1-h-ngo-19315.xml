* - Two areas were also selected in Aleppo (Al-Batraneh Center in the Jabal Samaan area - Asaad Mahfouz Center in Al-Balura area in Al-Marjah), which are the areas most affected by the war and in dire need of medical services, as their medical centers went out of service and were equipped by the Anti-Hunger Organization, but they were closed due to a shortage of medical staff. The medical and administrative team visited the targeted areas and met the people. They also visited the Aleppo Health Directorate and contacted the health sector official in Aleppo, Dr. Fares.
* - Two areas were also selected in the countryside of Hama (Morek and Har itself), which were most affected by the war and in dire need of medical services, as their medical centers went out of service and residents began to return to them in abundance due to the availability of some services except for health. The medical and administrative team visited the targeted areas and met the people. They also visited the Hama Health Directorate and communicated with the official of the health sector in Hama, Dr. Nadia.
Each medical center will provide the following services:
1. Primary health services through three clinics. Internal medicine, gynecology and children
2. Child care services, which provide health services, including follow-up of cases of child malnutrition.
 With referral service for acute malnutrition cases to hospitals.
3. Free medicines with referrals from doctors in the same medical centers.
4- Referrals for surgeries (general, neurological, urinary, orthopedic, cardiac, natural deliveries, caesarean sections, incubators)
5. Provide one-on-one mental health care sessions with measures to prevent COVID-19, and will be made available specifically to individuals experiencing post-war trauma.
Each medical center will provide primary and secondary health care services free of charge to the residents of those areas because most of the residents of these areas are IDPs, hosts or returnees.
The main headquarters of the centers is owned by the health directorates, and it was agreed with them to provide the service inside them
