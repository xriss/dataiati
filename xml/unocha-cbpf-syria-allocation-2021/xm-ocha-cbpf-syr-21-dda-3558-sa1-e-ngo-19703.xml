Phase 3</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The purpose of this project is to ensure a proper learning environment for girls, boys, and adolescents affected by the crisis by providing sustainable access to protective learning spaces through the rehabilitation of Five damaged public schools in the Eastern and Southern Aleppo countryside.

The school environment divided into teaching and non-teaching spaces, school facilities, and premises. This proposed project goes far beyond to ensure the safety and healthiness of the learning environment to make the school a desirable place for about (1751) direct beneficiaries (51% of them are girls and women ) through rehabilitation of:
A. Teaching Spaces: classrooms (48), computer rooms (2), and laboratories (2).
B. Non-Teaching Spaces: administration rooms (13), WASH facilities with sex-segregated for girls and boys (24), roofs, and corridors.
C. School Facilities and premises: Playground (5), Schoolyard (5), access ramps (5), and boundary fence.
D. Provide (475) school desks.

Moreover, this project will work as an entry point for other program interventions as the Early Childhood Programme to help pre-school age children to get prepared for school by acquiring basic knowledge. Therefore, (4) Early Childhood rooms will be fitted in line with MoE and EDU sector directions.

Fouadi will implement this education intervention directly in line with MoE standards and EDU sector criteria to address the problems the project is trying to solve which are:

1- Shortage of school buildings. By full rehabilitation of damaged  schools in As - Safira, and Al-Bab, we will restore 3 schools to the original condition and handover to DoE and back to education services
2- The gaps in the educational needs of affected populations scattered in rural conflict-affected areas in the countryside of the Aleppo Governorate where educational needs have not fully met.

3- To overcome the problem of double shifting in schools and the overcrowding of children in classes,

4- Shortage of school desks: School desks acquire considerable importance in any school design.  Its importance is derived from the fact that students spend relatively much more time on their desks than the time spent on other school activities. Thus, an acceptable learning environment would not be achieved without comfortable desks. School desks are of high importance and can be considered as much important as the rehabilitation of the school building itself.

All activities will have coordinated closely with the MOE and local authorities/ stakeholders on the ground (DoE) and the Edu sector.</narrative>
