  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">As part of the proposed project, TGH will directly contribute to the Humanitarian Strategic Objective 3 through increasing the resilience of affected communities by improving access to livelihood opportunities and basic services, especially among the most vulnerable households and communities. This proposed project will be combined with a Protection integrated project under SHF 2021.
The proposed humanitarian response is based on TGH 3-year experience in implementing ECHO, OCHA and AICS funded education projects in Syria, and more specifically in Hama and Idlib governorates. The targeted locations were selected based on their accessibility and the severity of needs as per the 2021 Humanitarian Needs Overview (HNO) (with all the localities being rated over 3). These areas are all witnessing important returns and/or displacements movements thus increasing the level of needs. In June 2021, TGH conducted thorough field assessments in all the targeted localities (see Annex 1 &#x2013; Field assessment report) and coordinated with municipalities, SARC, DoE and other NGOs. Through the proposed intervention, TGH will intervene in 5 public schools in Karnaz, Tal Jdeed and Madiq Castle in Hama governorate as well as in Tal Maraq and Khan Shaykun in Idlib governorate.
The proposed action aims at providing safe and equitable access to qualitative education services to the most vulnerable children within public Educational institutions. The final objective of the proposed action will be to offer out-of-school children (OOSC) and children at risk of dropping out, both girls and boys, a path to (re)integration or retention in the formal education system. A total number of 1,180 beneficiaries will directly benefit from this project, among which 18 men, 33 women, 622 boys and 509 girls. This includes 1,130 children attending formal and non-formal education, 41 teachers provided with trainings and 10 community members contributing to TGH education activities. This will be achieved through with a two-fold approach, working on both the physical learning space and on the learning programmes and tools, the schedule, and the teachers&#x2019; skills/attitudes while Child Protection (CP) and Gender approaches will be mainstreamed. 
First of all, TGH will ensure that children of the targeted localities benefit from safe, dignified and quality learning environments. Based on the assessments, the targeted schools were severely damaged during the conflict. TGH will rehabilitate the schools, including gender sensitive and inclusive WASH facilities, in order to provide safe learning space for the children, with a particular attention to girls and disabled children TGH will provide school kits, student kits, recreational kits and specific stationeries to students attending NFE sessions.
Secondly, TGH will contribute to enhance Education in emergencies (EiE) through addressing the specific needs of the most vulnerable OOSC and children at risk of dropping out from formal education. As part of this project, TGH will provide school and learning material and access to non-formal education (NFE) activities. This will include remedial, catch up and Self Learning Program (SLP) classes, Psychosocial Support (PSS) sessions including risk education and recreational activities. A specific focus will be made on supporting the reintegration of children with disabilities, early married girls and child labour cases into the formal education system through the proposed action by including the community based approach with the involvement of community members as well as parents and caregivers campaign awareness. TGH will provide formal and non-formal teachers with trainings on education methods as well as PSS. .
In this proposal, the integration of Child Protection with Education in Emergencies responds to the latest recommendations (June 2021) of The Inter-agency Network for Education in Emergencies (INEE) and The Alliance for Child Protection in Humanitarian Action (The Alliance).</narrative>
