   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Phase II - Promote safe access to housing in Harasta city, Rural Damascus</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Like other neighborhoods in Harasta, Hadaeq neighborhood has been exposed to high level of damage to buildings and infrastructure, in particular the network of tunnels dug underground jeopardizes the stability of buildings above them and cause life-threating risks. In the last 2 years, the city of Harasta has witnessed a relatively significant return originating mainly from neighboring communities such as Al-Tal and Damascus. Many returnees weren&#x2019;t able to return to their original houses and forced instead to head towards less damaged parts of the city. They currently live in rented houses or are hosted by friends and relatives. Meanwhile, badly damaged neighborhoods, like Hadaeq, remain largely vacant, return is practically blocked and recovery is standstill until basic services are resumed and residential buildings are secured from life-threatening risks.
In the last quarter of 2020, OCHA generously agreed to fund a project to support the affected population in Harasta city through the proposal submitted by UN-Habitat to fill in parts of tunnels that pose a threat to residential buildings and to remove rubble from some streets in Hadaeq neighborhood.
Despite the delay in obtaining official approvals for its implementation, the project is now ongoing and is expected to be completed within a slight delay in the original timeframe.
In a recent field visit, during which communications took place with the local community and the municipality, UN-Habitat team has observed an urgent need in this neighborhood to extend the scope of intervention to complement the work being done now with the aim of achieving the original objective in promoting safe access to housing in Hadaeq neighborhood.
Therefore, UN-habitat is proposing a complementarity of the first phase with activities serving the same objective. When the proposed project is completed, accessibility to the targeted neighborhood will be improved significantly leading its original residents to return and rehabilitate their houses and shops.
The proposed intervention therefore includes the following:
 Removal of 33,000 cubic meters of rubbles and debris from streets and in front of residential buildings, (the tunnels underneath most of them were targeted in the first phase of this intervention) into the official dumpsites.
 Removal of 350 cubic meters of life-threatening building parts, hanging and falling parts from damaged buildings in coordination with the municipality, the neighborhood&#x2019;s committee and the  houses owners.
 Cleaning and rehabilitation of common spaces in 25 buildings including the entrance, stairs, staircase, etc. to secure accessibility to apartments
 Support affected families with HLP services whenever needed, including advocacy to the rightsholders on obtaining replacements for lost documents, securing rightsholders consent on activities within their respective buildings and provision and installation of a Social Tenure Domain Model system with the necessary training and support.</narrative>
