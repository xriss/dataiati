   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Surgical Operation Services for IDPs and host community in Hassakeh city</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project proposal aims to provide emergency surgical services to needy sick IDPs, as of the eligibility criteria, originated from Ras Al Ain and who are living in shelters, makeshift shelters and in urban and rural areas of Hassakeh, as well as, part of the services will be provided to the host communities. As of reports from hospital both private and governmental, in addition, to local communities in Hassakeh city, show that the proportion of poor IDPs patients with surgical emergencies who receive effective treatment is very low, and that many of those who are untreated die.
Multiple barriers to delivery of surgical services exist in Hassakeh governorate. By lack of a referral system that can bring IDPs patients to referral hospitals from health centers and dispensaries, and the financial burden of a hospital, stay for poor IDPs families. Including maintenance costs for patients and those who accompany them food, medications, and supplies not available in the hospital which may create a debt burden from which a patient may not recover.
The project proposal goal has been to:
1.	Enabling targeted IDPs to have access to safe surgical services and care when the surgery is an indivisible, indispensable and is part of health care system.
2.	Save lives and prevent disability as well death. 
3.	 Protect IDPs against catastrophic out-of-pocket expenditure due to payment for surgery.
4.	Promote local economic growth 
After consultation with the relevant health sector, private, governmental bodies as well, depending on BICA previous experiences that obtained from the implementation of similar project in 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2020 in partnership with WHO  which is used as a resource material and info gained from secondary sources, 
Surgical key procedures and policy direction services provided at hospital
1.	Provision of safe, effective amp efficient surgical services via good clinical governance.
2.	All surgeons should follow the &#x201C;Safe Surgery Saves Lives&#x201D; guideline. 
3.	Postoperative care of the patient is the responsibility of the operating surgeon.
4.	Hospitals shall consider Day Care Surgery as of high priority for simple uncomplicated cases. To ensure good utilization of Day Care Surgery, hospitals shall identify index surgeries to be done as Day Care. Utilization of this service shall be monitored as per existing guidelines.
The targeted beneficiaries are those who have been forced from their homes in Ras Al Ain and its countryside, where around 19,000 families comprise around 84,500 people have fled the insecure situation to southern safe areas mainly to Hassakeh city and its countryside, and many people families have been displaced multiple times who exposed to grave protection threats, before resorting to schools and other collective shelters, makeshift camps, and host communities who have been suffering poor conditions of livelihoods, in which they become under further pressure, who have been already exhausted due the Syrian crisis which enters its tenth year. The displaced families and the host communities continue to bear the burden of ongoing conflict which they are in need to urgent humanitarian assistance and services. This intervention aims to provide surgical operation services, when the surgery is an indivisible, indispensable and is part of health care system, to 1,092 displaced people and people from host community.
Note This project proposal has been reviewed and approved verbally by the Health sector coordinator during the Health sector meeting  that conducted on 21 June to discuss SHF 1st A. 2021.</narrative>
