   <narrative xml:lang="EN">AAH proposes an 8-month project targeting vulnerable communities in under-served locations and holistically meeting the emergency WASH needs of 60,000 individuals (single counting). 
The project main outputs 1 &#x201C;Women, men, girls and boys have access to enough safe water as per Sphere standards&#x201D; and 2 &#x201C;Women, men, girls and boys have improved access to sanitation&#x201D; align with the WASH sector&#x2019;s objective objective1: Support to water, sanitation/sewage and solid waste management systems to ensure regular services for affected people in Syria, as well as with the SHF Allocation Strategic Objectives: SO1) Provide lifesaving and life-sustaining humanitarian assistance to the most vulnerable people with an emphasis on those in areas with high severity of needs.
Access to enough safe water will be ensured through providing emergency water trucking in Hassakeh City, where AAH continues to cover the southern neighborhoods targeting up to 53,500 beneficiaries, the extent of coverage will depend on the operability of the Allok Water Station. IDPs in collective shelters will be assisted by the provision of adequate water storage containers and rehabilitation of the sanitation facilities allowing safe and dignified access to gender sensitive toilets and solid waste disposal facilities. Also, IDP in Areesheh Camp, namely in stages 3 and 4, will benefit from the installation of latrines and personal hygiene facilities (showers) which will all be connected to the sewage network and a communal septic tank (already under construction). It is estimated that up to 6,500 individuals will be relocated to stages 3 and 4 upon completion of the relocation plan conducted by the camp management (please refer to the attached needs report for more details). 
The project will support the department of water in restoring their water quality monitoring capacities through the rehabilitation and equipping of the water laboratory. Light rehabilitation of the laboratory room and necessary analytical tools and devices will be provided. 
The project will also have both a direct and indirect positive impact on food security, nutritional status, and health outcomes. Indeed, the provision of enough safe water and re-establishing functional sanitation systems directly reduce morbidities and improve food utilization. Furthermore, the targeted communities will have more income to spend on necessities other than water. AAH is the best placed organization for this response due to its experience in similar projects in the area, its full-access to the targeted locations, secured MoWR approval, its capacity to start the operations according to the work-plan set through direct-implementation. Particular attention has been paid to ensure activities implemented by AAH are well coordinated with other agencies in the area and camp management. AAH is coordinating with the WASH sub-sector in Hassakeh regarding neighborhoods covered with water trucking by WASH partners as the Allouk water pumping station operability is not guaranteed. It is likely that the actual number of beneficiaries for the water trucking activity in Hassakeh will change according to the functionality of the station which will affect the total number of beneficiaries of the project.</narrative>
