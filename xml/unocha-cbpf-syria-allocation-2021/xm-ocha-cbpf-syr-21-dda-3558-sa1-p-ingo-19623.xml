   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Enhancing capacity of affected population in Hama and Rural Damascus to prevent and mitigate protection risks</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Ten years into the Syria crisis, humanitarian needs are deepening. At the start of 2021, the number of people in need of humanitarian assistance and protection in Syria has increased by 21 per cent compared to one year ago, from 11.1 million to 13.4 million. Specifically, The protection sector and its AoRs identified 8,320,000 people in need for protection assistance in 2021. The severity of the situation, compounded by sharp reduction in purchasing power, the loss of essential livelihoods and income, mounting food insecurity, limited access to basic services, inadequate shelter conditions as well as the immediate and longer-term effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, has a disproportionate impact on women and girls and other vulnerable or socially marginalized groups (children, older persons, people with disability). Harmful coping mechanisms such as child labor including its worst forms continue to be reported in all governorates while capacities of families and communities to protect children, particularly adolescent girls and boys are hindered. The proposed action aims to improve the protection environment of the affected population by preventing and mitigating protection risks and increasing communities&#x2019; resilience. Protection needs are addressed through reinforced community-based protection structures  and GBV risks mitigation activities targeting the most vulnerable population in areas with high severity conditions (3 or above, as per HNO 2021) in Hama and Rural Damascus (RD) through a mixed static and mobile approach. This action will directly support 9,134 individuals by tackling the identified problems and address the unmet needs in the targeted unserved areas. Through the collaboration with SARC, 2 teams each composed of 8 SARC Volunteers, and 1 INTERSOS PSS Officer will be deployed and carry out activities either in outreach or in the identified Community Centers. 12 community mobilizers will be also supporting access to communities and facilitating trust building. In Hama, 1 mobile team will intervene in the sub districts of As-Saan and Oqeirbat. In RD, 1 mobile team will be deployed in the sub districts of Arbin and Zamalka. INTERSOS and SARC will jointly carry out awareness-raising sessions disseminating key protection messages as well as conduct recreational activities for children and adults serving as an entry point to identify potential protection concerns. 4 Community-Based Protection Committees (CBPCs) will be established. Based on identified needs and community acceptance, 2 CBPCs will be formed by women and girls. Particular focus will be put on GBV prevention activities actively engaging members of the community to develop strategies to challenge harmful practices and encourage behavioural change. Within this framework, CBPCs will conduct a community risk mapping and develop 4 community-led initiatives to help mitigate a protection risk in their communities. Furthermore, Women and Girls CBPCs will be involved in empowerment and life skills activities to increase self-reliance. As the proposed intervention does not foresee a dedicated case management component, protection cases identified through prevention and recreational activities will be safely identified and referred. Internally, identified cases will be referred to ECHO-funded protection activities for structured PSS programs or individual case management. In both governorates, the Action will integrate and complement activities carried out under the ongoing ECHO-funded protection intervention whereby 4 additional teams will be targeting a total of 8 sub districts in Hama and RD.</narrative>
