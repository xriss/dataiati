  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The protracted crisis in Syria continued to intensify needs in 2021 and it has been further worsened by complex and deepening socio-economic crisis and recent conflict and displacement particularly in Dar&#x2019;a governorate, where situation escalated during the summer after weeks of tensions with heavy clashes resulting in the displacement of around 38,600 people including 15,000 women, and over 20,400 children. Following the 9 September ceasefire agreement, the security situation has reportedly stabilized, but still 114 incidents, out of which 11 in As-Sanamayn were reported in period from September 9th to October 28th.
Nonetheless, the disruption to the food supply chain during the ongoing hostilities has further affected the price of essential food items in the local markets. In September 2021, the average price of WFP&#x2019;s standard reference food basket in Dar&apos;a Al-Balad reached SYP 225,169, thus exceeding the national average by 21 percent and the average price for Dar&#x2019;a governorate by 15 percent. The increase of the process of food and due to the no job opportunities in targeted area the targeted vulnerable food insecure groups, Female and child HH, elderly HH, PwD and elderly are even more food insecure.
These factors along with frequently and intense climate-induced shocks are resulting in the degradation of livelihoods, significant losses in food production and a worsening and desperate food and nutrition security situation. 

The proposed action will contribute to the Humanitarian Response Plan (HRP) specific objectives SO1 &#x201C;Provide life-saving and life-sustaining humanitarian assistance to the most vulnerable people with an emphasis on those in areas with high severity of needs&#x201D; through distribution of 380 unconditional restricted food vouchers over the 8-months period with the value of 170.000SYP per month based on the cash working group recommendation for the transfer value. 

The most vulnerable households in targeted area of As-Sanamayn (HNO 2021 severity scale 4), will be supported with unconditional restricted vouchers in order to have access to variety of food and cover MEB food gap during the period of 8 months. 

Through the project 8 distribution rounds of food vouchers to the same beneficiaries will take place in the area of highest needs to enhance food security of the most vulnerable people.  In addition, project will positively affect the local economies by increasing demand for food and through promoting community economic opportunity and the participation of village shops in the voucher scheme as more dignified form of assistance.
The project will focus on the most vulnerable households (HHs), especially women headed HHs, HH with elderly people, PwD, vulnerable returnees, families with high number of children, IDPs, etc. HH with significant food consumption gaps or marginally able to meet minimum food needs. The list of items available to be procured will be printed on the voucher and will include items recommended by Food Security Sector for meeting a minimum of 60% daily kcal intake,.
In order to evaluate HH food security improvement, COOPI will use following FSA indictors:
- House demographic indicators during baseline survey
- Vulnerability status of household members during baseline survey
- Access to income during baseline survey
- Food security indicators, through conducting Coping Strategy Index and Food Consumption Score
During selection process, beneficiaries will be selected through referral of the beneficiaries lists by the SARC and local communities/municipalities. Before the distribution COOPI team will conduct cross check of the referred beneficiaries in coordination with SARC through house-to-house visit. Prior distribution, baseline for indicators will be collected simultaneously with the first round of food consumption score and coping strategy index survey.</narrative>
