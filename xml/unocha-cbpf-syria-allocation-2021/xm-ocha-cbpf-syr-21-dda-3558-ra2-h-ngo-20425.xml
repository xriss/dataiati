  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project aims at supporting vulnerable people in Duma with essential health care services to alleviate the effect of cold weather and related diseases. Services will be provided in Duma through a static center AlTamayoz already has and through 1 mobile team. AlTamayoz center in Duma is currently providing medical consultations for pediatrics and gynecology, this project is proposing an expansion in providing medical consultations in internal medicine to support all population categories (Men, women, boys and girls) that are prone to exacerbation of health situation if not treated properly. People in Rural areas use wood as a source of heat in cold weather, this will trigger many respiratory diseases like asthma, bronchitis, pneumonia, and others &#x2026; which will have a very bad effect on children and elderly people.. 
Because Duma is considered as one of the high-density population areas in Rural Damascus, the rate of communicable disease transition is very high especially in winter where many people are gathering in one place that is almost damaged with not enough walls or windows to protect them from rain or snow or even wind
 Activities in the center will include 
- Provision of medical consultations in Internal medicine in Duma center as a complimentary service to the already existing medical consultations in pediatrics and gynecology. 
-Provision of essential medicines and PPEs for all groups and support providing nebulization sessions to patients with Asthma or bronchospasms or other respiratory diseases that are widely spread in cold weather with poor conditions 
-support referral for diagnostic procedures like laboratory tests, X-Ray especially chest X-Ray as an important diagnostic tool for upper and lower respiratory tract infections related to cold weather.
-support referrals to some surgical operations. Winter, cold weather accompanied by extreme poverty, and the very high cost of transportation are preventing many patients in Rural Damascus from getting the needed medical support or surgical operations on time. 
-support people with disabilities with needed medical assistive devices that will ease their movement and enable them getting t some sort of support to practice their daily works.
-Conduct awareness-raising sessions to disseminate information about winter communicable diseases, methods of infection control, hygiene importance, healthy practices, topics related to COVID-19 prevention and vaccination&#x2026;.etc. 
-Support antenatal care 
2 medical mobile teams are proposed to provide essential health care services to people living in areas that are far from the center in an attempt to reduce patients&#x2019; exposure to cold and bad weather conditions especially persons with disabilities, elderly, pregnant women, and children.
Services through Mobile team will include:
-provision of medical consultations in fields of pediatrics, gynecology, and internal medicine to treat all disease that commonly spread in winter.
- provision of needed medicines and PPEs
- support people with disabilities with needed medical assistive devices.
-Conduct awareness-raising sessions to disseminate information about winter communicable diseases, methods of infection control, hygiene importance, healthy practices, topics related to COVID-19 prevention and vaccination&#x2026;.etc. 
-Support antenatal care 
AlTamayoz will cover the cost of premises rent, and part of the running cost  and will secure some diagnostic tools</narrative>
