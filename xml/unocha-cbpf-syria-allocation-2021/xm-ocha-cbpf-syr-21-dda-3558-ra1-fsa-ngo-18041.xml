   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Distribution of essential food parcels to affected and IDPs families in Deir Ez- Zor</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Since the beginning of the crisis in 2011, Syria has witnessed significant challenges in the humanitarian and security situation across the country, leading to an increase of displacement that has had a negative impact on the IDPs and affected groups. Thus, countless of thousands of families left their damaged houses hoping to seek refuge in neighboring cities. In most cases, they leave without suitcases, personal belongings or money.
Several factors including international sanctions and massive inflation worsened the economy and public services and left industries and livelihoods paralyzed leaving millions of people completely aid dependent.
This project main goal is to provide life-saving essential food materials  support to most vulnerable families targeting crisis-affected households in  Deir-Ez_Zor.
This project would  provide mid term sustainable resilience to those most in need for food items assistance.
The objective is to provide highly vulnerable Syrian families affected by the crisis in Deir-Ez_Zor with food items to maintain their health, privacy amp dignity.
It is worth to be mentioned that GOPA has a previous experience in implementing such projects with OCHA in Deir-Ez-Zor(Project code 7499), other NGOs and INGOs and has access to these areas.
GOPA has an office, warehouse and two community centers in Deir-Ez-Zor.

The primary target beneficiaries will be  war-affected vulnerable families from communities. Special emphasis is placed on targeting efforts towards female-headed households, families with pregnant and/or lactating women, families with children under 2 - 5 years of age, family members who are disabled/have special needs and/or family members who are elderly.

This project will target total of 9,735 households in Deir- Ez-Zor
Deir- Ez-Zor:
Deir- Ez-Zor (C5086) 5,000 food parcels will be distributed.  
Al Mayadin C5192 3,000 food parcels will be distributed 
Ashara C5210 1,735 food parcels will be distributed.

The distribution process will completed within three phases:
1- When we will targeted any area with distribution activities, GOPA team will arrange with the local community leaders FGD meeting in order to explain the project objective to the community, and coordinate with local NGO in the area and community leader to conducts beneficiaries registration operation based on project selection criteria.
After explaining the project objectives and the selection criterias of the beneficiaries to the community leaders in each area, they will provide beneficiaries list in coordination with GOPA team,
Beneficiaries will invited to register their personal data through inform them either by communities leaders or by calling them by phone if the communication network is available. 
The distribution and registration location will be in familiar, public and accessible places that take into account the social environment of the target area (GOPA centers, mosque square, school, or municipality building,...)
The purpose of beneficiaries registration operation is to collects all personal data of the families, including the families national numbers which will helps to avoid any duplication in providing of services.
2- During the registration phase, beneficiaries will be notified of the date,time and distribution point location of assistance delivery.
