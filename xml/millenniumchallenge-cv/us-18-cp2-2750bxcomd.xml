  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The five-year compact with Cabo Verde is intended to increase household incomes by reforming two sectors identified as current constraints to economic growth: the water and sanitation sector and the land management sector. Each compact project is an important component of the Government of Cabo Verde&apos;s economic transformation agenda, focused on shifting from a reliance on foreign aid and remittances to mobilization of private sector investment and improved domestic resource management. This compact builds off the success of Cabo Verde&apos;s first MCC compact completed in October 2010 and upholds high standards for accountability transparency and achieving results.</narrative>
