   <narrative xml:lang="EN">As the focal point of the VAC Alliance in Brazil, Avina facilitates the construction of good governance of the Voices for Climate Action Program in Brazil, where it works with WWF-Brazil, Hivos and SSN (in alliance with IIEB). These efforts involve the articulation of the permanent dialogue between the allied organizations, the sharing of strategic decisions and co-responsibility in the elaboration of the demands inherent to the implementation of the Program in Brazil, which ensures the systematic alignment between the member organizations on the fundamental issues of existence of the program, in relation to collaborative management and process methodologies.
It assumes a strategic role as a catalyst agent for all efforts of member organizations to maintain co-construction and coordination among them, as the focal point of the alliance in Brazil.</narrative>

   <description>
    <narrative xml:lang="EN">The dismantling of environmental and social protection systems in the last two years resulted in the loss of civic space participation in policymaking in general, particularly for climate actions, shutting down spaces of dialogue with civil society and cutting up to 95% of the budget allocated to combat climate change. There has been a drastic decrease in civil society participation in environmental councils, which are formal institutional forums.</narrative>

mineral and hydrocarbon resources and for the use of water resources for the generation of electricity in indigenous lands and establishing compensation for the restriction of the use 
of indigenous lands. The Bill disregards the 169 Convention to which Brazil is a signatory.</narrative>

   <description>
    <narrative xml:lang="EN">The political, environmental, economic, and COVID-19 crises under Jair Bolsonaro&#x2019;s government have created a continuous flow of social and environmental setbacks that have increased deforestation and conversion in the Amazon, Cerrado and all other biomes. The destruction of nature and the systems it protects is followed by increasing threats and violence against indigenous and traditional peoples in Brazil. The Brazilian parliament and business leading corporations of high impact supply chains &#x2013; commodities and financial institutions &#x2013; have positively reacted to international pressure to halt government actions in the first two years of the current federal government. Nevertheless, the early 2021 leadership changes at the Brazilian Chamber of Deputies worsened the scenario: a pack of environmental and social setbacks is expected to move forward and institutionalise the attempts so far proposed but avoided by social pressure (WWF-Brazil 2021).</narrative>
