  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">As Jordan strives to take its place as a modern country on the world map, education takes an even greater role in advancing the future generation. As a country with few natural resources, Jordan looks to its human resources as the key element for its success and the prosperity, health, and security of its people. Despite the very high enrolment rates and the availability of access to schools across the Kingdom, the quality of education remains uneven. The average achievement in urban areas is higher than that in the rural and more remote areas. One of the major challenges of the Ministry of Education is to provide the schools with the required budget to provide students with a safe and healthy learning environment conducive to maximum learning. The schools in remote areas lack sufficient financial resources to improve the schools&#x2019; environment. With limited access to adequate electricity to operate daily services such as the use of efficient heating and cooling systems within the classrooms during extreme temperatures, lighting, connecting computers and the use of online learning, sustainable and beneficial learning environments are implausible. The large influx of Syrian refugees to Jordan since 2011 has increased the load on the Kingdom&#x2019;s already limited resources. Key drivers of tension between the host community and the refugees at the micro-level are safeguarding livelihoods and competition for income-generating opportunities; the struggle to find adequate, affordable housing; and challenges in the education sector such as difficulty in accessing adequate education as well as a deteriorating learning environment. The Syrian crisis has exacerbated long-standing structural challenges in the energy sector in terms of supply, demand and management. Securing a sustainable energy pathway for Jordan is more critical today than ever. As per the latest statistics, electricity consumption in the northern governorates (those mostly affected by the Syrian crisis) showed an additional increase of 2.3 per cent compared to other governorates in Jordan. This project aims to contribute to the overall efforts aiming at mitigating the impact of the Syrian crisis in line with the Jordan Response Plan (JRP) focusing on the Northern governorates (Mafraq, Ramtha, Irbid, and North of Balqa&#x2019;a Governorates) that are most affected by the Syrian crisis. This will be achieved through the use of Renewable Energy (RE) and Energy Efficiency (EE) systems to reduce the growing energy demands improve the learning environment in schools, increase enrollment and retention of Jordanian and Syrian students, improving the livelihood of surrounding communities and promote the social cohesion at the same time. Providing the schools with innovative techniques to reduce expenditure in energy bills and generate income will greatly relieve the ministry of the financial burden as well as allowing students, regardless of geographic location and nationality access to a safe and healthy learning environment conducive to maximum academic achievement.</narrative>
