    <narrative xml:lang="EN">Despite Timor-Leste&apos;s hydrocarbon and mineral wealth and a degree of peace and stability, this young nation still faces daunting development challenges, including the world&apos;s highest rate of stunting and Southeast Asia&apos;s highest illiteracy rates. The primary goal of U.S. assistance is to assist Timor-Leste&apos;s transition to a more resilient nation by strengthening its human and institutional capacity and reducing extreme poverty. Building these capacities will ensure greater peace and security; foster democratic, accountable, and transparent governance; strengthen health systems; and establish the conditions for inclusive economic growth. The upcoming 2017 elections will test the ability of Timor-Leste to transition to a stable, successful post-conflict nation after fifteen years of independence and will either signal a new stage of political maturity or reveal lingering fissures, which could threaten the nation&apos;s hard-won peace. U.S. assistance will also support the Government of Timor-Leste&apos;s (GOTL) top foreign policy goal of joining the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) to better engage in the regional economy and political infrastructure. A more stable, prosperous, regionally integrated Timor-Leste is more likely to continue playing a positive global leadership role that furthers shared democratic, security, and development goals.</narrative>
