   <narrative xml:lang="EN">(i) Access to finance: increasing access to finance in Bhutan, a frontier market, by enabling BNB to expand and enhance lending to an underbanked largely rural population.  (ii) Best practices and implementation of strategy: as a shareholder, IFC will provide BNB with access to international best practices in the areas of IT, risk management, SEMS and governance, and help the Bank implement its new growth strategy and expand into new underserved market segments, not only benefiting Bhutan&apos;&apos;s society, but also allowing the Bank to attain higher profitability. (iii) Demonstration effect: as new commercial banks enter the market, BNB can prove to be an example of both success and public impact.  The guidelines and norms that IFC will introduce can serve as an important precedent in the newly developing financial market and can strengthen the country&apos;&apos;s investment climate.  Further, IFC&apos;&apos;s investment is expected to provide a stamp of approval and increase the interest of other foreign investors to invest in Bhutan. (iv) Strengthening the Bhutanese banking sector. Stronger equity capital footings of a key player such as BNB will help to reduce systemic risk, and enable BNB to play a strong role in increasing and improving financial intermediation in BNB and promoting the competitiveness of the banking sector.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Project comprises an equity investment of up to 20% in Bhutan National Bank (BNB or the Bank).  The Bank was established in 1996 by the Government of Bhutan as the second commercial bank in the country, to promote growth and competition in the financial sector.  BNB is currently the largest of Bhutans five banks in terms of credit market share.  As of September 30, 2012, BNB had assets of US$442 million, outstanding portfolio of US$ 306 million, and capital fund of US$82 million.  The proposed project will be IFCs first equity investment in Bhutan.  The proposed investment is strongly aligned with IFCs South Asia regional strategy, as it involves expanding outreach and financial inclusion as well as promoting sustainable and competitive private sector development in a frontier market in South Asia. Through this investment, IFC will provide BNB with access to international best practices in operational areas and help the Bank develop a more robust and scalable business model.  In parallel, IFC is also proposing an Advisory Services engagement to build the Banks capacities in risk management, strategy and business planning for the micro, small and medium enterprise (MSME) sector, as well as IT business integration and MIS strategy.</narrative>
