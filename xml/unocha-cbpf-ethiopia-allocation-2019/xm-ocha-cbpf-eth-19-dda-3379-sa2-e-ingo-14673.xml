   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Accelerated Learning  Program for Internally Displaced Returnee Children in two Oromia Zones (Borena and East HarergeZones)</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">According to the post assessment report obtained from East Harerge Zone Education Office, there are quite large number of school age IDPs affected due to the displacement in East Harerge zone. Currently, total number of school age IDP children affected by emergency crisis in ten woredas are 25,142 (11,144 Female). As a result, they are in critical need of scholastic materials, supplementary food and clothes. Very few of the border conflict affected IDP school age children could access schools in their current locations. Many of those who have accessed schools are facing a number of problems such as discriminatory, lack of scholastic supplies, clothes, hygienic items, school feeding and others. Some schools were overcrowded and lack  seats for students, and chairs, and tables for teachers. In general, little response has been made concerning education for the IDP children. Different non-governmental organizations, government organizations and stakeholders have contributed different scholastic materials (East Harerge Zone Disaster Risk, Reduction and Management (DRRM) office, August 2019). Thus, for this Education in Emergency (EiE) response project, Babile and Gursum woredas are selected because of their high number of IDP returnee children. 
Borena zone has also been affected by the border conflict between Oromia and Somali regions, which resulted in displacement of 254,922 people. As a result, five woredas and 52 villages (kebeles) are affected. Besides, during the last consecutive years, Borena zone has been repeatedly experiencing complex humanitarian crisis because of drought, conflict and diseases. Massive livestock death happened due to drought in the last decades, particularly in the last five years. It has badly affected the livelihoods of the communities and the overall food security in the area. The teaching and learning processes of 405 schools have been  interrupted. As a result, more than 100,829 (47,655 Females) students have been affected by conflict (Borena Zone Education Office, November 2019). There also other contributing factors, which aggravate school dropouts of students. Movement of school age children with families due to search of water and animal feed, support their families in house hold chores, lack of sufficient food to travel long distances to schools are some of the major contributing factors. Dropped out children are traveling from place to place with their families in search of animal feed and water. Other children are staying around home to save their energy as do not have sufficient food to walk long distances to schools. Thus, Dillo and Arero woredas are the two most affected woredas and prioritized to be selected as a project sites for this EiE response project. This is done with the consultation of Borea zone education office and approved the selection of two woredas.
In general, the prioritization of the zones and woredas made because of the high number of IDP returnee population in the zones. Besides, the return of the IDPs to their original zones of residence would place the two zones in a higher priority. A large number of IDP returnee populations are also settled in these zones and the assumption is the number of students is significant. Since the circumstances of IDPs changed to IDP returnees, re-prioritization of zones and the woredas are designed and adjusted for this purpose.  Hence, this project is to address IDP returnee children. World Vision Ethiopia proposes to establish an Accelerated Learning Program (ALP) for primary school-aged children (aged 7-14) and an Accelerated School Readiness (ASR) program for pre-primary school aged children 6 years old.  This project will target the selected 16 IDP returnee sites ( through selected schools) in their original community in the prioritized four woredas by constructing  7 education cluster proposed standard TLCs for Borena zone and the renovation of partially damaged schools for better teaching and learning processes.</narrative>
