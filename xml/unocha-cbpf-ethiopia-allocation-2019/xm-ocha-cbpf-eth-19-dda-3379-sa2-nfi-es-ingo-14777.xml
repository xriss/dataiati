   <narrative xml:lang="EN">ESNFI Response for conflict-affected people (IDPs/returnee) in Metema, West Gonder Zone, Amhara Region</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Mid-Year Review (MYR) of the Ethiopia Humanitarian Response Plan (HRP) for 2019 indicates 7.8 million people will continue requiring humanitarian assistance until the remainder of the year. The Government and humanitarian partners have been dealing with the triple challenges of drought impact in the eastern and south-eastern parts of the country, localized flooding and the still significant humanitarian and recovery needs of IDPs, returnees and host communities 
According to IOM&#x2019;s Displacement Tracking Matrix, round 18, there are currently 1.6 million IDPs (1 million conflict-induced, 420,000 climate-induced, and 36,000 from other causes) as of October 2019. In Amhara specifically there are 62,536, of which 39,862 are Metema. Although spontaneous as well as organized returns have been registered since August 2018 the largest Government-organized return operation in May 2019 was unprecedented. According to Government, 2.1 million IDPs were returned, and IDP camps were decommissioned. However, returnees in some areas are not fully back in their homes with few livelihood options and do not have adequate access to basic services. Their dire living conditions as a result of the insufficient support provided, beyond the limited shelter and food assistance, and the vulnerability especially of women and children to gender-based violence, exploitation and abuse remains a concern. 
Like the other regions of the country, inter-communal related conflict that sparked in November 2018 between the Amhara and the Qemant communities led to displacements in the western part of the Amhara region. Large areas in Amhara regional state have been indifferent emergency since the last October 2018 due to ethnic conflict between the clan of &#x2018;Kemanit&#x2019; and Amhara tribes. At the end of September 2019, the years-long political standoff of ethnic Qemant escalated into new armed confrontations in Chilga (North Gonder zone) causing casualties and displacing of some 15,000 people. This event has claimed mass life destruction of innocent civilians and sabotage of enormous property.
Metema which is 335Kms far from the capital city of Amhara regional state Bahir Dar and 835 Km from Addis Ababa situated by North Western part of Ethiopia located in West Gondar Zone.  
The national Shelter NFI clusters ESNFIs Gap Analysis by woreda report (1- Nov-19) identified 7,435 people in Metema in need of immediate ESNFI support and 1541 people in need of shelter repair kits. In agreement with this, the data collected from our implementing partner Bahir Dar Catholic Secretariat and the Metema woreda DRMO found that 2993 households (13442 individuals) are dislocated having quickly left their houses on their homeland to seek protection from violence.  
To address this critical need, the project will directly benefit 6250 individuals in Metema, with supply of ESNFI kits through in-kind and cash based modalities. The proposed EHF intervention is prioritized by UNOCHA, NDRMC, and the S/NFI Cluster. The project will work to strengthen the capacity of the community to operate, maintain, and manage the responses. the project will be implemented for nine months in Metema Woreda of West Gonder Zone, Amhara regional state. 
CRS will target 1,250 households with in-kind and cash for ESNFI kits &#x2013; the S/NFI Cluster and Cash Working Group&#x2019;s recommended method where possible in Ethiopia. Employing cash in the feasible target locations will allow beneficiaries to quickly access time-critical ESNFI assistance, reducing procurement leads as cash can be mobilized and transferred rapidly. Cash will be transferred either by voucher or finance institution depending on location and most effective method available.</narrative>
