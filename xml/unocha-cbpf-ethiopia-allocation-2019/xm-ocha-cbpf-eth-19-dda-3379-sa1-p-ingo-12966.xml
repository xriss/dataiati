   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Enhancing the safety and wellbeing of women and girls through strengthening coordination mechanisms and psychosocial support  in East and West Wellega Zones IDP Sites</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Displacement as a result of emergency affects women and girls disproportionately and it increases the protection needs of women and girls. During displacement, women and girls of reproductive age have increased needs of safety, security as well as hygienic needs. The multiple responsibilities of women and girls for household chores in the face of limited resources could predispose them to anxiety and psychological stress which call for urgent assistance. Similarly, conflict exacerbates the pre-existing gender inequalities and put women and girls at the risk of Gender Based Violence (GBV) and sexual exploitation and abuse. 

The proposed project contributes to the overall objective to enhance the safety and wellbeing of women and children IDPs in West and East Wellega Zones in Oromia region through emergency psychosocial support intervention. To achieve the overall objective, the action has specific outcomes that focus on providing psychosocial support through temporary women and girls wellness centers, strengthening GBV response services and strengthening safe and survivor-centered GBV procedures and coordination mechanisms. In particular, the project aims to improve and strengthen existing GBV multi-response services at BoWCA, and one-stop center. The IRC will conduct capacity building trainings on GBV case management and GBV Information Management System (GBVIMS) to BoWCA and one-stop center staff to improve services being provided to GBV survivors. Additionally, the IRC will conduct review meetings and on job training with BoWCA and one-stop center to improve their capacity in GBV response service provision. The IRC will also translate Clinical Care for Sexual Assault Survivors brief guideline and case management tools into the local language and train the one-stop center staff on the basic principles of Clinical management of rape. The expected result under this objective is that vulnerable women and girls and survivors of GBV receive timely and safe access to psychosocial support and referral services. The key issues that this project plans to address includes gaps in proper technical and institutional capacity of BoWCA limited awareness of communities on available services and absence of standard tools, and operating procedures that help to facilitate quality service provision for GBV survivors. In response, the IRC proposes to strengthen comprehensive gender-based violence response services for GBV survivors, and vulnerable women and children to enhance healing and reduce further risks of violence. The comprehensive GBV response services include strengthening the psychosocial support, targeted capacity-building for local service providers, and dignity kit distributions. The IRC will also strengthen referral pathways to improve institutional capacity and to strengthen quality service provision and coordination among GBV and other actors.

The IRC has experience in distributing dignity kits and material support in East and West Wellegas. To reach the most vulnerable women and girls, the IRC coordinates with BoWCA and DRMC starting from the selection of beneficiaries, distribution of materials to post distribution of assessment. The IRC assumes that the existing partnership with different government structures and service providers in the targeted areas will complement to the successful planning and implementation of this project. In addition, the IRC has a Mobile Health and Nutrition Team (MHNT) who are providing health and nutrition services in the area. Recognizing the challenges faced by women and children in accessing health services including clinical management of rape, the GBV team will closely coordinate with MHNT team, health centers, and one-stop centers.</narrative>
