   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Saving lives of conflict induced IDPs and drought affected host communities through WASH intervention in Dawa Zone, Somali Regional State.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Based on the rapid need assessment conducted by NCA in March 2019 and recent hotspot prioritization conducted by the government, the WASH needs of the proposed two woredas in Somali region namely Hudet and Moyale is very high. Both woredas have critical shortages of water supply and poor sanitation amp hygiene coverages. People are using untreated water from open amp unsafe sources like ponds and Birkas.  Coupled with poor sanitation amp hygiene practices this has posed risk of disease outbreak, including AWD. IDPs hosted in both woredas have limited access to latrine facilities. Compared to the number of people in the camps, the communal latrines are not only inadequate but also not gender disaggregated amp have no proper doors and locks to ensure privacy for girls amp women, who face GBV when using these latrines at night. Due to absence of adequate latrines, open defecation is widely practiced in IDP camps and in the host community. This has contaminated the limited water supply available, posing the risk of water-borne diseases. People were unable to maintain the sanitation of the communal latrines as well as their own personal hygiene due to shortage of water.  IDPs have no sanitation materials including dignity kits amp girls and women are facing critical problems. In response to the current identified emergency WASH needs, NCA along with its partner will support the local efforts by rehabilitating non-functional water schemes, drilling of new shallow wells amp hygiene and sanitation promotion. Through WASH interventions, School children amp the surrounding host communities will be benefited in addition to the IDPs living in the target sites.  The main activities include rehabilitation of non-functional schemes, drilling of new shallow wells, rehabilitation of water points, provision of logistics support amp distribution of WASH NFIs, construction of semi-permanent communal latrine in IDP camps, hygiene amp sanitation promotion, provision of dignity kits and community capacity building. In total the project intends to reach 48,200 people (26,510 female) by implementing the following activities.
1.	Construct/rehabilitate 10 water supply schemes that includes
	Rehabilitate 3 hand-dug wells in Hudet woredas of Lochale, 03 and El-Roka Kebele: which includes replacement of hand pump and head work, 
	Rehabilitate 2 hand-dug wells equipped with solar power, pipeline and water point rehabilitation (both in 01 kebele Hudet woreda)
	Drill 4 shallow wells using NCA drilling PAT, 2 in Hudet (Elqalla amp kebele 03) and 2 in Moyale (Tesohama amp Lagsaden kebele), which includes hand pump installation, casing, supply of filter material, well development, concrete grouting, water quality test amp well head construction.
	Rehabilitate one bore hole in Daruselam Kebele of Moyale including the replacement of submersible pump and rehabilitation of 10 water points.
2. Distribute 504,000 Sachets of Water Treatment Chemicals for 14,000 people in both Woredas (6,800 male and 7,200 female). The support will include provision of buckets, stirrer, filter cloths as well as training of households on safe water management. Besides, 4 drums of chlorine will be provided to the two districts (2 per Woreda), to help people treat surface water for consumption. 
3. Sanitation amp hygiene promotion: This component will be implemented in all Kebeles that are benefitting from the other two objectives. It will include awareness raising, training on safe water management, environmental sanitation amp improved hygiene practices. The project will  provide reusable hygiene kit to 900 IDP women.  20 gender segregated semi-permanent communal latrine blocks (each with 4 stances) will be constructed in Lami, Lochale, Malka Guba, El qalla, Hudet 03, Kiliwe and Dakawata of Hudet and Tesohama, Lagsaden and Achin IDP camps of Moyale (two blocks/camp) to improve access to sanitation facilities for 4000 IDPs. Besides, awareness raising amp hygiene campaigns will be conducted in both Woredas</narrative>
