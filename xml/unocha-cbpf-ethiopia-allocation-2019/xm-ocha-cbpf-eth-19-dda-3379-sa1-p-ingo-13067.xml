  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The recurrent conflict between the Borana (Oromo) and Garre (Somali) communities has caused displacement of 1,166,878 people from their original locations. Many of the displaced people reside in Hudet (100,295) in 3 IDP sites, Moyale (196,165) in 16 IDP sites and and Dolo Ado (3,599) in 3 sites (Round 15 Displacement Tracking Matrix and Deyr 2018 Joint Seasonal Assessment in Dawa Zone, Somali Region). These internally displaced people, most of whom are women and children, are at high risk of protection concerns. Particularly unaccompanied and separated children (438), children with disabilities (102) suffer from multiple protection concerns. The number of girls and young women affected by GBV including domestic violence, FGM, child and forced marriage is as high as 964 among IDPs and host communities of Hudet, Moyale and Dolo Ado woredas of Somali region (Protection Rapid Assessment Report in Hudet, Moyale and Dollo Ado Woredas). Currently SCI is operating through child protection interventions in Hudet and Moyale woredas where displaced children, adolescent and other community members in 20 IDP sites (8 in Hudet and 12 in Moyale woredas) have benefited from psychosocial support and awareness raising activities. Under this project Save the Children aims to ensure continuity of the ongoing interventions in the 20 IDP sites of Hudet and Moyale while scaling up the intervention to 22 IPD sites (15 in Hudet, 4 in Moyale and 3 in Dolo Ado woredas). The intervention focus on supporting the psychosocial wellbeing of children, adolescent and families through structured CFS activities and ongoing resilience building workshops for children and adolescent. Local capacities will also be developed through establishment and strengthening of community-based child protection mechanisms and awareness creation activities in the IDP and host communities. The project will be implemented for six months in 42 IDP sites and host communities in Hudet Moyale and Dolo Ado woredas of Somali Regional State. The project will directly target 21,788 children (G= 10,876, B= 10,912 and 8,308 adults (F= 4,154 M =4,154) through child protection and psychosocial interventions. The project will enable children and adolescent to access safe play and recreational services by establishing child and adolescent friendly spaces (A/CFS) in IDP sites and facilitating on going interactive programs. For the purpose of this project adolescent is defined as a person between the ages of 15 and 18 years. It will enhance children&#x2019;s and adolescent&#x2019;s capacity to positively address the challenges they face in their daily life through organizing regular resilience building sessions for children, adolescent and their care providers. Continuous capacity building is essential to sustain protection and response activities already started and initiate new ones. Hence capacities of relevant government sectors offices to identify and respond to protection concerns of children, adolescent and facilitate will be enhanced. Coordination mechanisms (both government and front line humanitarian actors) will be strengthened to undergo effective case management and family tracing and reunification services. SCI will create community-based violence prevention and mitigation systems through strengthening the already established community-based child protection structures in the IDP sites and host communities of Hudet and Moyale. Additional structures will be established in the newly targeted IDPs in the woredas. Awareness raising on child protection issues including issues of sexual violence, child marriage, FGM and domestic violence will be conducted through regular community conversation sessions, mass awareness raising events and peer to peer education programs. The project will work with governmental and non-governmental actors operating in the targeted woredas to mainstream child through psychological first aid and FTR services. The project will build the capacity on PFA through PFA trainings.</narrative>
