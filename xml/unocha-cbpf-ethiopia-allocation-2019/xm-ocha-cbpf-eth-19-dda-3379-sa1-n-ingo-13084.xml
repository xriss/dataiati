   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Emergency Nutrition Response   for  six woredas  of  Somali Region</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The situation of humanitarian life and livelihood continues at a large scale humanitarian crisis than ever mainly due to mass internal displacements in various parts of the country. Among the regions that are currently facing humanitarian crises, Somali regional state is an area in which the local communities have been suffering from consecutive years of severe drought and intermittent conflict during the year. 
As per OCHA&#x2019;s snapshot report of 2019, in Somali region alone, a total of 2.01 million people (34 per cent of the total population) require humanitarian and protection assistance, out of which 38 per cent are estimated to be in acute need. This means that they are exposed to a range of humanitarian risk factors have limited access to basic services or face disruption in basic goods and services. Of the total people under humanitarian crises, an estimated 1,080,000 children under five need assistance to overcome acute malnutrition in 15 woredas of the region. The crises reported in these woredas were considered high severity areas and suggested to be treated as a convergence of different needs, requiring multi-sector humanitarian responses. The report emphasized that women, girls and boys are vulnerable groups and they deserve special attention while protection, nutrition and healthcare issues are addressed by humanitarian organizations. With regard to Somali region, the plight of the people in those woredas have been worsening as they were already in serious humanitarian crisis that was triggered by drought and inter-communal conflict along the Somali -Oromo borders (Emergency Preparedness and Response Plan of 2018 and 2019). Moreover, it was reported that there are about 1,091,210 internally displaced persons (IDPs) with 65.7% conflict induced IDP and 30.5 % who were droughts induced IDPs. Similarly, recent malnutrition data in the three zones indicate rates are at crisis levels, with global acute malnutrition rates well above the emergency threshold. Without adequate intervention, there is a risk that the people in these areas could slide into severe food insecurity. Similarly, due to disruption in routine vaccination in those areas, there is a risk that deadly but preventable diseases such as measles will re-emerge. Water, sanitation and hygiene assistance remains critical to provide communities with safe, clean water and sanitation facilities, and to combat the risk of acute watery diarrhoea. Protection concerns are also mounting humanitarian need that should be extended and sustained actions across the woredas in the region. The region is also prone to climate induced drought, flooding, sporadic outbreak of communicable diseases like measles, acute watery diarrhea (AWD) and dengue fever. As a case in point, it is worth mentioning that the pastoralist and agro-pastoralist communities of the region who suffered two previous consecutive years of severe droughts and who have lost productive assets, will continue to require coordinated humanitarian assistance and recovery support throughout 2019. Owing to its presence in Somali region for the last fifteen years, IR is one of the pioneer international NGOs that effectively led and managed various emergency responses by employing Community Based Management of Acute Malnutrition (CMAM) model. Accordingly, IR implemented projects dealing with CMAM and 49,242 SAM across 1,296 health facilities including 1,151 Outpatients amp 143 stabilization centers that have contributed towards addressing Severe Acute Malnutrition (SAM) cases in the region. In addition, within 210 Outreach sites that were jointly managed by 29 mobile health and nutrition teams (MHNT), IR has assisted vulnerable local communities and IDPs who live in remote woredas of Somali Region in 2018 (GU 2018 assessment report).In response to addressing the dire humanitarian crises reported in Somali Region, the management of IR decided to extend the phased out interventions and to resume similar interventions</narrative>
