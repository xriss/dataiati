   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Mobile health and nutrition response for IDPs and host communities in Tuliguled, East Imi and Berano woredas of Somali region</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Mercy Corps (MC) proposes to respond to urgent, critical humanitarian needs of the most vulnerable internally displaced persons (IDP) and host communities affected by droughts and floods, and compounded by conflict. The project will target the following three woredas in the Somali region: Tuliguled, Berano and East Imi. The project period will be for six months.   

The overall objective of the project is to reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with under nutrition and increased illnesses of communities affected by drought, conflict and flood who do not have access to primary health care services and basic nutrition services. Woredas were selected considering the severity of the situation as the three  selected woredas are still in the top priority list based on the recent hot spot classification, with a high number of IDPs displaced by conflict, drought and the recent flooding along the Shebele river. In addition, the acute malnutrition caseload is still significantly high and the capacity of local government is limited to deliver basic health and nutrition services, particularly for IDP sites. These three woredas are also selected as the highest priority and need to be considered in the second EHF allocation 

The project will address both moderate and severe acute malnutrition and will reach 13,773 participants (CU5 and PLW) through full Community based Management of Acute Malnutrition (CMAM)  in East Imi woreda and Berano woredas and essential mobile health services for displaced people and communities in hard to reach kebeles of Tuliguled, Berano and East Imi woreda who cannot access basic health services from the existing health facilities. All acute malnutrition cases will be admitted either in outpatient therapeutic program (OTP), targeted supplementary feeding program (TSFP), or in stabilization centers for management of medical complications, and counseling on Maternal Infant and Young Child Nutrition (MIYCN), with an emphasis on infant and young child feeding (IYCF) and hygiene promotion. The Mobile Health Teams (MHNT) that will be deployed for Tuliguled, Berano and East Imi woredas will cover six IDP centers in each woreda to serve the displaced peoples affected by sporadic conflicts near the Somali-Oromia border, the recent flooding in Shebele zone and recurrent drought across the region.  

The intervention comprises the following outcomes:

Nutrition: Will be implemented in East Imi and Berano woredas
Outcome 1: Improving capacity for SAM amp MAM management at facility level and outreach sites through training Health workers and HEWs
Outcome 2: Improved services accessibility for IDPs and hard-to-reach area through MHNT at outreach sites for the most vulnerable groups (mainly children, pregnant and lactating women)
Outcome 3: Increased awareness of community members on the importance of optimal IYCF and caring practices and other nutrition related topics, as well as hygiene-related behaviors 

Health: will implemented in Tuliguled, Berano and East Imi woredas 
Outcome 1: Diagnosis, consultation and treatment of common diseases with a focus on child illnesses using integrated management of newborn and childhood illness (IMNCI) to treat common causes of child mortality 
Outcome 2. Improved maternal health including ANC, PNC and FP
All pregnant mothers who have no/insufficient access to maternal health services at the facility level will get ANC, PNC, FP and safe delivery services.

Outcome 2. Improved child health services including immunization and growth monitoring 
All children under five will get immunization services to prevent vaccine preventable diseases starting from birth up to 9 months, until they complete all vaccines, including measles. Vitamin supplementation and de-worming will continue every six months for children who did not receive it for six months.</narrative>
