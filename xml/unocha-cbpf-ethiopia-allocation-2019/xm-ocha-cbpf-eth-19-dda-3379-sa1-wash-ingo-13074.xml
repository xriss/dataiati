   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In 2018, there has been a significant increase in internal displacement as a result of inter-communal conflict in several pockets of Ethiopia. The IDP population has nearly doubled and IDP returnee population will be around three million people by the end of the year. Localized small-scale displacements have always existed in Ethiopia from clashes between communities over limited resources like pasture and water in pastoralist and agro-pastoralist areas along regional boundaries. The scale and frequency in 2018 are unprecedented and have led to a significant number of IDPs and IDP returnees in need of support.

According to the 16th round Displacement tracking Matrix (DTM), there are 130,788 IDPs in Borena Zone, settled in five woredas, Dhas, Guchi, Wachile, Arero and Moyale. These IDPs are Gebra Oromos (ethnic group) who left Oromia region of Borena zone to Hudet woreda of Somali Region 10 years back due to conflict between Borena and Gebra Oromos. According to Borena zone Disaster Risk Management office, these people have been returning since before the 2017 conflict among the Oromo and Somali along the regional border. Although the Federal Government and some humanitarian actors have been delivering some support to the IDPs, the need on the ground has never been satisfied and the situation is very tough for older people and people with disabilities (PwDs). Displacement has significant effect to vulnerable people, they are exposed to protection risks, food insecurity and lack of safe water and sanitation facilities which pose disease outbreaks. This project intends to support 17 IDP sites in Guchi, Dhas and Wachile woredas, each accommodates over 2000 individuals. The intended support includes construction of communal and household latrines, promotion of improved hygiene and sanitation and protection mainstreaming for older people and people with disabilities who are among the most neglected groups.

HelpAge International has been responding to the recurrent humanitarian situations in the most disaster prone and affected areas of Ethiopia for the last two decades. Currently, HelpAge is implementing an integrated humanitarian response project in four woredas Guchi, Wachile, Miyo and Dhas of Borena Zone where significant number of IDPs and the local communities have been benefitting. The response has been focusing on water supply through rehabilitation of malfunctioned water sources, construction of motorized water scheme (deep well), construction of inclusive shared household latrines for most vulnerable older people who have mobility challenges through construction of ramps, handrails, elevated seat, wider doors. The project also focuses on promotion of improved hygiene and sanitation practices and addressing malnutrition in older people.

The proposed project aims to assist a total of 74,485 populations residing nearby or within the host communities as well as in designated 17 IDP camps. The project&#x2019;s major activities include, construction of inclusive and accessible (age, gender and disability disaggregated) public and shared household latrines and promotion of improved hygiene and sanitation practices. While implementing these activities, protection will be main streamed through identification of protection risks of older people and persons with disabilities and their protection needs are supported through appropriate interventions including provision of relevant and inclusive protection materials, psychosocial support, referral to available and appropriate service providers, mainly based on the actual needs of individuals or groups of OP, PwDs and/or their careers. In addition, protection mainstreaming will be done through capacitating relevant government and INGO actors on inclusive programming.

The project will be implemented over a 6-month period and will require USD 450,000 to achieve its objectives and intended protection mainstreamed WASH activities.</narrative>
