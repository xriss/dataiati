   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Lifesaving Emergency Shelter and Non-Food Items Response to displaced IDPs in Somali Region.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The proposed intervention will provide life-saving assistance to 27,500 prioritized most vulnerable internally displaced persons (IDPs) impacted by conflict and drought and in critical need of emergency shelter (ES) and non-food items (NFI) in Somali region.

International Organization for Migration (IOM)&#x2019;s DTM Round 15, conducted in February 2019, identified a total of 2,227,109 internally displaced persons, excluding Gedeo/Guji and Wollegas/Kamashi conflicts which have displaced approximately 690,364 and 177,205 individuals respectively. Approximately 75% of the total displaced population in Ethiopia is displaced due to conflict while 23% is displaced due to climate related factors. Of which 1,166,878 IDPs (347,579 Climate induced, and 819,299 conflict-induced), and 52% of the overall conflict-displaced households, are displaced in Somali region.

Therefore, the present action prioritizes Somali region. 
Primary target locations for this response include Doolo, Erer, Fafan, Jarar zones in Somali region. These locations have been identified and prioritized by Somali Region Sub-National Cluster leads, the Ethiopian Humanitarian Fund (EHF) 2019 1st Round call for proposals, IOM field teams and country level humanitarian and recovery strategies such as the 2019 Ethiopia Humanitarian Response Plan (HRP). 

As agreed by the S/NFI Cluster in the Somali Region, the project will be implemented through a coordinated response between IOM and Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC) based on the strong presence and experience of the partners.

The proposed intervention will support 5,000 households (HHs) with life-saving humanitarian assistance through the provision of cluster approved in-kind ES/NFI kits and cash-based assistance for NFI materials. The ES/NFI kits will be fully procured and transported by IOM and distributed by IOM, NRC and other partners identified as needed. A total of 5,000 HHs will receive in-kind ES kits, of which 2,400 HHs assisted with ES will receive in-kind NFI assistance, while the remaining 2,600 will receive cash-based assistance for NFI materials. Cash-based assistance will be considered in areas where based on market assessments, the market is functional and offers items needed by IDPs and where IDPs have a preference for cash-based assistance. 

Exact areas of distribution will be identified through joint assessment by ES/NFI Cluster agencies in coordination with regional and zonal government authorities. If needed, IOM will engage/identify other partners as an implementing partner for ES/NFI kit distributions based on the partners&#x2019; geographic coverage, cost effectiveness and past partnership history with IOM. An effective communication strategy will also be put in place to ensure both displaced and host communities receive adequate and timely information about the planned intervention including entitlements and timings of distributions. Feedback mechanisms are established at the time of distribution (in the form of a help desk) in order to receive, document and respond to complaints related to the intervention. 

Please note that budget allocations per location (as listed in &apos;locations&apos; section) are indicative but not committed, as actual resource allocation will be determined throughout the course of the project based on prioritized needs and in collaboration with Cluster Coordinators.</narrative>
