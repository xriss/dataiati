   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Oromia Region of West Harerege Zone: For many years, the West Harerge Zone has experienced severe repeated droughts affecting large enfold of the population every year. Repeated drought is threatening the Agro-pastoralist way of life. The residual effect of the prolonged El Nino induced drought has limited the impact of current rains on the availability of pasture, livestock herd size, livestock health and productivity, and crop production, and households could not recover. The 2018 &#x201C;Meher/ performance is completely felid and started late, with early cessation and erratic distribution. For the proposed project woredas, As such, almost over 40% in Anchar, 74% in Boke woreda and 57 % in Hawi Gudina woreda of the population are expected requires food help. The situation is further exacerbated by the poor and below average performance of the 2018 Meher and Bulg rain which has further resulted in poor production performance, poor pasture, brows, and water availability, negatively affecting household income and availability of milk for families, especially children, and PLW. 
Afar region, Zone 4: Whilst 90% of the Afar population is, the recurrent drought, resulting in high livestock deaths, has led few people to engage in Agro-pastoralism to improve their resilience. However, its Performance is frequently affected by climatic shocks. As a result, the contribution of livestock and crop production to household food security is insufficient. In an area lacking diversified income sources, household food and livelihood security are under huge strain and reliance on external help is high. Households have coped with these challenges through relief food help and a strong culture of sharing resources among relatives and clan members,
Tigray: The main source of livelihood in the woreda is rain-fed agriculture, which relies on &apos;&apos;meher&apos;&apos; rainy season. The latest meher rain is expected to start from the 1st of May 2018. However, it starts early and erratic type of rain. Until the end of May 2018, it manifested that as light in the amount and intensity, especially in 11 dry kebeles of Tselemti woreda. due to the poor performance of the rain, A total of over 40% of the expected crop was recorded as loose. and high treat of AWD cases in both Tselemti and Mereb leke woreda. 
The overall strategic objective of this project proposal is to provide lifesaving emergency nutrition response, there by contributing to the reduction of morbidity and mortality associated with drought and acute food insecurity among Under-five children and PLW in this selected drought affected woredas by Hawi Gudina, Anchar, Boke, Tselemti , Merb Leke,Awra  and Teru, MCMDO will implement the intervention Focus on CMAM for the detection and rehabilitation of SAM and MAM cases Among under-five children and PLW  and minimize sufferings associated with malnutrition, in what&apos;s is predicted to be deteriorating food security situation and expected hunger season. MCMDO will support the woreda health office to deliver a high-quality full CMAM service including strengthening the community mobilization and participation for quality screening, early detection, coverage, and linkage through mapping and targeting of eligible children in a monthly manner,  strengthen the capacity of HW and the community for quality SAM treatment management through training, coaching/mentoring and ensuring the link of SAM cases to OTP and SC and quality documentation and reporting. The program will also support the implementation of IYCF-E as an integrative component, health, and nutrition counseling and TSFP in a collaboration with WFP to rehabilitate at-risk and moderately malnourished. children to prevent deterioration into SAM.
