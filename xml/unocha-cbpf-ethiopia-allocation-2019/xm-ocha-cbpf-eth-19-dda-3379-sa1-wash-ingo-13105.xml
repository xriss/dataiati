   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Emergency response and durable solutions in WASH for IDPs in 4 sites of Rayitu and Dawe Kachen Woredas of Bale Zone in the Oromia Regional State</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">LWF has been responding to the conflict-induced displacement that hit hard particularly the Oromia and Somali regions where the lion shares of the displaced people live. LWF has been assisting the IDPs in WASH in many of the woredas but there are few IDP sites which have been &#x2018;ignored&#x2019; or &#x2018;marginalized&#x2019;, as explained by the Rayitu woreda water office, because of absence of any support in WASH from the humanitarian actors mainly due to scarcity of resources. LWF plans to reach these IDPs in WASH through various interventions as described below. 
The proposed project will provide WASH solutions to IDPs of 4 sites in Rayitu and Dawe Kachen Woredas of Bale zone based on identified gaps and needs in the sites where there are critical WASH needs as verified by LWF&apos;s own assessment, government report and DTM R15. The 4 IDP sites namely,  Dedecha Belda (OR1024), Harabucha (OR534) and Kabole(OR851) sites of Rayitu woreda and Kelkelha site (OR1155) in Dawe Kachen woreda are reported to be in need of immediate interventions in WASH. LWF team collected data from the field and learned that the IDPs in these sites are found in dire situation due to absence of water, sanitation facilities, low awareness and poor practice in hygiene as well as because of absence of NFIs such as soap and water collection materials. 
The project targets IDPs in Dedecha Belda (OR1024), Harabucha (OR534) and Kabole(OR851) sites of Rayitu woreda and Kelkelha site (OR1155) in Dawe Kachen woreda for WASH support. 
Harabucha, Kabole, Kelkelcha, and Dedecha Belda sites will be prioritized for WASH NFI support due to the absence of hygiene facilities and also because low awareness on hygiene and sanitation. Additionally, IDPs in Kabole and Kelkelha sites will be supported to have improved access to water through pond construction as pond it the major source to secure water for the pastoralist communities. Besides, both the IDPs and host communities and their children will benefit from construction of roof water harvesting structures at 1 school and 1 health post in Harabucha and Kabole sites in Rayitu woreda respectively. The 2 ponds to be constructed at Kabole (Rayitu) and Kelkelcha (Dawe Kachen) sites will have each a capacity of collecting 8000 m3 of run off during the next rainy season. The ponds will be constructed through cash-for-work approach so that the IDPs will also benefit from the cash distribution to be able access food and other needs of the participating IDPs. The ponds will serve both the IDPs and host community in and around those sites. This will contribute to peaceful coexistence between the IDPs and host communities. A total of 140 persons will participate per pond for 30 days in two months. 
The ponds and roof water harvesting structures serve as durable solutions in WASH for the IDPs and also will benefit the host community.
In Rayitu, IDPs in Dedecha Belda, Hara Bucha and Kabole sites and in Dawe Kachen, IDPs in Kelkelcha site will be prioritized for WASH NFI support and communal latrine construction except the Dedecha Belda site where there are latrines but the awareness level on hygiene and sanitation is very low. In Kabole site, LWF will construct 8 latrines for the IDPs and also 3 at three institutions (2 schools and 1 health post) where there is critical need. Each communal latrine will have 2 blocks each having 5 rooms to serve 50 persons per room. The WASH NFIs include jerry cans (1 per HH), washing basin (1 per HH), 6 bathing and 6 laundry soaps per HH to be distributed in two rounds following hygiene promotion campaigns. LWF will complement its water supply and sanitation support with hygiene promotion activities in all target sites. The hygiene promotion campaigns will be organized twice using drama, demonstration and printed aids such as leaflets and posters.  
The project will have a 6-month duration.</narrative>
