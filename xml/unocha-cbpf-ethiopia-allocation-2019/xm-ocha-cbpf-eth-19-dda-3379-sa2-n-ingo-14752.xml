   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Emergency Nutrition Response and Preparedness in two Woredas in North and Central Gondar Woredas of Amhara Region</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Concern proposes a six-month (6 months implementation within 7 months project period) emergency nutrition project to contribute to the reduction of mortality and morbidity associated with acute malnutrition among children under five years of age and pregnant and lactating women in two P1 woredas (Janamora and Kinfaz) of Gondar, Amhara Region. These woredas are facing high co-morbidities of diarrhea, and scabies in addition to increased caseload of SAM (Janamora &#x2013; 6687 adults affected), indicating the poor hygiene and sanitation conditions placing children at risk for malnutrition and affecting the recovery for those who are already malnourished. Moreover, a measles outbreak (-123) was reported in the past three months which could further deteriorate the nutrition status of children U5 (Rapid contextual assessment for emergency response / Janamora and Kinfaz Health Office/, November 2019). In these woredas, the hunger gap begins as early as February each year, after families have exhausted their food stores, and lasts until September. With the lean season quickly approaching, communities in these two woredas face food insecurity that will affect the nutritional status of the most vulnerable women and children. This life-saving project will treat and manage SAM and MAM in children 6-59 months and PLW in the target woredas, in a comprehensive approach that includes capacity building of key government health staff, system strengthening, IYCF education and protection and GBV prevention integration. The project aims to achieve three integrated and mutually reinforcing outcomes that will contribute to the overall objective. Through establishing and strengthening OTP/TSFP sites and providing on-the-job mentoring and technical support to frontline health workers, the project will contribute to strengthened treatment of acute malnutrition among vulnerable groups, particularly children under five, in the affected populations Janamora and Kinfaz woredas in Amhara Region. Concern will promote optimal IYCF practices among mothers/caregivers of children below 24 months both at the distribution site and community level that lead to improved levels of knowledge and practice of mothers/caregivers on child feeding and caring practices as well as hygiene promotion. Concern will provide quality nutrition and medical care through the CMAM approach as well as build the capacity of program staff and local woreda staff on key protection and GBV prevention issues. This will contribute to the improved knowledge and skills of Ministry of Health staff in the management of SAM and MAM to enable a better response to fluctuating levels of malnutrition. Concern will also try to orient critical components Surge approach such as threshold setting and resource mobilization. Combined, these approaches will contribute to cluster objectives through reducing mortality and morbidity associated with SAM and MAM, as well strengthening local health systems, government actors and mainstreaming protection and GBV prevention issues. Concern will build off experience in implementing emergency programming support by EHF and other donors in the proposed target areas. With support from EHF, Concern implemented an emergency nutrition response in Kinfaz Begela and Janamora woredas of North and Central Gonder, Amhara Region most recently. Concern is thus well prepared to rapidly-implement the proposed project and will use experience and lessons learned to address the key bottlenecks to good quality service uptake identified during the previous interventions. This will include ensuring strong coordination mechanisms are built between Health and Nutrition actors at woreda level (previously only at zonal and regional level) and exploring solutions with WoHO for maintaining quality service delivery given the high staff turnover in remote areas.</narrative>
