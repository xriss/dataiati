   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Accelerated Learning Program for Internally Displaced Children in Oromiai in West Wollega Zone Nedjo and Lalo Asabi Woredas</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project prioritizes one of the conflict emergency affected zones of Oromia regional state. West Wollega zone. Nedjo and Lalo Asabi Woredas are targeted for this Education in Emergency (EiE) response project. The prioritization of the zone and woredas was made as a result of the high number of partially and fully damaged schools in the zone. Following the cluster prioritized activities as of July 2018, World Vision proposes to establish an Accelerated Learning Program (ALP) for primary school-aged children (aged 7-14) and an Accelerated School Readiness (ASR) program for pre-primary school aged children between 4-6 years old. This will allow the conflict induced IDP children to successfully transition into the next school year. 
The psychosocial support training will be provided to the affected children and teachers. The training will be delivered by TOT trained education experts and child protection professionals as a training resource persons. This includes a three-day EiE and conflict sensitive education (CSE) training for teachers, education stakeholders such as Parent Teacher and Student Association (PTSA), KETB (Kebele Education Training Board), Woreda Education Office (WEO), and Zone Education Office (ZEO). Three days capacity building training on ALP methodology for primary school teachers and cluster center supervisors a three day psycho social support training for teachers and students a two day capacity building training on GBV (Gender Based Violence), gender responsive pedagogies, psycho social support and prevention of School Related Gender Based Violence(SRGBV )to teachers and finally, a three day ToT (training of trainers) training for Master trainers will be provided. The purpose of ToT training for Master Trainers will be to equip trainees with knowhow and enable them to cascade down the trainings to the woreda and school/IDP site levels. The master trainers will also be involved in mentoring and close supervision to implementation of ASR and ALP programs alongside WVE staff. The ASR facilitators will be trained for about 15 days in ALP methodology and curriculum content orientation. The targeted ASR and ALP students benefit educational materials such as exercise books, pens, and pencils from the project implementation. In addition Glucose biscuits will be provided to ALP and ASR students on the schooling days in the week. WV assessed that Glucose biscuits which weight 30 gm (1 sachet) contain Energy 495Cal, Protein, 8gm, Carbohydrate 63gm and Fat 23.5gm. Each student will be provided three sachets of Glucose biscuits (90 gram) per day. This is to supporting school attendances of emergency affected children during the project period. 
 
These activities are proposed by the national education cluster and donor agency, and endorsed by government and partners. The trainees will be from Zone Education Office (ZEO), Woreda Education Office( WEO), and selected school teachers /school cluster center supervisors. This project will target two IDP sites in the prioritized two woredas. The proposed education emergency response project will have an immediate, comprehensive, and long term impact in the lives of the targeted IDP children.</narrative>
