   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In Ethiopia climate change and conflict are the main hazard profiles affecting millions of people in the country. The previously drought affected people are not yet fully recovered from the effect of the drought. They are still in need of humanitarian assistance. Moreover, the ethnic-based conflict in the different parts of the country were displaced millions of people and majority of the IDPs are returned to their place of origin and in secondary displacement sites but in critical need of humanitarian assistance. Based on the 2019 Ethiopia Humanitarian Response Plan Mid year review endorsed by the government on October 2019, 8.86 million people are in need of humanitarian assistance of which 7.8 million people are targeted for emergency food and non-food assistance. The Government of Ethiopia and the humanitarian community present the 2019 Humanitarian Response Plan (HRP) mid year review  with funding requirement of US $ 319 million to reach 7.8 million people with emergency food and non-food assistance. In the HRP plan for 2019, 3.16 million people are targeted for health and 1.07 million for protection with a budget requirement of $ 95.06 million and $ 20.40 million respectively. Clusters have re assessed and revised priority districts for humanitarian program interventions in July 2019. The average priority for the whole cluster have been taken and hot spot districts are identified as priority 1, 2 and 3. Hence, the total number of hot spot priority districts, as per the July 2019 classification, are 501, of these 250 districts as classified as hot spot priority one districts, 135 as priority two and the remaining 116 as priority three. Compared to the January  2019 hot spot classification, the number of hot spot districts in July 2019 increased by 34 districts.

According to IOM Round 18 Displacement Tracking Matrix (DTM) report that was conducted in July 2019 indicated a total of 1.64 million IDPs. Of these IDPs, 28,361 are pregnant women and 19,882 are single female headed populations. Conflict was reported as the primary driver of displacement, followed by displacement due to climate induced factors like drought and flooding. 

In humanitarian situations particularly in internally displaced persons and returnees women and girls mostly lacks availability of sexual and reproductive health services and related life-threatening complications of pregnancy and childbirth attributable to malnutrition that must be addressed. In this project, UNFPA is planning to provide sexual and reproductive health and clinical management of rape survivor&#x2019;s services for IDP returnees and surrounding host communities in selected 6  woredas in West Hararghe zone of Oromia region and Faffan zone of Somali region. UNFPA is a pipe line manager of emergency RH kits for the emergency response, there might be a possibility of using the emergency RH kits to the health cluster prioritized 33 districts selected at national and Somali level besides to the selected districts based on the emerging needs and situations. From the total requested budget, around $ 48,000 will be used for the IDPs and returnees response hosted in Babile, Tulu Guled and Goljano districts for emergency RH kits procurement and capacity development trainings. 

Project Goal: To contribute to the reduction of maternal and neonatal mortality and morbidity in selected IDP sites , returnees and  surrounding host communities
Project Objective: To enhance availability of lifesaving reproductive health, maternal health and sexual violence services for IDPs and returnees and affected host communities.</narrative>
