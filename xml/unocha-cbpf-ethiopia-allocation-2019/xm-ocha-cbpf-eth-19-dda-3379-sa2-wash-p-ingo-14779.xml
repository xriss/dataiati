   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Somali Region has two main rainy seasons that locally known as &#x201C;Gu&#x201D; that takes place in the months that cover April-June and Deyr that covers Oct-Dec. Under normal circumstances, the rain in the adjacent Oromia highland areas affect the Somali Region depending on the intensity of the rain.The torrential rainfall in the highland areas of Oromia causes over flooding in lower plain lands of Somali Region since the pastoralists are living around such rivers like Wabi Shebele, Dawa and Genale to get pasture and water for their animals and domestic consumptions. Every year, the flood has been affecting more than 30 Woredas in the Somali Region. Apart from the river, the incidence of flash flood is high that has devastating impact on the livelihood of the community.

Starting from the month of October 2019, there was heavy rain that contributed to cause overflow of rivers and flash floods. As per the sectoral review recently made in October 2019 at jijiga by the Somali Region sector offices, it was reported that the flood affected 47,130 HHs of which 21,573HHs were displaced in Shabelle, Liban, Afder, Korahe and Doollo zones. The flood-affected and destroyed a significant number of residential houses public assets such as schools, water schemes, etc. It also washed away farming and grazing lands. As reported, there are villages that are surrounded by the flood since there is no outlet for the water. The water level remains high and forced the affected people to stay at the evacuation site too crowded. On top of that the provision of the basic needs like water, food and shelter provision are limited as a result of limited capacity of responses actors including government. Currently the displaced people are living in open space with precarious situation. The need for emergency WaSH, shelter and non-food items are the top humanitarian needs and priorities. Immediate live-saving humanitarian intervention is required.

The humanitarian assistance in the Region is further complicated as a result of multiple vulnerable IDPs, who have been affected by drought and conflict. Despite the efforts made to return these IDPs by the government the number of IDPs in the Region remains high. The DTM 18 report indicated that there are about 828,028 IDPs comprising 139,977 households in 401 sites in Somali region. It was also proved that 58% of the IDPs are conflict induced IDPs. Among the affected areas of the Zones, in Somali Region, the three Woredas of Afder, namely, Godgod, Kohile and Doloby are among highly affected and characterized by the impact of the flood and significant number of drought induced IDPs, The three woredas have total of 26,729 IDPs at present that is 42 % of the total for Afder. Afder Zone has total of 63,677 IDPS at present. The desperate situation of IDPs who are exposed for multiple vulnerabilities as a result of previous displacements and current flood impact call for an immediate intervention of Water supply and Hygiene and sanitation responses to save the lives of vulnerable communities of Godgod, Kohile and Dolobay. Accordingly, IR submitted this proposal to save the lives of 26,729 IDPs in three Woredas of Afder Zone being the IDP communities are the most affected group of people by the current flood incidents.</narrative>
