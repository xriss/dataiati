   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This is a protection-led project with an integrated design aiming to build and complement the already multi-sectorial response (Nut, FSL, WASH, Emergency response and Protection) Action Against Hunger (ACF) is currently delivering in the West Wollega (Mana Sibu, Lata Sibu and Gimbi) and Kamashi zones. Addressing the protection needs will provide a holistic response to conflict-affected communities including IDPs, returnees and host communities. This project aims especially to support vulnerable groups whose needs have become priorities in areas still affected by violence, unrest and limited basic services. ACF will build on its presence and integration with government agencies to prevent and address GBV cases, improve mental health and protect the most vulnerable groups &#x2013; specifically pregnant and lactating women, women with disability, adolescent and young girls and survivors while also including the wider community including men, older adults and community leaders. This complex humanitarian emergency is exacerbating the population&apos;s negative coping strategies such as unsafe behaviours and practices, leading to higher rates of mortality and morbidity especially among the most vulnerable. ACF is willing with this project to address these urgent protection needs, but also to build capacity to governmental, national and local stakeholders and to raise awareness to make the community more resilient and cope in a better way. ACF currently reaches beneficiaries to provide Nutrition and essential mother and child care practices, MHPSS, WASH and FSL assistance. 
Under this project, ACF is planning to: 1) Raise awareness through radio campaigns and community based activities, 2) Provide assistance in the form of psychosocial support (PSS), parenting skills and child and woman care practices to prevent negative coping mechanisms and by distributing dignity kits to the most vulnerable cases identified ensuring Do No Harm Principles, 3) Referral of the vulnerable cases in need of additional support. ACF is planning to strengthen the referral pathway by triangulating the protection mapping services (health, legal and psychosocial assistance) and following-up to ensure the assistance is delivered. Identification and referrals will be done by teams in the field. 4) Establishment of Safe Spaces (modelled on the mother and baby friendly approach currently employed alongside health services) that will help to prevent and intervene on the protection risks and consequences of conflict in the family and community with a special focus on women, girls and boys at risk of violence, abuse and exploitation. 5) Capacity building, and supervision to WoYCA (Women, Youth and Child Affairs), local women associations and to teachers and health workers on PSS to adults and children, care practices, including IYCF, GBV and CPiE.

1. Raise protection and GBV awareness amongst community leaders, health systems, teachers, parents and caregivers
2. Distribution of dignity kits to the most vulnerable cases identified 
3. Establishment of Mother, pregnant, adolescent girls and child safe spaces or, women support groups to provide psychosocial support activities and behaviour change 
4. Support and strengthen the referral pathways through linkages with existing services (health, protection) and follow-up to ensure the assistance is delivered.
5. Capacity building to social workers in local government (WoYCA))), local women associations, as well as to teachers and health facility workers on minimum standards, Prevention and Response for GBV and CPIE, PSS and develop counselling skills, and Psychological First Aid. 
6. Protection Monitoring &#x2013; Providing monitoring information on IDPs on human rights violations and protection risks to the protection cluster and to inform program design and modification.
7. Standard Safety Risk Audit &#x2013; a toolkit for psychosocial workers to help identify potential GBV-related safety risks at and around Nutrition amp Health sites</narrative>
