   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Improve access to lifesaving primary health and nutrition care services to conflict affected communities in Haro Limu and Sasiga woredas in East Wollega Zone of Oromia and Oda Bildigilu wereda of Benishangul Gumuz</narrative>

  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">IRC has been responding to the impact of recent wave of displacement crisis since the aftermath of conflicts in Ethiopia, mainly in Oromia, BGRS and SNNPR by implementing core packages of lifesaving primary healthcare (PHC), sexual and reproductive health (SRH) and nutrition in IDP and returnees hosting Woredas in those regions. Total of 351,543 people were targeted during the last phase of the EHF response in those affected regions. Using the 2019 first phase of this grant availed by EHF, IRC has effectively undertaken a successful support for nine in woredas in East Wollega, West Wollega, Gedeo, Borena Asossa zone through strengthening of primary health care systems,   provision of trainings, creation of platforms for review meetings, conducting supportive supervisions, provision of IPC materials and logistics support while critical shortages of supplies resulted from diversion of facilities&#x2019; internal fund to returnees  support and damages to the  facilities  during the crisis and lack of medical equipment among other gaps still remain unresolved. Accordingly, 103,892 people have received OPD consultations and 1,320 women delivered assisted by professionals in health facilities through 148 facilities which benefited from the support. 
Those unresolved challenges of the health system will be addressed using this grant. The project will target two woredas from East Wollega zone, Oromia (Sasiga and Haro Limu) and one Woreda (Oda Bildigilu) from BGRS. These three woredas were hosting 120,797 IDP during the peak of the crisis some of whom are categorized as IDP returnees currently and their health system were adversely affected by the crisis. Seventy eight health facilities across the three woredas will benefit from the support while 13 health centers among them will be primarily targeted for more comprehensive support as they are referral points for the health posts. The intervention plan is in line with the HRP 2019 mid-year review priorities whereby the IDP crisis affected areas of the country including some werdas of East Wollega zone, Oromia region and BGRS were categorized under high priority areas and these particular Woredas were also identified as Tier 1 priority areas by the health cluster during the second round of EHF grant allocation due to their epidemic potential and high SAM on top of very weak health system they have among their immense health gap. 
The IRC ensures transparency and accountability by engaging the beneficiaries of the project and enhance the ownership throughout the project life. All possible measures will be put in place to safeguard the dignity of all beneficiaries of the project. The organization always orients the new staffs on the need of protecting the right of all beneficiaries regardless of their race, religion, political affiliation or any other background. The IRC will integrate a Do No Harm approach into activities, guiding interventions to identify critical areas where people with disabilities, pregnant women, children and people with chronic illnesses will be included in the services with priority. Using this approach, the IRC will undertake community level consultative group discussions to locate those marginalized people from their homes and help them benefit from the services. RC follows its strong internal organizational regulations to avert any effort or risk of aid diversion for any unintended purposes. 
All medical equipment and supplies provided to health facilities will be delivered directly to the facility following formal government delivery voucher system.</narrative>
