   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Saving lives of Conflict affected IDPs and Disaster affected host communities through WASH intervention in Hudet, Moyale and Qadhaduma Woredas of Dawa Zone, Somali Regional State</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Based on the rapid assessment made by NCA in the Month of November 2019, the WAASH needs of the proposed three Woredas, Hudet, Moyale and Qadhaduma is still very high. The three woredas have critical water shortage and have poor sanitation and hygiene coverage. People are using untreated water from open and unsafe sources like Ponds and Birkas. Coupled with poor sanitation amp hygiene practices this has posed the risk of AWD in the proposed woredas. Information obtained from Hudet Woreda Health Office indicated that in the month of October 262 cases of AWD were reported in 17 kebeles where Woreda Health Office managed the issue in 2 CTC centres. Secondary data also shows that 14 suspected cases of AWD are also reported in other part of Mayal in Oromia during this assessment time (November 2019). IDPs hosted in both woredas have limited access to latrine facilities. Compared to the number of people in the camps, the communal latrines are not only inadequate but also not gender segregated and have no proper doors and locks to ensure privacy of women and girls, which in turn could cause the risk of GBV. Due to absence of adequate latrine open defecation is widely practiced both in IDP camps and in the host communities. Such practice could easily contaminate the unprotected water source and aggravate the risk of water borne disease including AWD. People were unable to maintain the sanitation of the communal latrines as well as their own personal hygiene due to shortage of water. IDPs have no sanitation materials including dignity kits and hence girls and women are facing critical problems mainly at times of ministration. The heavy rain received in the area damaged some unprotected water sources like ponds, birkas and hoofer dams resulted the death of thousands of animals damaged the already poor conditioned road and devastated irrigable lands and water canals around Dawa river.  Consequently, huge number of IDPS residing in the proposed woredas and the host communities are leading miserable life. 
In response to the current identified emergency WASH needs, NCA along with its partner will support the local efforts by rehabilitating non-functional water schemes, drilling of new shallow wells amp hygiene and sanitation promotion. The main activities include 
	Rehabilitation of one bore hole in Hudet, Chekorsa kebele including replacement of submersible pump with all accessories, rehabilitation of 2 water points amp connecting with existing solar power,  
	Drilling of 4 shallow wells using NCA drilling PAT ((1 in Ketema Kebele, 1 in elkur, 1 in Elder  and the other 1 in the town of Qadhaduma), which includes hand pump installation, casing, supply of filter material, well development, concrete grouting, water quality test amp well head construction). 
	Rehabilitation of 1 Shallow well in Moyale Woreda of Gulala kebele, including replacement of hand pump, headwork maintenance and fencing, 
	Strengthen and train 6 WASHCOs with 7 members each (3 females and 4 males), 
	Provision of 683,964 sachets of HH water treatment chemicals, 
	Provision of 4 drums of 70% HTH Chlorine,
	 Provision of 3000 buckets with capacity of 20 litter, 
	Construction of 22 gender disaggregated semi-permanent communal latrine with 4 stances each, 
	Conduct Continuous hygiene promotion to all target population, 
	Conduct 9 hygiene and sanitation campaign, 
	Provision of 75,996 bathing and laundry soaps,
	Provision of 3000 jerricans with 20 litter capacity,
	 Provision of Dignity kit for 1100 reproductive age women (10 sanitary pad and 5 underwear to each beneficiary),</narrative>
