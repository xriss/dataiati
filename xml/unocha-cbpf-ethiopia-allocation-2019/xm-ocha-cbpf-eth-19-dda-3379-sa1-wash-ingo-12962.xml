   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Lifesaving Emergency WASH Response to IDPs and host communities through Provision of safe water supply and Installation of sanitation facilities in IDP sites, Bale zone; Leghidha, Sawena and Dawe Sarar Woredas</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The proposed intervention will provide life-saving WASH services assistance to 4827 households or 56, 176 individuals (23,183 M and 32,993 F IDP) due to inter-communal conflict between Somali and Oromo at different time since September, 2017 and who are in critical need of continuing humanitarian response mainly emergency WASH intervention and will assist 5876 household or 29,380 individuals (8516 Male and 20,864 Female of the local hosting communities impacted by drought due to failure of seasonal rain in two low land Woredas Viz. Lagahidha, and  Saweyna of Bale zone Oromia regional state. 
As it has been clearly indicated in Ethiopia Immediate Humanitarian Funding Priorities In 2018, Ethiopia saw a dramatic increase in internal displacement as a result of inter-communal violence in various pockets of the country like low land woredas of bale zone bordering Somali region. At present, there are around 3 million internally displaced persons nationally, of which around 2.4 million of whom were displaced by violence. Given the scale and the frequency of the violence being reported, and pending a political solution, more displacements are expected to occur in the country, and the internally displaced people (IDPs) will continue to require multi-sector assistance well into 2019. 

Protection risks and lack of access to safe water and sanitation coupled with poor hygiene and sanitation are also still rife in displacement areas and in drought and flood-affected communities, posing serious health outbreak risks, including Acute Watery Diarrhea (AWD). Over 3,000 AWD cases were reported in 2018. While there has been a drastic reduction in the number of AWD cases being reported nationwide, the outbreak is still active in some regions of the country. The impact of poor sanitation practices on the health of IDPS and IDP returnees is particularly concerning, especially in areas where the infrastructure is weak.

Displacement Tracking Matrix round 15 (DTRM R15) conducted by IOM country wide there are large number of displaced peoples in Oromia region next to Somali. The two major factors induced displacement in the region, Oromia, were Climate and Conflict, out of which conflict induced displacement holds high share. Totally there are around 859,290 displaced peoples in over 472 sites. People displaced due to conflict 694,696, due to climate 114935 and due to other factors 49,658 in Oromia region. 

According to 2019 Ethiopian Humanitarian Response Plan (HRP) Lack of access to safe water and sanitation coupled with poor hygiene practices continue to pose disease outbreak risks, including Acute Watery Diarrhea (AWD) in parts of the country. The impact of poor sanitation practices on the health of IDPS and IDP returnees is particularly concerning, especially in areas where the infrastructure is weak and where depleted water table limit access to safe water.

As per the report by Bale zone DRM currently there around 121,211 IDPs due to inter communal conflict between Oromia and Somali region since September 2017. 

The 2018 rains were generally satisfactory in most parts of the country. Despite this, pastoralist and agro-pastoralist communities including the target Woredas suffered two previous consecutive years of severe droughts and who have lost productive assets, as well as pocket areas that suffered failed seasonal rains in 2018, will continue to require coordinated humanitarian assistance and recovery support throughout 2019.

The project will be implemented through direct intervention by the IRC by as per the gaps identified at IDPs and hosting communities with critical WASH needs in two districts of the Bale zone and coordinating with other agencies including UNICEF and government organizations in the WASH Cluster members at all level. 

This project aims to address critical gaps of WASH services needs at IDPs sites and host communities through Provision of safe water through water trucking.</narrative>
