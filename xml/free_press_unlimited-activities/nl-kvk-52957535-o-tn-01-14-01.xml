   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Free Press Unlimited, with the support of the Netherlands Embassy, has been assisting the Media Development Centre (MDC &#x2013; Centre du Developpement des Media) in Tunis, to implement a programme to promote investigative reporting and to establish a network of investigative reporters in Tunisia. Such a programme will highlight questions of human rights and freedom of expression.</narrative>
  </description>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The overall objective is to enhance freedom of the press in Tunisia, by developing the capacity of journalists to investigate and report on topics of interest to local audiences.</narrative>
  </description>
  <description type="4">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Tunisia is one of three Arab countries which has adopted a freedom of information law. There is however, no proper mechanism for overseeing the implementation of this law. Nevertheless, the new right to access to information gives journalists an important opportunity to develop investigative reporting as one means to win audiences. Tunisian journalists now enjoy better conditions than their counterparts in most other Arab countries and are in a position to set a regional example for responsible reporting on issues of paramount concern to citizens. Issues for investigative reporting are numerous. Social change, Tunisian state under-performance in the delivery of basic services, mismanagement of government funds, corruption (both state and private), imbalances in regional development, the lack of development in rural areas and similar issues which directly affect citizen&#x2019;s daily lives provide ample opportunities for journalists to demonstrate the importance of a free and responsible media industry. Investigative reporting which observes international standards of professionalism can stimulate beneficial public debate and enable the media to play a critical role in holding the authorities and private enterprise to account for their actions. As in countries with advanced, professional media, this can increase public awareness of issues and stories that those in positions of authority often try to hide, eventually helping to create a more transparent and responsible society. It will also help to develop a greater public awareness of human rights and the need for freedom of expression in support of a more progressive society which recognises and responds to the needs of all Tunisian citizens.</narrative>

A ubstantial prize of EUR 1,500 will be awarded as first prize and EUR 1,000 as second prize. The awarding of the prize and the winning reports will be publicised in the Tunisian media. The Award for the Best Investigative Story will help to set quality standards as well as serving as an incentive for journalists to focus on investigative reports of in- terest to Tunisian audiences.</narrative>

     <narrative xml:lang="EN">A combined networking event will be organised for both training groups. This will be focused around a workshop on organisational development, aimed at enabling the most active journalists to establish a more formal association for investigative journalists, similar to those already established elsewhere, such as the Amman-based Arab Reporters for Investigative Journalism (ARIJ), the leading investigative journalists&#x2019; group in the MENA region. The Moroccan Association of Investigative Journalists (AMJI) is another association which can serve as a model for a Tunisian association. While some Tunisian journalists are already members of ARIJ, a specifically Tunisian association would focus on local Tunisian issues, and organise future training and other activities to promote investigative reporting in the country. This association will be led by the journalists themselves in order to ensure commitment and ownership.</narrative>
