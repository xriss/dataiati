   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Promoting Internet freedom in South Caucasus</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">During the project period, distinguished media analysts, media lawyers, Internet activists, ICT experts from Georgia, Armenia and Azerbaijan worked closely together in order to address the challenges of Internet freedom in the South Caucasus. The findings, the monitoring and the recommendations of the working groups were made available online for all media workers and Internet users, to influence the legal frameworks and stimulate public debate about freedom of expression and access to public information in the three countries. Another group, comprised of bloggers, local advocates and activists were brought together in Tbilisi, to enhance their skills through training on security, social media strategy, info-activism and sensitive issues reporting. This project also established the South Caucasus Internet Freedom Platform, which promotes transparency and democratic decision making.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Overall Project Goal: The project aims to make journalists real agents of democratic change. The explicit objectives of the project were: 1. To strengthen the capacity of three partner organizations to monitor Internet development and freedom in Georgia, Armenia and Azerbaijan &#x2013; broadening the diversity of available information empowering citizens in acting against lack of democracy and transparency. 2. To strengthen the capacity of Internet activists, bloggers and advocates from the three countries enabling them to use the vast experience and expertise in promotion of free Internet practices. 3. To establish a regional platform which brings knowledge, stories, and research together, tapping on all regional resources in order to consolidate Internet access, Internet literacy and push for democratic change.</narrative>

  <description type="3">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project targets highly-motivated Internet activists, bloggers, local advocates, media analysts and media lawyers from Azerbaijan, Armenia and Georgia with necessary skills and strong commitment to democratisation and regional cooperation. In addition to capacity building activities for the three partner organisations, the skills of five Internet activists/bloggers, advocates from each country, selected on the basis of their portfolio, motivation and command of the English language, will be advanced through trainings. The indirect beneficiaries are the organizations/communities where these activists, advocates operate and the broader audiences in each country.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project was originally planned for the period from 2013-07-01 until 2014-06-30. This was extended to 2014-12-31, at which point the project finished. However, the situation in Azerbaijan aggregated deeply during the second half of 2014 and it continued to remain repressive also in the first quarter of 2015. The final meeting that was planned to be organized in Baku by IRSF in the frame of this project could not take place. In August 2014, the director of IRSF Emin Huseynov went into hiding. As IRSF team had their hands busy defending other human rights activists, the Government started interrogating them and their family members. The rest of IRSF team has been interrogated and got travel bans. The whole activity of the organization has been suspended. Working with a foreign NGO and cooperating with Armenian or Georgian colleagues have been impossible in these circumstances. To address these developments and to further promote all the objectives of this regional project, Free Press Unlimited and its partners decided to add a follow up from 2015-08-06 until 2016-01-06, using the funding that was left over from the original project budget and some additional funds. The follow up involves updating the internet freedom report, raising awareness of the online internet freedom platform, organising a conference to bring together the partner organisations from the different countries. Furthermore, the extra funds for the project will be used for emergency support to reorganizate and possible relaunch IRFS through social media. We are also considering to make use of the meeting in Tbilisi to raise solidarity for the situation of media and civil society organizations in Azerbaijan.</narrative>

This analysis will be carried by the same team of experts involved in the regional project, though in the case of Azerbaijan they are dispersed.
