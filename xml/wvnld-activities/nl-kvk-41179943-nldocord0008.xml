   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Target Groups Description FSL activities (incl. mainstreamed protection) target vulnerable HHs that have arrived in/ returned to Ouham Pende during the last 3 months and that have limited livelihoods options as most assets were lost when fleeing their homes. Other targeted vulnerable HHs are female- and child-headed HH, pregnant or lactating women, people with disabilities, people with HIV, elderly people and those hosting orphans. Child Protection activities target vulnerable children that are affected by the fragile context in CAR. Many have lost one/both of their parents and are now head of the HH and taking care of siblings. Host families who take in UASC are often already poor, so that HH vulnerability increases when hosting these children.</narrative>
