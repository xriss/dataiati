  </title>
  <description>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The purpose of this project is to support conservation efforts in Burundi, Cameroon, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Rwanda, and Sao Tome and Principe by developing the organizational management skills of protected area managers. This project is intended to improve the implementation of conservation actions in Central Africa by developing the ability of early-career managers to achieve conservation goals. Specific activities include: (1) assessment of the competency gaps among at least 32 early career managers that represent at least 20 protected areas and community conservation areas; (2) adaptation or creation of training content to meet the specific needs identified through the competency framework process; (3) a training workshop to address known competency gaps for 14 early career managers who represent at least 10 protected areas; (4) development of personal theories of change and action plans for workshop participants to link improved management competencies to improved habitat and species conservation; (5) structured and ad hoc mentorship to workshop participants; (6) development of a network among workshop participants using social media, email lists and other communication channels; (7) survey at the project&apos;s end to compare baseline, immediate post-training and end-of-project competency levels; and (8) analysis of survey information to identify barriers and enabling conditions for effective competency training.</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">The primary goal of U.S. assistance in Rwanda is to support the country&apos;s commitment to tackle development challenges in order to achieve sustainable, broad-based economic and social transformation that expands opportunity and increases national and regional security and stability. To achieve this goal, U.S. assistance will strengthen the capacity of the health system to deliver high quality care and provide support for Rwandans to utilize and apply high-impact health and nutrition practices. U.S. assistance will support innovative, targeted agricultural investments in key crops as well as policy reforms to encourage greater agriculture investments, regional trade, and increased nutrition outcomes alongside sustainable growth in the agriculture sector. U.S. support for foundational literacy skills for children in lower primary schools, as well as youth employment training, provide a long-term foundation for skills building needed in a workforce oriented towards a service-based economy. In addition, U.S. assistance will support reforms that promote government accountability, respect for human rights and greater democratization of decision-making by building the capacity of relevant civil society and other key actors, improving justice and advancing reconciliation in this post-genocide country, as well as ensuring participatory planning with local populations and stakeholders, and encouraging improved community relationships. U.S. assistance will also support the continued professionalization of Rwandan military personnel participating in regional peacekeeping operations aiming to improve civilian command and control over the military and mutual respect of human rights. All U.S. assistance will integrate gender equality and women&apos;s empowerment to ensure that men and women equally participate in and benefit from the country&apos;s development.</narrative>
