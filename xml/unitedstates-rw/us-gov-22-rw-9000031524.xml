    <narrative xml:lang="EN">The primary goal of U.S. assistance in Rwanda is to support the country&apos;s commitment to tackle development challenges in order to achieve sustainable, broad-based economic and social transformation that expands opportunity and increases national and regional security and stability. To achieve this goal, U.S. assistance will strengthen the capacity of the health system to deliver high quality care and provide support for Rwandans to utilize and apply high-impact health and nutrition practices. U.S. assistance will support innovative, targeted agricultural investments in key crops as well as policy reforms to encourage greater agriculture investments, regional trade, and increased nutrition outcomes alongside sustainable growth in the agriculture sector. U.S. support for foundational literacy skills for children in lower primary schools, as well as youth employment training, provide a long-term foundation for skills building needed in a workforce oriented towards a service-based economy. In addition, U.S. assistance will support reforms that promote government accountability, respect for human rights and greater democratization of decision-making by building the capacity of relevant civil society and other key actors, improving justice and advancing reconciliation in this post-genocide country, as well as ensuring participatory planning with local populations and stakeholders, and encouraging improved community relationships. U.S. assistance will also support the continued professionalization of Rwandan military personnel participating in regional peacekeeping operations aiming to improve civilian command and control over the military and mutual respect of human rights. All U.S. assistance will integrate gender equality and women&apos;s empowerment to ensure that men and women equally participate in and benefit from the country&apos;s development.</narrative>
