   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Puntland Democratic Governance Programme (PDGP), with the overall objective of supporting democratic governance in 6 districts in Puntland (Armo, Dangorayo,&#xA0;Waciye, Badhan, Boame and Harfo) was implemented between November 2016 and April 2019. This was followed by a nine months cost extension from May 2019 &#x2013; January 2020&#xA0;mainly focused on outcomes 1-4 and with a geographical&#xA0;expansion to 9 additional&#xA0;districts in Puntland and South West State (PL: Iskushuban, Hafun, Bargaal, Godob-jiran, Taleh and Dhahar&#xA0; SW: Elberde, Berdale and Dinsoor)&#xA0;&#xA0;
The programme has had 5 expected outcomes, namely:
Outcome 1:&#xA0;Empowered citizens (women, men and youth) in the targeted districts understand and engage in democratic processes (district development planning, electoral processes and decision making processes)&#xA0;
Outcome 2:&#xA0; District councils in the selected districts are accountable to their citizens.
Outcome 3:&#xA0;Empowered citizens (women, men and youth) and custodial corps/prison warders in 6 districts know, respect and promote human rights&#xA0;

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">District development planning (DDP): Before the programme, in the targeted 6 districts, there were no district development plans and no efforts had been made towards formulating of any. The programme has developed and completed DDPs in the 6 districts, where a total of 5,400 (40% women, 30% youth, 30 % men) rights holders participated in the process.&#xA0;
Civil registration framework: Before the program, there were no registration offices nor frameworks in any of the six districts. Now, these districts have offices and a civil registration framework and have started registration, particularly of births. The civic and voter education meetings in the targeted districts reached a total of 324,000 people (40% female, 30% male and 30% youth) with knowledge on civic and voter education.
Women political participation: The programme involved 10,800 rights holders, with the aim of mobilizing and encouraging women activist and organizations to promote their political, social, and economic rights and be an assertive block of the society. The program supported the development of a women&#x2019;s political participation strategy to facilitate women to have a congregate plan to promote the political, social, and economic rights. Women groups started political campaigns for the district council elections in late 2019. In Badhan women secured 9 out of 28 seats of the district council.
Taxation and resource mobilization: The program trained 40 officials at the district level in a bid to support the districts raise resources for basic service delivery. The districts developed taxation frameworks and resource mobilization plans. The target districts administrations now collect all taxation in their districts using the frameworks developed. The number of the people that pay tax has increased in the districts.
Monitoring committees: The program supported the establishment of district structures comprising of 4 rights holders of both genders from each of the 9 towns in each of the 6 districts. The monitoring committees did not exist before the start of the program. These 216 monitoring committee members represented the community and closely worked with the District Councils to ensure that interests of citizens were addressed, and the local authorities were accountable to the people.&#xA0;
Protection and promotion of human rights improved the awareness and the knowledge of right holders:&#xA0; Currently, 68.3% of the rights holders in the districts are aware of basic human rights, compared to the 33% reported at the start of the program.
The program placed six&#xA0;Human Rights Monitors (HRM) in the districts to collect information on human rights violations. The HRM reported a total of 115 violations. 10.4% of the cases were resolved through legal proceeding while the rest were traditional elders&#x2019; resolutions.
At the start of the program, at least 23% of rights holders had experienced human rights violations in the hands of police and custodial corps, thus the program trained 108 (16.6% female)&#xA0;custodial corps and police officers&#xA0;on understanding police ethics and respect of human rights in police proceedings, democratic principles and gender equality. The program has contributed to changing the attitudes and behaviours of custodial corps and police officers through the training. Currently, 92.8% of rights holders cite the police as their preferred entity to report crime to, compared to 57% at the start of the programme.
The program trained 1,200 women in business dynamics in the six target districts. In each district, 200 women were trained on market dynamics, business literacy and how to establish and maintain successful&#xA0;business trade associations. Women traders are now into business associations, engaged in Puntland chamber of commerce and have diversified and expanded their businesses.
Unexpected results:
During the initial discussions on the DDP in Armo district, two clans that had always had conflict and were not engaging with each other, were brought together by the process of the DDP.&#xA0; The two clans realized that in order to benefit from the planning process, it was prudent that they put their differences aside and combined their efforts.&#xA0;
Although emergency response was not part of the programme, Diakonia supported 15,530 beneficiaries (2,588 households) in&#xA0; Badhan district with lifesaving food assistance, water provision, de-stocking and disaster risk reduction interventions. When the emergency occurred, consultations were made with community leaders who felt that the project should not be suspended as a result of the drought because the disaster was temporary, while the need for good governance and accountability and issues of corruption were perennial problems that needed to be tackled with urgency. Although activities were unaffected, the program remained vigilant and sensitive to the needs of the people in each district and gauged whether to proceed with planned activities. The possibility to complement the PDGP with humanitarian action is a good practice to be reproduced in possible future emergencies, this has also led to the inclusion of the inclusion of Disaster Risk Reduction plans in the new phase of the programme, DHRR.&#xA0;
During the mid-term evaluation, it was noted that POHRD documented cases of human rights violations, but there were no reports of follow-up actions after cases were reported. It was recommended that this issue be addressed by the institution. This recommendation was taken up and it was established in the final evaluation, that POHRD now has such records. This was noted as a good practice where the M&amp;E process is used to improve quality of project implementation.
The lack of functional courts and proper jails or police cells in some of the six districts were cited as limiting the good intention of promotion of human rights even among custodial corps who had been trained and were willing to implement Human Rights. In response to this observation, districts administration and rights holders took advantage of the pilot projects under the DDP and prioritized to either construct or rehabilitate police stations and improve on the condition of the police stations. This is a good example of how the DDPs were used to respond to urgent issues promoted by right-holders.
The PDGP process reveals that most citizens are ready for democratic governance involving elections through universal suffrage, while there is a lack of good will from those holding power. This includes clan elders and others who are direct beneficiaries of traditional systems. To be able to reach a system based on one person &#x2013; one vote, work is needed on all societal levels and more efforts must be made to break the traditional structures.
There has been improvement in the functionality of the judicial penal system, for example when people have committed crimes such as rape. People are tried and given custodial sentences. But because traditional courts are considered by some people to be superior, criminals from powerful clans or rich families can negotiate and pay compensation for their freedom. This makes the judicial system appear to apply justice differently based on the status of the person who has committed the crime. This is a mayor risk for the credibility of the judicial branch, and the democratic system as such. These aspects are important to include in the discussions and advocacy efforts with right holders and duty-bearer in the next period of the program.
At the initial process of the establishment and formation of women trade associations, there were some challenges where women traders expected the programme to provide them with grants for business expansion and diversification. The programme resolved the issue with continuous discussions and explanation with women traders to understand the purpose and value of women traders to come together and form association to support each other. In the future, such activities need to be considerate and careful to level expectations of the right holders at the beginning of the intervention.</narrative>
