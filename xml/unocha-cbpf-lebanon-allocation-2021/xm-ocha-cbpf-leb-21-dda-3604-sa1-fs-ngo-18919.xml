   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Providing food parcels and WASH kits for 400 Lebanese households and 80 Syrian households with at least one person with disability and one older person living in North Lebanon and Akkar.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Lebanon is facing an unprecedented situation. A series of multiple and consecutive shocks has worsened the country&#x2019;s socio-economic, political, and health situation.  A highly volatile currency, closely tied to political developments, further fueled inflation. This in turn severely hampers the ability of both Lebanese and refugee populations to access basic goods and services. The CPI witnessed inflation of 121.66% in April 2021 compared to April 2020 (CPI, CAS), while the Food Price Index (FPI) registered inflation of 423%. This has been exacerbated by the decreasing of the value of the Lebanese pound by 80% in the last year. An anticipated removal of food subsidies without an implementation of appropriate social safety nets programming, will severely impact access to adequate food and likely further increase the depth and breadth of food and nutrition insecurity in Lebanon.
The main target of this project is persons with disabilities and older persons who are facing exacerbated vulnerability due to the Lebanese economic crisis and the COVID-19 outbreak. The latter has increased their isolation, further impacting their capacity to cope and reducing their access to community support (LCRP Situation Update, December 2020). According to the same report, persons with disabilities and elderly people are facing severe lack of basic food items, chronic medicines shortages and the inability to cover health care costs, including mobility aids and home care supplies. The &quot;Assessing the Impact of the Economic and COVID-19 Crises in Lebanon&quot; report (WFP, 2020) indicated that families with at least one older person and with at least one member with disability have reported to be compromising their food consumption and apply severe coping strategies more often.  

In order to mitigate the above mentioned situation, and to address the emerging challenges and needs of Lebanese and refugees food insecure HHs this project will provide 2,880 nutritionally balanced food parcels paired with 1,440 WASH kits (1,140 Hygiene kits, 150 Baby kits, 150 Elderly kits) for 480 HHs for a duration of 6 months.
In alignment with the FSS priorities and LHF 2021 first standard allocation strategy paper, the targeted vulnerabilities of this project will be identified using a Validation Assessment prepared by LHF: 
- Persons with Disabilities (Men with disabilities, women with disabilities and children with disabilities).
- Older persons (Older women and older men)
- Households including at least one person with disability.
- Households including at least one older person.

The following distribution modalities are adopted to address the accessibility challenges faced by our targeted groups:
- Center-based distribution for the beneficiaries who are capable of safely accessing FoH centers without compromising their health situation.
- Home-based distribution done by the social workers for beneficiaries facing accessibility challenges. 
- Local level distribution.

Given that North Lebanon and Akkar are the most affected regions by the economic crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic. North Lebanon and Akkar have respectively 92% of HH and 91% of HH living under the Survival Minimum Expenditure Basket (LCRP Situation Update, December 2020). Moreover, FoH owns 3 centers in these 2 governorates which will ease the implementation of the project activities.</narrative>
