   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Providing 300 boys and girls in Akkar, North, Bekaa and Baalback Hermel with judicial protection services and building the capacity of 20 case workers in Bekaa on referring children to judicial pathways</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project proposes the following activities: 
1-Adequate response and follow up (Case management) for medium to high risk cases in need of judicial protection. 
The current economic situation has put children at greater risk of abuse, violence and exploitation, 
Under this proposed project, more than 300 children at medium and high risk of abuse will benefit from judicial protection case management services. 
Himaya was mandated by the ministry of Justice to handle judicial protection of children victims of abuse in North and Bekaa. 
The team is in urgent need of additional support to handle that number of cases who are in need of fast response as the child&apos;s life is at risk, but also in need of a significant level of investment, to cover assessments, home visits, reports, referrals and follow up. 
Despite the number of partners in the North and Bekaa, the capacity is still low. Himaya&#x2019;s role with the MoJ in both governorates is essential as In the North and Akkar, 25% of the cases were referred by International NGOs, 21% by  UPEL without Judge Assignment, 15% by Citizen, 13% by Judges and General Prosecutors, 10% by local NGOs, 7% by members of the family, 4% by beneficiaries themselves, 2% by himaya team members, 1% by the MOSA and 1% by Private Practice Professionals.

2 social workers will be covering the North region (T5 and Akkar) and responding to more than 120 cases (average of 60 new cases per social worker per 9 months), noting that covering governorates demands long field trips. One senior case manager will be fully working on supervising and coordinating the team members, making sure the assessment is properly done, coordinating with the general prosecutor and judge when needed.
2 Social workers for central and west Bekaa justice palace and 1 for North Bekaa, will be supervised by a senior case manager for both governorates and will be working on 180 cases (average of 60 new cases per social worker over 9 months) . 
2-Adequate child friendly and inclusive space to rehabilitate in the Justice Palace &#x2013; North Bekaa
The second proposed action In line with ensuring minimum standards of safety, comfort and inclusion to children, is the rehabilitation of the Justice Palace office accessed by children and their families when in need of protection. One room that is being used to welcome children and families, will be improved to meet child friendly space requirements. This room is often used to conduct assessment with children, or as a waiting room for some unaccompanied children, where the social worker tries to ensure their needs are met (food, safety, warmth, presence etc.) 
3-Training 20 case workers in the Bekaa on referral to judicial pathways of children in need of legal protection: 
The Bekaa governorates agencies still lack knowledge and guidance on how to properly refer cases of children to judicial protection, therefore himaya will build on its previous successful experience in conducting similar training for North case workers. This will directly have its positive impact on the referral and improve coordination among actors which will accelerate children access to judicial services. A PSEA component will be included in the training in Coordination with the PSEA network to enhance accountability towards affected populations.</narrative>
