   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The overall objective of the Action is to strengthen the protective environment for boys and girls at risk in Akkar and the North through an integrated Child protection and Psychosocial Support program. The project will contribute to address child protection by responding to the immediate needs through case management and focused psychosocial support, while simultaneously building a preventive and protective environment by raising the awareness of caregivers and community actors and by enhancing community based child protection on key child protection concerns - Child labor, child marriage and violence against children through building the capacities of existing youth committees to work with communities on CP related concerns in the targeted communities. In addition, it will reduce the vulnerability of children and caregivers by enhancing their knowledge, positive coping skills, and protective behaviors through FPSS/PSS and CP interventions and supporting caregivers to strengthen their protective role
The program will target children at risk and/or survivors of violence, abuse, and exploitation, including vulnerability criteria identified by the LHF and specifically: children at risk of drop out, children out of school, children with disabilities, working children and child survivors of SGBV. 
War Child will work with two National NGOs - HELP and Al Ribat Association - who have been long term partners of War Child. Ribat is well established in the North and will be leading the implementation in Tripoli and Minieh. Whereas HELP will lead the implementation in Akkar, specifically in Sahel and Dawse. War Child will be responsible for 1) the overall grant and project management, and donor engagement 2) the development of CSOs&apos; capacity on Psychosocial Support activities and overall case management supervision, coaching, and quality assurance 3) the development of CSOs capacity and front liners included in the project on PSEA in collaborations with CARE International and ABAAD and Child Safeguarding. 
War Child will build on its ongoing youth participation and community engagement initiatives by strengthening the engagement in Community Based Child Protection (CBCP) of existing youth committees &#x2013; who are long term partners in our programs. The two local partners, Al Ribat in the North (Minieh and Tripoli area) and HELP in Akkar (Sahel and Dawsw area)  will take on in the implementation of activities under the child protection component, including community based child protection, case management, FPSS and PSS with support from War Child team..
The action will directly target approximately 2730 participants, of which 2130 children (50% girls, 50% boys) and 600 adult caregivers (50% women, 50% men).
War Child has an established child protection program in Lebanon and has therefore considerable experience in implementing the proposed interventions including knowledge and expertise on case management and referral of vulnerable and at risk children, child safeguarding and existing child protection services both in centers and remotely. The project will benefit from the knowledge and expertise of the team, the existing cooperation with child protection actors, as well as from the inter connection with ongoing child projects that will facilitate identification and referral of vulnerable and at risk children (and their families). The action will target children, caregivers in addition to community actors and youth who will support in building a stronger protective environment</narrative>
