   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Provision of integrated and comprehensive primary healthcare services for vulnerable populations in three Primary Health Care Centers in Beirut and Mount Lebanon and North Bekaa areas</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The proposed project aims at improving access to quality, affordable and comprehensive primary health services for vulnerable populations in Lebanon. International Medical Corps (IMC) will support three Primary Health Care Centers (PHCCs) - Al Arz &#x2013; Zouk PHCC and Msaytbeh PHCC in Mount Lebanon and Beirut respectively, and Yamouneh PHCC in North Bekaa. Al Arz Zouk and Yamouneh PHCCs are considered non-traditional PHCCs.  Mystbeh PHCC was supported by IMC after the Beirut Port Explosion. It was among the centers that were considered as non-traditional, however after the explosion, the center was affected and IMC continued supporting the center as a part of the emergency response. Due to the economic situation, there is a significant increase in the number of patients of all nationalities who are seeking care at this center, and for that matter, IMC will maintain continuity of care for these patients. Health sector approval has been already received for this PHCC. Suggested activities will include the provision of primary health care consultations including mental health (MH), supply of pharmaceuticals, medical consumables, and Personal Protective Equipment (PPE). IMC will strengthen the integration of MH services into the primary healthcare system. Moreover, IMC will target communities on critical health topics by emphasizing health promotion, diseases prevention, and appropriate health-seeking behaviors. Selected PHCCs will also conduct acute malnutrition screening and referral for treatment of children under five, pregnant and lactating women, and will promote and counsel women on effective infant and young child feeding (IYCF) practices. The activities will mitigate and respond to the COVID-19 pandemic through screening for infection at selected PHCCs, the coverage of PCR testing for vulnerable groups to access health services including hospitalization, and support to COVID-19 case management by providing hospitals with PPEs. Community engagement will be enhanced through community surveillance for COVID-19 and multi-sectoral messaging on COVID-19, health, and MH. IMC will provide Clinical management of Rape (CMR) trainings to health workers at the selected facilities to increase their capacities to respond to the needs. 

International Medical Corps (IMC) is a US-registered independent affiliate organization of International Medical Corps (UK), IMC UK, with which IMC UK shares the same name and charitable objectives and mission. IMC UK and IMC work together to deliver assistance programs in an accountable and effective manner in pursuit of their commonly-held charitable objectives. IMC UK will engage IMC to implement its programs in the field, with IMC UK oversight, according to the terms and conditions of the agreement that results from this proposal and the terms of the parties&#x2019; administrative service agreement. Together with IMC Croatia, IMC provides administrative and operational support to IMC UK and to the programs on the ground, including but not limited to financial management, banking and cash management, procurement management/international procurements, and logistics.</narrative>
