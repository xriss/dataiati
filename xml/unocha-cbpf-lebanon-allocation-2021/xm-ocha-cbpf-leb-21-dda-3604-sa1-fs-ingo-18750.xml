   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The proposed integrated and equity-focused intervention will target food insecure households and provide life-saving assistance, including food parcel, WASH kits, and fruit and vegetable voucher distribution, as well as COVID-19 mitigation support, while contributing to local economic recovery for 3,150 beneficiaries in North Lebanon, (Al Batroun, Al Koura, Minnieh-Dennieh, Bsharri, Tripoli, Zgharta) between August 2021 and March 2022.CARE International in Lebanon (CIL) and its local partner, RMF (Rene Mouawad Foundation), will implement a two-prong food distribution approach. The combination of a dry food parcel distribution and a voucher scheme for fruits and vegetables will contribute to reducing malnutrition and negative coping strategies among target beneficiary groups. The voucher approach will also support the resilience of the communities at large through increased economic activity to local businesses and the reduction of food waste compared to in-kind fruit and vegetable distribution. Furthermore, to support ongoing mitigation efforts against the spread of COVID-19 and to improve hygiene practices Hygiene, Baby, and Elderly Kits with instructions for use will be provided alongside the dry food parcels and fruit and vegetable vouchers. CARE will leverage its extensive experience in such interventions through our current roaster of projects to ensure the timely and quality assured implementation of the project, also leaning on our experience with LHF 2020 allocation. In this proposed intervention and in line with CIL&#x2019;s partnership approach of implementing through partners, CIL shall be responsible for the implementation of the work plan, building and refining of RMF&#x2019;s capacities, procuring the food parcel and WASH kits, preparing the ( Information Education and Communication) IEC materials, disseminating the crosscutting messages and awareness sessions, validating the vulnerability assessments scoring, and selecting the eligible beneficiaries, as well as field monitoring of the distribution and leading the PDM process whilst RMF will be responsible for the outreach activities, identification of beneficiaries (through internal and external referrals provided by CIL) and organizing field and door-to-door distributions of the food parcels, vouchers, and WASH kits.CIL identified the main areas of capacity building required for RMF through the initial OCA conducted for RMF technical support will be provided by CIL staff or external consultants during the first month of the project. CIL will conduct regular follow-up and lessons learned meetings with RMF throughout the implementation. In addition to spot-check visits, the presence of the CIL project officer and PSEA focal point during distribution will allow direct communication with the beneficiaries.  CIL and RMF will target host, refugee, and migrant communities in underserved geographical areas whose vulnerabilities have been heightened by the pandemic and the far-reaching impact of the worsening socio-economic situation. Nationwide, 55% of households reported not having enough food, with North (56%) and Baalbak El-Hermel (63%), and Beirut (49%) reporting amongst the highest prevalence. These governorates also had the lowest proportion of households reporting the ability to stockpile food with North (37%), Baalbeck - El Hermel (37%), and Beirut (53%) (WFP World Bank, VAM 2020). The proposed intervention will target 350 (56%) vulnerable Lebanese households, 100 (16%) Migrants households, and 180 (29%) Syrian Refugee households.  CIL shall adopt the LHF validation questionnaire for the validation of beneficiaries, which has been approved and validated by the sector in coordination with WFP. The proposed intervention will be closely coordinated with other organizations with similar activities, FOH in the North as well as the PSEA network with the aim to avoid overlaps and maximize the efficiency of the project.</narrative>
