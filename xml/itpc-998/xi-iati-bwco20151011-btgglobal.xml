   <narrative xml:lang="EN">ITPC will attend and participate in relevant conferences such as the International AIDS Society Conference on HIV Science (IAS 2017) in Paris, the International Conference on HIV/AIDS and STIs in Africa (ICASA) 2017 in Abidjan and/or the in the International Congress on AIDS in Asia and the Pacific (ICAAP) 2017 in Bangladesh. As part of these participations, ITPC will present at and/or host meaningful sessions related to key population treatment access and human rights issues. Sessions and presentations will be guided by the outcomes to-date of the Missing the Target research project and the other key KPLHIV work. ITPC will also host three (3) regional treatment education trainings for KPLHIV activists and community organizations (25-35 participants) in Eastern Europe and Central Asia, South Asia, and East Africa. Trainings, which will be three days, will be guided by the Advocacy for Community Treatment (ACT) Toolkit, which was developed under Bridging the Gaps I (2015) and updated last year (2016). Topics and issues covered in the Toolkit include: the science of HIV, treatment initiatives, human rights and treatment, trade and treatment, financing and treatment, and community advocacy planning. Furthermore, within the three regions where regional trainings are held, ITPC will select five (5) countries in which to host national treatment education trainings for KPLHIV activities and community organizations. These trainings will follow the same structure and content as the regional trainings, but be tailored for specifically to the social and human rights context in each country. In order to better select the countries and training topics, ITPC will conduct a survey among KP partners to identify knowledge gaps and needs in access to treatment.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Participation in global conferences of this nature is key in order to bring visibility to the work done under Bridging the Gaps and promote community-driven initiatives for key populations. It is only when communities are experts on HIV, TB and Hepatitis C treatment that they can confidently engage at national, regional and global level. Investment in this area is key, not only for communities to better advocate for their health care (and therefore upholding human rights), but also so that communities can be meaningfully engaged in service provision.</narrative>
