  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">ITPC will host three (3) regional treatment education trainings for KPLHIV activists and community organizations (25-35 participants) in Eastern Europe and Central Asia, South Asia, and East Africa. Trainings, which will be three days, will be guided by the Advocacy for Community Treatment (ACT) Toolkit, which was developed under Bridging the Gaps I. Topics and issues covered in the Toolkit include: the science of HIV, treatment initiatives, human rights and treatment, trade and treatment, financing and treatment, and community advocacy planning. Furthermore, within the three regions where regional trainings are held, ITPC will select five (5) countries in which to host national treatment education trainings for KPLHIV activities and community organizations. These trainings will follow the same structure and content as the regional trainings, but be tailored for specifically to the social and human rights context in each country.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">It is only when communities are experts on HIV, TB and Hepatitis C treatment that they can confidently engage at national, regional and global level. Investment in this area is key, not only for communities to better advocate for their health care (and therefore upholding human rights), but also so that communities can be meaningfully engaged in service provision.</narrative>
