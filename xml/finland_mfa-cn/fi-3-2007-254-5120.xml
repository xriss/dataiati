   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Community Health Education and Development in Kashgar. The Community Health Education and Development Project (CHED) in Kashgar focuses on training local village health workers and their trainers. Kashgar Prefecture is located in Xinjiang Province in far west China. Most of its 3.6 million inhabitants live in rural areas and represent a Chinese Muslim minority_ the Uighur. In the CHED project Fida partners with the Prefecture Health Bureau. Initial cooperation started already in 1995 as Fida was asked to assist in improving the water distribution system in the area. The first project was completed in 2001 and the focus was moved to the health sector. The project will train five trainers/ training coordinators in each of the prefecture&#xE2;&#x80;&#x99;s 11 counties. These trainers_ in turn_ will train altogether 3200 village health workers in the area in e.g. immunization and disease prevention. Also small needs-based health projects are conducted. By the end of 2006_ trainers in 5 counties had received their training and provided training to almost 700 village health workers. The village health workers form the lowest level of the present health system in Kashgar. When trained_ they will be able provide better health assistance in the villages and_ as a result_ the overall health awareness in the rural areas of Kashgar will improve.</narrative>
