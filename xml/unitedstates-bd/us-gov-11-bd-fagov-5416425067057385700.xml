    <narrative xml:lang="EN">Bangladesh - the world&apos;s eighth most-populous and fourth largest Muslim-majority country - is a key strategic partner for the United~States in South Asia. After more than two decades of six percent economic growth, Bangladesh&apos;s economy continues to grow rapidly. Bangladesh also faces a rise in violent extremism and the United~States continues to stand ready to help counter this threat. Bangladesh is a key international player on climate change and global food security, promotes regional cooperation in one of the least integrated regions in the world, and sustains global peace as the largest contributor of troops to peacekeeping operations. U.S.~assistance to Bangladesh will address persistent challenges in the areas of agricultural productivity and crop diversity, health care, access to quality education, nutrition, vulnerability to natural disasters, governance and the rule of law, supporting a stable democratic environment, and countering transnational security threats. U.S.~assistance will continue to focus on expanding economic opportunities for Bangladeshis in targeted areas, improving governance, and developing social services which will greatly contribute to the Government of Bangladesh&apos;s (GOB) goal of becoming a middle-income country by 2021 - its 50th year of independence.</narrative>
