  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Key development impacts of the project could be summarized as:   - Provide high-quality cement for Vietnams infrastructure development and construction secto:  The company has been running at over 100% capacity and is not able to meet demand.  Vietnams 8% growth over the past several years has been underpinned by infrastructure and construction sectors, which has been growing at over 10% annually.  The government has a stated policy to encourage more integrated cement capacity in Vietnam and to eventually scale-down polluting vertical shaft kiln technology plants. The Project will help the government achieve these development objectives.   - Supply underdeveloped south-central market:   Through development of new Nha Trang distribution terminal, the project will supply an undersupplied market and facilitate the development of local tourism resorts and infrastructure.   - Increase scale and efficiency of existing assets:   NSCC is already an efficient producer of high-quality cement employing about 465 people. The expansion will enable the company to achieve scale economies on overheads and higher efficiency overall, as well as generate more tax income.  The cement tanker will lower cost and increase reliability of cement deliveries to the Southern markets.  - Employment and Development of Remote Area:  The project will create incremental employment in the underdeveloped Nghi Son area. In addition to 125 permanent jobs, there will be significant construction employment. Due to the expansion of the company among other factors, Electricity of Vietnam (EVN) is building local power generating capacity which will help develop the area into an industrial zone.   - Strengthening VICEM Management:   The joint venture platform will help VICEM continue to improve its managerial, finance and marketing capabilities through working with Japanese partners.</narrative>

IFC proposes to provide an A Loan of up to $35 million and a B Loans of up to $33 million to support the Project.  The goal of the project is to help NSCC to:   - maintain its leading position in Vietnam by expanding its production capacity and distribution network,  - improve efficiency through economies of scale, and  - provide more high-quality cement to underserved areas.    The project will provide high-quality cement to support the growth of Vietnams infrastructure which is a critical component of the countrys development program, as well as to the commercial and residential construction sector.   NSCC is an IFC client to whom IFC provided a $30 million A loan ($5.8 million outstanding) and a $26.5 million B loan (fully repaid in 2006) for a $340 million 2.15 million tpy greenfield plant in 1998.

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">The companys plant is located in Hai Thuong commune, Tinh Gia district, Thanh Hoa Province, about 230 km south of the city of Hanoi, Vietnam.  In addition to the existing 2.15 million tpy NSP cement line, the facility includes limestone, sand and clay quarries, and a jetty/port which can accommodate vessels of 22,000 deadweight tons (DWT).  The plant was started construction in 1998 and went into commercial production in mid-2000.  The existing production line was based on the latest dry-process technology available at the time and the civil work was contracted to a foreign/local joint venture.  Mitsubishi Heavy Industries was the main equipment supplier and all equipment was imported from leading manufacturers.  In addition to the Thanh Hoa plant, the company has a distribution terminal located outside Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC) with a 15,000 ton storage silo.    Under the project, the company will build a second clinker and cement line with a capacity of 5,800 tons of clinker per day (or 2.15 million tons of cement per year) at the existing plant in Thanh Hoa, and erect a new cement distribution terminal with direct sea access in Ninh Thuy, Ninh Phuoc industrial zone, Khanh Hoa province. This distribution terminal will facilitate cement distribution in the south-central part of the country which is an underserved market, but has great potential for tourism development. As part of the project, the company will commission a new cement tanker to strengthen sea transportation links from Thanh Hoa to the southern markets.</narrative>
