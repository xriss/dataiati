The land includes buildings for workshops, warehouses, a canteen, an office and an auxilliary area, with easy access to local and regional highways.      Description of Company and Purpose of Project    	Vinh Phat is a successful private Vietnamese company which manufactures garments for export.  The Project is to help Vinh Phat expand its cut-make trim (CMT) garment production from 170,000 to 300,000 units p.a. over three years by expanding production space, improving facilities and increasing the number of sewing machines.  One hundred and five additional machines will be installed in two building additions to be constructed at the companys existing location.  These would include both basic and specialized sewing machines that will address the companys production bottlenecks. By expanding its capacity and improving productivity at this time, Vinh Phat will be able to meet existing and projected future demand.  The project will help the company to increase its exports and employment.      Environmental Category and Issues    	This is a category B project according to IFCs environmental review procedure.  Environmental, occupational health and safety issues associated with this project include: indoor air quality; wastewater treatment and discharge; workplace health and safety conditions; and fire protection and safety systems. As the expansion involves the addition of a second floor on the existing facility, there is an increased need to consider fire safety procedures and exit routes.  The project sponsor has installed fire extinguishers in existing rooms and will install them in the additional rooms once construction is complete.  Marked fire exit routes from the second floor sewing units are included in the construction plans.  The facility is regularly inspected for fire safety by local officials and staff receive training in fire saftey procedures.        The  is  from the Infoshop.
