   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Antara HCMC project involves the construction and operation of a 25,000 pallet-position cold storage facility in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.  This is a greenfield project.  The project site is located fifteen minutes from the center of Ho Chi Minh City, next to both the Phu My Bridge (under construction) and existing and planned port facilities.  The planned facility will use a cascading ammonia refrigeration system, and aims to be environmentally friendly with zero-carbon footprint and 100% treatment of effluents. The project is intended to provide high quality cold storage facilities to the seafood industry and other users. This is the first stage of a plan to develop a fully integrated national cold logistics network in Vietnam.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The proposed project will help strengthen local supply chains, contributing to the development of the warehousing and logistics industry in Vietnam, benefiting both suppliers and retailers of seafood and a broad range of other products, facilitating the flow of products to the consumers and improving their availability and prices.

The project will result in more efficient distribution of consumer goods for seafood and frozen food sectors, decreasing the spoilage rate and eventually decreasing distribution costs. 

The project will also give local businesses an opportunity to increasingly outsource their logistics services rather than operate in-house cold storage facilities, lowering their business inventory costs and working capital requirements, thus improving their efficiency and allowing companies to realize economies of scale in cargo storage, handling and transportation. A presence of a strong and competent logistics operator in Vietnam would support the growing seafood industry and allow Vietnam to target more quality-oriented markets, benefiting both local economy and consumers. It will also help to promote better standards among other cold storage providers competing in this market that will in turn facilitate the integration of Vietnam to the WTO. 

As a greenfield project, Antara will create new jobs at the cold storage warehouse itself and also indirectly by increasing the level of business activity and thus creating jobs in other related sectors such as seafood processing, fast food retailers, construction, and transportation.</narrative>
