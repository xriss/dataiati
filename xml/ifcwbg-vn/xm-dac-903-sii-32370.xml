   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Access to quality and affordable housing: The project will add a significant number of affordable housing units in Vietnam, an IDA country; improve living standards of the lower income population by giving them access to quality and affordable housing.   Infrastructure development: affordable/low income housing is currently under-supplied in Vietnam. Governmental support for the sector has been fairly weak and the Project will help improve the infrastructure for the low to middle income earners. Being a pioneer in developing affordable housing in Vietnam Nam Long will encourage other investors to serve the mid-low income population.  Employment creation and SME linkages: The Project will help create significant number of direct and indirect employment opportunities for the local communities as well as demand for locally sourced materials, services and labour both during and after construction phase; hence benefit the local community and SMEs.  Inclusiveness: Some EHome projects will be built in the suburb areas of Ho Chi Minh city or second tier cities; hence promote inclusive economic growth.</narrative>
