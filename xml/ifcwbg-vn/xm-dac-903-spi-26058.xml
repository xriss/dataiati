   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This proposed project is to provide a Vietnamese Dong (VND) denominated loan of up to $20 million equivalent with tenor of up to 7 years to Technological and Commercial Joint Stock Bank (Techcombank). This loan would support Techcombanks medium- and long-term lending capabilities to local small-and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) as well as help to better match its asset-liability profile. The VND loan will be fully funded by IFC through a USD-VND swap from an international bank operating in Vietnam. Techcombank is the third largest private (joint-stock) bank (JSB) in Vietnam with total assets of approximately $1.6 billion and equity of approximately $100 million as at the end of July 2007.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Vietnams banking sector is underdeveloped and credit to the private sector, at 50% of GDP, remains low. The sector is dominated by 5 state-owned banks with market and asset shares of around 60-70%.  A sector diagnostic conducted by IFCs regional Advisory Services team, the Mekong Private Sector Development Facility (MPDF), showed that:   - Only 20%-40% of households and private enterprises have access to finance;  - private financial institutions serve larger corporates and secure a large percentage of their revenues through payment and foreign exchange services;  - banking products and services are limited to basic loan and savings instruments, many of which do not address the needs of SMEs; and  - lending is generally very reliant on collateral, typically immovable assets.   As a result, a large segment of the private sector, particularly SMEs, remains un- or underserved. This project is expected to directly expand credit access to SMEs, build capacity for a strong SME-focused local bank, and indirectly improve market perception to commercially-priced long-term funding for SME lending, which could catalyze similar funding from commercial sources for further SME-lending activities.</narrative>
