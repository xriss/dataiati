   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Established in 1995, Nafoods Group Joint Stock Company (Nafoods or the Company) is a small but niche fruit manufacturer and exporter in Vietnam with a leading position in passion fruits. The Company is currently engaged in four business lines: fruit concentrate and puree, individually quick frozen (IQF) fruit products, passion fruit seedlings and more recently, fresh fruits. The Company is operating 2 manufacturing facilities in central and southern Vietnam with a total annual capacity of 12,000 tons of concentrate/puree and 7,900 tons of IQF. It also produces passion fruit seedlings in an area of 6 hectares (ha) in a mountainous area of Nghe An, central Vietnam. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, the Company posted net revenues of US$22.9 million, EBITDA of US$4.2 million and net profit of US$2.9 million.   Nafoods is approaching IFC for support to fund the construction of the second phase of the Long An factory; development of a passion fruit liquid extraction workshop and a packing house in Central Highland; R&amp;D expenses for development of citrus seedlings, implementation of technology for supply chain management and permanent working capital (the Project).</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Farmer reach: The Project is expected to increase the number of farmers who supply raw materials or are employed at the Company&apos;s own land by about 11,500. Much of the Company&apos;s operations are located in economically depressed or unproductive areas. Because Nafoods is planning to provide its suppliers with high quality seedlings from own nurseries and guidance on the planting density in exchange for off-take of the crop, the yields can improve from Vietnam average of 15-30MT/ ha to 45-50 MT/ ha. 

Jobs creation and linkages: The Project is expected to create 150 full time equivalent new jobs which represents an above average impact compared to other agribusiness investments of similar size.

Market creation: By supporting Nafoods, IFC is helping to strengthen the image of Vietnam as a reliable global supplier of passion fruit concentrate. In particular, the work planned by the Project to help rationalize the supply chain will also be beneficial to the broader sector. The resulting efficiencies are expected to both facilitate competition and put a pressure on less efficient smaller players (encouraging consolidation) and promote better practices throughout the value chain. Specifically, other passion fruit producers are expected to improve their traceability and food safety practices to match the efforts being undertaken by Nafoods.</narrative>
