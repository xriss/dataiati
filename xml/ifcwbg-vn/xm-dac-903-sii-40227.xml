   <narrative xml:lang="EN">AC Energy, Inc. (ACE or the Company) is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Ayala Corporation (Ayala) in the Philippines that engages in power generation. Since 2011, ACE has invested around US$1 billion in the power sector in the Philippines, Indonesia and, more recently, in Vietnam and Australia. It currently co-owns ~4GW (~1.8GW pro-rata share) of generation capacity in operation or under construction, including thermal, wind and solar assets in the Philippines, wind and geothermal assets in Indonesia, as well as solar assets in Vietnam.&#xA0;  IFC will make an anchor investment of US$75 million in the total US$300 million 5-year green bond (the Green Bond) public issuance by AC Energy Finance International Limited (the Issuer), a Cayman Islands wholly-owned subsidiary of ACE, listed on the Singapore Exchange. ACE will guarantee the Green Bond. The proceeds of the Green Bond will be used as ACEs equity and development capital for its renewable energy (RE) projects in the Philippines, Indonesia, Vietnam, Australia, and in other countries where ACE may operate. IFCs subscription to the Green Bond would be dedicated to RE projects in Vietnam only.</narrative>

Beyond the Project, the expected market-level impact is through improving market competitiveness through supporting private sector investment in Vietnam&apos;s energy sector. In addition, the Project is expected to contribute to market sustainability with strong demonstration effects of supporting the RE generation in the very nascent market in Vietnam.</narrative>
