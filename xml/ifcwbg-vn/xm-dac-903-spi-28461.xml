   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Increase in Recruitment and Development of Local Executive Staff:      The Project will support a client actively engaged in the recruitment, development, and retention of talented local executives to replace expatriate executive staff where appropriate.  The number of expatriate staff has already been halved from November 2007 to the present in an effort to control costs and develop local talent instead.    Improved Environmental and Social Performance:      The Project will support PMIs attainment of Chain of Custody certification for the sourcing of its wood supply.  In addition, IFCs proposed investment will encourage the Company to explore the possibility of cleaner production opportunities, including raw material conversion efficiency and energy generation from wood dust.    Increased Linkages with the Local Economy:      Almost 80% of the goods purchased by PMI from its top 10 suppliers is from local Vietnamese companies.  The proposed IFC investment will continue to assist the Company in supporting local suppliers and the local economy.     Demonstration Effect:      The proposed IFC investment will support a key industry in the region facing a challenging market situation, sending a positive message to the market.  Furthermore, by investing in an operationally restructured entity, a very important signal is being sent to the market that an appropriate response to financial challenges is to address the underlying operational causes and dealing with those issues directly as PMI has done through professionalizing management and shedding excess non-performing assets, is worth investors support.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Paul Maitland International, Inc. (PMI or the Company) is an existing IFC client and a maker of high-end European style furniture with manufacturing operations based in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.  The Company was established in 1996 in Vanuatu and was re-domiciled to the British Virgin Islands (BVI) in 1998.  The Company&apos;&apos;s business model involves a process whereby all products are manufactured in Theodore Alexander HCM Ltd., (TA), its 100%-owned Vietnam subsidiary, for sale to global dealers through PMIs sales and distribution subsidiaries.  The Company is export-driven and generates all its revenues in U.S. dollars.    Project Description: The Project consists of 1) the refinancing of TAs permanent working capital, 2) the development of the Companys U.S. distribution program, 3) refinancing short term debt, and 4) supporting TAs FY2010  2011 capital expenditures program.  Total project cost is estimated to be $20 million and IFC proposes providing an A loan of up to $10 million.  The remainder of the project cost is expected to be funded by a local bank ($4 million) and internally generated cashflow ($6 million).    In March 2006, IFC provided an $8 million A loan primarily to support TAs permanent working capital needs.  Currently, only $2.4 million of the original A loan remains outstanding.  The loan is planned to be completely repaid by December 2010.</narrative>
