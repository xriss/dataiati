   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project aims to build capacity &amp; strengthen understanding of stakeholder research needs to
facilitate the effective functioning of the Baby Friendly Community Initiative (BFCI; a community-based
public health programme supporting health, growth &amp; development of infants) within African primary
care health systems. Members of our team have shown the BFCI&#x2019;s efficacy within a randomised
controlled trial (RCT) in Kenya and the Kenyan government is committed to scaling the BFCI. The
challenge of this transition from RCT to scale is to embed the programme effectively into the health
system working with existing resources. The team will engage with community, national and regional
stakeholders to; 1) Share understanding of the BFCI, 2) Identify needs for research and develop a
whole systems-based strategy for the BFCI uptake and dissemination in Kenya and into other African
health systems, and 3) Build capacity in health economics and systems science between the UK &amp;
Kenyan teams.</narrative>
