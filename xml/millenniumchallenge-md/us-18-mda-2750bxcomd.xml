   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Moldova: Moldova and the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) have signed a five-year, $262 million MCC compact aimed at reducing poverty and accelerating economic growth. The compact focuses on irrigation reconstruction, access to agricultural finance, and the rehabilitation of an integral section of the country&apos;s national road network.  Moldova is a low income country, the poorest country in Europe. Agriculture has long been the country&apos;s economic foundation. Farming accounts for more than 40 percent of employment and 17 percent of the country&apos;s gross domestic product. Moldova&apos;s agriculture currently suffers from low productivity, contributing to high rates of rural poverty. In addition, the deteriorated quality of Moldova&apos;s roads has been cited as a constraint to economic growth, as it raises the costs of internal and external production and trade.</narrative>
