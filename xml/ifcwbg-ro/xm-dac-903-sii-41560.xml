   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Agricover Credit IFN S.A. (IFN or the Company) is the only Romanian financial institution specialized in financing the agricultural sector. The Company is part of the Agricover Group (AG or the Group), an integrated agricultural group and one of the largest agri-traders in the country whose main operations include: (i) grain sourcing, trading, and logistics services; (ii) distribution of agricultural inputs; (iii) short and medium-term financing; (iv) insurance brokerage; (v) fuel distribution; and (vi) trading of meat and livestock.
