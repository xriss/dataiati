      <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Tanzanian government has expressed the need to industrialize in order to create jobs for millions of young Tanzanians and to build a modern economy for the country and its people. For the country&#x2019;s young people to play a role, however, they need to be equipped with the right skills and entrepreneurship opportunities to help the country to achieve its vision. Addressing the challenges facing Tanzania is impossible without widened participation in technological innovation. The recent Sahara Sparks seminar on the &#x201C;Fourth Industrial Revolution&#x201D; also emphasized that digital innovations can have a huge positive impact on the development agenda of the country. 
Through its National Vision 2025, Tanzania aims at becoming a middle-income modern economy. Moreover, the National Science and Technology Policy of 1996 (currently under review) acknowledges science, technology and innovation as key tools for fostering industrial development and eventually developing into a modern economy. 
Tanzania&#x2019;s STI (Science Technology and Innovation) development strategies are in line with the United Nations&#x2019; sustainable development goal nine (9) which considers investment in infrastructure and innovation as crucial drivers of economic growth and development. Furthermore, a strong and organized innovation ecosystem can also be instrumental in tackling wicked (inter)national challenges such as the current COVID-19 pandemic.  
To pave the way for this, signi?cant investments in resources that nurture the skill sets of individual innovators, start-ups and innovation service delivery (hubs) are essential. This does not only require an innovative mindset, but also the ability to make relevant links between socioeconomic challenges and innovative solutions. Furthermore, investment in institutions to drive change at a national level, support for infrastructure and policy are all needed to strengthen the innovation ecosystem.
UNDP&#x2019;s Strategic Plan 2018-2021 emphasizes the need to innovate  to id</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">Salum Awahd and Christof Hawle were hired under the PIP to create the entire program document. The work, which included a staffing plan, budget, fund management plan, and multi-year work plan, was completed and accepted by UNDP at the end of 2021. Under the terms of Salum Awahds contract, legal counsel was sought from Clyde and Co. They suggested that the Funguo Facility be registered as a Company Limited by Guarantee at first, and then as a Trust after further consultation.

The Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) was formed to inform and guide the program document drafting phase. The TAC was made up of SDC, Vodacom, Sahara Ventures, UNDP, FCDO, EU, and COSTECH as an observer. When it came time to launch the project, the TAC met on a regular basis to advise the consultants working on the project document and became a member of the Program Board. The investment in this TAC was extremely beneficial because it allowed COSTECH to observe and participate in the process, addressing concerns they had during a two-day workshop in October to define COSTECHs role in the project.



The TAC also allowed key development partners to stay informed about the program and earmark funds in their work stream for it before it was fully presented and completed. Partnerships and roles were identified as part of the process of developing the ProDoc and outlining funding opportunities. These are evident in the ProDoc, where the roles of each stakeholder are clearly defined. In addition, a partnership matrix was created, indicating which stakeholders could be approached for specific assistance. Relevant stakeholders were consulted on a regular basis, both through the TAC and bilateral meetings.



The Program Board was comprised of ten members: NEEC, TPSF, UNDP, MIT, MoEST, COSTECH, FCDO, EU, SDC, and Germany. On January 18th, the Board met and approved the ProDoc for LPAC. MoEST and UNDP approved and signed the meeting minutes, which were then uploaded to ALTAS.

There was a big plan for hiring human resources. TORs were created for UNV recruitment, and Chris Makayo was hired as a UNV to help with program development. Alexa du Plessis was hired as a consultant to secure funding and begin operationalizing the ProDoc and Facility. The P3 Program Specialist role was advertised, and over 340 applications were received on April 15th, but was later changed to a Programme Manager role. Mr. Joseph Manirakiza, the new programs programme manager, has been hired, and more positions are being filled.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Funguo Program has received initial payments of GBP590,000/$800,000 from FCDO, as well as a firm commitment from the EU for an additional 5MEUR/6MUSD, as well as a commitment from UNDP for 5MUSD. This brings total resource mobilization to $11.8MUSD, exceeding the resource mobilization target by 4.8MUSD. The above-mentioned negotiations with SIDO and TIRDO have stymied the EU contract.

The UNDP has put in a lot of effort to figure out how to set up the Facility the best way possible. It has become clear that UNDP is not permitted to register or establish a legal entity, but it is permitted to hire a company or fund a program that includes this as one of its activities. However, UNDP is not permitted to capitalize a fund or have its funds disbursed as loans of any kind (including repayable grants). This, along with the size of the funds (1.4MUSD) to be channeled through the Responsible Partner for the establishment and operation of the Funguo Facility and Fund, has raised red flags in regional procurement and stymied the contracting process. This is not necessarily a failure; the processes have made the team aware of the limitations of what is possible, allowing us to rethink the strategy. The Fund could resemble the Malawi Growth Accelerator, with matching funds from the private sector, for example. Furthermore, by understanding these limitations prior to contracting with the EU, we can better mitigate contracting risks.

We were unable to hire employees because the facility was not yet operational. This was deferred to the newly established program (FUNGUO). The option of hiring temporary consultants was rejected because it was too short-term and not flexible enough to find the right recruits. The plan was to hire a responsible party to find the necessary personnel and set up the facility, including legal registration, among other things. The UNDP is compiling a long list of potential trustees.

Furthermore, as part of this PIPs output 4, UNDP co-funded the Resilience and Recovery Challenge with HDIF and the Embassy of the Netherlands. HDIF collaborated with UNDP Tanzania, the Royal Embassy of the Netherlands in Tanzania, and the Economic and Social Research Foundation (ESRF) to launch a US$90,000 Covid-19 Recovery and Resilience Innovation Challenge fund aimed at finding, supporting, and amplifying innovative market-ready startups that have either stayed the course or pivoted their business to stay afloat during the pandemic.

The funds goal was to coach, promote, and ultimately award the best startups with innovative products, services, or business models that, by definition, are resilient to market shocks or contribute to the economic recovery of their respective sectors. The COVID-19 Recovery and Resilience Innovation Challenge fund, which was independently implemented by local innovation hubs Seedspace Dar es Salaam and Ndoto Hub, was an open call to all Tanzanian-founded and led startups in the tourism, agriculture, education, health, service delivery, and water, hygiene, and sanitation (WASH) sectors.

In the programs selection process, womens and youth-led startups were given priority. A rigorous selection process was used to select 20 startups from the 300 applications received. Once chosen, the 20 startups attended a week-long intensive training bootcamp focused on building resilience and shock-proofing businesses by developing Vision Resilience and analyzing gaps in their respective startups. The training also provided insights and practical approaches for leveraging environmental and ecosystem resources for longevity and sustainability.

Under this PIP, the UNDP Accelerator Lab was able to join the movement by providing technical and financial assistance in the design, fabrication, and testing of appropriate Tanzanian technologies.

This includes collaboration on 3D printing capabilities, PPE supply, and other innovations such as ventilator splitters, which allow more than one patient to be connected to a ventilator at the same time. This collaboration resulted in the design, fabrication, and distribution of over 2000 units of various PPEs to support Tanzanian front-line health workers in various public and private hospitals. Face shields, intubation boxes, and ventilator splitters were among the products available. It reached clinicians at Muhumbili National Hospital (Tanzanias largest hospital), Amana Regional Referral Hospital, The Aga Khan Hospital, and others in Arusha and the Zanzibar Islands. With UNDP assistance, the Design Studio and other partners will be able to increase their capacity to respond to CoVID-19. This will include the distribution of thousands more PPEs, ventilator parts, and other medical device spare parts, as well as local sterilization solutions.

Finally, due to competing priorities, the preparatory work on creating a conducive environment for innovation in Tanzania was not completed, so output 2 was deferred to the newly established FUNGUO program.</narrative>
