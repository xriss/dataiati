       <narrative xml:lang="EN">Nutrition awareness trainings were conducted in Northern zone (Tanga, Kilimanjaro, Arusha and Manyara). Nutrition trainings were widely captured in the Nutrition and Health day held on 13th November 2020. In Moshi rural district, Maranagu Magharibi ward.,Kyalla village. This event had direct well-being impact on the community, hence the society learnt about direct relation between nutrition and health to communities in the rural areas. 
Establishments of school gardens was completed, 5 schools have been engaged. Students received trainings on GAPs that showcased production phase.

In the course of ensuring market accessibility, orders of over 1,700 tons were confirmed through this intervention. During the project period, March- July 2020 over 300 farmers from Njombe were linked to the Dubai market through the off taker &#x2018;FreshtoMarket &#x2018;, it was estimated that each farmer sold over 1000 kilograms of Avocado at an average price of TZS 1500, giving an estimated local earnings of over TZS 400 Million.

The project initiated high level engagements with the government leadership to address critical horticultural policy, legal and regulatory issues. As a result of these engagements 16 major reforms in policy, legal and regulatory frameworks were to improve business environment in horticulture. During the COVID19 pandemic, through this project the Kenya &#x2013; Tanzania border dispute was resolved to allow agricultural produce (mainly horticulture) to be transported to Kenya from Tanzania hence ensuring a steady market for Tanzania produce.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">Nutrition awareness trainings were performed and extended to the and Lake Zone (Simiyu, Mara and Mwanza. Thus, agronomic trainings were done through demonstration farms in Chamugasa village in Busega district. The scaling up project involved the introduction of two new horticultural products in the lake zone which were the butter nut and orange-fledged sweet potato (OFSP). These crops were positively received in the society as they contributed to an increase in the household income as alternative cash crops and also improved household nutrition status. The school gardens are operational and these students have been trained on nutritional values of the leafy vegetables, from preparations to consumption. These are vulnerable groups who depend on the kitchen gardens for daily consumption of vegetables. Dissemination of protective materials equipment (washing equipment) etc. is done in all 6 districts.

A total of four demo plots were established with 27 farmers involved in the program from the lake zone. The farmers were trained on the best agricultural practices, climate smart technologies and supplied with farm inputs, and they collectively produced 6.4 metric tons of butternut and 5 metric tons of OFSP. As it happened, a total of 1.4 metric tons of butternut and one metric ton of OFSP were distributed among the farmers for their families&#x2019; consumption to improve their nutritional status.
Additionally, the five metric tons surplus of butternut were sold, earning the farmers a cool income of Tshs. 5 million, and the four (4) metric excess tones of OFSP were sold to other regions, netting Tshs. 2 million. The farmers had a combined earning of Tshs. 7 million from a single harvest

Farmers were trained on the Simple value addition technology such as solar dryers in preserving the horticultural products. This method helped to reduced the rate of post-harvest loss of products by increasing the shelf life of harvests. This method also helped to motivate other farmers to start cultivating horticultural products. Thus, Armed with solar dryers that preserve the vitamin A in the potatoes, demo plots provide learning platforms to communities and as a result, 68 households have received trainings with 63% adopting the GAPs and technologies and the numbers are still increasing.</narrative>
