   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Due to the COVID situation and military coup and armed conflict on 2021, KMF green program slightly changed its original approach. People have been displaced by the clashes and due to military council&apos;s restrictions, emergency food supply and food security have become a major necessity. KMF aims to work with alumni from different regions for their local food security in the future. In addition, KMF is working with the majority of university students, to continue to create learning spaces and connect them to facilitate learning opportunities and further study. In view of security concerns, previously selected areas have to be relocated to more suitable locations for the safety measure of the project. 
The revised program was developed based on the review and reflection of 2020-21 project implementation adding to the situation analysis, discussion with the key alumni and staff, and the scenario planning for 2 years. As the results of these, the program strategy will be;
? Capacity building for change agents to mobilize communities by improving their conceptual thinking, expecting the inner transformation with the supporting resources in practical eco-friendly practices. 
? Supporting resources for change agents will relay ecofriendly practices to the community to become individual changes in community level. (Individual level change for community members means awareness on ecology and practicing ecofriendly behaviors in their communities).
? Creating space for collaborative movements to promote ecofriendly culture with like-minded groups.
For the next two years, KMF will base on its strengths and address the above issues by working together with trained youth and its network. KMF believes that individuals and communities resilient are under an obligation more than ever. There will be two outcomes: &#x201C;Become a learning hub for required knowledge and skills to sustain ecofriendly culture and enhanced collaborative actions and movements with like-minded groups&apos;&apos;.</narrative>
