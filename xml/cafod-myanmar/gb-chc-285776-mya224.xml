   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Starting 2019, SEM together with the support of CAFOD has been working with the Muslim community in Myanmar on community research processes and communicating with diverse leaders, ranging from religious leaders to community leaders, including women and youths. SEM has facilitated five intra-Muslim dialogues and other capacity-buildings initiatives such as an advanced course on Non-Violent Communication and exposure learnings for 100 Muslim leaders (47 Male and 53 Female). These participants comprised of community members, social workers, members of religious organizations, youths and student activists. There have been positive results on increased self-awareness and more awareness about different groups and practices; developing positive relationships and promoting cooperation. 
For this project, SEM proposes to adapt its proven strategies to enable key constituencies to effectively promote religious harmony in Myanmar. the project will bring together mostly female participants from 7 regions and townships, with a view to enable Muslim constituents to share a common understanding of some of the challenges they face, and how best to engage with other religious groups in support of a peaceful and functional coexistence in Myanmar. It will as well built on the efforts of SEM to engage Buddhist religious and lay leaders as well as CBCM group so there can be joint efforts from diverse religious groups in building a more just, peaceful and sustainable future for Myanmar.</narrative>
