   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The proposed investment in ATFBank-Kyrgyzstan will support the SME lending activities of the Bank in the country.  Kyrgyz Republic is a frontier market for IFC, a primary focus area. Banking penetration is very low in the country, and banking activities are focused on large corporates as well as large cities. SMEs access to finance, especially medium and long-term finance, is very limited.    This loan will:    Enhance the Banks ability to access medium-term funding and on-lend funds to underserved sectors.  Through increased access to finance, Kyrgyz entrepreneurs would be able to access to finance for continuing their activity. Also, SME sector is critical to support job creation where unemployment rate is increasing, and  support the efforts of one of the leading banks in Kyrgyzstan to diversify and increase the volume of its funding, and to better manage its asset and liability position at the time of limited funding opportunities in the country.</narrative>
