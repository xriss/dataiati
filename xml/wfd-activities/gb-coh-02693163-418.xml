   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Partnership to Engage, Reform and Learn (PERL) is working to support Nigerian governments to become demonstrably better at prioritising, planning, resourcing, delivering, tracking and accounting for the delivery of public goods and services that respond to the needs of citizens, who are themselves actively engaged in ensuring these. The Engaged Citizens Pillar effectively engages citizens to bring about improvements in service delivery and poverty outcomes by working to ensure that constituencies become increasingly effective at influencing governments on selected service delivery and policy issues for the benefit of a greater number of Nigerians.</narrative>
