  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The initial stages of the peace talks witnessed low women representation from both sides, the reasons and analysis that were given were the lack of capacity of women to effectively engag in the peace negotiations. This trend has been actively opposed by Women Leaders who highlighted that this is against the obligations of the Security Council Resolution 1325. All parties have agreed to nominate women on their negotiation team, amidst the worry about the capacity. To ensure that the nominated women are well prepared for the next stage of negotiations, this programme focuses on building the capacity of women in negotiation to prepare them for the second round of the peace talks that will resume from the 20th of November 2019.</narrative>
