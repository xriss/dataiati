  <description>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The objective of the project is to provide settlement Non-Food Items as well as to provide emergency shared latrines  and organize community awareness activities on water-borne diseases to 2000 flood-affected vulnerable host community households in Al Jabalain locality, White Nile state to save their lives and restore their dignity, 
CAFOD, in partnership with HOPE For Development Organization after changing from Global Aid Hand (as the local co-implementing agency) as per the donor request, and in coordination with Shelter and NFIs sector lead (both at Kosti and Khartoum levels), other actors and the affected population, will respond to the settlement NFI needs of 2,000 flood-affected host community households in Al Jabalain locality, White Nile State, by providing them with settlement Non-Food Items. The settlement Non-Food Items to be provided to the selected beneficiaries will be 
- 2 Jerry-can (20-litres capacity), 2 blankets, 2 plastic sheets, 2 sleeping mats, 1 ibrik, and 1 set of HH utensils. 
- And provision of hand-washing soaps for personal hygiene 
Using internal funds, CAFOD is already on the ground responding to the emergency. The internal funds are being used to provide sanitation and hygiene services and rehabilitation of sanitation facilities to Al Ganaa, Dabat Bosin and Alagaya camp hosting South Sudanese Refugees. The current response, due to limited funds, cover the identified critical needs requiring additional support on settlement NFIs support. It is in this regard that CAFOD is seeking extra funds to address the crisis by supporting the affected 2000 flood-affected host community households in Al Jabalain. In identifying the 2,000 host community families to be supported, preference will be given to families that have had their houses destroyed completely. Also, consideration will be given to households with pregnant and lactating women, female/child-headed households, and households with members who are elderly and disabled.</narrative>
