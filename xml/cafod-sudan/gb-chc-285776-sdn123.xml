  </title>
  <description>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Taadoud II is implemented through a consortium approach by, CRS, CAFOD   World Vision and NCA. The project is implemented in the 5 Darfur regions with CRS as lead with  funding from FCDO. OXAFM A- was leading the implementinon in North Darfur and will be exiting Sudan  by end of March 2021. CAFOD is taking up the leading role in the implementing of key components of the project (NRM, Agriculture and Nutrition). CAFOD will be working with DDRA to implement the components of the project in 12 communities through three community catchments established in the previous periods and CAGS. 

Training on agricultural techniques improved farmer knowledge and skills and production. Regular training on essential nutrition actions increased knowledge retention that improved adoption of health, nutrition and hygiene practices among caregivers (with children under 5) and increased dietary diversification. Community resilience: One of the key outcome indicators that directly contributed to the measurement of resilience &#x2018;the absorptive capacity of communities&#x2019; which reached 77.6% in 2017 from 66.8% in 2016 and a baseline of 51% in 2014

During Taadoud I, the DRR approach through of CAGs aimed at representing many diverse sub-populations of the Community. By use of Hazard, Vulnerability and Capacity Analysis (HVCA) communities have identified common themes such as the impact of everyday disasters on lives, livelihoods and assets, the disproportionate impact on poor and marginalised people, the underlying causes of vulnerability (physical, social, economic, environmental), the right to information on risks and risk reduction measures, the need for inclusion in decision-making processes.  Communities developed Community Action Plans (CAPs) and implemented the CAPs to address communities needs with disaster reduction approach on basic services, animal health services and agriculture.
CAFOD has continued to provide pivotal role in capacity strengthening process on HVCA and integration of DRR work.</narrative>
