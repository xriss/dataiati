   <narrative xml:lang="EN">South Sudan is facing one of the most violent humanitarian crisis in the world right now. For the past three years the world&#x2019;s youngest country has been ravaged by fighting. The violence has helped force parts of South Sudan into famine. This project aims to prevent famine in high risk critical IPC phase 4 areas across South Sudan, in addition to supporting any population arrivals fleeing famine in phase 5 areas. Oxfam will respond with programming promoting dignity during this severe emergency through supporting existing markets through the provision of cash and vouchers, enabling communities to buy food and non food items from the local market which they cannot currently afford, vegetable garden kits for households to grow their own food to increase their diet diversity and nutritional status, as well as providing money for canoe transport in support of isolated families situated on islands in the Sudd swamp to safely access services such as food aid, markets and health care.</narrative>
