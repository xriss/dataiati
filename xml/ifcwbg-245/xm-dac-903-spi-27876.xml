   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The proposed project is to make an equity investment of up to the lesser of US$60 million or 20% of Helios Investors II, L.P. (the Fund) to support a fund manager that targets African investments in new business formations and established companies as well as in infrastructure-related  projects.  The Fund will consider investments in companies mainly located in Nigeria, Ghana, Angola, Cote DIvoire, Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda.  Other African countries may be considered opportunistically.  It is expected that half of the investments will be located outside Nigeria, in smaller IDA countries.  The Fund will target the following sectors: financial services, telecoms, healthcare, power and utilities, transport and logistics, agro-business and consumer products.  It is expected that 50% of the Funds commitments will be invested in infrastructure-related projects including power, railway and telecom infrastructure.  The Fund will make 8-10 investments with an average investment size of US$50 million (investments may range from US$20 million to US$100 million).  This investment strategy and focus is in line with the investment team&apos;s previous fund, Helios Investors, L.P., a fund that was launched in 2006 and has been 85% committed in five African investments.</narrative>
