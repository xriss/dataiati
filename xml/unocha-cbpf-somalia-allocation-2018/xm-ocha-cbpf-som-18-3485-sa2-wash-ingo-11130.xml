   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Providing sustainable and flood resistant access to safe water, sanitation and hygiene services for vulnerable communities in Jowhar district Middle Shabelle region of Somalia</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Despite the improved humanitarian situation in the first quarter of 2018 humanitarian needs in Somalia remain high, with 4.2 million people in need of life-saving assistance. Chronic vulnerability is compounded by recurrent climatic shocks and the ongoing conflict, resulting in limited access to basic services, increased protection risks, and no long term solution for the displaced. Alongside humanitarian action, substantial investment in resilience building efforts and development solutions is critical to ultimately reduce humanitarian needs in Somalia. According to September 2018 FSNAU release Deyr rains have begun in most parts of the country and are expected to be normal to above-normal leading to an increased risk of flooding in low lying and riverine areas, with the attendant risks of disease outbreaks and destruction of WASH infrastructure.
These floods had a particularly damaging affect in Middle Shabelle where seasonal flooding adversely affect livelihoods sources, resulting in damage to infrastructure, shelter, livelihoods and disease, as well as ultimately acting as a trigger for large scale displacement. The negative effects of drought were compounded by multifaceted conflict in a large part of the region. Large areas in Middle Shabelle are controlled by armed groups, resulting in regular conflict between militia and government forces carry-out regular offensive with the aim to claim control of contested districts.  The result, in 2018 has been mass civilian casualties, protection concerns, increases clan based conflict and displacement.  This, combined with the erosion of household resilience, has resulted in widespread and entrenched protection issues among the most vulnerable.
In this proposal, PAH will implement activities that are aligned with the SHF 2nd Standard Allocation strategy paper and WASH Cluster flood response plan 2018 through these three outcomes. First, PAH will provide reliable and sustained access to sufficient safe water is provided based on identified strategic water points. Namely PAH will provide sustainable access to safe water for 7500 individuals through the rehabilitation of existing infrastructure and installation of new shallow wells constructed using WASH cluster criteria for functional and environmental sustainability.  
Second, PAH will create an appropriate and inclusive system is in place for the management and maintenance of water facilities, by training 15 representative water committees to ensure the sustainability of community water management systems of each of the shallow wells. The water committees will oversee the water sources and they will be trained on management, water quality monitoring and maintenance of water facilities. Committee will enhance self-reliance by coming up with ideas for community contributions towards WASH needs and ultimate hand over of facilities. 
Third, PAH will provide reliable sustainable access to environmental sanitation for 6900 individuals. PAH will construct 230 latrines, using standard designs to avoid protection risks, as well as contamination of groundwater and surface water and facilitating desludging activities for safe disposal or re-use. Latrine construction will be complemented with Hygiene promotion activities in surrounding areas to increase adequate hygiene practices. Hygiene promoters will also be leveraged to carry out hygiene kits distribution to respond to areas at risk for AWD/Cholera outbreaks. A total of 16212 people will benefit from this intervention, in addition to creating synergies for improved coordination among WASH stakeholders in the area, including local authorities, clusters and other NGOs.</narrative>
