   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Food Provision and Livelihood Support for  Drought Affected Communities in Adaado District Galgaduud region</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project aims at improving household access to food for 1258 households (7548 persons) through provision of unconditional but restricted food vouchers and conditional cash through rehabilitation of communal assets. The targeted beneficiaries are those that are not able to meet the minimum food basket or are not able to meet the minimum living threshold of 2100Kcal per person per day.  According to Post-Deyr seasonal assessment conducted across Somalia in Nov and Dec 2017 by FSNAU, 264,000 people are in IPC 3 ampIPC 4 &#x2013; these amounts to 46 % of the total population of Galgaduud (569,434). The targeted people in Adaado are those who have been affected by persistent drought due to failures of two consecutive rainy seasons resulting in food consumption gaps, increased debt accumulation, depletion of herds due to sells at a throw away prices, deaths and diseases. in response to the situation, the proposed action has 2 components targeting Biyo Gadud, Dayeeno, Dhowdo dhogore, Dhumodle, Mirxeley, Iidoole villages in Adaado districts: 
1). Unconditional food vouchers for 850 HHs &#x2013; Meeting daily food is the pre-occupation of all households due to the precarious nature of their pastoralist livelihoods in Adaado.  Women headed households, those headed by a disabled person and old people are worst off.  For these members of the community, unconditional food vouchers provide for some basic food needs and render a level of dignity. These households will receive unconditional monthly food vouchers at a value of USD 79 (account for 80% of the MEB) per month for 3 months. The vouchers value will allow families receive food items consisting of 53kg of rice, 6kg of pulses, 5 litres of oil, 1kg of salt, and 5kg of sugar. The value of USD 79 value accounts for 80% of MEB and was determined by Somalia Cash Working Group (CWG) that issued set of cash transfer value recommendations in April 2017. This component will be implanted for 3 months.
2). Conditional cash interventions   &#x2013; For households who have human capital, cash for work gives an opportunity for a little income to purchase essential food items and possibly build up a small asset base that might make them more resilient in the face of the next &#x2018;shock&#x2019;. The project will target the poor but able beneficiaries who can conduct labour work. A total of 400 beneficiaries will benefit from 30 days job opportunity. Each beneficiary will excavate a soil volume of 1m3 a day at a value of $5 per day for 30days thus receive $150 at the end of the project (payment will made twice for 15 days worked per month so that each household receives 75 USD per month for 2 months). The daily wages will be based on agreed work norms in line with food security cluster standards which are based on the prevailing cost of the MEB baskets across the target district. Cash payments will be through the Hawala system, which is proven to be reliable, safe, and less vulnerable to diversions compared to direct payments.  As well 4 Water Users&#x2019; Committees (WUC) will be formed for each of the catchments and their capacity in water management and maintenance will be improved.
  
This project is designed to be implemented in 8 months covering both Jilaal and Hagaa dry periods. Justification for this duration is as follows: The first three months i.e. April,  May and June is specifically for project inception and launch mobilization, registration and verification of beneficiaries, printing of IDs and vouchers, recruitment of project staff and food vendor (s) and distribution of vouchers. The next three months i.e. July, August and Sept will be for food voucher redemption by the selected beneficiaries.  Component 2 of the project i.e. rehabilitation of community asset can only be rehabilitated during the lean dry Hagaa season after the rain season (between July to early October). The last month (Nov) is for project closure and hand over hence the total project duration of 8 months (see detailed work plan section).</narrative>
