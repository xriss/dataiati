   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Complementary Food Assistance Project for IDPs in Dayniile and Dharkinley districts in Mogadishu along K7-K19 Afgoi Corridor</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This is a complementary food security project to two ongoing integrated projects that CPD is undertaking in Dayniile, Kaxda, Dharkinley districts in Mogadishu along the K7-K19 Afgoi Corridor. One of the integrated projects that it is complementing is a SHF-funded integrated project SOM-18/3485/SA1/FSC-H-Nut-WASH-Ed/NGO/8496 (2018 1st Allocation- Feb/April 2018) which begun in June 2018 and will end on May 2019. The second project that it is complementing is a GAC-Canada funded integrated project (Health, Nutrition, WASH) that begun in April 2018 and will end on March 2019. Both these two ongoing projects have two fixed health/nutrition centres in Bariyow Camp- K13, Kaxda and Weydow Camp K13 in Dayniile districts respectively.

With a support cost of only 15%, and in a project period of 7 months, this proposed complementary project will support 10,320 food insecure persons (5,264 females and 5,056 males)- 1,720 households, with unconditional cash in the rate of $ 66/HH/Month as per the CWG&#x2019;s MEB rate for Banadir region. This is aimed at providing these persons with immediate food in order to cushion them from hunger, reduce/prevent malnutrition and prevent any potential mortalities.

Of the total 1,720 households that will be targeted, include 230 households that have been supported with 3 months&#x2019; (August, September amp October 2018) unconditional cash relief by the ongoing SHF-funded integrated project SOM-18/3485/SA1/FSC-H-Nut-WASH-Ed/NGO/8496 (2018 1st Allocation- Feb/April 2018). Due to their vulnerability and their need for extended support, CPD will target them again for two additional months (January amp February 2019) through this proposed project where they will receive $ 66 per month. And this is one of the reasons that makes this project a complementary one. These 230 HHs have been registered from the two health/centres, first based on their malnutrition levels as shown by the MUAC, and then in consideration of other indicative vulnerabilities such as household led by women/children, households with abandoned children, households with economically deprived widows/orphans and households with lone elders, disabled and sickly persons. The extra 1,490 households will be registered afresh, some from the two health/nutrition centres using the same above strategy, and will receive unconditional cash relief for 4 consecutive months (January to April 2019) and others through mass screening and in consideration with other vulnerability criteria. The two ongoing integrated projects have a combined staff of 48 and community volunteers of 60, who will be a valuable asset to the proposed complementary project. The program staff for the ongoing SHF-funded integrated project SOM-18/3485/SA1/FSC-H-Nut-WASH-Ed/NGO/8496 (2018 1st Allocation- Feb/April 2018) will be used for this new proposed complementary project until May 2019 and hence their salaries are catered for already. After that, this proposed complementary project will only need to cater for their salaries in the last two months (June and July 2019). This makes the project one that achieves high value for its money since it makes it run on a lean support cost, while about 85% of its funds are direct program cost.

CPD will measure the impact of the proposed unconditional cash relief to the 1,720 HHs in two ways. The first is for the health/nutrition staffs at the two centres to continuously screen members of the targeted HHs to know any improvement on their malnutrition levels. Secondly, CPD will conduct a post-distribution monitoring at the end of the cash transfers that is July 2019.

CPD plans to use the 7 months of the project as 2 months of beneficiary registration/cash transfer for the old 230 HHs, 4 months of cash relief/transfers for the new 1,490 HHs and 1 month for post-distribution monitoring.</narrative>
