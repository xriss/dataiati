   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project will provide educational support services and continuity of the education that had been disrupted the flash and floods. The heavy rains that caused flooding had given a shock to the school-aged children as their basic rights had been put in compromise. The implementation of the project activities ensures that the affected, marginalized, displaced, Minority, destitute, disadvantaged poor and needy communities in Bardhera and Luuq districts will have continuity in accessing to education and retention of children enrolled in the effected schools. Also, to ensure equitable access for education to IDP children, the project whenever feasible will support the existing schools to allow displaced children to enroll. Currently there are 5060 students enrolled in these target schools.
In addition, the project will strive to improve access to girl&#x2019;s education by addressing barriers such as early marriage, lack of awareness of the benefits of girls education through comprehensive community engagement and awareness rising and provision of sanitary kits. Incentives will be paid to school teachers and administrators, teachers/CECs training on school&#x2019;s safety, life skills and psychosocial support, as well as training of CP focal point on child protection and PFA/PSS will be provided under this project. Furthermore, the project will support the rehabilitation of the affected learning spaces/ classrooms, school WASH facilities   with the community contributing the site for construction and acting security watchmen during the rehabilitation.
