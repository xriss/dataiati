   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Recurring conflicts and drought have displaced thousands of households in Bakool villages to Hudur town. In addition, AS encirclement of the town has further deteriorated the humanitarian situation in Hudur. According to Inter-agency assessment led by OCHA conducted in Hudur, there are only seven functional community schools with an enrolment of 3150 learners (1270 girls). Further, 28000 persons of displaced live in congested 15 IDPs in Hudur town. According to the regional education officer from the ministry of Education at federal level, there are an estimated of 7200 school aged children in the host community whereas another 6072 school aged children reside in the 15 congested IDP settlements in Hudur town. In addition, 4 of the existing community schools in the host community are close to the IDPs settlements in Hudur and their current enrollment is 1840 Students (940 male amp 900). These 4 primary schools need three extra temporary learning spaces with school furniture&#x2019;s to accommodate new enrolment from the nearby IDPs. The target 4 community schools currently have 26 teachers and there is need to recruit 5 more teachers in Hudur and Bulow schools. 31 teachers in the 4 schools and 28 CECs will be trained on respective training modules to strengthen their knowledge and skills to run the schools and this will help the sustainability of the schools. None of the IDPs have schools, however, 4 community schools in Hudur are close and children from the IDPs can access these schools if the proper support provided to these schools. Moreover, the existing community schools are poorly resourced, shortage of classrooms to accommodate new enrolment, teachers lack appropriate teaching experience, shortage of teaching and learning materials, limited community support and lack of safe drinking water. Many IDP families cannot afford to pay schools and due to their poverty situation, education is their least priority. BREC has been working in HUDUR since 2001 and since then implemented education projects targeting the current existing schools. There is dire need to support IDP school aged children and poor vulnerable host community to have access to protective learning environment. Such interventions will help both IDP and host community children to be protected from risks. BREC proposes to support 4 existing functional schools in Hudur which are close to the IDP settlements in Hudur. 1100 school age children (800 IDP children) of whom 500 are girls will be enrolled in the four schools and provided with school uniform.</narrative>
