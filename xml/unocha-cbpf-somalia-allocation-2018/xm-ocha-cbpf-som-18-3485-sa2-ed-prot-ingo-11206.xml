   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Enhanced protection of vulnerable children and communities in IDP Camps in Banadir Somalia</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The proposed project will directly target 5,096 beneficiaries [2,185  girls, 2,291 boys, 322 male and 298 female] affected by emergencies, crisis  and displacement in Banadir region (Kaxda and Daynile districts). Beneficiaries will include IDPs and host communities in Banadir, with a specific focus on the following 9 IDP sites Malable, Al-Adala, Iskashi, Ala Dhowr, Kulmis, Bilkhayr, Jeebey, Samawade, and Cilitre. The project will target 10 schools within the camps namely Midnimo school in Malable, Al-huda school in Al-Adala, Aqoondoon school in Iskashi, Iskashi school also in Iskashi, Horseed school in Ala Dhowr, Hirwad school in Kulmis, Daryel school in Bilkahayr, Jebeey school in Jebeey, Eblawe school in Samawade and Cilitre school in Cilitre. The integrated 12-month project will aim at improving education for both IDP and host community children through improving access and retention for in and out of school, improving the learning environment, improving quality, while ensuring that the children are protected and learning in a safe environment. The school will be an entry point for implementing the protection interventions. The project will ensure existing public schools will be supported to continue hosting the IDPs and keep children in school and to support the schools to continue running. The project will particularly focus on increasing access and retention for both host community children and the IDPs who are out of school. This will be done through the construction and rehabilitation of classrooms and WASH facilities, provision of teaching and learning materials, provision of gender sensitive recreational facilities and capacity building for teachers and Community Education Committee (CEC) through different trainings.  Being an education and Child protection (CP) integrated project, the school will be an entry point for implementation of CP activities to ensure that children are learning in a safe and protective learning environment. CP activities will include community mobilization on the issues of child rights and child protection, setting up of reporting and referral mechanisms, training of CEC, Child Welfare Committee (CWC) and the Child clubs on Child Rights will be conducted. In addition to this, unaccompanied and separated children in the intervention IDPs camps will be reunified with their caregivers/guardians and those children who do not have caregivers/guardians will be supported through community based (clan/kafala) foster care placements and follow-up. The project will also provide appropriate support to 100 children associated with armed conflict when identified in the target IDPs and schools. General case management support will also be provided to vulnerable children and children at risk of abuse, violence, neglect, exploitation and SGBV on a case to case basis.  To ensure sustained solutions, the project will also focus on establishing/strengthening existing community structures including Child Welfare Committees and Child Rights Clubs, schools based protection focal points, Community Education Committees to build their capacity to prevent and respond to child protection violations. SCI will directly implement both the education and the Child protection components of the project. The project will also work collaboratively with the different stakeholders including the government at regional, central, and district levels school management and community education committees (CEC) child welfare committee (CWC) members child clubs the education cluster and child protection working group. The CWC and the clubs at the school will link up with community leaders and the child protection actors at community level to create a linkage and coordination of prevention, reporting and referral of child abuse cases. This project will also be complimented by other existing SCI projects in Banadir such as the NORAD program (Integrated Education and Child protection), and the SNAP project among others.</narrative>
