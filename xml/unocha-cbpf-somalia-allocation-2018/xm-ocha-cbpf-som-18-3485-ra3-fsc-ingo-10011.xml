  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The 2016/2017 drought resulted in vast losses of livestock, with many households losing their entire herds, causing acute food insecurity in many parts of the country. The region of Nugaal in Puntland was among the hardest hit by the drought. According to FSNAU, Livestock holdings among poor households are estimated at 25-27 goats in Bari and Nugaal, well below baseline levels of 57 goats . When herds are completely lost, many households migrate to rural towns and urban centers in search of employment and assistance. The ongoing population movement caused by livestock losses demonstrates how the drought has impacted and exacerbated chronic vulnerabilities of the pastoralist population. This loss of livestock and livelihoods has placed enormous pressure on local systems with poor pastoralist households becoming dependent on humanitarian relief and community support as the pastoralist systems can no longer sustain families. The livestock reared by pastoralists in the targeted locations is often their primary source of livelihoods, helping to feed their families and meet the demands of both local and regional markets (Puntland heavily relies on livestock exports). 

The Gu&#x2019; season has led to improved food security conditions country wide. In Nugaal, rainfall was 25-100 mm above average in most areas, however rainfall totals were 10-25 mm below average in eastern areas of Bari and some areas of Sanaag and Nugaal. Overall, rainfall supported the regeneration of pasture and browse in most areas, and livestock in rainfall-deficit areas were able to migrate for pasture and water . Due to improved seasonal performance and projected improvement of the same in the next Deyr season calls for recovery livelihood support intervention to build livelihoods and productive assets. 

In an attempt to rebuild productive assets, increase the household asset base and improve nutrition needs of children and mothers, the IRC proposes livestock restocking for 250 drought affected pastoral households in Puntland region of Nugaal. The activity will target beneficiaries that have dropped out of pastoralism and are now extremely vulnerable to further shocks. During selection of households, priority will be given to households with children with severe acute malnutrition (SAM) and moderate acute malnutrition (MAM) as well as pregnant and lactating women with MAM as a preventive measure, ensuring they benefit from the restocking and unconditional cash transfers. As the majority of the livestock were lost in 2017, livelihood activities will reach rural pastoralists that have already found coping strategies to subsist in the short-term, but do not have the livestock asset base required to rebuild their herd in advance of another moderate shock. The target group is either reliant on direct humanitarian relief interventions, community support found in town centers or are expected to turn to these sources of emergency assistance without livelihoods support in 2018. To reach this underserved vulnerable group, this action will work in coordination with relevant stakeholders to target 250 households providing each household with 10 goats (9 lactating goats and male goat). Beneficiaries will also be given one-off cash supplement package of USD 100 intended to enable households purchase livestock supplement blocks. 
Moreover, targeted households will benefit from 3 months cash transfers intended to meet non-food expenses in relation to care and maintenance of restocked goats including provision feed, water and other maintenance needs during the transition period. Through the combined package, targeted households will be enabled establish an immediate starter herd from which they will be able to grow to better withstand stresses and shocks in the future.</narrative>
