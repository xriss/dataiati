   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Provision of life-saving humanitarian assistance and protection services for internally displaced Yemenis in Amran, Hajjah and Aden Governorates (Parameter 2)</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Through this project, 4,320 75% of IDP families of 16 sites, three governorates (Aden, Hajjah and Amran) will be distributed and replenished of basic household items and 1,578 40% of families receiving emergency shelter kits with emphasis on the recently displaced and prioritising the vulnerable. An active site monitoring team will provide thorough protection monitoring for those in need of psychosocial services, child protection, legal assistance and survivors of SGBV to be referred. Furthermore, cash assistance will be provided to address the identified protection needs, followed by a close case management system. Half of the current emergency shelters which has sustained over nine months and those that need maintenance will undergo shelter upgrade while 410 transition shelter units will be constructed as part of the durable solution and exit strategy. The project will also target 1,447 25% of shelter units with maintenance activities to ensure IDPs in the site live in acceptable shelter conditions. Lastly, UNHCR has a long-standing commitment to the Age, Gender and Diversity Mainstreaming (AGDM) to all aspects of our work, through this policy, we aim to ensure that persons of concern &#x2013; women and girls, men and boys of different ages and disparities such as disabilities can address their needs and enjoy their rights on an equal footing and participate meaningfully in the decisions that affect their lives.
The 16 sites were selected based on the results of the Shelter/NFI/CCCM Cluster baseline assessment, and a verification exercise that was coordinated with clusters. All 16 sites are spontaneous sites. Each site had a range of 23 to 1,120 families residing, evaluated to be &#x2018;critical&#x2019; in overall terms of needs severity. In line with the First YHF Standard Allocation 2019 strategy (Parameter 2) which has been endorsed by the YHF Advisory Board in January 2019. The intervention is fully in line with the Protection cluster dossier. Lastly, the cluster objectives have been incorporated. 
UNHCR as the cluster coordination puts priority on capacity building of the local authority and partners in field. Throughout the implementation the monitoring teams and site managements will be trained on the inter-cluster framework, on the cluster objectives and priorities of response to ensure swift and cost-effective intervention. Furthermore, through creating and consolidating referral pathways supported by a clear and accountable feedback mechanism, the project will contribute to strengthening the overall emergency response mechanism of the local authorities as an exit strategy. 
Risks identified are difficulties in access. The local authorities consists of a part of the regular site management team, and constant dialogue and coordination ensures that the working relationship does not affect delivery.  Furthermore, UNHCR in parallel engages with the authorities. The sub national cluster coordinators act as a representative in field of the Cluster to ensure capacity building and smooth coordination. The cluster and sub clusters also has regularised information sharing to be harmonized conceptually and in practice.  
UNHCR has a proven record of leading both shelter and protection clusters. The two components are closely knitted, that the site management team includes a protection focal point and during Protection needs assessments includes household visits that considers the housing conditions. Furthermore, when selecting those eligible for shelter upgrading to a transitional shelter or maintenance, the protection vulnerability criteria is used. 
For the protection cash assistance, the amount was selected through cluster coordination meetings. Documentation and research was conducted on the value of protection services, documentation including the HNO/HRP plus monitoring visits to finalize the amount. However, it is important to note that this is also subject to change as the Yemeni Rial value tends to fluctuate.</narrative>
