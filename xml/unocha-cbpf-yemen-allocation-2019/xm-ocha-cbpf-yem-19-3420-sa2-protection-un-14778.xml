  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">YEMAC, (Yemen Executive Mine Action Centre) with the legal mandate for humanitarian clearance in Yemen, is neither equipped nor trained to deal with the increasingly sophisticated explosive threats and is overwhelmed by the geographical spread of contamination. To expedite YEMAC&#x2019;s capacity development to meet the needs will require the import of technical know-how, equipment and better methodologies learned in similar theatres through engagement with international HMA orientated NGOs, commercial companies and UNDP. UNDP is ready to scale up assistance to YEMAC to strengthen co-ordination, improve methodologies and increase the number of operational teams in the field.

YEMAC was originally designed to clear legacy contamination largely of mid Cold War Soviet design or their ubiquitous derivatives. YEMAC is neither trained nor equipped to deal with many of the new threats arising from the current conflict. While YEMAC have approximately 1,250 personnel mobilised nationally, they are overwhelmed by the increased geographic spread and the latest technical challenges. As priorities (and access in country) shift, so the teams deploy accordingly.

The overarching principles of the UNDP Mine Action intervention are: to assist in the restoration of normal services allow access to the infrastructure reduce injuries and fatalities all of which are a prerequisite to the normalisation of economic activity in many of the most impacted regions of the country and all of these are applicable to the planned interventions in Hudaydah. UNDP will assist NMAC (National Mine Action Committee)/YEMAC to re-structure where required and be technically competent to conduct efficient and effective physical operations to reduce the socio-economic impact of explosive remnants of war and landmines on people and communities, in order to ensure safe humanitarian access.

The proposal addresses the need for expansion of mine action MA interventions throughout the country. The expected results of the project are: 1. Mine and UXO contamination is mapped and impact assessed using primary and secondary sources 2. Mines and UXO are efficiently cleared in identified priority areas 3. The awareness of the threat posed by mines and UXO is increased in affected communities 4. Survivors of ERW incidents are effectively screened, supported and rehabilitated. Focus of operations and objectives of the project will be survey and ERW (Explosive Remnants of War) clearance activities.

The target for land release, risk education and victim assistance and the decision-making processes, is to reach all segments of society in Yemen. In addressing gender mainstreaming and balance the project will ensure that the capabilities, contributions, concerns and needs of women, girls, boys and men are acknowledged and/or addressed within the scope of its activities. The project will strive to have equal representation of women, girls, boys and men with access to and participation in mine action programmes as beneficiaries and employees in the decision-making processes.

Reporting to the MA CTA but under UNDP Rule of Law Projects, UNDP is concurrently running in parallel a C-IED (Counter-IED) project which has become a significant problem in Yemen. IEDs contribute directly to civilian casualties and their effectiveness (per event) is twice that of conventional landmines and three times that of air strikes. With limited statistics, it is known in the last years years there have been approximately 1,614 IED events (17% of the global total in that same period). The IED is therefore a weapon that creates personal safety issues, instils fear, impacts on sustainable development goals and thrives under poor governance.

The project will achieve its targets via its national counterparts whose capacity its strives to build through direct support and procurement of materials. The use of INGO and private sector expertise will also be employed.</narrative>
