  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">After more than three years of escalating conflict, Yemeni people continue to bear the brunt of ongoing hostilities and severe economic decline. The ongoing conflict continues to inflict civilian casualties and to cause extensive damage to public and private infrastructure. According to UN Reports, an alarming 22.2 million people in Yemen need some kind of humanitarian or protection assistance, an estimated 17.8 million are food insecure-8.4 million people are severely food insecure and at risk of starvation- 16 million lack access to safe water and sanitation, and 16.4 million lack access to adequate healthcare. Needs across the country have increased steadily, with 11.3 million who are in acute need &#x2013; an increase of more than one million people in acute need of humanitarian assistance to survive. Hajjah is one of the governorates with the highest severity of needs in Yemen according to the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification. 

Building through ADRA&apos;s long standing presence in the area through its project in health, nutrition and food security, this program will complement ADRA&apos;s ongoing effort to provide a comprehensive and targeted assistance and thus contribute to the first parameter of the SA1: Expanding high impact programs in districts classified as IPC 4 and above. 

The project will target 1,500 households of IDPs/returnees and host community residing in Aslem district of Hajjah. Taking in consideration WASH cluster objectives and core response elements, the project is expected to reduce the vulnerability of the conflict-affected and displaced population through increased access to safe drinking water and improved hygiene and sanitation practices and facilities. The project&apos;s main activities will include rehabilitation and expansion of existing water supply and distribution systems, capacity building and enhancing representation of WASH community committees, household level hygiene promotion and latrine construction. The rehabilitation of water sources will be done through contractors in areas with high malnutrition rates and at risk of famine. The areas within the targeted district will be selected in close coordination with the WASH sub-cluster of  Hudaydah hub. The WASH community committees will be formed in the areas where the water sources will be rehabilitated for community sensitizations and water sources management even after the end of the project. In areas with IPC 5 pockets, households will also be provided with hygiene awareness and hygiene kits. Hygiene kits and awareness beneficiaries will be selected based on the IFRR WASH cluster criteria. In addition,  households with the same criteria and have no access to improved latrine will be supported to construct latrines.

The project was designed on the basis of information collected through participatory methods. The project will use participatory approaches in the implementation of the activities, particularly, emphasizing the importance of women and marginalized groups (IDPs) to ensure that the needs of different community groups are addressed appropriately. Gender will be mainstreamed throughout the project. The project activities are designed to address the needs of the different community members where women, men, boys and girls needs will be addressed equally. The project will be implemented over a period of 6 months however, it is planned for 9 months to ensure having sufficient time to get project agreement signed with NAMCHA and have enough time for completion of all project activities.</narrative>
