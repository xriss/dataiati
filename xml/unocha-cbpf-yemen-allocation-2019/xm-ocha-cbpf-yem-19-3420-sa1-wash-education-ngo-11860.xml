   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Integrated WASH and Education response for IDPs settlements in Mustaba, Khayran Al Muharraq districts (Hajjah Gov.) and Harib Al Qaramish, Marib City (Marib Gov.). -Parameter 2 and 3.</narrative>

  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project was built on joint analysis of the needs of the IDPs in Marib and Hajjah, as per the guidance and the strategy built by the joint cluster initiative and the YHF guidance of 2019. This project is built to serve 15888 of IDPs currently residing in 5 IDPs settlements which are upon the 88 prioritized sites across Yemen in a Projectized integrated approach. Including newly displaced IDPs in Marib city. 

The project aimed to target IDPs hosting sites in Marib City and Hajjah (Para 2 and Para 3 combined): 
2 IDPs hosting sites in Marib city Al Gofinah and Community college site (WASH_Para 2), 1 hosting site in Harib al Qaramish Al Hazm site (WASH amp Education_Para 2), and 1 hosting site in Marib City Al Athar site (Para 3). While in Hajjah 3 IDPs hosting sites for Education solely were targeted (Education_Para 2).

BFD analysis and assessment commenced resulted in the urgent need of sanitation and water provision services to IDPs currently residing in 4 hosting sites that are in Marib city and Harib Al Qaramish, accordingly BFD assessed the sources of water available and with coordination with the LWSC it was found that optimum solutions are to connect the main water pipelines to water distribution points within the hosting sites while establishing water tower tanks near 2 hosting sites in order to act as source of feeding the water distribution points and the established network around and in the site. Moreover, findings showed that the sites are using poor unsanitary methods of sewage disposal, which we are proposing to tackle with rehabilitating the main sewage system network of Marib city and providing cesspits disposal and water treatment unit and connecting the Gofinah site and the surrounding areas to the main line. While in community college the optimum solution was to start by the disposal of the already existing overflowing cesspits and open sewage disposal units that are open and a huge risk for manifestation of water borne diseases and establishing two disposal cesspits tanks around the site and connecting the IDPs and HCs HHs to the sewage disposal network that will be constructed. Community volunteers from within the sites will be trained on the sanitation and hygiene awareness among other health messages, ensuring the uplifting awareness of their communities moreover, those volunteers will assist in cleaning campaigns, distribution of Hygiene kits and ceramic filters especially in areas such as Al Hazm site that does not have an available water source and rely on open water sources. Additionally, Al Hazm site as a priority site for the education cluster missing key educational elements, in this project BFD will ensure the operation of schools accessible by the kids and adolescents of the IDPs HHs, while Schools will be provided with comprehensive school kits that combine both teaching/learning materials (such as board, chalk, markers) and hygiene materials such as detergents to clean WASH facilities and soap for children to wash their hands after using the latrines with the aim of promote a culture of good hygiene practice among learners.

The targeted communities those residing in the IDPs settlements and the hosting community in Khayran Al Muharaq and Mustaba districts of Hajjah will be covered with educational services while WASH components are to be covered by NFDHR. These sites students will be provided with school bags containing notebooks and other essential scholastic materials, while teachers will be provided with teachers&#x2019; kits with basic teaching/learning materials to use in recording learner attendance and assessment. Schools will be supported with construction of Temporary Learning classrooms to provide extra classroom space to solve the challenge of overcrowding that has kept many children out of school. Schools will be supported to staff extra classes created (TLCs) and a monthly teacher incentive/allowance to cover volunteer teachers.</narrative>
