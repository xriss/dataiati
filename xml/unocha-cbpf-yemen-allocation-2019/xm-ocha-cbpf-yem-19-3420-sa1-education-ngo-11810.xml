  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Abyan Youth Foundation (AYF) proposes a nine-month education project in Zinjibar and Khafar districts in Abyan governorate.The aim of this project would be to expand high impact programs in districts that are currently classified  as IPC 4 and above. AYF will aim to achieve this by helping to restore damaged schools, as a result of the conflict, and to ensure that schools remain open and operational. AYF aims to target 11,968 beneficaries (359 women, 359 men, 5000 boys and 6250 girls - of which 8379 are host communities and 3589 are IDPs distributed 67% to Khanfar and 33% to Zinjibar) with essential educational assistance to ensure that they have safe access to education and learn in a safe and protective environment, by providing the following interventions:
1. Rehabilitation of schools (including WASH) facilities 9 schools 
2. Provision of new school desks
3. Repair of old school desks 
4. Establishment of temporary learning spaces
5. Training students and teachers in emergency related areas 
6. Training educational staff on education in emergency and
7. Training FMCs/school clubs on education in emergency
8. Provision of school bags 
9. Provision of first aid boxes

All the above will be provided to benefiacries in both districts (Zinjibar and Khanfar). Through these intervention, AYF will aim to address the needs of the most affected IDP children that are currently residing in the schools in Khanfar and Zinjibar districts. This project will aim to alleviate the IPC 4+ level in Abyan via addressing the malnutrition in children. This will be addressed through providing rehabilitation to the WASH facilities in schools ensuring that the children are in a clean and healthy environment. AYF will ensure that the school is well aware of the importance of hygiene to ensure a reduction and avoidance of diarrhea cases within children, which has a negative effect on their school attendance rate.   

Girls and young women are among the most vulnerable populations in Abyan governorate and advancing gender equality issues will be critical throughout the action. Girls being prevented from enrolling or made to drop out of school by their families due to the common belief that education reduces their marriage prospects was repeatedly expressed in FGDs with adolescent boys, girls, teachers and parents. Gender stereotypes and roles also contribute to girls and young women being in charge of care of children and having daily household chores. These findings have determined AYF to implement specific activities and approaches targeting girls, especially in facilitating their access. AYF will also establish temporary learning spaces to ensure easy and safe access to education by both girls and boys. Gender and cultural factors will be taken into account when designing the intervention. AYF has worked for many years in Abyan and through different conflicts and will continue to ensure proper coordination with local authorities, Education officials, Ministry of Education Office and other humanitarian partners present in the area.</narrative>
