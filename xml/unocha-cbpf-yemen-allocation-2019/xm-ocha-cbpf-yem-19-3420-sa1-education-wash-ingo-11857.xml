   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Enhanced support for IDPs living in sub-standard conditions in collective sites in Hajjah and Taiz governorates - Parameter 2</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In line with the WASH Cluster strategy and the 2019 first allocation objectives under parameter 2 (hosting site/collective centers for IDPs), the proposed interventions aim to improve access to adequate and safe water, sanitation facilities and hygiene information of vulnerable conflict-affected men, women, boys and girls. The project aims to support families to live with dignity in Hajjah and Taiz governorates, specifically in Abs and Al Mukha districts. NRC will target 12 collective centers in Al Mukha district of Taiz Governorate and 8 collective sites in Abs district of Hajjah governorate with comprehensive WASH services which seeks to address the WASH needs of IDPs and vulnerable host communities. In addition, the integrated education intervention is aimed at supporting children of displaced families living in IDP collective sites, as well as those from communities hosting the IDPs in Hajjah and Taiz.  The intervention will enable access to quality protective education for these children by addressing a range of barriers that are currently have currently deterred enrollment and retention of children in schools in these locations. In terms of beneficiaries, school-age children from families in priority IDP hosting sites as well as those in surrounding host communities will be targeted by this intervention.

The main proposed activities are in line with the activities under this parameter which are: Water trucking for IDPs for maximum 3 months with exit strategy through providing accessible and safe community water points, Water quality surveillance, and family latrine construction, (iv) provision of consumable and basic hygiene kits and, Hygiene promotion and community engagement including training of CHVs.

Students will be provided with school bags containing notebooks and other essential scholastic materials, while teachers will be provided with teachers&#x2019; kits with basic teaching/learning materials to use in recording learner attendance and assessment. Schools will be supported with construction of Temporary Learning Space classrooms to provide extra classroom space to solve the challenge of overcrowding that has kept many children out of school in the project locations. WASH facilities in schools will be rehabilitated to improve the hygiene and sanitation of the school environment special emphasis will be put on providing gender segregated latrines in line with the cultural context of the need for privacy especially for girls. Schools will be provided with comprehensive school kits that combine both teaching/learning materials (such as board, chalk, markers) and hygiene materials such as detergents to clean WASH facilities and soap for children to wash their hands with after using the latrines &#x2013; with the aim of inculcating a culture of good hygiene practice among learners. Schools will be supported to staff extra classes created (TLSs) and a monthly teacher incentive/allowance to cover transport for volunteer teachers will be paid. Teachers&#x2019; capacity will be strengthened through training in Psychosocial support (PSS), to enable them support children&#x2019;s wellbeing. Context-appropriate recreational kits for use by children in play will be provided while classrooms will be provided with student desks.

NRC will make sure that Provision of integrated response in critical IDPs collective centers will be in close coordination with CCCM cluster, Local authorities, other INGO/NGOs operating in the same districts, and internally with the Education sector implemented in the same districts under the same fund and other Core sectors (LFS, ICLA, protection, advocacy) under other grants. Selection of project beneficiaries will be carried out in a transparent and inclusive manner involving all stakeholders, including the local authorities and community committees and Cluster recommended selection criteria. The community will be regularly engaged throughout the project to ensure inclusion of vulnerable groups.</narrative>
