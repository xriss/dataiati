   <narrative xml:lang="EN">RDP has designed a WASH Emergency Response Project for IDPs and most affected host population in Masrooh Sub-district in Khayran Al Muharraq of Hajjah governorate and Bani Saif As Safil and Bani Mubariz Sub-districts in Al Qafr district of Ibb governorate. The project will target 25,266 vulnerable people (4951 Men, 5153 Women, 7426 Boys and 7736 Girls) to increase and improve access to water, improve sanitation standards, and develop people&#x2019;s knowledge of good hygiene.

The project interventions is in line with allocation strategy and priorities, especially, the first line of effort by Covering Priority Gaps in First and Second Line Responses for critical WASH interventions as it will help to cover gaps in the WASH response population in Masrooh Sub-district in Khayran Al Muharraq of Hajjah governorate and Bani Saif As Safil and Bani Mubariz Sub-districts in Al Qafr district of Ibb governorate which are critically affected and from the 45 districts with pockets of IPC 5 and insecure and hard to reach areas and has received many IDPs, the proposed activities focus on the highest priority life-saving humanitarian response in water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) as well as looking affordable sustainable solution in WASH at the targeted district using area-based approach. Also, the proposed interventions are directly aligned with both WASH cluster objectives:
SO1 - Provide emergency water, sanitation and hygiene services to highly vulnerable people.
SO2 - Restore and maintain sustainable water and sanitation systems, particularly in high risk areas. 
The project interventions will be implemented in 9 months period including the following main activities: 
-	Conduct technical feasibility studies for 3 water schemes in the targeted Sub-districts.
-	Conduct water quality tests of 3 water sources in the targeted Sub-districts.
-	Rehabilitate 3 water schemes in the targeted Sub-districts based on the results of the feasibility studies.
-	Select and train 30 water management committee members (WMC) (18 men and 12 women) from the community committees in the fields of management, operation, and maintaining water schemes.
-	Provide communal water tanks and install communal water tanks/taps including the connection to water scheme with piping system to the nearby locations of affected people in the targeted areas.
-	Select and train 40 community volunteers (26 Men and 14 Women) in the targeted areas in hygiene promotion and community engagement to strengthen knowledge and facilitate the adoption of behaviors.
-	Conduct hygiene promotion sessions over different themes by the trained community volunteers.
-	Distribute basic/consumable hygiene kits to most vulnerable HHs .
-	Construction and support of family latrines for 172 HHs (1204 beneficiaries including 236 men, 246 women, 354 boys and 368 girls) in the targeted areas.
The implementation will be coordinated with local authorities to serve as an external quality control measure. RDP will closely coordinate with UN agencies for the de-confliction to be obtained for project implementation sites. To mitigate the risk of government-imposed selection of villages, RDP will follow assessment criteria including, but not limited to water sources likelihood of sustainability, number of beneficiaries from water sources and value for money. The activities proposed based on the results of the needs assessment conducted by RDP in November 2019. RDP will implement the project in total commitment to DO NO Harm Principle through targeting the most vulnerable population based on WASH cluster selection criteria with no discrimination based on age, gender, religion, ethnicity, or disability. Additionally, WASH activities are in line with SPHERE standards, which directly reduces and contributes towards reduction the risk of water and sanitation related diseases.
The project will be implemented according to the terms and conditions of the grant agreement that results from this proposal.</narrative>
