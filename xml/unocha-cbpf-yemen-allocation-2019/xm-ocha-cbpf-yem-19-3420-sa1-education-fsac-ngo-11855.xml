   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The ten-month project is under parameter one expanding high impact programs in Al Mukha and Al Wazi&apos;iyah districts of Taiz Governorate classified as IPC 4 and above through focusing on two main sectors: education and food security. The objective of the education component is to ensure that schools remain open and operational and to keep the access to quality accredited formal education in Al Wazi&apos;iyah District through implementing a set of activities at three dimensions as follows: 
1- 1100 male students and 1100 female students aged 6-12 will get the benefit directly by providing the affected, targeted schools with 1100 new desks. In addition, 500 female students and 630 male students aged 13-17 will directly benefit from repairing of 565 desks to ensure that their schools remain open and operational. 
2- Supporting the most affected 1743 female students and 2400 male students studying in the classes from the 1st Grade to 6th Grade with school&apos;s bags, will contribute in supporting more student stability in education.
3- 100 male and 60 female from Schools&apos; Councils and Committee will get intensive training on &quot;How to deal with Emergencies&quot; to keep the Schools open and operational, and 30 members of MoE staff (20 male and 10 Female) at the Education Office in the targeted District will get intensive training on &quot;EiE&quot;, to insure the quality of education during the emergencies.
The education component of project has been designed based on a needs assessment conducted in 15 schools  in Al Wazi&apos;iyah districts by BCFHD on 15 -30 Jan. 2019 to identify the need of the affected students and schools in terms of school requirement and training. The activities of this component  will be implemented in coordination with MoE in Taiz Governorate, Education Office in Al Wazi&apos;iyah District, and targeted Schools&apos; Managements in order to ensure that assistance is provided in appropriate way and with a high quality.
The food security component of the project aims to increase access to food for highly vulnerable families in Al Mukha district of Taiz Governorate targeting 1000 Households (7,000 individuals disaggregated:1,372 men, 1,428 women, 2,058 boys, 2,142 girls) with unconditional voucher/cash transfer assistance for 6 rounds on monthly basis. The actual beneficiaries will be selected based on FSAC standards in terms of HHs vulnerability and targeting criteria, food basket composition, quantity of commodities, and amount of cash per HHs per month. The targeted beneficiaries are composed of Severely food insecure HHs, Vulnerable IDP HHs, Vulnerable Host HHs hosting IDPs, HHs with children under 5 with SAM or MAM, Child headed HHs, Vulnerable Female headed HHs, Vulnerable Elderly headed HHs, Vulnerable HHs headed by chronically ill members, Vulnerable HHs headed by physically challenged heads, Vulnerable marginalized communities. In coordination and corporation with CFMCs, the registration team will select the beneficiary HHs in the target areas adhering to FSAC vulnerability and targeting criteria.  So as to determine the most appropriate modality (Cash/ voucher transfers) for delivering the food assistance, a detailed market and contextual assessment will be conducted, during the early stages of the project. Besides, BCFHD will conduct a rapid food security assessment to help in identifying localized needs, and assist in targeting of beneficiary HHs. In addition the following main activities will be undertaken in this project:
- Selection of CFMCs with representation of at least 50% of women and ensure women in leadership position in the committees.
- Registration and Verification of beneficiaries adhering to FSAC vulnerability and targeting criteria.
- Provision of unconditional voucher/cash transfers assistance to most vulnerable HHs targeting 1000 HHs in Al Mukha district  for 6 rounds conforming to FSAC standards.
