  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The twelve-month multi-sector project, livelihoods and education, is in line with YHF 2019 and the Second Standard Allocation strategy 2019. The livelihoods component aims to increase highly vulnerable household incomes in Al Mukha district of Taiz Governorate by provision of emergency Cash+ fisheries input to 500 highly vulnerable fishery dependent households (3,500 individuals disaggregated:686 men, 714 women, 1029 boys, 1071 girls). In accordance with the priorities and activities of the Standard Allocation strategy 2019, this intervention comes to support the targeted highly vulnerable fishery dependent families, who are at high risk of becoming acutely food insecure and whose conditions can improve quickly if their household income increases, in Al Mukha district ( ranked as high priority IPC phase 4) thorough distribution of cash for 3 rounds+ fishery kits. The livelihoods component of this  project is proposed to enhance households and community resilience in Al Mokha  district, focusing on the highly vulnerable fishery dependent households, through supporting their access to food production inputs that will contribute to the improvement of  the households income. The actual beneficiaries will be selected based on FSAC standards and criteria of selection in terms of HHs vulnerability and targeting criteria. The targeted beneficiaries are composed of Severely food insecure HHs whose fishery assets damaged or lost because of the conflict. This intervention has been designed based on the initial rapid needs and market assessments conducted in Al Mukha district by BCFHD in the beginning of Nov. 2019 to identify the needs of the targeted beneficiaries. BCFHD will ensure fair intervention by tracking the distinct needs, response actions and benefit rates by gender and age groups and measuring whether women and men (and girls and boys in appropriate age groups) receive fair and comparable benefits from  the intervention.
The education component of the project aims is to help maintain basic education services in Al Wazi&apos;iyah district of Taiz Governorate through implementing a set of activities as follows: 
1. Targeting 32 affected schools through the provision of : school supplies (white boards, markers and erasers), school&apos;s bag for 9345 students (4645 boys and 4700 girls) and teacher&apos;s bag for 525 teachers (387 male and 138 female), training on emergency in education for 200 teachers (120 male and 80 female) .
2.Rehabilitation of 25 partially-damaged schools (including WASH facilities ) with provision of cleaning materials amp tools .
3.Supporting 6 targeted schools with 557 new desks. .
These activities will be implemented in coordination with Education Cluster, MoE office in Taiz Governorate, Education Office in Al Wazi&apos;iyah District, and targeted Schools&apos; Managements in order to ensure that assistance is provided with high quality. This component has been designed based on the findings of an initial rapid needs assessment conducted in 32 schools in Al Wazi&apos;iyah districts by BCFHD during 4 -12 Nov. 2019 to identify the need of the affected schools, teachers and students.
To implement this project, BCFHD has the technical capacity and the geographical as well as the operational presence in the 2 targeted districts of Al Wazi&apos;iyah amp Al Mukha as it has sub offices there and can easily access the targeted areas. At the operational level, BCFHD is  about to complete implementing a YHF-funded multi-sector project of education in Al Wazi&apos;iyah district and food security in Al Mukha and has maintained good relationship with the local authority, education office and the targeted communities. Over the last two years, BCFHD has implemented five YHF-funded projects in different sectors including food security, WASH and shelter which were evaluated by the third Party Monitoring (TPM) as &quot;good performance&quot;.</narrative>
