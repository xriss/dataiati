  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">YWU is proposing a 15 months livelihood (cash+ agriculture support) project to targeted highly vulnerable agricultural dependent families in Mawza and Al Qafr districts, Taizz and Ibb governorates consequently.This intervention addresses the livelihood gap in high priority IPC 4 and 3 agricultural and fishing communities in the First Line of Effort as defined by the allocation strategy (SA2) amp FSAC. In terms of highest priority geographical location (Taiz and Ibb governorates) are among the priority governorate of 2nd standard allocation 2019 according to FSAC HRP 2019, and also with highest per cent of food insecure population and highly vulnerable agricultural and fishery-dependent families in high priority IPC phase 4 and IPC phase 3 districts who are at high risk of becoming acutely food insecure, and whose conditions can improve quickly if their household income increases. The project aims to increase access to food for highly vulnerable families to Livelihoods assistance focuses on cash + agriculture kits within its primary role to assist vulnerable households to meet their short-term basic food and livelihood needs. This intervention aims to intervene in the first-line response gaps under two FSAC objectives: 1) Increase access to food for highly vulnerable families across the country 2) Increase household incomes and rehabilitate food security assets in areas with high levels of food insecurity. YWU will support highly vulnerable agricultural dependent families in Mawza and Al Qafr districts of Taiz and Ibb governorates through distributing cash + Agricultural kits to severely food insecure families in IPC phase four districts for 2000 (14,000 individuals) households with access to productive assets by distributing 2000 cereal and vegetable kits (seeds) along with farm tools. These activities will be implemented along with awareness-raising activities and training the farmers and the targeted beneficiaries on best practices behaviour of food issues through production of highly nutritious vegetables for households&#x2019; improved dietary diversity amp food intake for men, women, girls and boys. The activities will only target vulnerable households, households hosting IDPs, and vulnerable host communities with able-bodied members, access to land, and access to productive assets. In addition, YWU has also conducted Rapid need assessment to in order to determine the actual need of the community, type of cereal and vegetable crops, tools that are suitable to their agro-ecological/livelihoods zones, and climate and season and meet community preferences. In addition, YWU conducted Rapid Market assessment to identify the functioning of the market, access to market, availability of food and agricultural inputs, availability, capacity and interest of suppliers and financial service provider (FSP) to meet the demand of the assistance and community preference of the assistance. The potential risks for the project are aid diversion by recipients or beneficiaries, Corruption by local authorities, the no access due to the security situation deterioration, Authority delays signing the sub-agreement, Selection of asset/infrastructure for rehabilitation create conflict among the local communities, risk of floods and heavy rain which will destroy the land of the farmers and delay the project implementation, lacking the availability of enough quantity of good quality cereal local seeds. The Mitigation measures:YWU through its unique relationship with authority, MAI and local communities who will facilitate access. Further, the situation is stable based on YWU experience working in the area, Sensitization of project beneficiaries during every distribution cycle and appropriate targeting which reduces inclusion and exclusion errors, YWU with close consultation with MAI and local community during project design will provide the necessary data for the suitable intervention and will provide the list of asset/infrastructure.</narrative>
