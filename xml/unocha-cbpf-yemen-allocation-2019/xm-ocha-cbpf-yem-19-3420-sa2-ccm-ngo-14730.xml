   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Support Site Management through Capacity-Building activities and minor maintenance for IDPs in AsSafra and Sahar districts - Sa`aada Governorate</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project is designed with an aim to Support Site management of 5 hosting sites for 2140 IDP families, totaling 14980 IDPs (2937 men, 3056 women, 4404 Boys, 4583 Girls) in capacity building and minor site maintenance activities. The project will target 2 hosting sites in As Safra (Al-Huthin and Mazraa, Al-Qaida and Al-Mannaa) and 3 sites in Sahar (Jarfat Alwadi, Ghaaml and Al-Khafji) districts in Sa&#x2019;ada governorate. These IDP hosting sites are proposed based on the rapid need assessment conducted and cluster recommendations however, due to the complex situation between IDPs, host communities, IDP movements and the conflict in general, NFDHR is aware that these targeted sites may change. IDPs by nature tend to move and their locations are rarely stable, for this reason, NFDHR remains flexible during project implementation to change targeted site locations, in order to reach as many IDPs as possible and ensure project effectiveness and impact.

Main activities that will be implemented are:
- Establishing IDP site focal points/community committees
- Training community committees and focal points around rights-awareness raising for IDPs
- Providing minor maintenance support by connecting the IDP Hosting Sites to existing infrastructures (Makeshifts, unfinished buildings, water, sewage-if possible)
- Conduct Capacity Building Training in livelihood skills.
- Provide a Community Based projects.
- Establish community committees for each hosting site.
- Establish complaint and feedback help desks including design, develop, print and distribute complaining information materials.

NFDHR will implement some activities using a sub-implementing partner, which is a local NGO in Sa&apos;ada (Development and Humanitarian Response Foundation). Partner activities that will be implemented are:
- Conduct a satisfaction survey to measure baseline survey of beneficiaries with interventions.
- Organize regular multi-sector data collection exercises at the site level and work with the different clusters/service providers to address any gaps in response and provide minimum integrated assistance at the site.
- Planning, supervising and monitoring the Minor maintenance  using CFW strategy.

NFDHR will also conduct monitoring visits for follow-up and document intervention activities, challenges and success. Monitoring and reporting will be gender dis-aggregated by age, sex and diversity, and will seek to ensure beneficiaries receive the full package of interventions. 

Expected major risks consist of the following: security situation becomes worse and targeted beneficiaries cannot be reached, beneficiaries may demand to add activities amp services that are not included/approved in project amp maintenance of hosting site may provoke conflict among locals. Yet, NFDHR has faced many similar challenges in the field amp has gathered lessons learnt from previous interventions. NFDHR holds the capacity to solve these challenges amp mitigate the risks through proper coordination with all stakeholders We will: conduct regular security assessments establish frequent communication with all stakeholders keep teams informed about the updated situation work with local leaders, local authority, the CCCM cluster and NAMCHA to facilitate the implementation process.

NFDHR is working in Sa&#x2019;ada governorate in WASH, Health, Nutrition, Protection amp Education contexts, so we are familiar with the terrain amp surroundings, amp have a great deal of experience in dealing with the local stakeholders through our field office located in Sa&#x2019;ada governorate. Our access to Sa&#x2019;ada is never restricted due to our diligent implementation amp coordination with all stakeholders. We have a team of elite WASH experts in designing amp implementing WASH interventions who will thoroughly contribute to improving the quality of the deliverables. Not to forget, NFDHR is the focal point for WASH cluster in Sa&#x2019;ada governorate.</narrative>
