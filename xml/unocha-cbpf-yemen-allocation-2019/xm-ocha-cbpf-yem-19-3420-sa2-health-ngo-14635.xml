  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Aiming at increasing access to health services for displaced people and host community in 6 health facilities in Kharif and Raydah districts, YDN proposes this project aligned with the 2nd standard allocation strategy, where the project comes under the first line of effort: Covering Priority Gaps in First- and Second-Line Responses. This project is going to support IDP response by providing the core components of the minimum health service package (MSP).
  The project targets Kharif and Raydah districts in Amran governorate. Six health units are targeted to provide minimum service package (MSP) for IDPs and host population. In Kharif district (Ibn Hajib HU &#x2013; Al-Jaledi HU - Dhobr Al Rawaee HU) are targeted and in Raydah district: (Bait Al Montaser HU - Baut Al Qohom HU- Al Berar) are targeted covering 25923. The needs of these HFs were determined according to a needs assessment, which was conducted in the project set up early phase. The needs included workforce, rehabilitation, equipment, and medical supplies. All these needs are addressed by the activities included in this project. The health units will be supported based on the national guidelines and MSP standards. Primary health care services within health units are concluded in basic health services, child health care, reproductive health care, and health education. The activities will be implemented through supporting the health workers, providing medicines and supplies, providing furniture and equipment and finally rehabilitating the infrastructure and supporting operational costs. The project will be provided with WHO standards kits, which include (6 basic kit, 6 supplementary renewable supplies kit, and 6 supplementary equipment kit ) for all targeted HFs.

The differentiated needs of women and girls, men and boys of different ages and disparities are addressed by providing reproductive health services for pregnant and lactating women, providing basic and clinical health services for all age and gender groups and disparities, providing child health care for boys and girls under 5 years.

YDN has good accessibility in Amran governorate where it covers 4 districts and is conducting two projects in health thus it has established excellent relations with the authorities and stakeholders in the governorate. YDN has a field office and warehouse in Amran. 
YDN&#x2019;s experience in the provision of humanitarian aid, the management of any field difficulties, and the use of the best practices has significantly improved through the implementation of many integrated emergency projects in different areas. More specifically, this is going to be the Sixth health project and the tenth one funded from the YHF since January 2017. All along with the other humanitarian relief and developmental projects implemented by YDN in different governorates, this ensures that YDN has improved the capacities of its sectors and sophisticated its experience through the accumulating learned lessons and feedback.
YDN health sector includes a team of experts with different specialties, who are supervising and implementing the health interventions and are developing particular updated guidelines for the health interventions in Yemen. 
In Amran governorate, YDN is currently implementing two health projects in three districts, and have managed to strengthen the relations with the governorate health office and the authorities.
In regard to access, YDN has coordinated with the ministry of health and the governorate health office in Amran to conduct an assessment to choose the targeted health facilities and assess the actual needs. This coordination ensured the accessibility of YDN and was done to facilitate the approval of the project in the sub-agreement phase.</narrative>
