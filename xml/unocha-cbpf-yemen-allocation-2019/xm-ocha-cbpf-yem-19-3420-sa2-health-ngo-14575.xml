As a result, access to health services for displaced people and host population in four districts which fall within the IPC 4 and IPC 3 will improve, and 7health facilities will continue to function. Generally the proposed project duration 12 months, the proposed Heath activities of this project project will be provided for about (109860 ) IDPs and host community (men 18039,women 36223, boys 27777, girls 27821) as follows:

An electronic system is established by the IT management of ADO and allocated specially for Health data entry to keep excellent health record for all reached beneficiaries.
One of the potential risks the project may face is the conflict escalating in the targeted districts, an emergency coordination plan will be placed to mitigate this risk and the donor will be kept informed for any such risks to advise the necessary action (either by targeting the beneficiaries in their new locations if displaced or continue is case of a coordination can be reached).
All other potential risks are listed in details under Risk Management section, and all protection mainstreaming is also ensured in this project and CHWs will be trained in these topics ( Protection mainstreaming, AAP..etc), the detailed protection aspects have been clarified under protection mainstreaming section of this project. ADO already implemented so many Health interventions in Hodeidah and Hajja governorates, and it has the qualified and well experienced medical team and health officers, so many TPM have been carried by UNOCHA and their assigned third parties for ADO&apos;s Health and WASH interventions, no lower than good performance has been scored. 
ADO has the full access to those targeted locations of this project, and an effective coordination with NAMCHA and all stakeholders is always ensured. the complementary and partnership with WHO to provide the medical kits , Also we have a confirmation from WHO to provide these kits.
