Where the financial constraints of those families has limited their purchase capacity of both displaced and non-displaced populations. In the last years, NFIs programs helped IDPs and other affected population to purchase basic  items that help them endure harsh conditions. This interventions will try to provide the commodities from the local market, yet if it is not available, Altawasul foundation will search for a supplier from the nearest market and transfer goods to distribution points. The distribution will be followed by a PDM (post-distribution monitoring) for each area. 
The project will increase resilience of vulnerable IDPs, making them less vulnerable to harsh conditions, where this project will distribute 2800 NFIs kits. Though this project is mainly for IDPs, the distribution share will be for 70% for IDPs families (1,960 families) and 30% to the host community (840 families) in order to achieve do no harm principle for protection mainstreaming by targeting few surrounding in need host community families to avoid clashes between IDPs and their hosting community. 
The project&apos;s distributed kits are as per the Shelter / NFIs cluster standards, where each kits will consist of the following items: mattresses, blankets, sleeping mats, plastic buckets, and kitchen sets.

1. Consider the feasibility of distributing the abovementioned materials through in-kind considering various factors in the targeted areas. 
2. Engagement with the relevant stakeholders.
3. Assessment and verification of the target population.
