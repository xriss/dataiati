   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Emergency Education Intervention for vulnerable Communities Including IDPs in Maqbanah, Ma&apos;afer  Ash Shammayatayn Districts in Taizz Governorate</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This is an Emergency Education Project targeting highly vulnerable communities &#x2013; host communities amp IDPs- in Maqbana Al-Ma&apos;afer amp Ash Shamayatayn districts in Taizz Gov. The proposal is planned based on communication with the Education Clusters as well as with the relevant authorities at Governorate amp District levels. 
13 schools were studied for their urgent needs (12 in Maqbanah, 1 in Ash Shammaytayn) in a rapid need assessment in coordination with Aden Hub Education Sub-Cluster amp Education Offices. For the rest 9 schools in Al-Ma&apos;afer amp Ash Shamayatayn, they are the same schools targeted by SOUL in the {Emergency Education amp Nutrition Interventions for IDPs Prioritized Collective Sites in Al Ma&apos;afer amp Ash Shamayatayn Districts in Taizz Gov. under parameter 2} funded by YHF 1st SA 2019. They are included to cover the rehabilitation needs that weren&#x2019;t covered by the previous project. The targeted schools are in the locations under Aden governance.
22 school-aged children schools will be provided by education services, serving total number of 14,011 students (7,440 girls amp 6,571 boys). 
Equipped by YHF assistance amp support, SOUL will be able to reach out to give a hand to the neediest children including IDPs. Through this project, SOUL will be able to contribute to the Education cluster efforts to remain the schools operational and functional and children at school age to have improved access to education services. This will be accomplished through providing support to ensure schools remain open and operational and to restore damaged and destroyed schools. Also, SOUL will ensure that students receive psychological support through training education Personnel.
 
The planned Education Activities in response to cover priority gaps in first amp second line responses include the following:
1. School Rehabilitation, including WASH Facilities.
2. TLCs Construction.
3. Support alternative learning opportunities by supporting volunteer teachers by providing incentives.
4. Provision of new and repaired school desks.
5. Provision of white/black boards.
6. Provision of Teachers kits.
7. Provision of recreational kits.
8. Provision of basic learning materials (School Bags) to vulnerable amp needy students.
9. Provision of other essential school furniture for the Temporary Learning Classrooms (TLCs) for overcrowded schools (i.e.,white boards markers and erasers)
10. Capacity building of school management, Education staff at district level amp representatives of Mothers&#x2019; amp Fathers&#x2019; Councils on Education in Emergency.
11. Capacity building of schoolteachers on fundamentals of Education in Emergency, the basics of active learning as well as student center classes.

As of 2011, SOUL maintained its presence in Taizz mainly through Nutrition, Health, WASH, amp FSAC interventions in around 15 districts. Thus, this project will utilize SOUL&#x2019;s experience (e.g. working with CHVs amp MTs) amp its very good connections.
Accessibility risks are inevitable. However, since the projects&#x2019; staff will be recruited from the targeted areas amp SOUL can maintain its intense pre-coordination, the project will certainly avoid grave risks.</narrative>
