   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Comprehensive WASH Response in Al-Meghlaf District of Al-Hodeidah Governorate</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The intervention is a water, sanitation, and hygiene project that is expected to improve the life conditions of about 20511 persons at Al-Maghlaf District in Al-Hodeidah Governorate. The project aims to improve the living conditions in the displacement sites and promote durable solutions with full participation of IDPs and host communities. The intervention targets six water projects in three subdistricts namely Alhabeel, Almahjam, and Kohlan in Bani Mohammed Kofiah amp Alharthah in Bani Alborrah, and Almasloobah in Almahmedah.

The WASH needs of IDPs and communities have been fully identified by a qualified team trained on the principles of water, sanitation, hygiene, and humanitarian action. In addition to closely observation, the team conducted several meetings with the water project managers and interviewed many people in focus group discussions. 

The Needs Assessment (NA) was carried out for 15 days between 3rd through 18th of November 2019.The selection criteria are displacement, severe need, and lack or suspension of nearby water sources or projects where IDPs and communities hosting them are located. The NA shows that the people of the area are in dire need for this WaSH intervention for the frequent suspension of sustainable sources of safe drinking water. All the targeted 6 water project pumps are in very bad conditions, too much consuming for fuel and are in need for expensive repairs and parts. Besides, Kuhlan and Kofiah water projects do not have concrete tanks and the water network in Kohlan is too small and severely damaged. Also, IDPs are in need for many latrines and all areas are polluted with solid waste everywhere. What is more, a considerable percentage of IDPs (40%) practice defecation in the open.

It is planned that the project starts by establishing strong coordination with all relevant stakeholders: NAMCHA and all other governmental authorities of concern at all levels: central, governorate, and district the WaSH Cluster GARWSP OCHA and key leaders of the targeted communities.

The analysis of the disaggregated NA data according to GAM has resulted in tailoring the assistance to the WaSH needs and interests of the targeted groups in a way that can help in mitigating GBV. The project activities include: construction of 2 concrete water tanks, implementation of 1 water network of about 15 km long, implementation of 1 pumping line of about 350m long, testing of pumping and water quality in 6 wells provision of 10 public water points construction of 108 latrines installation of 6 complete solar-powered pumping units on 6 wells collection and disposal of solid waste distribution of 1000 consumer hygiene kits three times  and 1000 essential hygiene kits once training of 12 community volunteers on hygiene promotion and community participation and training of 6 water-project committees of 5 members per each, and hygiene promotion. The work plan of activities shows the number of beneficiaries in each area and the implementation duration in a sequential and logical manner.

AGF has demonstrated its ability to implement water and sanitation projects by having a skilled team consisting of a project manager, 2 engineers, a water and sanitation officer, a logistics officer, a coordinator, an MampE officer, a protection officer, 2 field supervisors, and volunteers. Furthermore, building a variety of practical communications with WaSH service providers, AGF is able to obtain any required stock or service whenever needed.

Finally, it is worthily noted that AGF is well acquainted with Al Hodeidah and the needs of its districts as it has implemented several projects of different sectors including WaSH. Presently, AGF is implementing a huge WaSH project in Az-Zaidiah and Al-Munirah, 2 districts nearby Al-Meghlaf. The WaSH needs, geography, and status of people where AGF is working now are all similar to that in Al-Meghlaf District.</narrative>
