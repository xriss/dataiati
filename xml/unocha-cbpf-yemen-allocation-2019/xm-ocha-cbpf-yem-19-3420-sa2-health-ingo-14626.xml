   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Provision of emergency health services in Taiz and Lahj governorates</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">lMC propose to provide emergency assistance to the health care facilities located in areas facing acute humanitarian needs and underserved through the support of the Yemen Humanitarian Pooled Fund. The lifesaving assistance will be provided by supporting health care services through 7 static health care facilities and 1 mobile teams. This assistance will target 2 of the most conflict-affected governorates, Lahj and Taiz, and target districts considered to be within IPC level 4 and 5 as of August 2019. As per endorsement from the health cluster, IMC proposes to cover the following locations within Al Mukha district, Taiz &#x2013; Al Sahera PHC, Al Moamera PHC, Al Shathlia PHC, Nubat Amer PHC, Yakhtal PHC, Al Tuban PHC and Dhubab Hospital as well as Al Musaymir district in Lahj. The target population will be internally displaced populations and host communities who are often unable to access services due to distance, security instability, inadequate family resources as well as lacking the awareness of the availability of health services and information-seeking practices. The project will support static and mobile health services to widen access to the targeted populations and reduce some of the factors restricting beneficiary access to the health services available. Furthermore, the project will not discriminate according to sex, gender, status or residence and will ensure protection principles are mainstreamed throughout the proposed intervention. The project proposes to support existing government health care facilities at the primary and secondary levels of health care. IMC will support 6 primary health care facilities, 1 hospital and 1 m. Mobile team. The mobile team will target at least 4 locations within the district of Al Musaymir in Lahj. The health facilities will be supported in the form of incentives for health workers and support staff as well as the provision of essential medical commodities, including pharmaceuticals, medical and laboratory supplies, operational supplies such as stationery and cleaning materials. IMC will collaborate to receive IEHK kits from WHO requested to ensure that the quantities of medical commodities procured are augmented. To ensure that necessary knowledge and skills are provided, capacity building activities will be coordinated with the relevant GHO/DHO counterparts and supportive supervisions will be conducted jointly with IMC and the DHO technical staff. The Yemen Minimum Service Package will serve as a guide for the project to monitor the services offered within the supported health facilities. This will include general medical consultations for adults and children with the provision of essential medications for common communicable and non-communicable diseases, maternal, newborn and infant care through ANC/Delivery/PNC, family planning, IMCI, EPI and growth monitoring. The proposed intervention will reinforce the capacity of the health system to prepare and respond to health emergencies that may be brought about by diseases of outbreak potential. The project will also support community-based services through community health volunteers that will provide ICCM through house-to-house visits and group awareness sessions. In the past 6 months, International Medical Corps has deployed mobile teams in coordination with the GHO to contribute to the control and management of increased malaria, cholera and diphtheria cases in districts in Lahj. The influx of displaced families in Al Mukha and Al Hussein triggered the deployment of mobile health teams to augment the existing capacity of the functional health facilities in these districts. These examples illustrate the flexibility and importance of mobility for mobile teams to address situations, which may not be addressed through services in static health facilities. IMC coordinates with the health clusters at the national and sub-national levels to avoid duplication</narrative>
