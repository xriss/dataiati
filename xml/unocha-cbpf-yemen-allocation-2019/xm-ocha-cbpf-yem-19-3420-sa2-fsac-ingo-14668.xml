   <narrative xml:lang="EN">ADRA Yemen was registered in 1995 and currently employs 551 staff as well as 2,327 staff who receive incentives, and on voluntary and service contracts. ADRA Yemen is currently working in 11 of the country&#x2019;s 22 governorates and is implementing projects in the sectors of health, nutrition, WASH, food security, livelihoods, education and protection. Building on ADRA&apos;s long standing presence in the targeted area through its project in health, nutrition and food security, this program will complement ADRA&apos;s ongoing effort to provide a comprehensive and targeted assistance and thus contribute to the strategic objective of helping millions of destitute Yemenis overcome hunger.

This project is designed to support the agricultural livelihoods in Al-Marawia district of Al-Hudaydah by supporting the framers to resume their livelihood activities. This will be achieved through the provision of cash + agricultural kits and cash for work activities. Unconditional cash will be provided along with agricultural kits to provide a source of income for the targeted households as they prepare their lands, plant, and harvest, and to avoid any risk of families selling their seeds and kits in order to provide for their families. Cash for work on the other hand is planned to further enhance households&#x2019; economic situation and improve the conditions of the abandoned irrigation canals. Prior to project implementation the, ADRA will conduct detailed market assessment to further determine the market functionality, beneficiary preferences, mode of transfers, availability of inputs suppliers, availability of financial service providers, beneficiaries&#x2019; distance to the market, potential input distribution or cash payout points etc. As part of this intervention, ADRA will enhance the knowledge and skills of the targeted farmers through provision of training. The training will be through the line ministry of agriculture. 

The project was designed on the basis of information collected through participatory methods. The project will use participatory approaches in the implementation of the activities, particularly, emphasizing the importance of women and marginalized groups to ensure that the needs of different community groups are addressed appropriately. Gender will be mainstreamed throughout the project. The project activities are designed to address the needs of the different community members where women, men, boys and girls needs are treated equally. The project will be implemented over a period of 10 months however, it is planned for12 months to ensure having sufficient time to get project agreement signed with concerned authorities and have enough time for completion of all project activities. This proposed project is planned to reach 1,500 households, approximately 10,500 beneficiaries (2000 Women, 2000 Men, 3250 Grils, 3250 Boys) with agricultural support. These households will be selected from the most vulnerable whose agricultural livelihoods have been affected and/or disrupted because of the ongoing conflict and lack of financial resources. The project will prioritize households with malnourished children, pregnant and lactating women, and disabled members, female-headed households, and households hosting IDPs.</narrative>
