  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In line with 2019 SA2 Strategy objectives and cluster objectives, this project intends to provide comprehensive WASH and Shelter assistance to estimated 115,708 IDPs and most vulnerable affected individuals (27770 men, 30084 women,26613, boys, 31241 girls) from the most vulnerable groups with focus on IDPs and most affected communities hosting IDPs to respond to the humanitarian needs in WASH and Shelter sectors at Jehaf,Damt,Juban and Al-Husha districts of Al-Dhale Gov.

WASH and Shelter interventions will be providing a comprehensive response to 18516 IDPs and 97192 most vulnerable host communities in the 4 targeted districts covering  second line responses for newly accessible locations formed due to  the recent clashing in Aldhale with focus on under-served IDPs within the 2nd line sector response to ensure the functionality of targeted communities&#x2019; water assets as well as promoting public hygiene practices. 

The WASH interventions will be provided to conflict- affected beneficiaries to improve their access to safe drinking
water and sanitation services through:
Construction of 50 water harvesting tanks through CFW at HHs level in Jehaf and Al-Hushaa districts by providing the beneficiaries with tools and materials to build the harvesting tanks and supporting them with incentives for unskilled and skilled workers who will perform the construction activities under the supervision of field engineer. 
Rehabilitation/repair of 8 community water assets. 
Provision of operational support for 1 water asset  in Damt.
Conducting Hygiene awareness sessions.
Conducting Solid waste management and disposal in Damt ,Juban districts. 
Construction of 110 Family latrines in the 4 districts.
Distribution of CHK, Jerry can,for SAM, MAM, PLW , cholera cases.
Distributing ceramic filters for SAM, MAM, PLW and cholera cases prevalence: 62% of beneficiaries in 4 districts  don&#x2019;t use any method to treat their unsafe drinking water as  they cannot afford  the cost.
Conducting CLTs interventions in Al-Husha and Jehaf districts to improve the poor sanitation practices and achieve behavior change and ODF targeting the most affected communities.

Shelter activities will be provided to IDPs at collective centers and among host communities in 3 districts (Alhusha, Damt and Juban) through the provision of EESKs/ NFIs,rental subsidies, support through in-kind and cash/vouchers modality of appropriate shelter and essential household items. 

The targeted districts are located within Aden and Ibb Hubs where YFCA has its two main sub-offices to carry out the main implementation task with backstopping support from the main office in Sana&#x2019;a. Coordination with WASH, Shelter clusters, RRM, GARWASP , Local authorities has already been done to support and facilitate the planned interventions and to avoid any duplication with other partners .

The possible risks that might face YFCA while preparing and implementing the activities could include the delay in signing and approving the agreement for 3 districts under De facto, security deterioration, airstrikes, prices fluctuation, supplies shortage in the local market and outbreaks of diseases. 
These risks can  be mitigated through close coordination with all stakeholders in the field, obtaining de-confliction from airstrikes for operation sites, contracting with suppliers and staff for the whole period of the project to ensure sustainability of supply and services and avoid any prices fluctuation and finally to coordinate with health cluster and on ground actors regarding the spread of diseases such as cholera.
YFCA will closely coordinate with authorities at Aldhalee in both sides and at central level to obtain the permission and sign the agreements within the first month of the project. 
YFCA will monitor the project activities using concentrated modalities and tools at the central, hub, governorate and field level.</narrative>
