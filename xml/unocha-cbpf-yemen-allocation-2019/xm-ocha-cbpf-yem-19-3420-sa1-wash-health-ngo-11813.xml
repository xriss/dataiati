   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Parameter 1: Provision of integrated emergency lifesaving WASH and Health interventions to the most vulnerable people in Al Abr district of Hadhramout Governorate and Qa&apos;atabah  Al Azariq districts of Al Dhale&apos;e Governorate.</narrative>

  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Under the first parameter of this SA and over the project duration of twelve months, YFCA plans to provide integrated emergency lifesaving health and WASH assistance to estimated 101939 beneficiaries (Men-24466, Women- 26504, Boys- 23446, Girls- 27523) from the most vulnerable individuals of IDPs and host communities at Al Abr district of Hadramaut Governorate and Qa&apos;atabah and Al Azariq districts of Al Dhale&apos;e Governorate.
The key objective of this project is to cover the gaps in accessing the lifesaving Health and WASH services so the integrated Health and WASH interventions will serve in making significant impact in reducing the famine risks at the targeted communities as the current gap in health and WASH services are main underlying causes of famine risk so the improvement of the services in these two sectors will have a direct impact on health status of communities members that will tolerate the consequences of gap in feeding as well the indirect impact that comes from saving the limited income of population to cover the food requirements instead of spending them on health and WASH needs.

Health services package will include the provision of general health services for primary and secondary health care including the CD prevention, RH MISP package,  IMCI with focus in increasing immunization coverage. The targeted health facilities under this project are 9 which are distributed as follows: 5 in Qa&apos;atabah district (Al Salam hospital, Qreen Alfhd HC, Bait Alshwki, Shathan and Al Madraj HUs), 2 in Al Azariq district (Alhaql HC and Qaradh HU) and 2 in Alabr district  (AlAbr HC and Al Wahd HU). 

WASH activities will include: rehabilitation and maintenance of water supply schemes amp wells and sanitation systems for affected populations and IDPs in addition to the provision of adequate hygiene kits and items. For the purposes of enhancing general public hygiene practices the targeted communities will be engaged in hygiene awareness raising activities including the establishment and scale up of community volunteers including the application of CLTS approach in Alabr district.

The capacity building of served communities is on main pillar of this project towards serve sustainable services in Health and WASH sectors after project end.

This WASH and Health integrated service provision approach is guided by clear findings of RNA assessment that had been conducted at the targeted HFs, WASH assets and community level that revealed the gaps in both sectors and thus drawn us to design the interventions package in close coordination with the beneficiaries, GHOs amp DHOs, Local Water Corporations at the targeted Governorates and districts and the rest stakeholders to ensure addressing the gaps properly.

The targeted Al Abr, Qa&apos;atabah and Al Azariq districts are located at areas covered under Aden hub umbrella where YFCA has the second biggest office that will carry out the main implementation tasks with technical, financial and administrative backstopping support from the main office in Sana&#x2019;a.
YFCA will monitor the project activities using more focused modalities and tools at the central, governorate and field levels including the conduction of planned and spot MampE visits that will enable us to take the corrective actions if needed on time.
On-time reporting of regular and spot reports to HFU, WASH and health national and sub-national clusters will be ensured and supported with the needed documentations via GMS, mailings and official letters if needed.
YFCA ensured the mainstreaming of protection and gender concepts during the designing of this project through the active engagement of beneficiaries while conducting the RNA that had been reflected in clear specific project performance indicators, while at the implementation stage the beneficiaries will actively engaged in monitoring the activities and take part in corrective measures to be taken if needed.</narrative>
