  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Sustained conflict since 2015 has resulted in increased vulnerabilities across Yemen &#x2013; an estimated 24 million people require some form of humanitarian or protection assistance, including 14.3 million who are in acute need of humanitarian assistance. Despite the tremendous needs, access constraints have challenged the humanitarian system, delaying services to those in need and diverting aid from the communities for which it is intended. Internal displacement of 3.3 million Yemenis exacerbates an already dire situation as communities in resource challenged areas struggle to cope with protracted displaced populations competing for services and livelihoods. In order to help address these expanding needs, IOM bolstered and expanded operations in 2018 in order to provide efficient multisector humanitarian response its emergency response programming expanded by 200% since 2017. Strengthening and expanding its response activities continues to be IOM&#x2019;s strategic approach into 2019.

The proposed project will help respond to widespread needs of the displaced, in line with the 2019 Yemen Humanitarian Response Plan, the Shelter/NFI/CCCM Cluster&#x2019;s objectives for the year, and priority governorates identified for the YHF&#x2019;S 1st standard allocation strategy, by providing life-saving shelter, NFI and CCCM assistance to 9,485 individuals in Ibb and Taiz governorates. 

IOM intends to provide CCCM assistance in 35 displacement sites across Taizz and Ibb governorates, and shelter/NFI assistance (through cash disbursements) in 6 displacement sites in Taizz alone. The Organization will aim at addressing critical gaps in the targeted sites through: the provision of 400 NFI and Enhanced Emergency Shelter Kits (EESK) (cash assistance) in 6 sites in Taizz supporting the effective and coordinated implementation of targeted response activities in 35 sites, and basic rehabilitation of communal site infrastructure to improve living conditions and access to services in 17 sites (see site profiles attached). More specifically, IOM will:
- implement standardized Site Management and Coordination (SMC) mechanisms in 35 displacement sites across Taizz and Ibb governorates
- distribute 400 EESK and NFI kits (cash assistance) in 6 sites in Taizz governorates and
- conduct basic site rehabilitation in 17 sites across Taizz and Ibb governorates.

IOM has been active in majority of the targeted locations and has through other donor funding carried out site rehabilitation and shelter/NFI activities in the sites not targeted for these activities under this Allocation. IOM will continue to explore complementary donor funding to support further required CCCM/NFI/Shelter activities. IOM will engage Deem Foundation as an implementing partner with proven experience in 6 locations targeted in Taizz for this activity (see market assessment attached). DEEM has been active in Al-Taiziah, Damt Khadir and Sabir Almodem districts, and has been chosen for their understanding of local dynamics and needs. IOM will ensure the capacity building of DEEM through this project, and will provide any technical guidance that may be required.

The project will contribute to the YHF Advisory Board&#x2019;s endorsed 2nd Parameter for the 1st Standard Allocation to scale up assistance in priority IDP hosting sites. Activities proposed also support the overall 1st Standard Allocation objective to help cover key gaps in the existing operation and support the immediate scale-up of activities in highly vulnerable communities. IOM&#x2019;s needs-based approach as well as the project&#x2019;s alignment with inter-agency strategies, its beneficiary criteria and its proposed activities are detailed the relevant project document sections below.</narrative>
