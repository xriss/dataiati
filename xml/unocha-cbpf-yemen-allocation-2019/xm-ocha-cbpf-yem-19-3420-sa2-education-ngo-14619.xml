   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Boys and girls in school-age are deprived of their right to education as a result of the conflict in Al Hudaydah. Most schools have been destroyed and those that have been left cannot handle the huge number of students.

In response to this situation with the objective to Help to ensure schools remain open and operational to support boys and girls in the school-age to regain their right to equal and inclusive education, NMO visited the two conflict-affected prioritized districts and visited the IDP sites (as IDP students are the main targeted group) and held consultations with the IDPs to understand their needs. After that, the closest schools to these IDP sites were identified to be supported to accommodate the IDP boys and girls. NMO&apos;s engineers visited these schools and assisted their needs as a result, the following activities will be conducted:

1. Construction of 24 Temporarily Learning Classes and 4 wooden TLC: As discussed above, the schools are either destroyed or cannot handle the huge number of students therefore, NMO will construct rural temporarily learning classrooms as per the Education Cluster&apos;s  BoQs. These classrooms will then be supported by the needed furniture so that boys and girls can continue their education in a safe and inclusive learning space. 
2. Incentives for 28 teachers: An incentive will be provided to volunteer teachers because many teachers have displaced from the targeted districts or have joined the army. 
3. Rehabilitation of damaged schools (including WASH) (2 schools): NMO will rehabilitate damaged spaces and/or WASH facilities so that boys and girls can have safe and inclusive access to classrooms and WASH facilities.
4. Distribution of teaching and learning supplies: 
- Individual student kits for 4000 students.
- Provision of Teachers kits for 80 teachers.
- provision of recreational kits for 8 schools (3 kits/school): To promote the well-being and resilience of children, NMO will provide recreational kits to the schools because recreational play is essential to boys and girls in the school-age. The kits will consider the gender-age differences of the students.  This will help schools to organize creative and fun learning and recreational activities for all children and youth, especially those living in challenging contexts. 
- First aid kits for 8 schools (3/school): To mitigate any risks or injuries resulting from the recreational activities or any other incidents.
5. Training teachers in emergency-related areas (80 teachers).
6. Establishing Parent Teachers Associations (PTA) in all targeted schools (8 PTSs).
7. Conducting back to school campaign to promote inclusive education (in 8 IDP sites).
8. Provision of desks and essential school furniture for the TLCs hosting schools 

The project will address the different needs of girls and boys of different ages and disparities: All the activities will be implemented in line with INEE guidelines and the cluster standards to ensure that they consider the different needs of boys and girls and students with disabilities. Additionally, NMO will promote inclusive education through project activities. For example, the teacher training in emergencies will discuss child Protection/Well-being and Inclusion,  gender-responsive curricula, Lesson Planning and case referral,  making teaching and learning processes responsive to the specific needs of girls and boys. Moreover, there will be back to school campaign to promote inclusive education.

The main targeted group is IDP children in school-age however, children from the host community in school-age will also benefit from the intervention as it will ensure that the schools remain operational and will support and train teachers in addition, students from the host community will also be targeted to prevent any tension between the two groups.

8 Targeted Schools:
Al Khokha:22-May,Omar bin Al Khattab, Al Shaheed Qamhad,Al Noor,Al Fateh
At Tuhayta: 14 Oct,AL Fateh, Al Shatae</narrative>
