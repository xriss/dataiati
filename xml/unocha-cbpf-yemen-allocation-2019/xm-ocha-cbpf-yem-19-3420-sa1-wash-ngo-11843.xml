Based on the DO NO HARM principles, SOUL will sustain AAP and include gender mainstreaming throughout all project phases and activities, ensuring these principles by applying a comprehensive and solid MEAL system. Further dimensions taken into consideration include transparency and culture sensibility also, inclusiveness is considered, not only in terms of gender, age, or special needs cases, but also by ensuring that &#x2018;there is no way to exclude any person on whatever basis.
Its approach will provide the targeted communities with following WASH services and supplies:
 1. rehabilitation /maintainance of water supply systems in areas with high SAM prevalence by the following 
a. Repair, rehabilitate or augment water supply systems. This maintenance plan will cover 2 water systems in Maqbanah, Only 13% from the load case is considered

SOUL and AFD-SIP  will draft an Exit Strategy outlines, which will be discussed with the communities during an early stage of the project implementation. 

The SIP will take major responsibility of the field work, teams management and arrangement&#x2026;etc., related to the following 
Activity 1.1.1 Repair, rehabilitate or augment of water supply systems in areas with high SAM prevalence in Maqbanah at the field level
Activity 1.4.1 Training of Water Management Committee.

SOUL plans to cover the WASH gap in Maqbanah as a scale up to the already ongoing project. The ongoing project is funded by the OCHA under the YHPF&#x2019;s 1SA, 2018, and It is an Emergency WASH Intervention targeting  Dimnat Khadir, At Ta&apos;iziyah and Mawiyah district. It is worth mentioning here that, this project (i.e. Emergency WaSH intervention in Maqbanah - Taizz Gov.) will be implemented under the management and supervision of the ongoing project management team, thus both will have the same end date and both project will be closed at the same date. This project timeline is built on the fact that the ongoing project will have 4 months&#x2019; extension.</narrative>
