   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Parameter 2: Provision of Emergency lifesaving Health Services to the targeted IDPs and host communities at 12 Hosting Sites and 2 Health Facilities at AL-Mukha District ,Taiz Governorate</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Health and Education Association for Development (SWAT) plans over this project period of 11 months to provide emergency lifesaving health services to the most vulnerable population of IDPs and host communities in Al-Mukha district via 2 health facilities and a mobile clinic (MC) to cover 12 community hosting sites. The overall beneficiaries target by health services is 1954 IDPs (678 men, 690 women, 290 boys and 296 girls) and 5680 host communities (1968 men, 2008 women, 844 boys and 860 girls), they will receive basic emergency and lifesaving health services through different modalities via fixed health services, mobile team and referring cases to the nearest referral health facilities for medical care needed. 
In complete coordination with Taiz GHO and Al-Mukha DHO, two very partially functioning health facilities had been identified to serve the targeted vulnerable population as they are covered under their catchment areas, the two HFs are: 1) Al-Mukha Maternal and Child Health Center (MCHC) in Al-Mukha hospital and 2) Yakhtel Health Center (HC).
The package of health service to be provided includes the primary health care services of IMCI, ANC, PNC, management of acute malnutrition, first aid of casualties, communicable diseases prevention, NCDs basic care in addition to BeMONC services. The provision of Gynecologist will enable MCHC in Al-Mukha hospital to provide the full package of BeMONC services and high risk pregnancies with complications that need Cesarean Sections will be referred to Aden and Lahj hospitals which is the only lifesaving measure to be done to save pregnant women that couldn&#x2019;t deliver via normal process.
Raising awareness on the health issues for the targeted beneficiaries and communities is an essential part of this project, it will serve in preventing the occurrence of many NCDs and CDs through providing the targeted communities with the proper health messages on the priority health topics especially those related to the specific environmental characteristics of Al-Mukha area such as Malaria and Dengue Fever, this also will include a focus on prevention of Acute Watery Diarrheas (Cholera) as the current wave is also stroking the area and the deterioration is most likely because of the change in season where Cholera is much activated in warm and hot seasons.
 According to the RNA findings, the essential needs for health service provision had been specified for the two targeted health facilities which are covering the needs gaps for health staff especially a Gynecologist for MCHC of Al-Mukha Hospital along with the rest essential supportive medical and para-medical staff. The support of the HFs will include also a provision of essential medical equipment and furniture and also essential medicines and medical supply according to the needs and service level provided.
 The project will be managed in close coordination with Health sub-cluster in Aden, Taiz GHO and Al-Mukha district DHO to insure keeping all main stakeholders in the loop and avoid any overlapping in service provision, this will include a close MampE activity to the operation sites including the involvement of beneficiaries through formed community committees and fixing a complaint and feedback mechanism.
 The regular progress and spot reports will be shared with the health sub-cluster in Aden and Taiz GHO and Al-Mukha DHO and will be uploaded to GMS within the given deadline.</narrative>
