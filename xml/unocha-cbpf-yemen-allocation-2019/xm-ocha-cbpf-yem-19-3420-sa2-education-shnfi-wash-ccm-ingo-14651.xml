   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The proposed project will support the improvement of living conditions and access to essential basic services for internally displaced persons (IDPs) living in settlements across five (5) governorates in Yemen. These are Hajjah, Amran, Amanat Al-Asimah, Taiz and Al-Dhale&apos;e. This is an integrated programme focusing on Shelter, WASH, and Education interventions. The proposed interventions are in line with YHF Second Standard Allocation Strategy covering priority gaps under the first and second line responses. additionally, the proposed interventions are in line with the prioritized funding gaps identified by the WASH, Shelter, CCCM and Education clusters. 

Under WASH, the target population in Amran and Huth will be supported to access safe water for household consumption through the rehabilitation of three community water supply schemes (two in Amran and one in Huth district). The water will be tested regularly and chlorinated to ensure safety. Established WASH committees will be trained on operation, maintenance and management of the systems. Hygiene promotion activities will be carried out to improve hygiene practices in the target communities. Solid waste management will be undertaken to ensure improved public health. This will include clean-up campaigns and garbage collection. 52,790 individuals (40,722 in Amran and 12,068 in Huth) will benefit from increased access to water, solid waste management support and hygiene promotion activities.   

Under Shelter/CCCM, the interventions will benefit 7,372 households comprising 51,604 Individuals (11,869 Men, 12,385 Women, 13,417 Boys, and 13,933 Girls). The interventions include shelter rehabilitation and provision of basic household non-food items. Selected vulnerable households will be provided with cash grants to enable them rehabilitate their damaged shelters. The cash modality is chosen because it enables beneficiaries the opportunity to prioritize what they want among various options. It is also proven to facilitate fast, efficient and timely delivery of assistance. Market surveys conducted by NRC is the proposed target locations have ascertained the availability of necessary materials in the local market. On the other hand, needy families that are renting accommodation around IDP sites and who have difficulties meeting the rental charges will be supported with rental subsidies. The shelter/NFIs activities will be integrated with CCCM, WASH and Education intervention in the same locations to ensure greater impact of the assistance provided. The project will support strengthening of coordination mechanisms, improvement of infrastructure and enhancement of community participation in 15 IDP settlements in Amran, Hajjah and Hodiedah Governorates. Improved coordination will result in better identification of needs and appropriate provision of necessary assistance including referrals to service providers. Housing Land and Property (HLP) issues will be identified and addressed as necessary. 

Under the Education component implemented in Dhubab, Qataba and Al Dhale districts, different teaching and learning, recreational and hygiene materials will be provided to students, teachers, and schools. Additional classrooms TLSs will be constructed and furnished to address the challenge of overcrowding. WASH facilities in schools will be rehabilitated, providing gender-segregated latrines and teacher incentives.The proposed Education interventions are in line with the observed needs by NRC where it According to data from the education cluster Aden hub in September, 2019 more than 49 schools across four districts in Al Dhale governorate were not functional as a result of having been occupied by IDPs fleeing the fighting that erupted in April - May 2019. Thirteen (13) schools were reported in Al Dhale district, twelve (12) in Al Hussein, eight (8) in Azraq and sixteen (16) in Qa&#x2019;atabah. 15 schools in the 4 districts assessed in Taizz (Dubbab).</narrative>
