   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Parameter 1: Provision of Emergency Food assistance and School Supplies and Rehabilitation: An Integrated intervention for the Population in IPC Phase 5 in AlQafr District  of Ibb Governorate</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This integrated FSAC- Education proposed project is implemented under Parameter 1: Expanding high impact programs in districts classified as IPC 4 amp 5.It aligns with the First Standard Allocation of 2019 (SA1) objective to help cover key gaps in the existing operation and support the immediate scale-up of activities in highly vulnerable communities. The project design is based on Integrated Food Security Phase Classification analysis and need that shows that 20.1 m. people (67% of the total population) would be in need of urgent action (IPC Phase 3 and above), including 238,000 people in IPC Phase 5 (Catastrophe) had HFA not been delivered (December 2018 -January 2019). This intervention also aim to increase access to food for highly vulnerable families across the country. The proposed intervention targets Al Qafr district of Ibb Gov. which classified of having population in IPC phase 5 catastrophe by IPC analysis. Accordingly, to respond to this identified extreme need, this project will be implemented through Emergency Food Assistance to 1098 HH (7,901 individuals, 1,877 men,  2,157 women,  1,998 boys and  1,869 girls) most vulnerable populations (meeting FSAC targeting and vulnerability criteria including households (HH) headed by Females, people with disabilities, elderly, and chronically ill people). Voucher Transfer to severely food insecure families, newly displaced IDPs and host families facing extreme hunger in Al Qafr district of Ibb Gov. for 6 consecutive rounds/month. The proposed intervention will allow targeted households to meet their minimum food security needs and reduce the use of negative coping strategies. KFD will distribute vouchers as a modality of food assistance as per the recommendation of market and contextual assessment report conducted February 2019. The proposed project also fit within the education cluster S1: Ensure that schools remain open and operational and provide access to quality accredited formal education to conflict-affected children aged 6-17 (boys and girls). It also aims to increase enrolment and retention of school-age children in Al Qafr through the provision of school supplies (9, 568 students) school rehabilitation (18 schools) teachers (men and women) supplies (358) a total of  4218, and 3902 students will benefit from new and repaired desks respectively, and  3973 students will benefit from the provision of white/blackboards. KFD conducted Initial Rapid Need Assessment (IRNA) on January in 4 schools which involved consultation a total of 157 community members (65 females, 64 males, 17 IDPs, 11 Host HHs).The IRNA shows that lack of curriculum school supplies cost lack of WASH facilities and lack of teachers are the main reasons for the low enrolment of school-age children. KFD adopts an effective and efficient integration approach that will have a high impact on the targeted population. To enhance integrity of the activities implemented under each cluster for same beneficiaries, KFD will select schools for rehabilitation that are located in high density sub-districts where the majority of HHs meet FSAC vulnerability selection criteria. FSAC priority for HHs selection will be also applied to HHs with children enrolled in the rehabilitated schools.This strategy will ensure that families with children who are enrolled in the targeted schools will also receive cash/voucher assistance via FSAC thus improving children access to education. KFD is actively participates in the relevant coordination at all levels including NAMCHA and MoE (will be consulted on the project&#x2019;s activities and location), Nutrition, Health, WASH, Education and Food Security and Agriculture clusters., KFD coordinates its activities with FSAC and Education clusters and their partners implementing similar Food Security and Education interventions to avoid overlapping and duplication. This intervention also builds upon KDF extensive and continuous work in implementing FSL and education programs.</narrative>
