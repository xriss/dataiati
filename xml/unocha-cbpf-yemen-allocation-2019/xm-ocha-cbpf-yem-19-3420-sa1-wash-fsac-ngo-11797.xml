   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Parameter 1: Integrated WASH and Food Security Response in Khanfar district - Abyan Governorate</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project main objective is to contribute in high impact FS amp WASH projects in districts classified as IPC 4 and above, which is where Khanfar district in Abyan governorate is classified. Where NMO will seek to do that by increasing access to food for highly vulnerable families, in addition to increasing access to safe drinking water, where the interventions will address IFRR household level and system/HF level respectively. The beneficiaries of the project will receive integrated intervention in health, food, WASH, and education sectors, where all the sectors will target heath facilities and their catchment areas. The project FS and WASH components are mainly targeting 4 health facilities catchment areas as follows: Amswad Yrames HU,  Aljoul Yrames HU,  Saken Wa&#x2019;ees HU,  and Kadmah Aslan HU. The project will benefit men, women, boys, and girls who are in risk of famine and malnutrition. As it will address the food needs of those food insecure people for 6 consequences months, in order to help them securing their food needs and preventing from using negative coping strategies that may harm their diet and livelihood. At the same time, it will also increase access to safe drinking water through rehabilitation of existed water sources/systems in Khanfar district. By securing food needs, the targeted HHs food security level should increase and the famine risk should decrease accordingly, also, they could save the money they use on food to be invest in small income generating activities, or they could use it to expand their current source of income example: expanding their herd of livestock, expanding their farming activities, etc&#x2026;
Additionally, by increasing access to safe water, the morbidity rate should decrease, especially for diarrhea. NMO will provide food assistance targeting 1000 HHs (around 6,000 individuals), where each household should receive 6 rounds of assistance during the project implementation. As a first step of implementation, NMO will conduct a market assessment to decide whether to go vouchers or Cash modality in coordination with FSAC and YHF. 
The WASH assistance will target (Aljoul Yrames HU, and Kadmah Aslan HU) by rehabilitation of water sources/systems as per the attached BOQs, which will provide sustainable solution for the targeted areas. While CLTS and Hygiene Promotion activities will be implemented in all the targeted HFs catchments, which will enhance sanitation condition through community mobilization (behavior change), that could lead to better hygiene practices.
For effective and efficient implementation of the project, the community involvement/participation will be at all stages of the project, where NMO will establish community committee in order to involve the local community in the project implementation.The project will implement with good coordination with the NGOs that implements projects in Khanfar, especially the ones that covers the other IFRR sectors such as CSSW.
The MampE team of NMO will conduct Base line, and End line evaluation, in order to keep track on the project performance to follow the project outcome and output indicators to meet its targets.
Moreover, the MampE team will conduct several PDMs , in order to insure safe delivery of items to the beneficiaries, alongside with monitoring field visits and feedback mechanism that will achieve accountability to affected population. NMO will adhere to the IFRR HH vulnerability criteria in beneficiaries selection as follows: 
1.Severely food insecure HHs 2.IDP HHs 3.Host HHs hosting IDPs 4.HHs with children under 5 with  (SAM) or (MAM) 5.HHs with children under five years old and/or PLWs6.Female headed HHs7.Child headed HHs 8.HHs with no productive assets, or functional means of income.9.
