Mitigations of risks are: 
-Close coordination with all stakeholders at the central and field levels, obtaining prior permissions, good communication and continuous awareness raising sessions, YFCA field team will keep track of the market prices monitoring any significant trends/changes, contracting with supplier/s in USD so the price fluctuation will be mitigated, YFCA will intensify MampE activities and community-based complaint mechanism to discover any deviation and take corrective measures on-time, penalty measures of inappropriate items will be clearly outlines in the articles of the supplier/s contract. HHs to sign a commitment of not selling the kit, also ensure all targeting and verification activities be conducted late as March in the event the sub-agreement took three months to be signed by SCAMCHA</narrative>
