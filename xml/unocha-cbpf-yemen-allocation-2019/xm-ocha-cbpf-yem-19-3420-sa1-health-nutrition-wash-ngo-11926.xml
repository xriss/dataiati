   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Integrated Health, Nutrition and WaSH project in Milhan district of Al Mahwait Governorate and Maswar district of Amran governorate (P1  P2) 1st SA 2019</narrative>

  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project was designed to improve the access of affected and vulnerable people of Milhan district of AL Mahwait governorate and Maswar district of Amran governorate to the lifesaving health, nutrition and WASH services. YDN proposes this project in the first and second parameters of the first standard allocation 2019 that aim to expand high impact programs in districts classified as IPC 4 and above, and scale up assistance in priority IDP hosting sites. As both Milhan and Maswar districts were found to be with population in IPC 5, they were put in the allocation as priority districts. In addition to Huth camp in Amran governorate that is a priority IDP site, too. 
To get a better picture of the actual status, YDN conducted an in-depth needs assessment in Milhan district to assess the main WASH and health needs, in addition to health facilities assessment in both targeted districts to determine the targeted facilities and identify their needs.
In health, it&#x2019;s planned to support one district hospital in Maswar district of Amran governorate with medications, equipment, medical supplies, operational costs, cleaning and disinfection supplies and incentives for health staff to provide primary and secondary health care services in adherence to the minimum service package. In Milhan, one health center and two health units will be supported with medications, equipment, operational costs, and incentives for health staff to provide primary health care services in adherence to the minimum service package. Supporting these health facilities is going to improve affected people&#x2019;s access to health services and improve the overall health status in both districts.
Nutrition services are going to be provided in Maswar hospital and the health units in Milhan district. These services include screening of U5 children and pregnant and lactating women for malnutrition, management of SAM cases, capacity building for both health workers and community health volunteers, and increasing the awareness through IYCF.
WASH Intervention will focus on reducing the proportion of people without sustainable access to safe drinking water in Milhan district of Al Mahwit by the rehabilitation of water schemes (unprotected spring), which are the main water source for the majority of the district population and found to be neither clean nor easy to access by them according to the conducted needs assessment. In addition to the provision of water filters and jerry cans. Such rehabilitation is expected to ensure clean water is easier to access for the targeted people. Moreover, increasing beneficiaries&#x2019; access to safe sanitation in areas with high SAM prevalence through latrine construction, which is one of the most acute needs of the targeted community as the majority of them has no access to safe latrines for any of the family members, and improving hygiene practices by conducting awareness sessions on key hygiene messages and distribution of consumable hygiene kits.
This integrated project targeting Milhan and Maswar districts, and Huth camp in Huth district, will definitely alleviate the devastating situation and, for sure, improve health, nutrition and WASH conditions of the targeted populations, and will, up to the limits, seek sustainability through rehabilitating water sources, constructing latrines, equipping health facilities, and building the capacities of health workers, community health volunteers, and targeted communities.</narrative>
