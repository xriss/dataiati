  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Since late 2016, more than 1.3 million suspected cholera cases and nearly 2,800 associated deaths have been reported in 306 districts across Yemen. Sustained conflict since 2015 has resulted in the deaths of tens of thousands of civilians. Despite the tremendous needs, access constraints have challenged the humanitarian system, delaying services to those in need and diverting aid from the
communities for which it is intended. Internal displacement of 3.3 million Yemenis exacerbates an already dire situation as communities in resource challenged areas struggle to cope with protracted
displaced populations competing for services and livelihoods. In order to help address these expanding needs, IOM bolstered and expanded operations in 2018 in order to provide efficient multisector
humanitarian response. IOM&#x2019;s emergency response programming expanded by 200% since 2017.

In response to widespread health needs, and in line with the 2019 Yemen Humanitarian Response Plan, the Health Cluster&#x2019;s objectives for the year, and priority governorates identified for the Yemen Humanitarian Fund&#x2019;s (YHF) first standard allocation strategy, IOM will provide life-saving healthcare assistance &#x2013; inclusive of primary, secondary, maternal and child, and reproductive healthcare services &#x2013; to 93,400 individuals in Ibb, Marib and Dhamar governorates. In Ibb, IOM will operate in the following districts and support the following health centres: Al Lahj Health center, Al Ghorbah in Al Mashanna district Nasser Hospital to support Al Udayn, Jiblah and Al Dhihar districts and Al-Qaida Hospital and Al-Horri health unit in Dhi As Sufal and Ibb districts. In Marib, IOM will support Al-Rodah Heatlh care centre in Marib City and Alshaheed Mohammed Hail Hospital and AlGofinah IDP site mobile health team in Marib and Harib Al Qaramish districts. In Dhamar, IOM will support a mobile health team in Jahran district (see Annex 1 and 2 for detailed beneficiary and caseload breakdown).

The project will ensure an integrated and comprehensive healthcare response to the needs of the conflict-affected population in these areas, under the YHF Advisory Board&#x2019;s endorsed 2nd Parameter for the 1st Standard Allocation: scaling up assistance in priority IDP hosting sites. 

Seven fixed health care facilities and two mobile medical team will serve in areas where IDPs and affected host communities reside, to ensure that health services are made available and are accessible to the most vulnerable (including vulnerable displaced populations, women, children, people with special needs and the elderly). Cases identified with infectious diseases and acute malnutrition will be prioritized, and complex cases will be referred to secondary healthcare facilities as needed. To ensure community cohesion, and reduce tensions between displaced populations and with host communities, host communities will be targeted within the proposed, with a priority to the same vulnerable categories.

IOM&#x2019;s needs-based approach as well as the project&#x2019;s alignment with inter-agency strategies, beneficiary information and proposed activities are detailed below.

As part of its overall health program strategy, IOM adheres to Minimum Service Package (MSP) through the provision of human resources for health and the procurement and distribution of medicines and medical supplies. In addition, salaries of healthcare professionals and operating costs of select health care facilities will be supported, to ensure access to healthcare services by the most vulnerable. Proposed approaches under this project are aligned with the YHF Joint Cluster Approach, to carry out &#x201C;General services, communicable diseases prevention and control, minimum initial service for RH, inpatient care for SAM amp immunization. Emergency training, operational support and incentives for health staff&#x201D;.</narrative>
