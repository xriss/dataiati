   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Parameter 1: Provision of life-saving food emergency food assistance for the most affected IDPs and Host Communities in Al-Hali district at Hodeida governorate</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Life Makers Meeting Place Organization (LMMPO) is proposing a 10 months food emergency response via cash/voucher to enable 700 HHs of the most vulnerable and food insecure people in Al-Hali district at Hodeida governorate.
The main activities of this project will include:
-	Market assessment (through which the modality will be decided).
-	Community formation and training.
-	Beneficiary selection via community committees and LMMPO field team.
-	Monthly distribution of Cash/Voucher for food for 6 consecutive rounds.
-	PDMs.
The above activities will be closely coordinated with the local authorities and community itself starting from market needs assessments, beneficiary selection and ending with post distribution monitoring. Coordination will take place with other humanitarian actors (I/NGOs) and coordination with relevant clusters at Hodeida hub during planning and implementation of the project to consolidate partnership in targeting same affected population and having shared selection criteria for IPC Phase 4 amp 5 within the target district. Moreover, LMMPO will be implementing a WASH project which will contribute to improving the health status of the targeted HHs and beneficiaries in same districts. 
The intervention addresses the priority criteria as defined by the allocation strategy amp FSAC in terms of highest priority geographical location (Hodeida governorate). The First Standard Allocation &#x2013; Strategy January 2019 gave priority to distribution of food, cash, or vouchers on a monthly basis for 6 consecutive months to the same IDP or community household. Al-Hali district is one of the districts classified as IPC 4+ where the population experience catastrophic conditions. This intervention is to alleviate the situation of the population as a live-saving measure. The project intends to contribute to the reduction of severe hunger among highly vulnerable families by distributing unconditional cash or vouchers for food to 700 HHs from IDPs and host community classified as IPC 4+ and who face extreme hunger in Al-Hali district and that would be for consecutive 6 rounds. Further, the district is classified as food insecure where malnutrition and cholera spread widely. The aim is to improve immediate household availability and access to food for the most vulnerable and conflict-affected host/IDP households/population.
This project will consider different needs of women and girls, men and boys and people with disabilities. As these will be considered in selection criteria where female and child headed households, people with disabilities, elderlies and HHs with malnourished cases are given a priority in this project. HHs with many under 5 and malnourished children will be considered as priority. Delivery of the services will consider the conditions and protection concerns of the target group via facilitating easy and safe access to the cash or voucher for food services. Moreover, the community committees&#x2019; involvements and participation during project implementation will consider men and women participation in project implementation and voicing the community feedback and concerns with reference to the project service provision and other community needs as well.
The project might have some access challenges if the security situation deteriorated. LMMPO consider mitigation measures like contracting private sectors who have the ability to provide assistance in Al-Hali or in other places if beneficiaries are forced to move. LMMPO has strong connections with the community leaders, volunteers, active partners within the targeted district to share experience and support. 
LMMPO trusts to achieve the project outcome building on its completed three and two ongoing projects in Hodeida where it has strong expertise in food security projects with experienced field staff who completed with high achievements more than 3 FSAC projects. Coordination is already made with local authorities in Hodeida and this will ease implementation.</narrative>
