   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Oxfam proposed actions will restore the livelihoods of 1300 hhs ( 9100 individuals in   Al Magraba sub-district   of  Bani Qa&#x2019;is district, Hajja. The district is one of highly conflict affected districts in Hajja and has been categorized by the 2018 Yemen IPC analysis in IPC 4 with population in IPC 5. The conflict has resulted in destruction of agriculture livelihoods which is the main source of food and cash income for the majority population in the target areas. The conflict has only resulted in high prices of agricultural inputs (seeds, water, fertilizer, pesticide land preparation) but also made agricultural activities difficult. Small farmers could not afford buying inputs to resume their agricultural activities and meet their food needs. The district has a high need for livelihoods support among the agricultural and fishing communities, however a huge gap in livelihoods response has constrained many vulnerable farming households not to restart their agricultural activities and cope with the impact of the crisis. FSAC&#x2019;s recent analysis show that out of the total 50062 individuals target of FSAC in 2019, only 403 individuals (less than 1%) have so far received livelihood support in the district      
 
This proposal proposes a cash plus agricultural inputs (seeds, tools and training) package support to meet livelihoods&#x2019; needs of 1300  highly vulnerable farming households in four villages  of  Al Magraba sub district  who  are at high risk of becoming acutely food insecure. It has also cash support to the same beneficiaries for a period of 3 month to cover 50% of the minimum food basket. In addition, the project will provide the beneficiary during the pick time of agricultural activities, when access to food is very limited, to support the success of the agricultural support. To increase the success, the beneficiaries will receive the cash and agricultural inputs after preparing their fields for planting 

The project will distribute USD 50 /hh/month for a three month period to  fill food consumption gaps. The cash will be distributed through a financial service provider at community level. Oxfam&#x2019;s market monitoring in the targeted areas show that beneficiaries have access to functional local markets to buy basic commodities. Targeted communities are also familiar with cash assistance and prefer it to in kind assistance.  As for the agricultural inputs support, the support will be provided to the beneficiaries in kind or vouches depending on agricultural inputs market situations and target beneficiaries&#x2019; preference.  Oxfam will conduct a rapid feasibility and market assessment in the target districts to inform the decision 
Oxfam has been operational in Hajja since 2012 and has a lot of experience and capacity to implement livelihoods support. In the past Oxfam provided the most vulnerable household with different livelihoods support to successfully restart or develop vegetables and crop production, beekeeping, goat rearing, small groceries and skills-based services. It has also established a good working relationship with local authorities, traders, financial service providers, veterinarians etc  to successfully implement livelihoods intervention in Hajja  in a participatory and collaboration manner.  
Oxfam will closely work with the ministry of Agriculture, small traders and financial service provider to successfully implement the project. It will also uses its participatory approaches to engage all key stakeholders including affected communities to implement the project in line with local and FSAC&#x2019;s standards.  Oxfam will particularly and work with the Ministry of Agriculture and private agricultural inputs providers to ensure the project is implemented in a no nt harm approach. Oxfam has systems and procedures that will be used to managing potential risks of the project (security, financial, mis use funds, etc )  while implementing the project</narrative>
