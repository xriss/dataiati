  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The intervention is a WASH project that will take place in Al Hodeidah Governorate in two districts: Al Munirah and Az Zaidyiah. The project aims at ameliorating the living conditions in IDPs collective Sites and the promotion of durable solutions with full participation of the IDPs and local communities
The criteria used for targeting beneficiaries were the displacement, severity of the need, unavailability of near water sources (the closest water sources are about 2 kms away), and existence of suspended water projects in the area where IDPs are found
The project activities include: repairing, rehabilitation, and augmenting of water supply systems rehabilitation of wells after doing quality surveillance  provision of communal water taps building latrines installing full solar-powered units on wells solid waste collection and disposal distribution of hygiene consumable and basic kits training of community volunteers on hygiene promotion and community engagement approaches and training of five water committees to operate the water projects. The activities have been placed in a timely plan illustrated with the number of beneficiaries in each area
The project has started by establishing strong coordination with all relevant stakeholders: NAMCHA and all governmental authorities of concern at the central, governorate, and district levels WASH Cluster HFU at OCHA and key community leaders
AGF has proved its capacity in implementing WASH projects by having a well-qualified team composed of a project manager, two engineers, a WASH officer, a logistic officer, a coordinator, an MampE officer, two field supervisors, and volunteers. AGF has also built a variety of practical contacts with WASH stock and service providers therefore, AGF is capable to get any required stock or service whenever needed 
AGF knows well the areas of intervention and their needs for it has implemented multisectoral projects in the same areas presented in this proposal including WASH, especially, the construction of concrete tanks and networks. Accordingly, this has resulted in building a tangible database about the area, its people, and their needs of WASH services
Also, AGF has conducted a rapid needs assessment in the areas of intervention for the purpose of understanding the living condition of the surveyed communities during the crisis of war and displacement through collecting pertinent and UpToDate information 
The WASH needs of IDPs and local communities have been fully identified by the AGF&#x2019;s well-trained team on WASH principles and humanitarian work. In addition to close-eye observation, the team has conducted several meetings with the managers of the water projects and has interviewed many people in focus group discussions to recognize the needs of both IDPs and host communities
Not only does the needs assessment focus on the WASH, but also it focuses on identifying the various coping mechanisms employed by IDPs and the local communities, assessing the humanitarian assistance delivered so far in the area, and assessing the gender aspects of the impacts of the crisis of displacement
GAM and protection criteria will be applied to all the activities of the project. People of different ages and social status of both genders will be made sure to be incorporated in the intervention. Sex- and age-disaggregated data has been collected and analyzed in order to tailor assistance to the needs and interests of the different gender and age groups this will help in reducing and mitigating gender-based violence. Besides, men, women and children in appropriate age groups will participate in and influence decisions taken throughout the project 
The project will have a remarkable impact on all aspects of the targeted people&#x2019;s lives. Their health will improve, GBV will be mitigated considerably, more time will be granted to adults for finding other supportive income for their families, and children will have time to go to schools to get some educati</narrative>
