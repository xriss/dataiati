   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Project Summary :	The project has been designed to meet the WASH amp Shelter clusters guidance amp objectives to respond to the objective of reducing the pressures faced by host communities and IDPs. This proposed Interventions seek to cover gaps in the WASH response in one of the most critically affected districts alleviate some of the IDP amp host communities&#x2019; stressors by providing shelter support services.

The WASH interventions will provide conflict- affected beneficiaries improved access to safe drinking water by: 
-Training the water committee to manage water supply amp sanitation services
-Repairing amp rehabilitating 2 harvest water tanks
-Rehabilitating the Sanitation Network in Haydan central butchery 
-Conducting awareness sessions
-Providing cleaning campaigns 

The Shelter support interventions will consist of: providing 2300 NFIs in Haydan and kitaf districts, training for assessment and registration team, and conducting a rapid need assessment including the PDM Report for the shelter interventions. 

The targeted beneficiaries for the WASH interventions will be 10,812 individuals (2120 men, 2206 women, 3178 boys, 3308 girls) in Haydan, and for the Shelter interventions will be 16100 individual beneficiaries (3157 men, 3284 women, 4733 boys, 4926 girls) in Kitaf amp Haydan.

The intervention aims to alleviate suffering for women amp children who are responsible for fetching water used for drinking amp other domestic uses. Women will have more time for taking care of their children amp family members in the time saved from fetching water for their HHs. Equally, children will have more time to be able to join classes amp get an education instead of spend time fetching water. Also, people with disabilities will be provided with safe drinking water, which will protect them from catching water-borne diseases. This project will provide a sustainable healthy environment for 26,912  of the most affected populations, host communities amp IDPs. Furthermore, IDPs in the area will also be provided  NFIs to facilitate their living situation, in addition to having increased access to water. Since many IDPs are vulnerable due to their unstable living situations (either in open settlements or dependent upon host communities), the WASH and Shelter interventions will complement each other to alleviate IDP&#x2019;s suffering, in facilitating their access to water, offering a cleaner environment for them to live, and alleviate IDP children&#x2019;s burden of fetching water.

The security situation has deteriorated, amp risks that we may face are: WASH interventions may be targeted, meaning beneficiaries have less access to water beneficiaries demand to add activities that aren&#x2019;t included in project amp rehabilitation of WASH projects may provoke conflict. NFDHR has faced many similar challenges in the field amp has gathered lessons learnt, so we hold the capacity to solve these challenges amp mitigate the risks.

NFDHR is currently working in Sa&#x2019;ada in WASH, FSL, Health, Nutrition, Protection amp Education contexts, so we are familiar with the terrain, amp have a great deal of experience with local stakeholders through our field office in Sa&#x2019;ada. Our access is never restricted due to our diligent implementation amp coordination with all stakeholders. We have a team of elite WASH/ Shelter who thoroughly contribute to improving the quality of deliverables. NFDHR is also focal point for WASH cluster in Sa&#x2019;ada.

We will continue to ensure strong integrated amp comprehensive response to the affected host communities amp IDPs who need humanitarian assistance to ensure that the 26,912 individuals (5275 men, 5490 women, 7912 boys, 8235 girls) have improved access to safe water amp sanitation amp Shelter to the target areas in Kitaf amp Haydan districts.
