   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Emergency parameter 1 High Impact Health Response for highly vulnerable communities at risk of famine in Al Ashah  Districts in Amran Governorate, Yemen through activating its rural hospital.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The complex emergency situation in Yemen has caused a major public health crisis with extensive disruption of essential primary and secondary health care. The crisis has led to breakdown of  the health care system especially in Al Ashah and its surounded districts leading to outbreak of communicable diseases such as cholera, measles, diphtheria and dengue fever. The economic deterioration led to the lack of operational cost and health workers have gone for more than three years with no salaries. Consequently, this has increased the workload in urban hospitals due to limited health care staff despite the increased morbidity in the governorate.

The project will seeks to improve access to high impact health interventions of primary and secondary health care  through provision of Minimum Health Service Package in Al Ashah district hospitals, which serve al Ashah district directly and many other district around indirectly (like al Qaflah and Huth and harf swfian)  to provide  the most needed life-saving health services to the vulnerable community members in this districts. Primary health care services will comprise of outpatient consultation for adult and child, immunization of pregnant mothers and children under-five year, anti and post natal care ,skilled delivery by qualified midwives and gynecologist, integrated management of childhood illnesses, management and prevention of the communicable diseases ,delivery care and provision of essential medication and distribuation of clean delivery kit for pregnant in the third trimaster.

services In Secondary health care will be expanded to cover the life-saving health intervention especially basic life support and trauma care from minor  to major trauma cases including  general Surgery in addition to stabilization, first aid and transfer of complicated cases from lower-level facilities. The project will also ensure to have inpatient care, basic laboratory, delivery care and otpatient curative servises  in the targeted hospitals. 

In the targeted hospital the project will enforce patient safety interventions as well as safe waste management especially for epidemic diseases like cholera and diphtheria. This project will also support functionalization of Stabilization Centers for severely malnourished cases with medical complications referred from Outpatient Therapeutic Programmes across the districts which will solve the diffeculty to reach the nearest sabilization center which need more than 4 hours travelling.

There is a serious gap in reproductive life-saving health services hence the need to improve the access by strengthening emergency obstetric and neonatal care through the establishment of basic and comprehensive emergency mother and neonate life-saving care service. The project will procure medications and medical equipment to address the current shortage making the supported hospital  ypically provide all mentioned planned project interventions while adhering to Minimum Initial Service Package (MISP) standards in reproductive health. Psychological services in the country and specifically in Amran Governorate are limited hence the need to train health care staff on counselling and referral mechanisms of those in need of mental health services in addition to recruit psychologest to treat the currently large number of psychatric conditions.

Community involvement and advocacy will be strengthened at the targeted district to improve the utilization of health care.
The range of services will include basic curative care (IMCI) but also common diseases as well as NCD), simplified ANC/PNC and Family Planning, as well as screening, management and monitoring of SAM cases with no hospital admission criteria. The project will support all procedure for the management and prevention of the epidemic diseases including the early discovering of any epidemic conditions.</narrative>
