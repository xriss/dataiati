  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Over the planned period of 9 months Abs development Organization (ADO)  aims to respond to the High, amp critical multi-sectoral needs of 9705 (1927 men, 1951 women, 2644 boys, 3183 girls) affected people in 8 IDPs sites of Abs district. In continuation of ADO&apos;s commitments (ADO currently managing all IDPs sites in the whole of Abs district/Hajjah  through Site management and coordination project (CCCM) in partnership with UNHCR) to those IDPs in 8 proposed IDPs  sites, an integrated (Food , and Health assistance) project will be implemented by ADO. The activities of interventions under this project aim to cover gaps in first-line responses using key approaches and modalities endorsed by the respective clusters ( FSAC, and HC), as well as to build on our On-going  CCCM intervention in providing Humanitarian assistance at Abs district to ensure the maximum benefit and impact of the interventions for the most-in-need communities. In response to the gap, and through this grant  ADO will  Provide Integrated (Food, amp health) Response for the affected people in the proposed 8  IDPs sites which will be as following:
 In food the project will distribute 1120 FA(Cash/ voucher) 6 consecutive months to 1120 HH of high vulnerable people in two  targeted IDPs site(Upper, and lower Alma&apos;ssarah) out of 8 targeted IDPs sites in Abs district to address the financial barrier, this modality selected based on MARKET ASSESSMENT(report draft attached) result which as following a- markts are functional and the food items are available. B- availability and accessibility of FSPs c- many convenience reasons raised by beneficiary to select this modality , and capacity of ADO to deliver such as intervention. ADO  will be  conduct a curate food security assessment at the beginning of project to be as baseline for the food assistance intervention.
 In health component, the project will target all affected people in 8 of priority IDPs site( including Upper and Lower Almassarah IDPs sites), and will focus on provision primary health care including outpatient consultation, basic reproductive health, immunization though 2 mobile medical teams(MMT), and activate the referral mechanism  to refer the urgent case to the nearest to secondary health care, and nearest DTC, Heath education through CHVs. Based on the GAP NEED ASSESSMENT which conduct by ADO, those 8 proposed  IDPs sites have been not targeted by any Humanitarian agency to provide health service before(see the GAP NEED ASSESSMENT) 
So The same beneficiaries in Upper amp Lower Massarah IDPs site( 1120HHs) will targeted by both  Food and Health service,  and the other targeted beneficiaries in the rest 6 targeted IDPs sites will provide with just  health service to be as complementary  for the  other humanitarian partner activities(OXFAM, WFP,SHS, and ADO).The project will achieve this by providing a life-saving intervention in  Food, and health.
 ADO will ensure the alignment of planned activities under this project with the concepts of protection and gender mainstreaming while providing humanitarian assistance using very clear and specific mechanisms that could be easily monitored and measured, in addition to demonstrating its &#x2019;accountability towards beneficiaries&#x2019; rights during designing, implementing and evaluating this project through adhering to the AAP framework for respective clusters. 
The management of this project will be carried out by high professional central and field staff who abide by internal code of conduct which is aligned with humanitarian principles.
ADO MEAL unit will fulfill effectively the tasks of MampE as per the designed plan to ensure the timeliness and quality of implementation throughout the project duration using innovative tailored MampE concepts, modalities and tools at the central and field levels including active community engagement( community committees) through the tool of feedback mechanism.</narrative>
