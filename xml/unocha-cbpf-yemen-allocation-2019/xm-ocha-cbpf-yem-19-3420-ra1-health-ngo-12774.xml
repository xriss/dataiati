   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Over the project duration of 6 months, YFCA plans to implement a package of preventive and curative cholera response Health interventions at Juban and Ash Shu&#x2019;ayb districts of Aldhale&#x2019;e Governorate at 2 DTCs and 10 ORCs to respond to Cholera outbreak at the two targeted districts. (Juban district: 22 May hospital as DTC, Alrpiaiteen HC, Aldabeaneia  Alalia HU, Alawdiah HU,  Alsekayateen HC and Muhrm Hajaj HC.. Ash Shu&#x2019;ayb district: Alrubat HC as DTC,  Aradhah HU, Bani Musalam HU, Bakain HU, Lanjood HU and AlGethee HU)
The main objective of implementing this project is to mitigate the impact of the recent cholera outbreak, reduce its transmission and prevent the loss of lives. 
Based on Health Cluster cholera report issued on 20th of March 2019 Juban district used to report 33 suspected cases out of them 13 cases were confirmed cholera cases via RDT while Ash Shu&#x2019;ayb district reported 3 suspected cases all of them were confirmed positive via RDT with no death cases reported up to the report issuing time. The estimated beneficiaries target to be assisted under this project is 16104 (Men 5153, Women 4509, Boys 3543, Girls 2899), this includes all suspected and confirmed cases along with the family members and community individuals at risk of cholera infection that had been addressed by preventive and curative AWD interventions.
In close coordination with health cluster and Aldhalee GHO and DHOs of Juban and Ash Shu&#x2019;ayb the cholera outbreak health response interventions will take place guided by the cluster SOPs for DTCs amp ORCs establishment including their positioning inside the targeted Hospitals, Health Centers and Health Units if the capacity and infection control requirements are ensured. The interventions package will include also the capacity building of service providers at the targeted HFs on Case Management of AWDs that covers the skills to diagnose the case and assess the status according to the dehydration level and so, to select the treatment plan. The skills of infection control will be also an area to build the staff capacities on, this is an essential element of cholera response to avoid making the service provision location a contaminating point for cholera spread to the rest of bystanders and HF staff members.


YFCA will monitor this project activities using concentrated modalities and tools at the central and field levels with giving more attention to on time reports to health cluster and Aldhalee GHO amp DHOs of Juban and Ash Shu&#x2019;ayb districts.
The monitoring activities will include also frequent MampE supportive visits to all operation sites in a regular manner along with PDM visits after distribution rounds of medical consumables to the project targeted HFs.

The project implementation will be carried out directly from YFCA office in Aldhalee Governorate with technical and administrative backstopping support from our offices in Aden and Ibb if needed while the main office in Sana&#x2019;a will follow up the performance in a close manner to make sure that all interventions are performed as designed and all administrative and financial requirements for HFU are met as per the operation manual guidance.</narrative>
