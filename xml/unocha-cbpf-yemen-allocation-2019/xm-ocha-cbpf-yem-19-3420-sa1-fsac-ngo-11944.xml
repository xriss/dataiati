   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Mayar Foundation for Development (MFD), through this action, aims to address the needs of the most underserved and vulnerable population in Qattabah district, Al-Dhale governorate that are currebtly on the brink of famine with IPC 4+. The project will provide lifesaving interventions in the sectors of food security for a period of 8 months. 7000 individuals (1000HHs) will be targeted. MFD aims to focus on Qattabah district in particular because it is a priority and the selected locations within the district are the most underserved by the humanitarian community and are hard to reach areas (IFRR). In addition, there is a gap in response of life saving food security interventions as there is a limited number of NGOs providing assistance to this population and serving their dire needs. The project would seek to meet the two strategic objectives: provide life-saving assistance to the most vulnerable people in Yemen through an effective, targeted response and ensure that all assistance promotes the protection, safety and dignity of affected people, and is provided equitably to men, women, boys and girls. In line with the guidance tools and priorities of the FSAC cluster and the findings from the assessment conducted by the FSAC cluster, the project aims to conduct a market assessment to decide whether to distribute unconditional food vouchers/food baskets with an amount of $80 to 1,000HHs (7000 individuals) in Qattabah district. The distribution will take place over a duration of six rounds in order to have a meaningful impact on improving household&#x2019;s food security situation. Implementation of this project will be in close coordination with all relevant stakeholders at national, governorate and district levels. MFD will also ensure full coordination with both clusters and with other humanitarian partners. MFD has put in place a strong monitoring and evaluation plan to ensure the effectiveness of the action and to ensure that all set targets are met. In addition, the needs of all the population will be taken into consideration, with a special focus on the needs of women and girls.
