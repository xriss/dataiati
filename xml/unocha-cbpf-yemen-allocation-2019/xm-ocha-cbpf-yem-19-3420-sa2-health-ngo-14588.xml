  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Under the first line of effort of this SA and over the project duration of twelve months, YFCA plans to provide Minimum Service Package (MSP) assistance to estimated 100,425 beneficiaries from the most vulnerable individuals of  23,175 IDPs and 77,250 host communities in responding to the humanitarian needs in Ataq, Jehaf and Al Qabbaytah districts of Shabwa, Aldhale&#x2019;a and Lahj Governorates respectively. 
The key objective of this project is to improve health conditions of targeted beneficiaries by preventing occurrence and minimizing morbidity and mortality rates occurred from communicable and non-communicable diseases at the targeted 3 districts through provision of good quality MSP services at public health facilities and community levels. MSP health services will include the activities under the first line response so the package of MSP will ensure the functionality of Eight health facilities at the targeted districts.Those HFs are ( Ataq hospital in Shabwa, Al Sarir HCs, Al Saleef HCs, and Al Ozlah HCs in Aldhale&#x2019;a , Al Dhahi HU, Al Rabo HU, Al Zaiq HU and Al saifi HU in Lahj). 
The estimated targeted beneficiaries to be assisted under this project is 100,425, IDPs will represent 23,175 which had been provided by cluster in the cluster guidance for this 2SA allocation for the targeted three districts, while Host communities will be 77,250 (Men 19,683 , Women 20,487, Boys 29,525, Girls 30,730), to whom some specific services will be addressing children such as IMCI services while RH services will be addressing women in reproductive ages and the rest elements of MSP services such as trauma care, CDs and NCDs cases management will be cross cutting covering the different age and gender groups.
Medical supply for this project will be mainly secured by the medical kits that will be provided by WHO for all targeted 8 health facilities over 12 months in quarterly bases. 
The designed approach in this project is guided by clear findings of RNA assessment that had been conducted at the targeted HFs, it revealed the gaps in Health services coverage from both qualitative and quantitative perspectives and thus drawn us to design the interventions package with close involvement of the beneficiaries&#x2019; representatives from the targeted communities. The RNA was coordinated with GHOs amp DHOs as well as with Health Cluster and sub-cluster in Aden Hub.
In Aden,YFCA has the second biggest office that will carry out the main implementation tasks with technical, financial and administrative backstopping support from the main office in Sana&#x2019;a.
YFCA will monitor the project activities using more focused modalities and tools at the central, governorate and field levels including the conduction of planned and spot MampE visits that will enable us to take the corrective actions if needed on time . Regular and spot reports will be submitted to HFU and health national and sub-national clusters supported with the needed documentations via GMS, mailings and official letters if needed.
YFCA ensured the mainstreaming of protection and gender concepts during the designing of this project through the active engagement of beneficiaries while conducting the RNA that had been reflected in clear specific project performance indicators, while at the implementation stage the beneficiaries will actively engaged in monitoring the activities and take part in corrective measures to be taken if needed through the two ways feedback mechanism YFCA will establish at the targeted locations. 
The possible main risks we might face could be: security deterioration, prices fluctuation, supplies shortage in the local market and outbreaks of endemic diseases. These risks can be mitigated through close coordination with all stakeholders in the field, contracting with suppliers and staff for the whole period of the project to ensure sustainability of supply and services and avoid any price fluctuation.</narrative>
