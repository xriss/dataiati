  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">MFD aims to respond to the basic WASH needs of the most vulnerable crisis affected population, so that men, women, boys and girls have access to safe and clean drinking water that will reduce excess morbidity and mortality related to water-borne diseases. The project will provide a six-month lifesaving intervention in the sector of WASH targeting 5000 individuals (700HHs) in Musaimeer district, (Lahj governorate) is  in need of standard integrated programming package for famine risk reduction (2018) ,MFD has chosen to focus on the district of Musaimeer as it is classified as IPC Phase 5 and a district with extremely high needs for men, women, boys and girls. Women and children are disproportionately affected by a lack of access to water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH), and shoulder the largest burden in water collection. MFD aims to address the WASH needs of the most vulnerable with a special focus on women and children which will provide direct and indirect benefits to the entire community, including health, education, and economic productivity. Women and girls spend much of their time collecting and transporting water for their families. For women, that time could be applied to income generating activities, housework, or childcare. For girls, that time could be spent in school. There are also numerous adverse health effects due to a lack of adequate sanitation and hygiene. MFD aims to place women and girls at the center of this project by implementing the following activities to address their needs and alleviate their suffering: provision of ceramic water filters, distribution of hygiene kits including the of consumable items and CHVs will conduct hygiene promotion campaigns to educate beneficiaries on hygienic practices . Implementation of this project will be in close coordination at national, governorate and district levels as well as in line with the cluster priorities. MFD will ensure coordination with humanitarian partners in Lahj and Musaimeer specifically to compliment their activities to ensure an integrated response, especially those providing food, nutrition and health interventions.
