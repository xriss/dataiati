   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Provision of Emergency Food Security and Livelihood assistance for acutely food insecure households in Najera district of Hajja governorate</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The proposed project is designed in response to FSAC first-line gaps and in-line with Cluster Objective 1) Increase access to food for highly vulnerable families across the country, Objective 2) Increase household incomes amp rehabilitate food security assets in areas with high levels of food insecurity and Strategic Response Plan (SRP) objective SO1: Help millions of destitute Yemenis overcome hunger. The project objective is to provide emergency food security amp livelihoods assistance to acutely food-insecure communities in Hajjah governorate through provision standardized approach that 2,000 vulnerable households in Najrah district have improved access to essential food. Proposed interventions will support vulnerable communities in meeting basic food needs, contribute in removing indulgence in negative coping strategies (i.e. child labor/criminal acts/ child marriage/forced marriage etc.) and provide temporary employment support by a rehabilitation of communal assets through cash for work activities. 

Key interventions include: 
- Supporting 1000 HHs (7000 individuals i.e. 1610 men, 1470 women, 2030 boys amp 1890 girls) with 1) Cash assistance ($50/month) for 2 months to meet their immediate food needs and 2) Provision of agricultural inputs to produce their own food within 3/4 months. These agricultural inputs include: 
o Sorghum, Tomato, pepper amp Land Preparation/tillage support (cost of the tractor for 1 hour)
o Vegetable Tool Kit including watering can, hoe/pick axe, rake, trowel, and plastic water tank (1,000 liters)
- Supporting 1000 HHs (7000 individuals i.e. 1610 men, 1470 women, 2030 boys amp 1890 girls) with temporary employment through conditional cash transfer for 3 months ($90/month) for the rehabilitation of 3 communal assets as a minimum i.e. water sources to land area, land rehabilitation

HA has a strong programmatic presence amp excellent track records in delivering similar activities. HA maintained a long-established institutional knowledge amp credibility within local communities amp local authorities including NAMCHA amp relevant agriculture offices in Hajja governorate. 

The project maintains a strong focus on gender with 48% beneficiaries being women (2940 women amp 3780 girls). The project also ensures inclusion of PWDs with 141 individuals (33 men, 41 women, 29 boys amp 38 girls) with special needs included as beneficiaries. 30% of total targeted HHs will be women headed with PWDs. 
Yemen is a patriarchal society and to mitigate the risk of ensuring effective engagement of women, all services will be delivered in a culturally sensitive and traditionally acceptable manner. The presence of female staff (35%) and female community volunteers/workers (35%) will ensure access amp privacy for women/girls. Effort will be made to ensure targeting male and female farmers and to ensure that both genders have access to input packages. For a selection of Sorghum seeds&#x2019; beneficiaries, the following beneficiary selection criteria will be taken into consideration: 
- Own lt 1.5 ha of agriculture land in coastal areas or lt 1.0 ha in highlands
- Female/ elderly headed households (high priority)
- Have a family member with a disability
- Host IDPs from other regions
- A household headed by chronically ill members/physically challenged heads.

To mitigate the risk of market players conspiring to deliberately increase food prices and market disturbance HA will regularly conduct market and feasibility assessments and make informed decisions accordingly. HA will mitigate the risks of cash-misuse by strengthening internal accountability mechanisms (including feedback/complaint systems). There is also a risk of lack of available qualified staff (especially females) in target locations. However, HA has an established office in Hajjah and the project will be managed through Hajjah office, by existing staff.</narrative>
