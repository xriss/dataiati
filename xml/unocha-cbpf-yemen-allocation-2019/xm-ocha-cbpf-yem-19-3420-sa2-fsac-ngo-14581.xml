   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Livelihood Support through Cash+ Agriculture Assistance Package in Radfan District in Lahj Governorate and Bayhan District in Shabwah Governorate</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">As recommended by the Advisory Board and FSAC, this project will focus on the first Line of Effort: Covering Priority Gaps in first and second Line responses and focusing on the subcomponent of Livelihoods in high priority IPC 4 agricultural communities. 
The overall objective is reducing famine risk levels by increasing HHs incomes and rehabilitating food security assets.
The target group is the highly vulnerable agricultural dependent families in high priority IPC phase 4 districts (of Radfan &quot;Lahj&quot; and Bayhan &quot;Shabwah&quot;) who are at high risk of becoming acutely food insecure, and whose conditions can improve quickly if their HHs income increases. 

The project will provide a Cash+ package, which includes three main components: unconditional cash transfers, agricultural inputs, and training for farmers. The cash transfers can help restore food security and alleviate poverty, supporting beneficiaries to address their basic needs while protecting their assets from being sold out of distress. The transfers can help farmers bridge the food gap often faced before a harvest. Cash+ programming ensures families not only have cash in their pockets but also the inputs, training, and support they need to farm and diversify their livelihoods, enhancing their food security, nutrition, and income generation potential. The productive inputs will be provided to enhance agricultural production and improve income generation potential. The training will enhance capacity related to the content of the productive assistance package, specifically a specialized technical training on crop production and sustainable agricultural practices.

According to FSAC, the cash will be provided to the same HHs receiving the inputs for 3 months.  Furthermore, the project will target vulnerable HHs with access to productive assets. The activities will only target returnee HHs, HHs hosting IDPs, and vulnerable host communities with able-bodied members, access to land, and access to productive assets. The distribution of kits will be in line with local area seasonality and after consultations with the local Ministry of Agriculture, and NMO will provide tillage support as needed in the form of cash to facilitate the preparation of land. 

The project duration will be 15m as per FSAC recommendation

The main risk is political instability as the situation remains fragile however, we assume that political instability will not significantly deteriorate, yet should any escalations arise, NMO will monitor the situation in the governorates daily, and adapt movement and implementation procedures accordingly to ensure the safety of its staff and beneficiaries. NMO will strengthen the rule of the community committees and will hire district coordinators from the targeted communities so that the implementation is not hindered.

We can implement the project as we have experience in FSL and have implemented a similar project with UNFAO targeting 10,950HHs in 5 hard to reach districts further, we have strong access to both districts and have good relations with authorities and community leaders there.

The different needs of of women,girls, men, boys and PwDs will be considered: NMO will promote equitable access to FSL opportunities and resources, ensure all employment practices are non&#x2010;discriminatory, prioritize safety and dignity in all activities and monitor the safety of project activities and locations on an on-going basis, prohibit and have no tolerance for SGBV, ensure that the unique needs of individuals and groups are considered in livelihood programs by, for example, identifying any individuals or groups affected by loss or theft of personal documentation preventing them from having access to services, monitor and address any exploitative child labor. Protection and SGBV will be mainstreamed in all activities and staff will be trained at the start-up phase. 

The project will impact the lives of 1600HHs (2984 Men, 2844 Women, 2809 Boys, 2563 Girls)</narrative>
