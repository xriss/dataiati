  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The food insecurity situation in Aslem and AL-Qaflah districts has been exacerbated by four years protracted conflict. Households in these in the districts have experienced extreme food gaps and are at risk of severe malnutrition. Yemen 2018 IPC analysis classified the districts in IPC phase 4 with 1500 households (10450 persons) in IPC 5. 87% of the population in these districts are in urgent need of food assistance. Loss of livelihoods, high food prices and displacements affect the food security, although local markets are functional, lack of money remains the constraint of many HHs to access food. 
The project will reach 2200 HHs (15411 individuals) through a conditional and unconditional cash transfers, to increase the purchasing power of the vulnerable HHs, enabling them to meet the minimum food needs. Cash based intervention are the preferred way of assistance. PDMs under previous projects and market monitoring carried out show that local markets are resilient and functional to provide basic food and nonfood commodities despite of the for years protracted crisis. The project fully aligned with the YHF 2nd standard allocation SA1: to help cover key gaps in the existing operation and support the immediate scale-up of activities in highly vulnerable communities. It targets Aslem (Hajja) and Al-Qaflah (Amran) which are among the 45 priority districts classified in IPC 4 with households in IPC 5 / catastrophic situation. The proposed action is also in line with FSAC&#x2019;s defined 1st line and 2nd line responses. To reduce sever hunger, 1500 households will receive six rounds of cash transfers as per FSAC. The amount of cash (YER 48,000/HH/round) is enough to cover the current cost of 80% monthly minimum food basket for a household with seven members. Under the second line response, Conditional/ Cash for work has been proposed for 700 vulnerable households with able-bodied persons to help them meet their basic needs to create temporary employment and help rehabilitating community infrastructure and assets. Each participant will work 15 days /m and get paid USD 6 /day 
The action proposed under this project will enable the targeted vulnerable households to meet their minimum food security needs and reduce negative coping strategies such as child labor, early marriage, reduction of meal portion as well as selling off properties and valuables to cope with the deteriorating financial and economic situation. Oxfam will use its experience and already established systems in cash transfers to timely deliver the assistance to the beneficiaries. Its established good working relations with local authorities and communities in the target districts would also help to implement the project more effectively and efficiently. To ensure integration and create synergy, Oxfam will coordinate its work with other agencies&#x2019; responses in targeted districts, particularly with those agencies implementing WASH, nutrition and health programs. Through FSAC, it will also coordinate the implementation the project with agencies engaged in food assistance particularly with WFP to avoid duplication. Oxfam will also ensure that gender and protection is mainstream throughout the project cycle. The Oxfam MEAL Team will adopt a tailor-made approach and will lead on baselines, developing monitoring and performance management plan, conduct post distribution monitoring, etc. to inform program delivery and measure the impacts of the project. Oxfam multi-channelled feed feedback and complaints mechanism will be rolled out to the project areas and all the stakeholders including the local communities and beneficiaries will be empowered to raise their concern on the project implementation.</narrative>
