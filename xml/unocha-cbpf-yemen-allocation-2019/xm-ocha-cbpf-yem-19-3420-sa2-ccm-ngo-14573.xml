   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In view of the YHF 2nd standard allocation priorities and in coordination with CCCM shelter cluster, YWU is intending to intervene in the management and coordination of humanitarian efforts serving 5 of the most populated and poorly managed 5 IDPs sites, 2 in Ibb and 3 in Taiz each main site consists of several scattered sites within the same area of 1.5 K.M. The total target BNFs are 454 HHs including 2516 individuals distributed as 37% in Akamat Al Safani, 24%Al Dhuhrah Al-Sufla in (Ibb) whereas 18% in Al-Mobadir,11% in Hafat Al-Souqa and 10% in Samae Stadium in Taiz governorate.. These selected sites include women, children, and elderly people. Additionally, and based on rapid field assessment for IDPs sites conducted by the YWU field teams in Ibb and Taiz, it was found that Mawiah and Al-Dhehar districts are of the most populated displacement sites which witnessed huge dislocation since 2015  from Hodeida, Dhalae and Taiz governorates as a result of the conflict. The target BNFs were found in miserable living conditions and their needs represented in the lack adequate shelter and essential protection services especially for women and girls who represent 31% of the female-headed HHs whose top priority is shelter, as dwelling conditions have led to life-threatening situations, lack of privacy, adequate latrines, hygienic items the exposure to the risk of serious diseases such as diarrhea, dengue malaria and cholera given the lack of access to health services. Moreover, the poor children&apos;s care/protection condition led to the spread of child labor, begging and deprivation of their rights of schooling due to the critical displacement conditions among the lack of sufficient, organized and coordinated humanitarian support by the humanitarian service providers in these areas.
The project aims at improving the living conditions of the target BNFs in the 5 sites through sound coordination with the relevant service-providers of development partners and humanitarian organizations in the two selected districts to ensure the effective delivery of multi-sectoral services. Moreover, it aims at involving the target BNfs in the decision-making process regarding their priorities, raising awareness and enhancing the referral as well as the feedback mechanisms and communication channels between service providers and BNFs. 
The project main activities will include the creation of the SMC team who will be in charge of site management, the development of a master list of all stakeholders working in the sites and conducting service mapping and assessment of the scale and impacts of services delivered per site. Moreover, the project will establish multi-sector referral mechanisms to ensure that relevant humanitarian responders are mobilized towards providing respective sectorial assistance, inter-cluster site-level data collection exercises, tracking of the IDPs population size, movements (new arrivals and departures. Furthermore, the project will create 5 Site Committees (SC) which will include community leaders, local authority and IDPs with emphasis on women&apos;s active participation in the committee. Moreover, the project will support community-based development activities to bridge the existing gaps and ensure the mobilization of efforts and social participation of the site inhabitants in the management and maintenance of the infrastructure of their sites to enhance accountability and ownership among them. Potential Risks: it is anticipated that the project will encounter some obstacles and difficulties in terms of interference of NAMCHA which may delay some of the planned activities which we would address by early and close coordination with them as well as involving some of NAMCHA members in the Site Committees. The YWU has valuable experience in implementing similar interventions with regard to IDPs site management and humanitarian response to address the needs of the most vulnerable gro</narrative>
