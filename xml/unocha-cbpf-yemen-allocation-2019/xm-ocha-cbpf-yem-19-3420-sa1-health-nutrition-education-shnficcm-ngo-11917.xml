Accessible HFs to IDPs settlements are to be Provided with primary health care including outpatient consultation, basic reproductive health, immunization through existing static health facilities within 5 km radius or through outreach (mobile medical teams) for 2nd and 3rd catchment areas. Cholera prevention and response will also be activated in the HFs while MTs will have a comprehensive knowledge on case management and referral of cases with complications. Referral system for critical cases from the IDP sites will be supported to ensure treatment for those unable to receive the medical care they need.
Nonetheless the project has a wider focus on vulnerable groups (women, children), as such every targeted HF and MT will be activated as OTPs providing lifesaving activities to PLWs, boys and girls facing acute malnutrition severe and moderate, which according to the need assessment is prevailing in the targeted communities.

Consequently, this project is a product of gained experience and is a joint effort of communities, local civil society, government health and education officials, and BFD to support and improve services essential to decrease the potential risks which will hinder the project&#x2019;s activities implementation.</narrative>
