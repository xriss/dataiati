  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Qatar Charity is proposing a 12 month, WASH proposal Targeting seven IDP sites with seven host communities around those sites, in Mustaba district - Hajjah governorate , under First Line of Effort of the 2019 SA2 . The program will address the critical WASH of the most vulnerable and conflict affected households , 
The proposed WASH intervention are intended to : covering priority needs of 7 IDPs sites with 7 host communities around it  These priorities were identified through an extensive assessment study carried out by Qatar Charity at 15 displacement sites in Mustaba , and The results of our assessment study were consistent with the WASH Cluster reports , The main results (enclosed with this proposal),
The Yemen WASH Cluster considers Mustaba district among the 45 districts at risk of famine and is classified as High. The district was selected in coordination with the local authorities and WASH cluster at the subnational level to ensure that newly displaced and host communities at high risk of in pre-famine areas have access to safe water and sanitation services. This intervention aims to reach 30,000 individuals with WASH services, including 13,302 IDPs (12,000 targeted by water trucking increasing to 21,000 after rehabilitation WSS). The proposed response will provide  displaced households and host communities with water trucking for safe drinking (chlorinated) water from water vendors. The intervention will incorporate a holistic approach by offering rehabilitation of the water supply (4 WSS) ,  as well as construction Emergency latrines and Solid waste campaigns. Water Management Committees (WMCs) will be created and provided with capacity building support and the tools required to ensure the continued operations and maintenance of newly rehabilitated water systems. Qatar Charity will conduct regular water quality monitoring focusing on the Free Residual Chlorine (FRC) and fecal coliform bacteria levels. Community mobilization on hygiene promotion and mass information sharing will be undertaken by locally recruited and trained community volunteers in the local language using pictorial messaging to promote positive behavioral changes. In addition, WASH NFIs will be provided with specific focus on hygiene kit materials. Qatar Charity will mainstream protection principles in the proposed activities through ensuring gender inclusive WASH committees with a ratio of 60:40 of men to women representation. and consedring Sphare standards while designing project components to protect all beneficiaries, especially women and children.  The committees will be trained on the operation and maintenance of WASH infrastructures to mitigate conflict around WASH facilities. Prior to the distribution of WASH NFIs kits, women and girls will be consulted with regards to kit contents in coordination with the WASH cluster. As part of the protection mainstreaming and building capacity of Qatar Charity staff on protection issues, WASH committees and Community Health Volunteers (CHVs) will be trained on Protection Principles. This will ensure that project activities to be implemented will promote meaningful access, safety and dignity to targeted beneficiaries. QC seeks to ensure the ongoing sustainability , where practicable, through behavioral change of beneficiaries, and provide support for sustainable water rehabilitation.</narrative>
