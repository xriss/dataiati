   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Emergency Response for Education Services in Al Garrahi district in Al Hudaydah Governorate</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project is designed with an aim to increase access to education and to improve the safety and quality of education for school-aged girls and boys in Al Garrahi district in Al Hudaydah governorate. The district has been classified as Level 4, priority geographical areas by OCHA for Education. Accordingly, to respond to the identified needs, this project will be implemented in close coordination with Education authorities to meet the following overall objective: Help maintain basic education services, particularly in areas where schools are damaged, closed or unable to fully operate because of budget, payroll, and other conflict-related constraints. NFDHR will do this  by targeting the 5 most overcrowded schools with the highest need in Ammar Bin Yasser, Fatima Al-Zahra, Al-Nahdah, Khawla Bint Al-Azwar, Al-Hussein Bin Salama for the following core activities: 
- Establish 10 semi-structured classrooms
. Procure and distribute 100 whiteboards, markers and erasers to the most in need schools.
- Construct and rehabilitate 18 latrines 
- Provide 1050 new desks according to the need per school among the 5 most crowded schools.

NFDHR will also procure and distribute 10,000 school bags with stationery to the 10,000 boys and girls IDPs and host community students in the targeted schools in Al Garrahi district. However, for this activity, NFDHR will target around 70% of the students in the targeted district, which will hopefully reach more than 12 schools. 


NFDHR will also conduct monitoring visits for follow-up and documentation of project activities, challenges, and successes. Monitoring and reporting will be gender dis-aggregated by age, sex, and diversity, and will seek to ensure beneficiaries receive the full package of interventions. Ultimately, it is anticipated that about 11850 students who are currently receiving very limited humanitarian support will benefit from and have improved access to education.

Expected major risks consist of: worsening security situation limited student accessibility in reaching planned services difficulties in convincing local authority/community of the project activities delays in approval of the project by the local authority and schools/learning spaces being targeted. However, NFDHR has planned for such risks by preparing the following mitigating interventions: We will: conduct regular security assessments establish frequent communication with all stakeholders keep teams informed about the updated situation.

NFDHR pays close attention to education and considers it as one of the most important programs, as it plays a vital role in accelerating economic growth and reducing poverty and unemployment rates. NFDHR builds people&apos;s capacities to improves their incomes, which subsequently leads to empowering and enabling them to participate more effectively in all domains of life. We also have a highly-qualified team experienced in implementing various education projects. In the last 7 years, NFDHR has been working with UNICEF, UNOCHA, Oxfam, and personal initiatives to implement a variety of projects including rehabilitation of 10 schools in Amran, conducting Back to School campaign amp &#x201C;I Miss my School&#x201D; campaign in Amran, Sana&#x2019;a governorate, Aljawf , Sada&apos;a, Al-dhale&#x2019;e, Taiz, Al Hudaydah. Furthermore, we have provided school desks, recreational kits, school bags with educational materials, established semi-structured classrooms and repaired old school desks in Sa&#x2019;ada and Al Jawf governorates. In addition, six WASH projects have been conducted in Amran, Al Baydha and Sada&#x2019;a Schools. Moreover, NFDHR has launched a unique technological system (phone application and platform) called Education Watch, used as a tool to serve the educational process in many ways all around Yemen. NFDHR ensures that both girls and boys get equal opportunities from all projects and activities that are always conducted by its</narrative>
