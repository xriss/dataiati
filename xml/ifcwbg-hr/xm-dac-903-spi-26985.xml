  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The proposed Euro160 million project consists of:   - financing the acquisition of the state owned steel mill,  - refinancing the debt assumed before privatization  - funding new investments necessary for CMC Sisak d.o.o (CMCS, the company, or the borrower) turnaround and  - funding the working capital requirement.  CMC plans to implement modernization and expansion investments to improve CMCS operational efficiency and competitiveness to bring the company in line with international standards.  The investment program aims to:   - reduce manufacturing costs,  - improve product mix and quality, and  - reduce emissions.    It involves:   - the construction of a new state-of-the art Electric Arc Furnace;  - the installation of a Ladle Furnace (LF);  - the modernization of the existing Continuous Billet Caster (CC), together with the installation of new Ladles and Tundishes; and  - the installation of a fabric filter Bag House and Melt Shop sheeting.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The proposed project is expected to have a positive development impact in several areas:  - Promoting the privatization of non-performing SOE:   The privatization of the previously state owned steel firm is expected to enhance its production efficiency and competitiveness and help regain its local industry leader status. The implementation of state-of-art technology will transform it into a competitive manufacturer; facilitate efficient use of energy and raw materials and help raise productivity levels in the country.   - Supporting the modernization of the sector:  CMC will transfer management expertise, technological know-how, advanced marketing methods, and a proven quality control system to Croatia and help support the modernization of the sector.    - Strengthen supply chains:    Increased purchases of domestic raw materials (scrap) will expand opportunities for upstream suppliers, while increased local production of high quality steel pipes will provide the necessary inputs for the infrastructure sectors.   - Improved environmental standards:   Replacement of the existing obsolete EAF with a state-of-the-art unit will substantially reduce primary and secondary particles and flu gas emissions during EAF charging, melting and tapping phases.  The use of waste energy for scrap preheating and other features of the new unit will allow a 20% reduction in energy consumption per tonne of liquid steel. The major environmentally-dedicated project is the construction of a new Bag House with sufficient capacity to meet the needs of the Electric Arc Furnace, the Ladle Furnace and the Continuous Caster.  Sheeting of the Steel Shop will ensure secondary emissions (from EAF and LF) and emissions (from CC) are kept within the Steel Shop building. CMCS are also considering further protection against EAF secondary off gases emissions by constructing a canopy hood. Investment in environment protection amounts to USD 15 million (25% of the CAPEX).</narrative>
