    <narrative xml:lang="EN">The main goal of U.S. assistance is to promote a more prosperous, democratic and stable Mozambique. U.S. assistance supports the country in leveraging emerging opportunities to achieve inclusive socio-economic development and improve the quality of life for all Mozambicans, particularly the poor, underserved, and marginalized. This assistance will continue to promote an integrated approach that addresses short and long-term social, economic, and health constraints to development. To achieve this goal, U.S. assistance combats serious health threats, increases the transparency and accountability of democratic institutions, and improves educational outcomes as fundamental pre-requisites for national development. U.S. assistance also promotes sustainable and inclusive economic development, sound agribusiness practices, the preservation of national biodiversity, and investments to adapt to climate change. The United States will continue to collaborate with the Government of the Republic of Mozambique (GRM) to combat trafficking in wildlife, and work across all programs to improve oversight, transparency, and civic involvement in governance.</narrative>
