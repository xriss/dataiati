  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Victims have a central role in pushing forward innovative transitional justice approaches, and they should be empowered to influence and participate in the design and implementation of justice measures and policies. Without meaningful and diverse victim participation, policies dealing with the past are more likely to be detached from affected communities; face difficulties in generating local ownership; and fail to adequately address the grievances of victims. As part of Impunity Watch plan to equip victim groups and their supportive civil society organisations with knowledge and skills that would allow them to organise, campaign, and fully engage in justice effort; we started to provide partner organisations with advice and resources. Our objective is to enable them to work closely with survivors to raise their awareness on victims&#x2019; rights and transitional justice and the design and implementation of guarantees of non-recurrence</narrative>

The final stages of this work incorporated reviewing the gathered material from SNGOs, holding 5 discussion meetings with women-led NGOs, and applying SLDP&apos;s learned lessons from its previous experience and engagement. SLDP has received a positive and welcoming feedback from the IIIM, and it further recommended contacts for Syrian lawyers specialized in the issue to be contacted by the IIIM. SLDP expects to develop this project with the IIIM into a more concrete steps in which SLDP seeks providing SNGOs with the needed and relevant support. Following the outbreak of the COVID pandemic, travel restrictions, lockdowns, and social distancing rules have prevented SLDP from being able to schedule and organize physical meetings in the timeframe 1st of April to 30th of June. SLDP used this time to advance its relationship with the targeted States in order to (1) increase their knowledge on Syria, (2) establish a more advanced level of understanding and interest in engaging in Syria (3) facilitate future engagement when physical meetings and travel related restrictions will be lifted. The Human Rights and Business Unit (HRBU) has provided international policymakers and stakeholders with various forms of advice regarding issues of business and human rights in Syria, particularly those relating to reconstruction and HLP rights issues. The HRBU participated in a meeting of a Syrian HLP legal experts network organized by GIZ to discuss HLP rights in Syria. During this meeting, SLDP briefed Syrian participants as well as GIZ on the role of businesses in violating HLP rights and identified methods through which such businesses could be held accountable."></actual>

     <narrative xml:lang="EN">SLDP organized a meeting between 3 victims&#x2019; groups and representatives of Peru and Uruguay in January 2020 in Geneva. The meeting was as a result of an initiative from SLDP to engage with non-engaged states. The meeting resulted in an appreciation by the states and openness to explore further means of engagement such as organizing a thematic side event in Geneva on enforced disappearance with the participation of these victims&#x2019; groups. SLDP is maintaining its relationship with these states and others such as Argentina and Chile and is providing them with regular updates on the SNGOs and victims groups activities and plans. However, due to the Covid19 outbreak, physical and other in person activities had to be postponed. In the context of this focus, SLDP is facilitating an exchange of experience between Argentina NGOs and Syrian victims&#x2019; groups. This resulted from SLDP&apos;s contact and engagement with these Argentine groups to explore potential collaboration in supporting the Syrian victims&#x2019; groups narratives, demands and advocacy approaches with the non-engaged states. SLDP has also met with a number of policymakers regarding the use of sanctions as an interim method of accountability, and an alternative form of accountability for those involved in business related human rights violations, including those tied to relief or reconstruction.</narrative>
