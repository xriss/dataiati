   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Church of Melanesia operates ten Rural Training Centers (RTC), three in Vanuatu and seven in the Solomon Islands. The RTCs were established against the backdrop of many school dropouts from the primary &amp;amp; secondary education systems in Solomon Islands and Vanuatu. These school dropouts do not have the necessary education or self-esteem to be functioning members in society. 

The RTCs provide an avenue for some of the school dropouts to be empowered with useful knowledge, values and skills. The RTCs receive some limited financial assistance from the Governments of Solomon Island and Vanuatu. 

Based on the results of a comprehensive review and study of the RTCs conducted in 2009 by Episcopal Relief &amp;amp; Development and ACOM, five policy goals have been identified: 

1) to increase the number of female students and lower the ratio differential between men and women in all 9 schools; 

2) to increase and/or improve the number of business and management courses; 

3) To initiate or expand short community courses as a means of increasing impact and non-formal education access to the wider community; 

4) to develop the local business and management plans for at least 4 RTCs (possibly all ten) which result in increasing the income and self sustainability of the individual RTCs; and 

5) introducing solar power as both a course and a source of revenue for the school. 

The program will be overseen by a Business Development Committee which will function for at least 2 years. A new business management curriculum, and solar short-courses will be offered in all RTCS in 2014. The program will measure impact of business development plans on the self sustainability of the RTCs.</narrative>
