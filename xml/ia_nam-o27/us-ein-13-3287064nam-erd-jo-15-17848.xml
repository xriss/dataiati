  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In 2015 both centers provided quality cross-disability services for over 300+ individuals with impairments, including those who are hearing impaired, visually impaired, physically impaired and/or intellectually challenged as well as their family members. These services included the lending and distribution of equipment and learning devices, physiotherapy, audiological testing, hearing aids, hearing aid repair/maintenance and ear molds, as well as eye tests and eye glasses. In 2016 both centers plan to provide these same sorts of cross-disability services to over 720 individuals. In addition, both centers will continue to offer vocational training and employment programs to provide professional skills training and job identification service for young men and women with disabilities. Besides the improvement of their professional and social status, training also enables these youth to play a role in policy development, decision-making and administration. In 2016, HLID and the centers will also continue their focus on educating communities on issues related to disabilities to encourage inclusion.</narrative>
