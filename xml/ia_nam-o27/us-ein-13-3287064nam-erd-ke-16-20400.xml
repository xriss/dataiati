   <narrative xml:lang="EN">CAPA is an instrument of the Anglican Communion in Africa that provides the space and opportunity for synergy within and through the Church in order to affirm and celebrate the witness of Christian life in the continent. Inspired by the values of common faith, CAPA proclaims and acts on the agenda of spiritual, social, political and economic transformation, hence harvesting all the initiatives of the Church to re-articulate her prophetic mandate in the midst of the contradictions facing Africa and the World. Over the years, CAPA has developed and successfully implemented various programs and plans in response to the needs of the Provinces and Dioceses. Through a consultative process CAPA has developed their current strategic plan (2011- 2015) that focuses on: 1- Formation of compassionate and Accountable leadership; 2- Healing forgiveness and renewal for just and peaceful society; 3- Stewardship of resources for socio-economic emancipation; 4- Advancement of critical theological reflection and action; 5- Community health and HIV and AIDS; and 6- New frontiers of advocacy and discernment. 2016 is CAPA&#x2019;s transitional year between their former and new strategic plan. As such, they are targeting the completion of two key activities: The training of new Bishops from areas including the Central, Southern and Eastern Africa provinces, and conducting CAPA&#x2019;s Standing Committee meeting (in August) to elect new office bearers.</narrative>
