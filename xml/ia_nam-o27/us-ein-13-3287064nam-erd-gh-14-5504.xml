   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In Northern Ghana, most of the population are small landowners relying on subsistence farming. While the country has made great progress over the last decade, in the north poverty, food insecurity and malnutrition rates remain high. 

ADDRO uses an integrated approach to tackle issues of poverty and hunger, improve health and combat gender and disability discrimination. ADDRO continues to build on its long experience working on food security in the region. 

This year they will implement the second year of a five-year comprehensive program aimed at increasing productivity, reducing postharvest losses, conserving natural resources, and improving incomes. Activities include improving agricultural input supply with the latest seed varieties and appropriate fertilizers, assisting farmers with new crop techniques through demonstration and training, training in vegetable and fruit-tree production, and small animal rearing, as well as food processing activities like peanut and shea butter production. 

ADDRO will also improve women&apos;s ability to till land and reduce their labor through the provision of an innovative technical and financial package for women to purchase a donkey, plough and cart. The program also includes a micro-credit facility, managed by ADDRO, which allows farmers and other entrepreneurs in the communities to access credit for their operations. They will also continue their long-standing work in disability rehabilitation, assisting the blind, mentally or physically handicapped through their integration in their broader program support.</narrative>
