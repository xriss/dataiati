   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Our partnership with the Sudanese Relief and Development Agency has three components.  The main component is the continued strengthening of the disaster risk reduction capacity at both the provincial and diocesan levels.  The other components include an impact evaluation of the provincial agricultural demonstration farms and support towards SUDRA&apos;s first strategic planning process.   

The disaster risk reduction program began in 2010 with comprehensive assessments of each of the 27 dioceses of South Sudan on their DRR experience, their diocesan administrative and programmatic capacity, and areas for additional strengthening to enhance DRR competencies.  In 2011, SUDRA staff designed a two-phase training course on both consistent approaches to disaster mitigation, preparedness and response, but also on standardizing programme and financial management.  The training was provided to the Development Officer, the Mothers Union Worker, and the Diocesan Secretary from each diocese. All dioceses would have completed both phases of training by the middle of 2012.  Following the training, SUDRA will prioritize 5 diocese to implement a small pilot project to apply the theory of their training, and also select a further 6 strategically placed dioceses to provided additional accompaniment as these diocese implement their follow-up plans, which includes developing diocesan disaster preparedness plan.  

With our support towards the operation of three agricultural farms since 2009, this year SUDRA will conduct a simple impact evaluation of the past trainees of these farms.  There have been 21 farmers who have been trained in improved farming methodologies and this evaluation will examine who these farmers (from across the country) have applied their newly learned knowledge and skills in their home diocese.   The evaluation will also seek input from these trainees on how best to restructure the farm so that it would serve as a valuable resource with engaging and relevant curricula for their home diocese.   

The final component of 2012 is the long-overdue facilitation of a strategic planning process for SUDRA.  With the independence of South Sudan and the various opportunities that come with it, SUDRA expects that that a new strategic plan is warranted to determine their new work plan and mandate based on their past strengths and successes.  A consultant will be engaged to consult with various stakeholders (church leadership, provincial departments, diocesan staff, international partners, local civil society, etc.) and present these findings to the SUDRA Board&apos;s strategic planning workshop (expected in mid-2012). Following the strategic plan, there will be follow-up information seminars throughout the province to educate SUDRA&apos;s constituency on their role and mandate.</narrative>
