   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Project Siloe is part of the Honduran Episcopal Church&apos;s Ministry in HIV/AIDS &quot;Siempre Unidos&quot; or &quot;Always United,&quot; whose purpose is to reduce HIV/AIDS among highly vulnerable populations such as male and female commercial sex workers, LGBT, military members and Garifuna communities. Garifuna are ethnic minorities that due to social isolation, lack of health services, traditional practices, etc. have a high HIV prevalence. In 2015, Siloe will also target male and female prisoners of San Pedro Sula penitentiary. Due to poor prison conditions, lack of rights and advocates, and existing behavior, health and psychological problems, prisoners are particularly at risk for STDs and violence. Key interventions for these vulnerable groups center around awareness, education and empowerment. Voluntary counseling and testing and informational workshops are important ways Project Siloe helps inform and empower vulnerable people. Siloe is the only project that works with the military (low and high ranks) on issues related to sexual health and SGBV. Advocating for gender equality, LGBT and human rights is also a fundamental part of Project Siloe&apos;s mission. Commercial sex workers and the LGBT people are frequently victimized by the general population as well as by law enforcement and military personnel. In 2015, Project Siloe will also focus on teaching girls aged 13 to 17 about sexual and reproductive health, as pregnancies among this age group is rising.</narrative>
