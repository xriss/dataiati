   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Since 2008, Episcopal Relief &amp;amp; Development and Nets for Life have been supporting the Anglican AIDS Programme (AAP) in a variety of initiatives to facilitate parishes and local groups to address the challenges and realities of their communities. The goal has been to train and facilitate communities of specified parishes and outstations in the Diocese of Namibia to be self-empowered in their own health and well being, particularly in relation to the prevention of and care for those living with HIV &amp;amp; AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. Over the years, AAP has worked with 10 parishes and 15 of their outstations reaching over 2,838 people in 32 communities in northern Namibia, many of which are located in remote areas beyond the reach of other social service programs. With these communities AAP facilitated the growth and educational outreach of Support Groups made up of individuals with HIV, volunteer Home-based Care Givers and general community members. In 2014, in an effort to combine sustainable economic supports with existing social supports, AAP integrated into their existing work Episcopal Relief &amp;amp; Development&#x2019;s Savings with Education methodology. Following a February 2014 peer learning exchange to the Savings with Education program of the Diocese of Angola, the Mothers&#x2019; Union program coordinator from Luanda joined Episcopal Relief &amp;amp; Development in the co-facilitation of a training for AAP&#x2019;s launch of savings work. Over the course of the year, AAP successfully launch 18 Savings with Education groups in 17 of their pre-existing communities. In total, these groups mobilized 294 members (including 21 men). In 2015, AAP grew the program to 37 SwE groups in 30 communities with a total of 595 members who saved + earned a total of $18,126; with 412 (69%) group members accessing loans from their joint savings, of which 100% were repaid. On average, in 2015 each member saved $27.55 and earned $3.87, and a total of 347 members (58%) reported expanding or starting a business in 2015 with their savings and/or loan. In 2016 the SwE Team and their 21 trained SwE Facilitators will continue to strengthen the savings and loan management activities of their existing 37 SwE groups (and 595 members) in 30 communities, while also forming 28 new groups (with an anticipated 504 new members) in 21 new communities.</narrative>
