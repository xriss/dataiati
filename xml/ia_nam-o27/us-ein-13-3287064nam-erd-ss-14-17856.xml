   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Project Description The Province of the Episcopal Church of South Sudan and the Sudan Health Commission (ECSSS HC) has been focusing in Maternal Child Health program in hard to reach locations with integrated primary health care and emergency responses. In ECSSS there are a total of 32 dioceses out of which 15 of them are getting support from the health commission. The major support delivered includes: training of diocesan health coordinators and program managers, training of technical staffs, supplying essential commodities &amp;amp; medical equipment, supplying motor bikes &amp;amp; bicycles for field activities and incentivizing staffs. Health education programs are also undergoing in the three dioceses of Rajaf, Aweil and Mundri addressing disease prevention, health promotion and early health seeking for children and pregnant mothers. There is a great need to scale up the Health Education program in other parts of dioceses. In addition to the health education various trainings were conducted to mothers union, diocesan coordinators and community volunteers. In the ongoing unrest the health commission responded to the huge number of IDPs and returnees in Nuba mountains and aweirial by supplying live saving essential drugs. This contributed saving of thousands of the life of vulnerable mothers and children in the community. After November 2013 mid term review meeting the priority was given in operationalizing the health programs in Nyet (Maker) - Wau and Ofirika &#x2013;Torit. Based on the decision the Commission has been able to equip the provincial office and started the primary health programs in Torit and Wau dioceses. The HC also established two Income Generating Activities (IGA). The IGAs has been designed to help to overcome economic factors as funding from the international donors expected to scale down in the coming years. All these supports have been coming from Episcopal Relief &amp;amp; Development, ABM and many others. In 2015 the HC planned working in the legal and administrative procedures in registering Torit and Wau PHCUs under ministry of health (MoH). MoH already deployed some key staffs to Torit and Wau covering part of their salary. Dioceses Health programmes: Out of the 32 ECS dioceses, only 15 dioceses have currently active health programmes. There are currently 7 Primary Health Care Centers (PHCCs), as well as numerous dispensaries in various dioceses. Many dioceses have the vision and compassion to reach out to the sick and vulnerable individuals through health and healing ministries. The health commission has been facilitating and supporting directly 2 PHCUs in Wau and Torit and more than 13 health programs indirectly. The current proposal is planning to finalize the infrastructure building of Torit and Wau and provide supportive supervisory visit for the rest of 13 PHCUs. Although few dioceses have health programs that are functional, there are still greater needs to scale up primary health services especially in Wau and Torit based on the Board and Donor recommendation. We are also looking the use of IGA as community income supporting tool and pushing the government in providing us essential drugs, human resource and capacity building.</narrative>
