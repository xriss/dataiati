   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Partnering with the respected Nicaraguan organization, the Council of Protestant Churches of Nicaragua (CEPAD), in two regions of Nicaragua, San Francisco Libre and Nueva Guinea, this program is focused on community participation and education in agriculture, environmental conservation, and nutrition. Using its expertise in innovative and sustainable agricultural techniques, CEPAD staff is training small farmers in rural communities to make the best use of their land. Practices include planting of fruit trees such as plantain, banana, citrus, guava and passion fruit which can decrease erosion and provide a long-term source of food and income for the family. Farmers also receive inputs and training in planting maize, beans and cassava amongst the trees, in order to maximize the use of land and provide reliable annual staples for the household. Overarching this is the use of locally trialed soil improvement and conservation techniques, including household production of organic fertilizers and pesticides and construction of ridges and ditches to trap runoff and needed topsoil. 

The program trains volunteer agriculture &apos;promoters&apos; in the communities, who in turn each train five &apos;disciples&apos; for a total of 168 trained individuals. At least 1/3 of trainees are women. CEPAD undergoes a three year cycle with each group, and is currently working with farmers in their second year. 

Starting in 2012, they began working with a select group of farmers to improve their business and marketing practices to increase the income they receive from plantain production. Finally, in 2013, they started piloting a small rainwater harvesting initiative to increase families&#x2019; access to water during the dry season.</narrative>
