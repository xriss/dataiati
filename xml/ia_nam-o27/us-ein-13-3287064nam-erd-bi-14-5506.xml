   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Anglican Church of Burundi&#x2019;s Transformative Sustainable Livelihoods Program seeks to assist poor and vulnerable people in all seven dioceses in their efforts to recover from the depletion of livelihoods and health that affected the country for over twenty years, resulting in severe and widespread hunger and malnutrition. 

The Province is working to strengthen the capacity of the poorest in targeted communities in order to provide them with sustainable solutions to food insecurity. This includes increasing access to improved seeds (grain seeds, cassava cuttings, banana tubers, vegetable seeds, fruit tree seedlings) and training on agricultural skills and crop disease control with over 30,000 farmers. 

They are also working with farmers to adapt to the changing climate which is bringing more erratic rains and droughts in some areas. The program is engaging communities in large-scale efforts to decrease soil erosion on Burundi&apos;s steep hills, through the digging of trenches, and planting of trees and grasses. This year they are in addition beginning work on the creation of home vegetable gardens with women in order to improve and diversify family nutrition. 

The Program also includes the rehabilitation and installation of clean water sources by protecting natural water sources and channeling water to community water points, as well as installing rainwater harvesting tanks.</narrative>
