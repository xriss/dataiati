   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Despite being one of the largest countries in South-East Asia, Myanmar is one of the poorest. Both extensive government regulations and high inflation rates have created economic stagnation, keeping the vast majority of the population at the poverty level. The Mother&apos;s Union works within the church structure to assist families of ethnic minorities, who are further disadvantaged by government majoritarian policies. As women play a crucial role in both the economic and social structures of a family, the Mother&apos;s Union programs have focused on enhancing the resources available to women to pursue greater economic stability in their families. The Mothers Union initiated a micro-credit programme to assist women to support their family income through various entrepreneurial ventures, including mini shops, agriculture, animal husbandry and other cottage industries. The Mother&apos;s Union began its pilot micro-credit programme in Yangon Diocese in 2001. With learnings from this pilot project, the micro-credit operations expanded and there are currently 30 self-help groups with 504 members in the Diocese of Yangon and Toungoo. In 2015, the Mother&apos;s Unions union plans to monitor and train 21 self-help groups in Yangon Diocese and 9 self- help group in Sittwe Diocese to administer loans to 504 women. The loans will be administered through the groups, following a 6-month period of savings and multiple business development training sessions. The Mother&apos;s Union will also provide cottage industry vocational training in animal husbandry and food production. As part of ongoing efforts to maximize impact on communities, the Mothers Union will also seek to develop a master strategy with their two main partners - Five Talents and Episcopal Relief &amp;amp; Development. This strategy will be jointly funded by both partners to increase the capacity of Mothers Union to enhance technical expertise</narrative>
