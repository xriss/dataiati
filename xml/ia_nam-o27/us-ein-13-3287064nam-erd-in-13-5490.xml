   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Community Development Program continues to provide communities with resources to address a wide range of community development needs. The CDP program works with 13 villages in Barikul,13 in Samadi and 12 in Balughart. Each program initiative promotes self-sustaining, long-term economic development and improved community health. 

The program works with small, marginalized farmers to improve their knowledge of water harvesting techniques to improve crop yield. Artificial insemination improves the quality of livestock available to the farming communities. Coaching centers, run by the villagers, promote preservation of the local tribal language, Alchiki, and the importance of primary education for girls and boys. Youth is supported with technical education to promote small micro-businesses, further diversifying the income sources in the community. Ongoing women&apos;s cooperatives are strengthened by providing needed equipment, additional micro-loan capital, and skills training. Women&apos;s empowerment lies at the heart of many program activities, including support for an all-female team of community health volunteers who work with women and children in the villages to ensure safe deliveries, monitor child health and nutrition, and spread positive messages about disease prevention including HIV/AIDS. The health volunteers are backed up by the services of the clinic, which will continue to provide needed services in an area with limited access to medical facilities. The program also addresses the lack of proper sanitation in the villages through latrine construction, to reduce water borne diseases, reduce the use of open fields, and improve the village environment. In addressing the many causes of poverty, the Diocese hopes to inspire community members to become active in changing their own lives and in securing their rights. 

By June 2014, a programmatic outcome evaluation will be completed to define the future strategy of the project.</narrative>
