   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Church in Community Mobilization Process (CCMP/Umoja) is an open ended and a participatory process that is conducted within a church setting with an aim of stirring up the church towards self-discovery, an appreciation of their context and their God given potential. The program seeks to unlock the potential within communities so that these potentials can be harnessed to confront the existing social and economic challenges. This self&#x2013;discovery process is preceded by visioning sessions which set the stage for the process to start and grow. CAPA&#x2019;s approach to all community interventions is premised on the belief that God has surrounded his people with resources, which once harnessed faithfully and responsibly can enable them secure their desired future. Africa is a continent with great potential however, due to poor governance and global unjust structure; it continues to struggle to translate her potential in ways that will lead to improved quality of life for her citizens. This is compounded by the fact that the enormous resources endowed to Africa have made it a beehive of diverse interests. Consequently, the community and especially the vulnerable groups (children, Youth, Woman and those with disabilities) end up being bruised by the self-interest of the different economic and political players. There is, therefore, an urgent need to develop mechanisms that can draw on people&#x2019;s resilience to confront these obstacles and get them on the road towards self-actualization. Fortunately, there is significant awakening with communities in Africa towards recognizing that they have the resources to determine their destiny. CAPA has developed the capacity to implement programs of this nature, through experiences of mobilizing communities to respond to social and economic challenges such as HIV/AIDS and in sustaining communities in times of conflict and political unrest. The specific objectives are: 1. To enable religious leaders in Africa to have the opportunity to bring their experiences and aspiration to bear on global issues and establish growing confidence in communities to take charge of their development agenda. 2. To share enabling mechanisms that will strengthen communities to harness their resources for sustainable development. 3. To draw experiences and aspiration to contribute to the global discussions on issues pertaining to improving human dignity and peaceful co-existence. The Umoja model was adopted at the All Africa Bishops Conference which aimed at having Bishops participate in its adoption and the Provincial staff gaining exposure to the program through orientation sessions conducted by CAPA. The activities for 2015 are therefore intended to actualize the desires expressed by the leaders and have trained facilitators assist in rolling out the strategy in the selected provinces-West Africa, Indian Ocean, Sudan and Southern Africa.</narrative>
