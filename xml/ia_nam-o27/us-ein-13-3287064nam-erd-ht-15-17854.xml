   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Leogane&#x2019;s plain was the epicenter of the January 12, 2010&#x2019;s earthquake. Ninety (90) % of the city was destroyed, and the most vulnerable groups of the population particularly the farmers were among the most affected. Following the earthquake, NGOs such the World Food Program donated food to appease hunger. Unfortunately, the government of Haiti did not put in place proper agricultural policy to increase local production. Furthermore, due to the reduction of the food aid, farmers and their families have become more food insecure. The farmers who want to invest in production have little or no access to land and agricultural inputs; that keep them below the poverty line. Despite efforts made in recent years by the Haitian government and some Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) working in the agricultural sector to increase local production; Haiti is among the countries in the world facing a problem of chronic food insecurity. Several Agricultural programs have been launched to give a new contribution to the agricultural sector, which contributes 30% of national GDP. These include the &#x2018;Technology Transfer to Small Farmers Initiative (TTSF), run through the Ministry of Agriculture and funded by the Inter-American Development Bank for $90M, from 2011-2016, and USAID&#x2019;S Feed the Future initiative in Haiti, with a budget of $4.6M, started in 2011. Nonetheless, Haitian agriculture cannot produce the amount of food sufficient to meet the needs of the population. Nearly 47% of the food consumed in Haiti is imported especially in the Dominican Republic, and 7% are received as donation from largely the USA. In 2010, domestic production covered only 46% of food needs estimated at 2,269,171 tons grain equivalent (CNSA, 2011). To help address this issue, the Episcopal University of Haiti is carrying out a baseline study in order to inform a strategy which will contribute at transforming lives of farmers in the L&#xE9;ogane region by allowing them to benefit from the technical support from UNEPH in the production, post-harvest management, processing and commercialization of their agricultural products.</narrative>
