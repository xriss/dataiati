   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Episcopal Relief &amp;amp; Development is supporting various projects in Haiti. amongst them are: 1)PROCREEH-PROCREEH stands for Programme de Cr&#xE9;dit et d&apos;Epargne de l&apos;Eglise Episcopal d&apos;Haiti (Program of Credit and Savings of the Episcopal Church of Haiti). PROCREEH is a new initiative that has grown out of the traditional microcredit activities of the Diocese of Haiti&apos;s former development arm CEDDISEC. In 2013, in response to recommendations coming from a professional review and audit of former microcredit activities, Episcopal Relief &amp;amp; Development and the Diocese of Haiti joined together t support a new Manual of System Control and Administrative Procedures (MSCPA)- manuel de Systeme de Controle et de Procedures Administratives) and the opening of a designated Microcredit revolving Loan Account (at SOGEBANK). PROCREEH&apos;s goal is to reinforce the autonomy of Haitian communities as leaders of their own socio-economic development. 2) Support to repair of Episcopal schools According to the last education census (2010-2011) available, of the thirteen thousand five hundred and ninety nine (13,599) &#xE9;coles fondamentales (1st to 6th grade levels) identified, the non public sector schools represent 88% while the public sector has only 12% of total schools. Two hundred and forty-four (244) of these schools are owned and operated by the Episcopal Church in Haiti. Schooling at this age range (6-12 years old) is not something that happens systematically in Haiti. The Episcopal Church in Haiti has therefore a very important role to play in guaranteeing access to education to Haitian children. The population of children ages six (6) to twelve (12) years old who are in schools totals about. Only 60.93% of the school-age (6-12 years old) population is able to attend schools in Haiti. The access to education for this age group in Haiti is very problematic, either because of long walking distance required to get to school or inability of families to pay for the cost of education since most schools are not public. Nonetheless, Haitians parents are very committed to the education of their children. The World Bank estimates that Haitian parents spend on average $130 USD to send their children to school . Still, it is estimated that half a million children do not attend school. Haitian parents are willing to make extraordinary sacrifices to educate their children. Though many of the schools do not offer the children the tools necessary to compete in the 21st century. It can be argued that the learning environment is partly to be blamed in the deterioration of the school system in Haiti, as it does not allow the students to fully concentrate on learning. Some schools do not even have enough seats for the students that are enrolled. Although precise data is not available, it is generally known and accepted that many Haitian school infrastructures, including Episcopal schools are in very poor conditions. Taking into account the strong relation between an enabling learning environment and student achievement in disadvantage settings, investments in rehabilitation of Episcopal schools is essential in Haiti. Provision of quality facilities is a factor determinant of education outcomes. Therefore investment in improving quality of schools can contribute to positive education outcomes. In its quest to help tackle this issue, Episcopal Relief &amp;amp; Development puts in place a project aiming at improving education supply by improving the infrastructure, furniture for 11 existing Episcopal schools that were selected by the Diocese of Haiti. Through this project, Episcopal Relief &amp;amp; Development will not only enhance significantly the quality of school buildings; it will also provide new student places, therefore increase access. Increase in supply of education will be possible since these facilities will be able to offer basic education while providing required space per student. Increasing the supply of education in the communities will lessen the burden for families who will not have to turn to more expensive private schools to educate their children.</narrative>
