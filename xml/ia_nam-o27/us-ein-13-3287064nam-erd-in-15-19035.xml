   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In the fourth year of this program we will continue to address the challenges faced by farmers, and particularly women, the landless, sharecroppers and other vulnerable people in the Yavatmal area of Maraharastra, in India. In 2016, we will work with the original 500 farmers, the approximately 3,000 farmers added in 2015, and also expand the approach to add an additional approximately 750 new farmers in surrounding communities. CASA will continue to work with this full group through at least 2017 in order to achieve sustainable change at a significant scale. Many of these farmers are faced with debt burdens, due to the high rates charged by local lenders, and the need to use sufficient amounts of fertilizers and pesticides on the hybrid cotton seeds they buy. The farmers are also primarily engaged in cash-crop farming, and are therefore susceptible to local and international market price swings. Many do not have diversified sources of income, or food grown for household consumption that they can fall back on. In addition, some of the practices promoted by the government in past years, such as the promotion of cash crops for export and subsidy support for industries other than agriculture are harming the environment through excessive use of irrigation and fertilizers, and efforts need to be taken to reverse this trend. The program will work to improve land management over the regional watershed, introduce low-cost sustainable agricultural practices, build capacity of households in financing and marketing of agricultural and non-agricultural products, and to increase financial literacy and savings. In addition, they will assist farmers in advocating the government for the services that they are entitled to, such as support for families who have experienced a death, or services for those living below the national poverty line. CASA has a strong history of working on similar programming and hopes to bring their skills and experience to this region of India.</narrative>
