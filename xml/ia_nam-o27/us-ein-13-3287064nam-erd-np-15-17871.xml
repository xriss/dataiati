   <narrative xml:lang="EN">While DCA continues to participate in the global ACT appeal, their portion is not yet fully funded. Episcopal Relief &amp;amp; Development support would fill that gap in the ACT appeal but also go beyond the ACT appeal so that DCA can expand their work in livelihood recovery and disaster resilience. Activities though this programme include: repairs to 3,000 households toilets and 5 community water schemes, distribution of shelter grants to 2,000 households, support for a livelihood recovery programme, including skills training for 45 masons and carpenters to build back better, psyshosocial assistance to 4,000 to recover from the impacts of the disaster, mentally, physically and economically. A key emphasis of all activities is to incorporate disaster resilience through better building techniques, better hygiene preparation during disasters, reinforcing water and sanitation infrastructure, and disaster (flood) resilient rice and seed varieties. All activities will target the districts of Gorkha and Dhading, as two of most affected but least accessible districts. The target communities are located in the isolated high hills, and inhabited by ethnic minority groups.</narrative>
