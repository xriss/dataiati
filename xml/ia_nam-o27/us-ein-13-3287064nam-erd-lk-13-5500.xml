   <narrative xml:lang="EN">During the past two or three decades Sri Lanka has faced a number of natural and human made disasters in addition to the annual cycle of floods and droughts that the country witnesses. These range from the devastating flood of 2003, the catastrophic tsunami of December 2004, the major cyclones of 2000 and 2008, destructive annual earth slips, and several major terrorist attacks in Colombo such as the Central Bank bomb attack and the bombing of the commuter train at Dehiwela. 

While in most cases, churches in the affected areas have responded spontaneously, quickly and instinctively to these tragedies, there has been little or no attempt to analyze, codify, and share the good practices, the lessons learned, the experiences gained, how the church has collaborated with other organizations, the mistakes and pitfalls to be avoided. 

More recently, the church&apos;s experience with the IDP relief work has highlighted some of these issues. The particular circumstances surrounding this emergency such as the lack of free and direct access, the lack of clear direction from the government, the paucity of and inaccurate information available and the suspicions of the motives of the Church and NGOs have also added to the difficulties of the relief effort. 

Lessons can perhaps be also learned about how best to work in similar situations, which are expected in the Sri Lankan context. The Diocese of Colombo had designed and is implementing a disaster preparedness and management training program for church staff and parish leaders. The program would result in a toolkit, which is customized to address the local realities of the Sri Lankan context. The toolkit would include basic methodology, minimum standards, procurement procedures, monitoring and evaluation and resource management.</narrative>
