   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Our partnership with the Sudanese Relief and Development Agency (SUDRA) has two components. One component includes the emergency response following the outbreak of violence in December 2013, and the second component relates to the operational management and restructuring of the SUDRA organization. With the outbreak of violence on December 15, 2013, the young nation of South Sudan has been engaged in a defacto civil war between forces loyal to the current President, Salva Kir and the former Vice President Riek Machar. Although attempts at cessation of hostilities have been partly successful, various new militant groups have emerged and the security situation continues to be very fluid. Within this context, The Episcopal Church of South Sudan and Sudan, commissioned an Emergency Crisis Committee under SUDRA. SUDRA/ECC serves to oversee and provide technical assistance to the relief activities facilitated by SUDRA. As SUDRA is designed as a coordinating body and an implementing agency, the emergency response has relied heavily on the diocesan DRR teams, which Episcopal Relief &amp;amp; Development had trained several years ago. This is a positive development and demonstrates the practical application of the training. SUDRA&apos;s Emergency Response is supported by various funding agencies, coordinated by the Anglican Alliance. Episcopal Relief &amp;amp; Development is playing a critical role as the lead agency in this collaborative effort. 2015 will see the end of the Emergency Response with the completion of the ipact and process evaluation. The second component of our partnership is the continued support of the SUDRA organization. In 2015, Episcopal Relief &amp;amp; Development is funding about 40% of the administrative budget of the SUDRA office. Episcopal Relief &amp;amp; Development supported a strategic planning process in 2013, and out of that process the SUDRA Board has adopted several new policies and procedures that served to restructure SUDRA operations. New leadership was also recruited. With a new strategic plan and new leadership, a key objective of 2015 is the build ownership of SUDRA at the diocesan level. Therefore several regional consultative workshops are expected to solicit perspectives and recommendations from the dioceses on how best SUDRA can support local initiatives and vice versa.</narrative>
