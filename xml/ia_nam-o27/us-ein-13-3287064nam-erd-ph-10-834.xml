   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This is a climate change adaptation and livelihood project.  More specifically, it seeks to construct a 1 square meter x 300 meters box reinforced concrete covered canal on one side of the street leading to a creek and thus complete a drainage system that will address the problem of perennial flooding in the community. It shall also establish a Livelihood Fund of P200,000, which the beneficiaries can access to enhance their various livelihood ventures. San Vicente is a barangay of Cabiao municipality in the province of Nueva Ecija, one of the provinces is what is referred to as the Central Plains. Cabiao is about 100 kms. northeast of Manila. San Vicente is its last barangay adjacent to the province of Pampanga. Hence, it is near to the Pampanga River Basin. During rainy seasons, the barangays of Cabiao nearest to Pampanga, including San Vicente, is always flooded with overflow water from the Pampanga River. The flooding has become worse in recent years when the level of precipitation has greatly increased. With no drainage system that can divert flood waters to an exit point, the flooded communities can remain submerged in water for several weeks. This has adversely affected ricefields, houses and household belongings as well as brought about diseases. The barangay is home to small-scale farmers, with average monthly household income of only P3,650. Because of the destructive flooding problem, San Vicente&apos;s inhabitants have long been clamoring for a drainage system. The barangay has started this project but after several years of lobbying with the municipal and provincial governments, it has accessed funds sufficient to construct only 100 meters of the drainage system. While this has benefitted a portion of the community, the bigger portions continue to suffer the problem. Hence, they have approached several funding partners for possible assistance. This proposed project will complete the drainage system by constructing a 300-meter extension. The project will then set up a credit facility to assist the beneficiaries in commencing or enhancing livelihood activities. The beneficiaries are presently organized under the San Vicente Farmers Association, which shall manage the proposed credit facility.</narrative>
