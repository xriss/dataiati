   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The majority of the people in Central Tanganyika are engaged in smallholder, subsistence agriculture. Many households also have some degree of livestock production. The transition from subsistence to market economy is very slow due to various factors, such as: natural and man-made disasters (i.e. drought); inadequate social and economic infrastructures; poor access to agricultural technology, inputs and equipment; and very low education base. The rapid degradation of the environment is due to poor soil management, uncontrolled livestock grazing, deforestation, overpopulation and water shortages. By promoting Conservation Agriculture and the formation of Village Savings &amp;amp; Loans Associations (VSLAs), the long term goal of DCT-DSC is to help the people living within the Diocese to achieve food security in an economically and environmentally sustainable manner. Objectives are generally related to achieving self sufficiency in food grain production through use of minimum tillage, improved seeds, retention of crop residue, crop rotation and proper storage techniques. Both men and women will directly or indirectly benefit from the project in 6-8 villages within 4 parishes. Indirect beneficiaries are expected to be more numerous as most of the technologies are transferable by just copying or purchasing the inputs required. Government agricultural extension agents play a key role in reinforcing CA skills and knowledge relayed through program supported field trainings. DCT-DSC has recently initiated VSLA interventions in several of the Diocese project sites. Discussions and initial results from the pilot VSLA&apos;s show that members, mostly women, desire funds for small business activities. Small commerce allows women to set aside much-needed money for children&apos;s school supplies and food.</narrative>
