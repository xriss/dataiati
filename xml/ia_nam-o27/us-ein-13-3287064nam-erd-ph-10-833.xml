   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This is an integrated project intended to enhance food security as well as environmental advocacy. The components of the project are: a]  provision of farm machineries to increase income of beneficiaries by lessening rental costs; b]  establishment of nursery and reforestation of about 30 hectares of land; c]  construction of spring water system; d]  goat and pig dispersal for women&apos;s group; and, d] micro-finance to support livelihood opportunities. While sitio San Miguel is part of Digos City, it is actually a rural community of mostly hired farm workers who do not own any farm lands. There are however about 25 households who are small land-owners and who shall constitute the initial direct beneficiaries of this project.  Many of these households own  less than a hectare of land with a few having over one hectare. With these landholdings, they  can barely support themselves economically due to high cost of farm inputs and rental of farm machineries. By making available farm machineries: mud turtle, rice thresher, a hand tractor and trailer,  at lower rental costs, and by establishing a small credit facility which they can use for the purchase of inputs, the income of these farmers will substantially increase and will enable them to have a more substantial control over the agricultural production and marketing processes. The nursery is intended to propagate coffee and other agro-forest tree seedlings for reforestation of a public land, measuring about 30 hectares, much of which is presently bare, with gmelina trees scatted in some parts. By reforesting this area, the community enhances biological diversity while at the same time providing future source of additional income from coffee, rubber and other agro-forest trees. The community is presently negotiating with the Department of Agriculture for stewardship rights over this public land. [Propagation of rubber tree seedlings shall be done at the existing rubber tree plantation of St. Francis High School in North Upi, Maguindanao, which is a previous Diocesan Project.]While women are envisioned to actively participate in all the components of the project, a specific activity, which is the goat and pig dispersal, shall be managed by them in order to enhance their collective capacity to promote their sectoral interests and to empower them by making them directly responsible for raising additional household income. Finally, a potable water system shall be established to augment the present limited supply of water to the community. This water system shall also serve the nursery.</narrative>
