   <narrative xml:lang="EN">WOZO Haiti is a leadership network that promotes the vision of a healed and peaceful society, engaging people of diverse backgrounds. It nurtures respect and dignity for human life that transforms social relations and systems. Created in 2010 after a crippling earthquake in the Port-au-Prince area, WOZO has expanded its services throughout the country. WOZO found that the earthquake provided a shared experience across Haiti that enabled all peoples to talk about traumas and problem-solving in new ways. From its beginning, WOZO has aimed to address the earthquake&#x2019;s devastation as well as the traumas and related social challenges that have historically afflicted Haiti. Therefore, WOZO continues to address the violence that deeply affects urban and non-urban areas by teaching leaders nonviolent ways to resolve everyday problems and conflicts. WOZO now aims to serve its vision by expanding the availability of these resources for social change to partner institutions and organizations.</narrative>
