   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Violence against women and girls, in all of its forms (i.e. sexual, physical, emotional and economic abuse), is a global epidemic that destroys not only individual lives, but impedes the well being and growth of communities. As part of its integrated approach to fighting poverty and disease through empowerment, Episcopal Relief &amp;amp; Development prioritizes supporting grassroots efforts to prevent and respond to sexual and gender based violence (SGBV). By using its social, spiritual, human and physical capital, the Church has the power and obligation to act as agents of change and champions of peace and equality. As such, Episcopal Relief &amp;amp; Development is supporting an SGBV prevention &amp;amp; response project of the Diocese of Aru in the Democratic Republic of Congo. In its second year, this project increases church and community participation in SGBV prevention and response in 5 health zones. It focuses on equipping faith leaders, health center staff, youth and other community leaders with knowledge and tools they need to educate others about SGBV and gender inequality and to support survivors of violence with psychological and medical care. as well as social and economic empowerment opportunities. This project is being closely monitored and evaluated as the goal is to have this model of community mobilization and comprehensive survivor support be replicated in other dioceses in the coming years.</narrative>
