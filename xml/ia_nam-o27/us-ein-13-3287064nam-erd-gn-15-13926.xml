   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The partnership between Anglican diocese of Guinea and Episcopal Relief and development, dating back to 2009, aimed at reducing new malaria infections and by that reducing the high morbidity and mortality associated with malaria. In 2014, Guinea and neighboring countries experienced the ebola infection. As at March 2015, the country of Guinea had recorded 3,011 confirmed cases of Ebola virus infection. Out of this number 2,263 died. The consequence of this is that life in the country was virtually brought to a standstill. To begin with, many families are devastated with deaths of family members, breadwinners and care givers. This has weakened the already fragile economic situation in many families, worsening the situation of poverty in communities, the church and the country. At the peak of the Ebola infections, many companies either closed down or scaled down activities drastically and sending employees home destroying the source of livelihood for even the survivors of ebola. The emotional trauma caused by the deaths have left the church with a huge task of restoring hope in life for the survivors. Also children are who have lost parents are now left as orphans, some needing daily provision to survive, shelter and clothing. Ebola has interrupted the education for some of these children without hope of having a meaningful future. These problems caused by Ebola comes as an add on to the challenge of Malaria which the church has been working with Episcopal Relief &amp;amp; Development to mitigate. At the height of the crisis it was difficult for primary health workers to differentiate malaria from ebola thereby wrongly categorizing cases of malaria as ebola and by that exposing the persons concerned to ebola infection even at the health centers. Also activities that were outlined for malaria control by the government and other agencies like the church which involved household visits and community level gatherings were suspended; and thus affecting the gains that would otherwise have been made in the control of malaria. In the light of these developments, the Anglican church of Guinea is aiming at reducing the combined sufferings of Ebola, Malaria and Diarrhea and to consolidate the gains made in malaria control in the past through the 2015 year. The church also hopes to ensure that all persons suspected of having ebola receive prompt and adequate treatment in the health facilities as well as malaria promptly treated in the community. With support from Episcopal Relief and Development, the Anglican Diocese of Guinea intends to embark on massive information, education and communication on management of malaria and diarrhea at the community level. The church intends to return to the use of door to door conversation and community level gatherings for drama performance to achieve this. Furthermore both community level and facility level health workers would be trained to ensure that the appropriate care is being provided. It is anticipated that by the close of 2015, the usage of LLINs would have improved in the project areas leading to reduced numbers of malaria cases.</narrative>
