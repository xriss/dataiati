   <narrative xml:lang="EN">As Myanmar is an agricultural country where most residents depend on agriculture production as a livelihood, the Men&apos;s Association identified the need to introduce appropriate, cost effective methods to increase productivity in the agricultural sector. Introduced by a Japanese agronomist in the 1990s, Effective Microorganism (EM) technology is an environmentally friendly low-cost method of farming that allows for the production of crops without damage to the ecosystem, including effects on soil, water supplies, biodiversity or other surrounding natural resources. The technology uses low cost and locally appropriate inputs to produce a microorganism based process for the producing organic fertilizers. With findings of an agricultural survey, the Men&apos;s Association identified the need to provide the EM technology and innovative agricultural techniques to farmers who struggle to sustain their own farms due to increasing costs and unpredictable weather patterns. 

The Association established a 6-acre demonstration farm in 2008 on rented land from one of the Association&apos;s members. The demonstration farm uses soil from under the bamboo trees to produce EM by mixing it with molasses and rice husk. At each training, farmers will learn the improved techniques and apply them in the demonstration farm over a three-week training period in order to prepare them to use these technologies in their home farms. 

In 2014, the Men&apos;s Association plans to train 95 farmers in 3 residential and 2 mobile training courses. The mobile training course will also include the practical application of biogas technology with the provision of a system in 2 communities. As training courses began in 2009, the Men&apos;s Association will continue to monitor the success of the training program and its impact on farmers as they apply their learning. The farm also intends develop a sustainability plan to support the continued service to small-holder farmers in Myanmar. To assist the Men&apos;s Association enhance their monitoring and financial management capacity, the Episcopal Church in the Philippines will provide technical support as part of Episcopal Relief &amp;amp; Development&apos;s South-to-South learning exchange initiative.</narrative>
