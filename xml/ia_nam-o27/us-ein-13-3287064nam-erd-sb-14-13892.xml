   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Mothers&#x2019; Union includes 16,000 members throughout nine dioceses of the Church of Melanesia. The Mothers&#x2019; Union initiated literacy programs in the province in 1989, and since has been one of the main providers of literacy training throughout the two countries. Literacy schools are supported and facilitated by Mothers&#x2019; Union members in each diocese. Schools take place within parishes, where there are 20 to 40 students in a class. Classes range from beginner to advanced in both Pidgin and English. All of the Mothers&#x2019; Union teachers, trained by program leadership and government services, have been leading these classes voluntarily. Since 2009, Episcopal Relief &amp;amp; Development has helped Mothers&#x2019; Union to support over 60 schools where over 1,500 individuals have learned to read and write. Last year the Mothers&#x2019; Union worked to strengthen its literacy program in each diocese by enhancing teaching methods, and reproducing and distributing standardized class record books, and learner testing tools. Additionally, working with the national literacy network and Ministry of Education, Mothers&#x2019; Union leadership reproduced and distributed a collection of 33 different types of teaching tools. In 2015, the Mothers&apos; Union seeks to reproduce and distribute four new teaching books that seek to encourage learner-driven reflection and community action on environmental protection, reforestation, building strong communities, and how to solve problems. The 2015 program targets include: 9 Diocesan Literacy Coordinators, 88 Literacy Schools, 163 Literacy Teachers and 1,130 Literacy Students (including an estimated total of 1055 women and 75 men), and an indirect beneficiary target of 4,520 family members of literacy learners.</narrative>
