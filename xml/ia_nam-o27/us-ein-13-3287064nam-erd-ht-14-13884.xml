   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In the 2014/15 academic year, BTI will undertake an evaluation of the situations of prior graduates. There are now 7 years of graduates from BTI, the first being in 2007. However there has been no formal evaluation of their success in obtaining employment or establishing a new business. Therefore one of the planned activities for this program this year is to undertake an evaluation of the situations of the graduates. As part of this process, evaluators will obtain feedback from graduates and businesses/NGO&#x2019;s about the adequacy of the qualifications of the graduates. This information will be used to assess whether modifications are needed to the current curriculum. It will also be helpful to ascertain why graduates have not been able to obtain steady employment. For each successive graduating class, this type of information will be collected. A portion of Episcopal Relief &amp;amp; Development funds will be used to support this effort. Since its inception in 2005, BTI has produced 773 skilled graduates, of which reports show that over 60% are employed in fields such as banking, government administration, and NGO services. In the 2014/15 academic year BTI anticipates an enrollment of 450 students, and a 2015 graduating class of 125.</narrative>
