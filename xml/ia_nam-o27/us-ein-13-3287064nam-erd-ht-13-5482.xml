   <narrative xml:lang="EN">School overcrowding and low public expenditure on education from the primary to secondary level result in low quality education in Haiti, with most schools depending upon uncertified teachers and traditional methods of learning and teaching. As a result, most graduates of secondary school are ill-prepared and presented with few opportunities to compete in a modern global economy that stresses information literacy, independent problem solving, and collaborative decision making. BTI offers students a post-secondary education that changes lives. BTI educators are highly qualified and committed lecturers, who challenge students toward innovative business technology developing new approaches to address Haiti&apos;s emerging needs. BTI strives to contribute to the economic development of Les Cayes and surrounding areas by providing graduates/employees skilled in administrative science, accounting, information technology, and English language. In response to the evolving Haitian job market (post-2010 earthquake) in 2011 BTI introduced two new courses focusing on NGO management and construction. BTI also offers students a very modern and relevant learning environment, with well-equipped classrooms, a library, and complementary wifi services. At the same time, BTI operates for-profit services such as a bookstore, cafeteria, and business/copy center that not only improve the learning environment for students, but also generate income to off-set institutional administrative expenses. In the 2013-2014 academic year, BTI&#x2019;s academic programs will be enhanced by the offering of a variety of seminars to be conducted by international resource persons. In addition, the academic and social life of the students will be enhanced through a variety of planned activities such as cultural events and education tours to the Dominican Republic, Cap-Haitian and the United States. Since its inception in 2005, BTI has produced 653 skilled graduates, of which reports show that over 60% are employed in fields such as banking, government administration and NGO services. In the 2013/14 academic year BTI anticipates an enrollment of 400 students, and a 2014 graduating class of 125.</narrative>
