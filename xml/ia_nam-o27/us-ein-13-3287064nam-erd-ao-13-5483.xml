   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Anglican Church in Angola, through its department of Projects for Community Development began the Malaria prevention program in 2006 with the support of Episcopal Relief &amp;amp; Development. With an annual budget of $520,000, Episcopal Relief &amp;amp; Development supports programs with Projects Department of the Church that includes NetsforLife&#xAE; and a clean water program, in Cunene. In 2007 PMI/USAID started to support NetsforLife at Mucaba Municipality in Uige Province, with a total grant of $1,500,000 for five years. 

The Anglican Church with its strong roots in the community, in Uige province and Southern Angola, has successfully shown impact in malaria morbidity and mortality. The result of these discussions was a grant of $308,000 to purchase and distribute long lasting insecticide treated nets through the Anglican Church network. In Angola, malaria is the most significant cause of child and maternal morbidity and mortality in the country and Episcopal Relief &amp;amp; Development enthusiastically supports PMI&#x2019;s leadership.

In February 2007, NetsforLife&#xAE; launched its malaria program in St. Stephens Church at Kilamba Kiaxi (suburb of Luanda), which was attended by Admiral Tim Ziemer, Dr. Van-Dunen, Minister of Health, Ambassador Cynthia Efird, Bishop Andre Soares of the Anglican Church and Dr. Steven Phillips of ExxonMobil. 

Since the problem continues to face lives of the people in the country, especially children under 5 and pregnant women in the cities, per urban and suburban areas, the church prioritizes and to implement the same project by continuing the intervention in malaria integrated program in the communities as the health system is still poor and needs to be improved. Last year the project trained 13 health agents, 75 volunteer activists, 30 women leaders, 60 Pastors and 30 youth groups. 

In 2014, the program would train nursers, volunteer activists, distribute LLINs and reach out to people with education.</narrative>
