   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Electricity access in Haiti is the lowest in the Latin American and Caribbean region. The electricity sector in Haiti has several weaknesses and it has been in crisis for decades. Haiti has a very limited availability and access to electricity, with significant technical and commercial energy losses. Even prior to the January 2010 earthquake, the energy sector was very problematic. Less than 40 percent of the population had access to electricity services leaving more than 6, 2 million people without power. The average person in Port-au Prince had less than 10 hours a day of electricity. Today, the access to electricity in rural areas in Haiti remains at approximately five percent. According to the Inter American Development Bank, the total installed generation capacity in 2010 in Haiti was about 150-MW. More than 60 percent of electricity generation is unsustainably based on imported diesel, mainly from Venezuela. Besides the P&#xE9;ligre hydroelectric generation plant (54-Megawatts (MW) plant that feeds Port-au-Prince) there are six small hydroelectric plants with a total installed capacity of 7-MW serving the isolated systems. Approximately 75 percent of Haiti&#x2019;s total installed generation capacity was dedicated to the metropolitan area of Port-au-Prince in 2010. The Episcopal University of Haiti School of Nursing (FSIL) is located in Leogane, just an hour (30 kms ) south of the Haitian capital: Port-au-Prince. But in terms of access to electricity, the town of Leogane might as well be on another planet. Today, Leogane gets only four hours of electricity at night. The school is not able to depend on the state sponsored electricity company (EDH) for electricity during the day. FSIL therefore relies heavily on fuel-powered generator during its hours of operation. Considering the increase of fuel prices, and taking into account the economic precarity of its students; FSIL is unable to continue to afford the high price of energy by EDH. The city of Leogane was the epicenter of the 2010 disastrous earthquake. It was reported that 90% of the city&#x2019;s buildings were destroyed and thousands of people lost their lives. While it was spared from major damages from the earthquake; the nursing school became a makeshift hospital and provided assistance and care to more than 5000 displaced persons. As the only nursing school in Leogane and one of the best in Haiti, FSIL strives constantly to sustain and enhance its quality in teaching, public service and economic development in Leogane. It also ensures that the students participate in the reconstruction of Leogane by providing the necessary tools to identify, understand and meet the health needs of their communities. Through this project, 195 solar panels of 250 Watts will be installed to produce the 220 KWh needed per day. Also, the A/C units will be replaced in order to reduce the load of the air conditioning system from 40 KW to 13 KW. The energy costs is expected to be reduced by approximately USD$6,300.00 per month.</narrative>
