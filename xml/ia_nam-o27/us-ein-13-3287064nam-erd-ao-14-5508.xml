   <narrative xml:lang="EN">2014 Program Goal: The current goal of the Angola Mothers&#x2019; Union Child Survival program is to facilitate the transformation and empowerment of Angolan women to reinforce their contribution toward a reduction in the morbidity and mortality of their children, an increase in their economic independence in their families, and an overall improvement in the environment and public health of their communities. 

The 2014-2016 Strategic Plan of the Angola Mothers&#x2019; Union Child Survival program targets the formation of 520 Savings with Education Groups throughout five provinces. This 2014 plan therefore proposes to support the Mothers&#x2019; Union in their expanded work toward this goal and the growth of the new Savings with Education component of the Child Survival Program through the reinforcement of 56 Savings with Education groups (32 in Luanda and 24 in Uige). Additionally, this plan will ensure the continuation and/or integration of education dialogues on good health, clean environments, violence, gender-based violence, and financial literacy within each and every Savings group. 

Background: Initially launched in 2009 as an extension to the Angola NetsforLife&#xAE; program, the originally shared goal of the Angola NetsforLife&#xAE; and Mothers&#x2019; Union Child Survival program was to contribute to behavior change and the reduction of child morbidity and mortality in Angola. With recognition to the need for a more integrated response that would address additional childhood vulnerabilities such as contagious diseases, poor nutrition, and limited prenatal care, the Child Survival program was launched to empower (educate and enable) women to improve the health of children in their households as well as their communities. 

In response to a January 2011 assessment, the Bishop of the Anglican Church of Angola approved that the leadership of the Child Survival Program be transferred to the Mothers&#x2019; Union and their newly formed project department, so as to ensure the project&#x2019;s more intensive and effective engagement. As Public Health depends upon all (the whole population) being educated and engaged, not simply the members of the Anglican Church parishes and congregations, in 2011 under the Mothers&#x2019; Union leadership the project took on a new structure. This change charged the Mothers&#x2019; Union with the task of educating its members, who in turn would voluntarily work to educate the community. 

Over the next three years (2011 &#x2013; 2013) 27 Mothers&#x2019; Union members were trained as facilitators (Community Agents). These Community Agents in turn mobilized and trained over 1,173 Mothers&#x2019; Union members as volunteer Activists that in turn engaged women in their neighborhoods to create community-based Learning Groups. Over the three-year period it was reported that 4,129 women in 55 communities of Luanda, Uige and Mucaba districts had formed 608 Learning Groups to discuss issues of better child health. 

As of 2013, over 2,198 women in 291 learning groups were still meeting weekly to not only discuss but also take action on issues that would contribute to better health in their homes, among their group members, and in their wider communities. In 2012/3, to improve responsiveness of the program to meet women&#x2019;s additional requests for economic strengthening, the Mothers&#x2019; Union began researching the integration of a savings group component. This initially involved a March 2012 peer learning exchange with Mothers&#x2019; Union Burundi, followed by a November 2012 Savings with Education Facilitators&#x2019; Workshop led by Episcopal Relief &amp;amp; Development technical partner Freedom from Hunger. 

In 2013, this new Savings with Education component was launched in Luanda by 7 newly trained Mothers&#x2019; Union Savings Agents. The pilot year results were the creation of 12 Savings Groups (through the combination of 28 learning groups) inclusive of 233 active members who saved a combined total of US$29,683 and earned a combined total of US$3,889 in benefits (interest and fines) for an end-of-year payout of US$33,572 (i.e., representing an average of US$144 per member).</narrative>
