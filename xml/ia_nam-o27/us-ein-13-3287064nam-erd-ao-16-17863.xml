   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In Angola, Episcopal Relief &amp;amp; Development and the Igreja Anglicana em Angola&#x2019;s Community Development Department work to empower rural communities to tackle their development challenges. While improving access to safe drinking water and sanitation facilities is a major objective of both the Minist&#xE9;rio da Energia e &#xC1;guas (MINEA) and Direc&#xE7;&#xE3;o Nacional de Abastecimento de &#xC1;gua e Saneamento (DNAAS), the water and sanitation sector remains weak. Water-borne diseases such as diarrhea and cholera remain prevalent. Diarrhea is responsible for 15% of under-5 deaths, one of Africa&#x2019;s highest rates (WHO, 2010 Data). Water and sanitation improvements have been concentrated in urban areas, where systems are easier to install and manage by local authorities. For example, in rural areas, only 35% of the population has use of improved drinking water versus 66% in urban areas (WHO, 2011 Data). While Angola reduced open defecation from 57% to 25% from 1990 to 2011, the reduction was largely in urban areas (86% compared to 19% reduction in rural areas). Angola faces the challenge of identifying feasible community-driven and managed strategies for creating sustainable water, sanitation and hygiene in rural areas. Lack of WASH access disproportionately affects Angolan women, who are typically responsible for the provision of domestic water supply and sanitation and hygiene. They struggle to collect water for daily needs, care for children who suffer from diarrhea, and maintain a healthy household. Despite their responsibilities, household and community decision-making processes exclude women. Clean water and improved sanitation are critical sustaining factors of life; without them the entire family suffers. The project&#x2019;s overarching goal is a significant reduction of water-borne diseases by increasing access to improved water supply, sanitation, and hygiene services in Songo. The project would adopt the Community Led Total Sanitation (CLTS) approach as a way of sustaining behavior change with respect to sanitation: particularly the use of latrines with the hope of arriving at open-defecation free (ODF) communities. Community volunteers are critical to the project. Staff will train and support 30 Community Health &amp;amp; Savings Agents, 81 Community Water &amp;amp; Sanitation Committees, 405 Volunteer Community Health Activists, and 810 Volunteer Women&#x2019;s Group Activists. These volunteers serve as key vehicles to disseminate knowledge, mobilize community-driven WASH solutions, and ensure clean-water access and improved hygiene and sanitation. Community members &#x2013; local leaders (sobas), their deputies, health professionals and volunteers &#x2013; will link their plans and implementation to those of MINEA and DNAAS at the municipal and provincial levels. This approach integrates existing strengths, including the government&#x2019;s resources and technical knowledge, the Anglican Church&#x2019;s local presence and experience in fund management, and the broader population&#x2019;s contributions, motivation, and local ownership of WASH resources.</narrative>
