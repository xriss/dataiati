   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Beginning in 1990s, rural folk from western China poured into cities of the east coast to seek employment. Since then, the rural farming areas of China have been consistently losing young male laborers, and that has led to a slow down of economic development and self-management, weak internal cohesion, and lack of community spirit. 

To fill this labour gap, women have become the major force in rural community development. Women are provided with opportunities for economic development but also faced with the household and community responsibilities. Currently, in rural areas in China, women&#x2019;s development remains one of the major issues that need to be enhanced. With low income from a singular source, weak awareness of health care and accessibility to medical treatment, poor school education and insufficient agricultural skills training, lack of legal knowledge and awareness, low social welfare coverage, and few opportunities to participate in decision-making of community affairs, women in rural China still need to overcome many obstacles to develop themselves. 

The Amity Foundation has identified Jinyintan and Guojiaqiao Township of Litong County in Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region for targeted activities. The major population of the township consists of Hui ethnic groups. Litong County lies in the middle part of Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region. It is under the administration of Wuzhong city. There are 12 townships, 108 villages in Litong County. The total population of Litong is 400,000, among which 55.2% (220,800 people) is of Hui ethnic group. 

Initiating this three year project from 2014-16, the objectives of the program include increasing household income and women&apos;s health status. This year, Amity intends to establish 2 women&apos;s associations to provide business skills and technical training, provide health worker training and support community centers to provide health education campaigns.</narrative>
