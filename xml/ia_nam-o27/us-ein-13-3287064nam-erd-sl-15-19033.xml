   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Agriculture is a dominant sector in the Sierra Leone economy. An estimated 2/3 of the population practices subsistence agriculture. With rice production increasing over the years after the conflict period, the country still faces food shortages given the rapid growth in population size. This is particularly evidenced during the lean period (August to June) where it is estimated that 45% of the population or 2.5 million people do not have sufficient food. Increments in food production experienced after the war was driven by a threefold increase in the area planted with rice. However, producing food does not necessarily mean that there is access to food. High poverty levels, poor marketing infrastructure and a dynamic growth together with weak agricultural extension services are the main constraints that directly impact on the livelihoods of vulnerable communities. It&#x2019;s estimated that only 6% of rice cultivators rely on their own production to feed their families. The majority of the rural population borrows money to buy food. The problem of accessing food is further exacerbated by the growing trend in rising food prices. The Anglican Diocese of Bo continues to implement the Integrated Health and Food Security Program as part of the overall effort of reducing poverty, by targeting poor families in its operational area and working towards achieving the main objectives of increasing agricultural yield, strengthening of marketing links and contributing towards the fight against malaria in high prevalence areas. The spread of Ebola in the Diocese of Bo has to a large extent affected the Program. The Anglican Diocese of Bo had over the years developed and strengthened community structures, which remained intact during the emergency. This structures served as important conduits and partners in mobilizing much needed emergency support, which includes all aspects of prevention, mobilization, education, awareness, contact tracing and counseling, protection &#x2013; PPE and provision of sanitary items and materials and more importantly relief supplies in the form of food for quarantined communities an families in hard to reach areas located within out operational area. The Anglican Diocese of Bo holds the view that it is part of her mission to address some of these psychological, physical, social and economic repercussions. The Diocese is therefore involved in sustainable development in Pujehun and Bo districts through the implementation of programs related to good governance, food security, GBV and preventive health. Specifically, the Diocese is involved in supporting communities to grow enough food to eat and sell and the environmental protection for economic growth, teaching on good governance/democratic leadership, advocacy and gender equity including the Government approved three gender acts (Domestic Violence, Devolution of estate and Marriage ) in four chiefdom in Pujehun district communities. In both Pujehun and Bo districts the Diocese teaches about the causes, prevention and cure for malaria including sourcing and hanging of bed nets. This Program brings into the fore the need to mainstream currently ongoing Ebola response work with the Integrated Health and Food Security Program. The Program would be better positioned and prepared to address the longer term task of post Ebola rehabilitation. To this end, the Program will continue providing counseling and education support to both survivors, village communities and the Church congregation using its clergy, volunteers and traditional structures as trainers and mobilizes. Specific schemes related to livelihoods rehabilitation of survivor families and direct support to orphaned children will be linked and mainstreamed with the ongoing Integrated Health and Food Security Program.</narrative>
