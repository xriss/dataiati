   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Malaria control at household level remains a challenge in the rural, and Urban and semi-urban setting. The project intends to intensify the net use culture to ensure that all nets at household level are used effectively with the knowledge enough to increase usage through self procurement to sustain community gains in fighting malaria. In otherwords, the project will not only continue promoting net use for the existing nets but will go further in ensuring that household appreciate the benefit of net use to enable them sustainably ensure that all members sleep under a mosquito net every night. The project will promote these initiatives through the church structure by engaging the local religious, civic and cultural leaders. Through this project, CoU will use its vast structure to continue lobbying and advocating for better government interventions at community level which will aim to have more sustainable ways of dealing with households in prevention of malaria. CoU will also ensure that there is continuous capacity building for health workers and local leaders to promote preventive measures. This will see grass-root trainings for Community Health Workers enhanced to improve localized interventions. CoU will work with other health promotion organizations to promote malaria messages across the country. Through media broadcasts, CoU will no longer carry self proclaimed messages but work with other service providers to leverage on efforts and to increase ability of reaching more people with messages. CoU will work with NMCP and within the National Malaria Communication Strategy to design effective messages on malaria and other diseases. CoU is in the process of strengthening its M&amp;amp;E department by prioritizing evidence based approaches to inform future programming. This will be mainly to build capacity at national, community and diocesan level to manage and filter data for better planning. This project will ensure that proper documentation of the project milestones is emphasized through a robust Monitoring and Evaluation (M&amp;amp;E) system strengthening. This will range from data collection at community level, ensuring that the human resource is adequately available to carry out M&amp;amp;E and also build the capacity of various players in systems strengthening in regards to M&amp;amp;E. CoU will continue building in country partnerships and enhance the private sector involvement in contributing to the fight against malaria. Within this period, CoU will concentrate on reviving private sector initiatives to fight malaria and make remarkable resource allocation to this cause.</narrative>
