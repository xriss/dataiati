   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Episcopal Relief &amp;amp; Development&apos;s partnership with the Church of the Province of Myanmar involves activities in each of the six dioceses and the Provincial Development Office.  Episcopal Relief &amp;amp; Development is working with the provincial and diocesan development staff to strengthen and expand community development program planning and implementation, and to build professional capacity of development staff. Each diocesan office conducts assessments to determine community priorities and plan program activities, with community participation and leadership, to meet development needs as defined by their constituencies.   This year, each diocese will conduct an external evaluation to address effectiveness, efficiency and participant impact of programmatic activity.  This evaluation is expected to be completed by mid 2012, following which the development staff will review and develop a work plan to implement many of the recommendations to enhance their management capacity.
