   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Anglican Church of Burundi&#x2019;s Transformative Sustainable Livelihoods and Health Program seeks to assist poor and vulnerable people in six dioceses who lack access to preventative health care information and services and suffer from and/or are at high risk for infectious diseases such as HIV/AIDS. Using a comprehensive approach to address HIV/AIDS called &quot; SAVE&quot; (Safer practices, Available medication, Voluntary counseling and testing, Empowerment), the program focuses on raising awareness of HIV/AIDS and working against the stigma and discrimination associated with it. PEAB and diocesan counterparts educate and equip clergy and youth to speak out about HIV/AIDS prevention and they support clinics to provide voluntary counseling and testing for HIV/AIDS. The program specifically targets pregnant mothers to attend PMTCT sessions at clinics to prevent mother-to-child transmission of HIV. Since 2015, the program also includes family planning and female hygiene education and service provision. Clergy are trained on integrating family planning and other SRH topics into their pastoral care so that they can educate ad empower couples to make healthy choices. Female youth are being taught about proper hygiene care during menstruation in order to reduce the growing rate of hygiene-related infections. Inclusion of family planning and feminine hygiene into PEAB&apos;s health education, advocacy and service provision support is promoting a more holistic approach to improving community health.</narrative>
