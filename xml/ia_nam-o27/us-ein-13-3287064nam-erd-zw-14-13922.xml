   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Diocese of Masvingo Partenership Program is a relief and development program whose mission is to enhance the relevance of the church in society through holistic mission. The program&#x2019;s chief focus is strengthening livelihoods of vulnerable households living in drought prone areas by strengthening and diversifying income sources which in the longer term will enable them to withstand shocks emanating as a direct consequence of drought and food shortages. The Program will also continue to focus on HIV/AIDS mitigation efforts, that aims to improve the health status of PLWHAS and their families so that they can lead health and productive lives. For the past four years, the Diocese embarked on income generating and home based care projects. Lives have improved through households having more disposable income to pay fees for their children and to buy food and household utensils. Through the provision of kits, HIV/AIDS caregivers have brought relief to those living with HIV virus. Continuous training and workshops to beneficiaries, staff, caregivers and other stakeholders has contributed to the success of the programs. In addition, monitoring trips have enabled effective communication, identification of challenges and speedy assistance and solutions offered. The Diocese have introduced Conservation Farming. In the Diocese of Masvingo farmers have experienced drought. The Diocese has traditionally responded to drought by providing farmers with seed to enable them to re-establish their cropping enterprises, but the absence of interventions there is limited sustainable option for farmers to maintain higher productivity levels. Hence the Diocese has embarked on Conservation Farming techniques training that include the application of planting basin, which concentrates on limited water and nutrients resources to plants, this strategy teaches farmers to apply the inputs efficiently. The pursuit of input used efficiently provides higher and more sustainable productivity gains necessary to achieve food security in drought prone areas.</narrative>
