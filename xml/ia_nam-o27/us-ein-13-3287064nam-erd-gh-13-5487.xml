   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This is an Integrated Community-based Program which will contribute to the improvement of child and maternal health. The program uses the integrated Community Case Management (iCCM) model which focuses on malaria, diarrhea, and pneumonia among children under five years and pregnant women. ADDRO has implemented the integrated Community Based Health Programme (ICHP) with a focus on malaria since 2006. By the end of 2012, about 1,822,665 LLINs were distributed and this led to significant increase in LLINs possession and utilization (63.8% to 95%) in ADDRO target communities among pregnant women and children under five and the general populace. In 2013, ADDRO expanded its health program to include HIV/AIDS, STIs, Tuberculosis, hepatitis and malaria.</narrative>
