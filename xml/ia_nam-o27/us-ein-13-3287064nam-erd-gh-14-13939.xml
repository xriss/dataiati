   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This is an Integrated Community-based Program which will contribute to the improvement of maternal and child health. The program uses the integrated Community Case management (iCCM), and Social and Behavior Change Communication (SBCC) strategies with its focus on malaria, diarrhea, and pneumonia among children under five years, pregnant women and women of reproductive ages. ADDRO has implemented the Integrated Community Based Health Programme (ICHP) with a focus on malaria since 2006. By the end of 2012, about 3,880,604 long Lasting Insecticide Nets (LLINs) were distributed and this led to significant increase in LLINs possession and utilization (63.8% to 95%) in ADDRO target communities among pregnant women, children under five and the general populace. In 2013, ADDRO expanded its health program to include Human Immunodeficiency Virus &amp;amp; Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome/ Sexually Transmitted Infections (HIV&amp;amp;AIDS/STIs), Tuberculosis, Hepatitis and malaria. Hundred (100) LLINs were distributed during the annual World Malaria day commemoration. In 2014, ADDRO shifted its focus to the iCCM strategy reaching out to children under five years and pregnant women. 273 Community Based Agents (CBAs) were trained on iCCM and they worked in their various communities to diagnose and treat uncomplicated malaria, diarrhea and pneumonia in children under five years. At the end of the year, 2,049 children aged 0-59 months were treated for Malaria, 669 treated for diarrhea and 584 treated for pneumonia. As part of the program, ADDRO in partnership with National Malaria Control Program (NMCP) and other partners carried out LLINs point distribution campaign in the Eastern and Volta Regions in 2014. About 1,583,440 and 1,293,913 LLINs were distributed in the Eastern and Volta Regions respectively, bringing it to a total of 2,877,353 LLINs distributed in 2014. 7,994 community volunteers (4,633 for the Eastern Region and 3,361 for the Volta Region) were trained and mobilized for the LLIN distribution campaign.</narrative>
