   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The civil unrest in Syria over the last four years has caught millions of civilians in the crossfire causing large numbers to flee for their life to neighboring countries and further abroad. At the present time some 6 million Syrians form the largest single group of refugees world-wide. It is estimated that to-date about 1&#xBC; million Syrians reside within Jordan. The UNHCR registration figure of Syrian refugees in Jordan reached 657,206 persons. Approximately 83% live in urban areas in the north of Jordan, while the remaining proportion live in the Za&#x2019;atari, Marjeeb al-Fahood, Cyber City and Al -Azraq Camps. In emergency situations, the needs of the disabled are generally neglected or considered a low priority by relief agencies and service providers. Even though disability is a cross-cutting theme which affects the entire refugee population it is often overlooked in all sectors, notably health and education. Most international relief organizations lack the specialist capacity to work with persons with disabilities. The Syrian refugee situation is no exception, as refugees entered to Jordan and were received initially in Za&#x2019;atari camp none of the relief agencies operating there at the time offered appropriate services to the disabled. Refugee Disability Services HLID is a founding partner of the NETWORK, a coordinating organization of five local disability-specific organizations providing services throughout Jordon. The NETWORK has a proven track record of over 30 years of service provision and expertise. In December 2012, with Episcopal Relief &amp;amp; Development support, HLID expanded its NETWORK programme to serve the disability community in Za&#x2019;atari camp. From December 2012 until April 2016, HLID has screen 5050 cases, assesses 3,751 cases, diagnosed 2,744 cases, provided 2,551 people with assistive devices, 1,454 with glasses, 822 with hearing aids and distributed 6,082 batteries, 224 splits, boots or chairs and 51 buggies for children with cerebral palsy or elderly persons with mobility issues. Additionally 70 children with different disabilities are enrolled in special education programmes at the NETWORK Center in Za&#x2019;atari. In this 8-month project proposal, the HLID intends to expand its services furthermore to include Azraq camp in the Eastern desert of Jordan. It is the second biggest camp with currently around 52,000 refugees from Syria (with Za&#x2019;atari camp now at capacity, new intake is channeled to the Azraq camp). In Azraq Camp). Syrian refugees live in destitute conditions, depending mainly on support from international organizations (and Arab Gulf countries), coordinated by UNHCR. Social services are below the needs and the camp does not caters for persons with disabilities. Institutional Strengthening Since the start of the HLID&#x2019;s Syrian refugee response, HLID has been able to deliver on partnership agreements in providing support to refugees with disabilities. In response, HLID has mobilized its institutional resources to establish, supervise and monitor these operational centers both at Za&#x2019;atari camp and in mobile locations. While the donor community has funded the direct costs of these services, HLID has lent support in the form of expertise, human resources and in-kind contributions. With an expansion of services in ongoing refugee humanitarian crisis, HLID&#x2019;s institutional capacity is stretched particularly as HLID strives to maintain the integrity and quality of their core programming as well. Therefore, a critical component of this proposal is capacity building of HLID, which includes hiring new staff, training, and logistical resources and supplies.</narrative>
