   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Being a large agricultural country, the quality of the environment in China&#x2019;s rural areas is not only crucial for improving the health of local people and their quality of life, but also for maintaining sustainable development in rural areas. At present, there are about 103 million rural Chinese who are consuming unsafe drinking water, of which 28,960,000 are difficult in drinking water as a result of water pollution. 

As the government has passed strict regulations on industrial pollution, the point-pollution source from the industry is not the only cause of environmental pollution and deterioration in rural areas. Rural communities are also significant sources of pollution with household garbage, domestic sewage, human and livestock fecaluria, and chemical fertilizers and pesticides. 

Baojing County of Hunan Province is located in central and southern China. And Baojing has minority population of 236,000, accounting for 79.6% of the total population, of which there are 166,000 Tujia people and 69,000 Miao people. Per capita disposable income of urban residents is 8,779 yuan and rural per capita net income of farmers is 2,539 yuan. Baojing County is one of the key counties included in the national list for poverty alleviation. 

In 2012, Amity began a three-year initiative entitled Baojing Environmental Management Programme. The program seeks to address the lack of appropriate sewage and garbage disposal systems for the villages of Puxi, Tiechang and Yama, in Baojing county, to benefit 1,450 people. Currently, with the sewage and garbage being disposed into the Huapuxi river, the river&#x2019;s water quality has worsened thus threatening both the safety of key drinking and irrigation water source for the farming community. 

In 2014, program activities include the provision of 49 toilets, a road-side drainage system and installation of 13,340 meters of piping from a 360 square foot water reservoir through the strengthening of village-level watershed committees.</narrative>
