   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Our partnership with the Sudanese Relief and Development Agency (SUDRA) has two components. One component includes the emergency response following the outbreak of violence in December 2013, and the second component relates to the operational management and restructuring of the SUDRA organization. 

With the outbreak of violence on December 15, 2013, the young nation of South Sudan has been engaged in a defacto civil war between forces loyal to the current President, Salva Kir and the former Vice President Riek Machar. Although attempts at cessation of hostilities have been partly successful, various new militant groups have emerged and the security situation continues to be very fluid. 

Within this context, The Episcopal Church of South Sudan and Sudan, commissioned an Emergency Crisis Committee under SUDRA. SUDRA/ECC serves to oversee and provide technical assistance to the relief activities facilitated by SUDRA. As SUDRA is designed as a coordinating body and an implementing agency, the emergency response has relied heavily on the diocesan DRR teams, which Episcopal Relief &amp;amp; Development had trained several years ago. This is a positive development and demonstrates the practical application of the training. SUDRA&apos;s Emergency Response is supported by various funding agencies, coordinated by the Anglican Alliance. Episcopal Relief &amp;amp; Development is playing a critical role as the lead agency in this collaborative effort.</narrative>
