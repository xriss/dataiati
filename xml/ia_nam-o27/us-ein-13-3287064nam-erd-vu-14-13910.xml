   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Church of Melanesia operates eleven Rural Training Centers (RTC), five in Vanuatu and six in the Solomon Islands. The RTCs were established against the backdrop of many school dropouts from the primary &amp;amp; secondary education systems in Solomon Islands and Vanuatu. These school dropouts do not have the necessary education or self-esteem to be functioning members in society. The RTCs provide an avenue for some of the school dropouts to be empowered with useful knowledge, values and skills. The RTCs receive some limited financial assistance from the Governments of Solomon Island and Vanuatu. The aim of ACOM&#x2019;s Rural Training Centers is to empower men and women with appropriate life skills that would enhance their own well-being and that of their respective communities. In 2009, ACOM with Episcopal Relief &amp;amp; Development&#x2019;s support conduced a comprehensive review and study of all ACOM RTCs. This 2015 plan is based on the guiding principles that emerged from the 2009 study as documented in the Master ACOM Rural Training Center Policy document that are: 1) Increase access and gender equity in enrollment, 2) Create better quality standards in education and training, 3) Improve infrastructures, 4) Strengthen teacher training and recruitment, 5) Introduce new and relevant curriculum including short-courses, 6) Equip centers with tools and inventory controls, and 7) develop business plans to work toward sustainability.</narrative>
