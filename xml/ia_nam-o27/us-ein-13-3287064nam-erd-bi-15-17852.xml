   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In Burundi, political and ethnic conflict has not resulted in civil war or government upheaval the past few years; yet is has contributed to ineffective or non-existent government policies, economic stagnation and poor social development indicators. This instability and poverty increases women and girls&apos; risk to violence, in all of its forms. The social and cultural norms underlying the attitudes and behaviors that lead to gender inequalities and violence are quite entrenched. A culture of impunity and lack of government social services mean that most survivors of violence suffer in silence with little or no recourse to justice or support. The Anglican Church of Burundi&apos;s &quot;Services Anglicans pour le D&#xE9;veloppement Communautaire&quot; or SADC is continuing to pilot a faith community-driven SGBV prevention and response project in the 3 dioceses of Makamba, Matana and Rumonge. Its objectives are threefold: (1) Increase knowledge and support skills related to SGBV prevention and response for 63 faith leaders in 3 dioceses by the end of 2015; (2) Increase active leadership and advocacy efforts by 63 faith leaders to prevent and respond to SGBV in 3 dioceses by the end of 2015; and (3) Educate and mobilize youth about SGBV prevention and response through 12 Stop AIDS Clubs in 3 dioceses by the end of 2015. The project envisions diocesan development staff, pastors, Mother&apos;s Union representatives and youth group leaders as agents of change and key community mobilizers and as such they will participate in intensive and participatory workshops and discussions that will help prepare them to speak out against violence; promote positive masculinities and gender equality; and advocate for and support survivors of violence.</narrative>
