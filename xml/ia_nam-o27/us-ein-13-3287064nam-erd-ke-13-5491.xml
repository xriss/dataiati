   <narrative xml:lang="EN">CAPA works to accompany the Anglican Provinces of Africa by discerning and interpreting the political, social and economic trends in relation to holistic development in the Continent. CAPA aims at influencing policies and interventions that enable communities to overcome poverty, ignorance, misery and social challenges in Africa. The main strategy of CAPA is to mobilize Churches and build their capacity to make sustainable and prophetic responses on matters that affect the well-being of the people so that they can become a credible voice and vehicle for their total transformation. 

Objectives include: 

1) To sustain engagement of women and Youth in Peace building, healing and discipleship. 

2) To contribute towards Food Security and Nutrition in 10 Dioceses 

3) Linking Religious Leaders with Regional Hubs (EAC, SADC, ECOWAS, Arab League) 

4) Resource Mapping 

5) Provide support to the Africa Reaching Out to Africa Initiative. 

6) To step up the anti-malaria campaign in all the CAPA Provinces Africa consists of countries at various levels of socio-economic development presenting various challenges including poverty, hunger, gender inequality, young populations, political instability, conflict and effects of climate change. 

Women and Youth tend to bear the brunt of the effects of these challenges due to their relative lower levels of empowerment and opportunities. Community initiatives in different countries have included peace building/conflict transformation, climate adaptation, economic empowerment through table banking etc. While there are some success stories of community action towards meeting the challenges, there is need for the Churches to help other communities through capturing and sharing of best practices. 

CAPA will work with key Anglican Church leadership in African Provinces by facilitating forums and enhancing capacity to ensure that they engage locally, nationally and regionally with the relevant institutions to overcome the challenges presented above. As a Body that has a huge constituency of congregations, the action will thus make use of the numbers to spread the positive effects expected as outcomes. Different strategies will be used for particularly the young people (young men and women) and women who tend to be &#x2018;invisible&#x2019; and thus left out. By creating separate and later common spaces for these groups, CAPA hopes to capture all the voices and ideas necessary to reach the desired outcomes. CAPA&#x2019;s strategy and approach is based on the recommendations and outcomes from the All Africa Bishops&#x2019; Conference held in 2010 where among other themes, the following were agreed upon as focus areas: i. Securing economic and community development ii. Nurturing harmonious and dignified communities. Further, the Primates Wives meeting In Lagos in February 2014 expressed commitment towards supporting economic empowerment of all women to spur self-reliance.</narrative>
