   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Camalotal is located in the Mexican state of Oaxaca in the municipality of San Juan Bautista Tuxtepec. Located at an altitude of 60 meters, Camalotal is home for 1214 inhabitants. About 56 percent of the local population are adults. While the average years at school is 6 years, there are still about persons who are illiterate. Most of them  are of indigenous origin and speak an indigenous language. Lack of employment opportunities is a big issue among the members in this community. Most of the men and women remaining are unemployed, the rest are working illegally in the USA because that is their only resource. Episcopal Relief &amp;amp; Development in partnership with the Diocese of Southeast Mexico established a dairy cooperative to generate income and employment among the members of this community. Cattle has being purchase to form a cooperative among the members of the community. They organized themselves to work the land where cattle is raised, they make sure it has adequate space, food and provide maintenance on a regular basis. A veterinarian has been hired to train the members of the cooperative on how to maintain and take care of the cattle, how to apply vaccines and other medications to the animals and to monitor their health on a regular basis. Training on milk production, cheese making and basic business practices are also provided to guarantee their insertion into the local markets. In addition to generating employment for the community members, the income generated by this program will fund alternative productive social projects and a disaster relief fund for this community.</narrative>
