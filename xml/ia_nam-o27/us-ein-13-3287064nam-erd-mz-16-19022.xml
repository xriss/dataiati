   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In 2014, the Lebombo Diocese consecrated the Right Reverend Carlos Sim&#xE3;o Matsinhe as its 11th Bishop. With an intention to build upon the strengths of both the Diocese and its relief and development office known as Anglican Social Action (ASA), Bishop Matsinhe with the support of Episcopal Relief &amp;amp; Development chose 2015 to be a year of learning and growth. Episcopal Relief &amp;amp; Development thus partnered with Lebombo on two key initiatives: 1) Lebombo Diocese Capacity Building in administration, finance and human resource policies and practices, and 2) ASA Community Driven Development through the application of a pilot Church and Community Mobilization Process (CCMP) known as Umoja (Together we Can). Last years&#x2019; experience proved to the ASA team that CCMP or Umoja is an appropriate tool for community engagement and participatory development. The Program showed the potential ASA has in impacting the lives of communities through facilitation, training and journeying with the groups that were part of the pilot program. CCMP drives community members into a paradigm shift as far as agency and problem solving is concerned. Communities realize their potential and mobilize themselves for the process of identification of resources and finding answers for their challenges. The church plays an important role as the starting point, a safe space where it emerges and is then taken into the communities. Last year the Program reached 4 Archdeaconries and 14 Parishes. In 2016, ASA will continue the CCMP/Umoja Program started last year. The plan is to continue with the 14 parishes and go further to envision the leadership in Inhambane Archdeaconry.</narrative>
