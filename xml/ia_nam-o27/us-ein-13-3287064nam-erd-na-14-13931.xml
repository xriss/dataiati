   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Since 2008, Episcopal Relief &amp;amp; Development and Nets for Life have been supporting the Anglican AIDS Programme (AAP) in a variety of initiatives to facilitate parishes and local groups to address the challenges and realities of their communities. The goal has been to train and facilitate communities of specified parishes and outstations in the Diocese of Namibia to be self-empowered in their own health and well being, particularly in relation to the prevention of and care for those living with HIV &amp;amp; AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. In 2013, AAP worked with 10 parishes and 15 of their outstations reaching over 2,838 people in 32 communities in northern Namibia, many of which are located in remote areas beyond the reach of other social service programs. With these communities AAP facilitated the growth and educational outreach of Support Groups made up of individuals with HIV, volunteer Home-based Care Givers and general community members. In 2014, in an effort to combine sustainable economic supports with existing social supports, AAP integrated into their existing work Episcopal Relief &amp;amp; Development&#x2019;s Savings with Education methodology. Following a February 2014 peer learning exchange to the Savings with Education program of the Diocese of Angola, the Mothers&#x2019; Union program coordinator from Luanda joined Episcopal Relief &amp;amp; Development in the co-facilitation of a training for AAP&#x2019;s launch of savings work. Over the course of the year, AAP successfully launch 18 Savings with Education groups in 17 of their pre-existing communities. In total, these groups mobilized 294 members (including 21 men). The overall aim of the Savings with Education initiative is to alleviate poverty and reduce lack of unemployment amongst family members and also to enhance entrepreneurial skills and knowledge among community members. The 2015 goal is to continue enhancing community groups with entrepreneurial skills as well as health education and environmental sustainability. Due to the demand within the communities, the 2015 program intends to expand upon the 2014 pilot activities that started 18 savings groups through the creation of 21 more saving groups.</narrative>
