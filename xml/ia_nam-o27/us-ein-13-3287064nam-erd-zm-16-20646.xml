   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In the pursuit of changing the lives of the children and their caregivers in vulnerable communities, Zambia Anglican Council Outreach Programmes (ZACOP) in partnership with Episcopal Relief &amp;amp; Development has been implementing the Early Childhood Development (ECD) programme since 2012. The first phase of the programme was implemented in Northern and Central Dioceses in 2012. The second phase was the scale up to three other Dioceses in 2013, namely Luapula, Lusaka and Eastern which ended on 31st December, 2016. In 2017, ZACOP will be implementing an Interim Integrated Early Childhood Development Program for Children Affected by HIV/AIDS for a bridge period of six months. The key areas of focus for the Interim Six-month period (January to June 2017) is to strengthen caregiver/ volunteer engagement and ownership of the ECD Program in order to enhance improve community activity performance for impact results. In order to achieve this, a new set of activities will be carried out in addition to the routine activities. The transition strategy for the interim six month period foresees the continuation of ongoing ECD activities with some variations on program timeframes between new and older Dioceses leading to changes in frequency of home visits. The transition strategy is grounded on continued learning, innovation and piloting that will enable key stakeholders to manage and own the ECD Program while at the same time providing continued services to caregivers and their children. - Integrating nutrition assessment with ECD through ongoing health services (growth monitoring), home visitations, care giver support and learning group sessions will enable the Program to attain scale and maintain effectiveness. Detecting the early on-set of malnutrition together with referral; treatment and counseling can avert and reduce the incidence of wasting (Marasmus) and edematous malnutrition (kwashiorkor) averting and reducing the negative longer term consequences. - The caregiver peer-to-peer home visit approach is a small pilot that will be learned from, adopted and scaled up - Continued participatory discussions and consultation are expected to lead to increased participation and involvement and ultimately to self-management and ownership.</narrative>
