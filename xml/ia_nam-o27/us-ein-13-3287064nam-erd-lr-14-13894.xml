   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Episcopal Church of Liberia will continue implementing it Agriculture and Livelihoods Programs in the four Archdeaconries (South East, North, South West and Bassa). The agriculture program will continue to focus on strengthening of community based farm groups enabling members to increase agricultural yield and generate income for their families. The agro-forestry nursery established in 2014 has managed to propagate 7800 cocoa and palm oil seedlings; Transplantation of seedlings to farms to eight community-based farms will take place in 2015. Over a three year period, it is expected that seedling will mature with 60% of income generated from sale of products to be used to fund community development projects, while 40% will be turned over to the church for church development purposes. The program will continue to support the ongoing Women Savings and Loan Programs to build and strengthen savings and income for women and their families. This program which started its first cycle in February 2014 economically changed the lives of over Two Hundred and Fifty (250) women in various communities. Food production and processing schemes established in 2014 will continue to generate income for vulnerable families and fund community projects in 7 communities in the Bassa and Southwestern archdeaconries. The project will use community land to grow food crops that will then be sold in local markets. In some cases, crops will be processed before being sold. 40% of income generated will be used to fund community development projects. 40% of income generated will be used to purchase seeds and agricultural tools for community members participating in the project and 20% of the income generated will be used by the church to administer, manage and support the program. The Program was to a larger extent impacted by the ebola outbreak in Liberia where much of the planned activities for 2014 were implemented under difficult conditions that limited the free movement of staff and resources in outlying project operational areas. The Program has responded to the ebola emergency by providing much needed direct assistance (food, protection equipment and sanitary items), engagement in sensitization and awareness creation activities that target affected communities including those that were directly affected as a result of quarantine measures imposed both at individual household level and nationwide. As cases in the resurgence of the ebola are decreasing the Program&#x2019;s focus will be on the longer term recovery effort which will include the establishment and strengthening of emergency preparedness levels, direct livelihoods assistance to survivor families (savings groups, farm inputs) and continued guidance, support and counseling to those directly affected and the wider community enabling survivors to successfully integrate within their communities without any fear of stigma or alienation. In a way to mobilize Faith Networks and Infrastructure for positive action on Ebola prevention and care, the program will train faith leaders (both Muslims and Christian) on how best they can use their trusted position in a society on addressing stigma, counseling needs and empowering people in improving the quality of life. There will be first a Training of Trainers&#x2019; session in Sierra Leone, and the Trainees will later return and train a wider group of people (including other church staff in the region). The program will also provide assistance to 1000 Ebola Orphans in Bong and Cape Mount Counties that are of school age by providing some education materials (school bags, copy books, pens, pencils etc) to help their care givers. The Health Program NetsforLife works closely with the National Malaria Control Program (NMCP) at the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare in the reduction of Malaria morbidity and mortality rates. In 2014, the NFL program in collaboration with the Ministry of Health distributed sixty five thousand mosquito nets in River Cess, Sinoe, Grand Gedeh, Montserrado, Maryland, River Gee and Grand kru Counties, trained ninety volunteers and fifty community dwellers in River Cess County on Malaria Prevention Methods, conducted follow up on nets usage and sensitization on Malaria prevention to fifty thousand seven hundred (50,700) persons in Grand Gedeh, Sinoe and Montserrado Counties, Celebrated World Malaria Day in Montserrado County under the theme: &#x201C;Invest in the Future, Defeat Malaria&#x201D;. The program also signed a memorandum of understanding with CHAL to distribute one hundred and eighty-eight thousand, two hundred and seventy mosquito nets in Grand Gedeh, Sinoe and River Cess Counties in January 2015.</narrative>
