   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Following a strategic planning process that started in 2010, the Episcopal Church of the Philippines (ECP), and their community development arm, the Episcopal-CARE Foundation, have adopted an asset-based community development (ABCD) approach for their programming. The approach identifies the assets and resources of communities and considers these the building blocks of development. Any community desiring to partner with E-CARE must now undergo the ABCD process, and they will continue to accompany communities on this approach in 2015. Additionally, during 2015, E-CARE will work with several communities to implement the plans they came up with through ABCD processes last year. Along with this, E-CARE is working through their Receivers-to-Givers (R2G) policy, in which community groups give-back the development capital loaned to them, so that the funds can be passed on to another community. Working in each community, E-CARE also promotes natural farming techniques, in order to alleviate negative health and environmental effects from chemical use, allow producers to reach new organic markets, and increase resilience of productive to a changing climate. During this year, E-CARE will also be continuing to strengthen the capacity of the Foundation, as well as build on opportunities to market and sell products made in the communities they work with.</narrative>
