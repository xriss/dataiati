   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The objective of the Colombia Clean Energy Development Project is to assist Colombia in increasing electricity generation capacity from non-conventional renewable energy sources and energy savings in the industrial sector with mobilization of private investment. The proposed project will offer a combination of technical assistance and credit-enhancement products to help scale up renewable energy and energy efficiency. On the technical assistance side, the project will support in the design of auctions and in improving and modernizing market and commercial rules to create a competitive, level-playing field for renewable energy. Under the credit-enhancement provision, the World Bank will guarantee Financiera de Desarrollo Nacional (FDN) for innovative credit enhancement and risk mitigation products so as to unlock significant private investments. The project is expected to mobilize US$ 1,015 million of total investment in renewable energy and energy efficiency, including about US$ 755 million from the private sector. The proposed project has high transformation potential as it will, through risk mitigation products, serve as a demonstration effect, mobilizing private capital to accelerate the deployment of renewable energy and energy efficiency projects in the country.</narrative>
