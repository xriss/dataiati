       <narrative xml:lang="EN">Two meeting notes have been developed. The notes provide a context update and a summary of agreed actions for civil society actors to collaborate on. Following the civil society actor meeting in June 2017, sixteen priority areas and action points were identified for joint implementation over a six month period. In order to facilitate this, working groups were formed &#x2013; each with an identified focal point to ensure actions are followed up and completed. These working groups will also support future collaboration and joint working between civil society actors. The working groups are focused on the following themes: knowledge management, strengthening existing society mechanisms for coordination, national level advocacy targeting political actors, and international advocacy. The third meeting for YR 1 was rescheduled to the first quarter of YR 2 due to unavailability of participants in the originally planned period.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">Two meetings were held with civil society actors to discuss follow up actions on collaboration and coordination among civil society actors. A total of 53 actors (20 female, 33 male) participated in the meetings. Civil society actors discussed and agreed on joint responses towards issues related to peace and stability. A list of actions was developed and roles assigned for implementation. The program has developed an advocacy strategy that guides its engagement with regional and international actors on key issues.</narrative>

     <narrative xml:lang="EN">A CAG is a group of 12-25 people drawn from surrounding communities - who will participate in the participatory action research process, receive training and small grants and mentoring from the programme. Their role will include research analysis, action planning and implementation of initiatives to address locally identified issues. They will in addition be community focal points for conflict resolution. Participatory Action Research will be carried out by the CAGS on a bi-annual basis in order to identify human security issues that affect the communities. Findings from the research will be shared with the community during discussions that will be led by the CAGS. Community communication system will use short messaging on mobile phones to pass on information human security issues. The messages will be sent to the partner server who will then compile them into a report that will be shared with the CAGS. Using PAR and CCS information, CAGS will hold periodic discussions to identify responses to identified human security issues. The indicator tracks the use of PAR and CCS information in these discussions .Use of information can be but is not limited to using the information generated through CCS&amp;PAR to start a discussion, including an agenda item that relates to APR/CCS findings, presenting PAR findings and the CCS report to members in order to inform their opinions and suggestions. The indicator only tracks scheduled CAG discussions and does not include adhoc discussions</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">Initial findings from the community level assessments (CLAs) highlighted the need for sustainable, equitable and representative community-level structures to support development, promote cohesion, limit conflict and contribute to stability. Existing community structures fail to represent all members of the community and can be biased and political in nature. The CLAs have also indicated a willingness and clear request by targeted communities for support in identifying and addressing conflict and security issues. Further information will be collected and reported against this Sub-Outcome area in Year 2; activities and outputs that contribute to this sub-outcome commenced in Q4 of Year 1. Any delays in Year 1 as a result of the CLAs are expected to be recovered in Year 2; up to 6 CAGs will be established in Year 2. Related PAR activities will also take place as planned alongside the establishment of CAGs. Indicator figures for the related outputs will be modified to account for this change in implementation timeline and structure.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">The formation of Community Action Groups (CAGs) began in Year 2 leading to the formation of seven community action groups. The formation of the groups was preceded by consultations involving representatives from the local administration,farmers, women, youth, IDPs, refugees and CBOs to develop a shared understanding around the CAGs, their role, and processes/guidelines for establishing them. In some areas, existing groups are working with the project to either strengthen or include aspects of safety, security, conflict and gender sensitivity in their existing initiatives.</narrative>

     <narrative xml:lang="EN">According to the OECD DAC, &#x201C;[CSOs] can be defined to include all non-market and non-state organizations outside of the family in which people organize themselves to pursue shared interests in the public domain. Examples include community-based organizations and village associations, environmental groups, women&#x2019;s rights groups, farmers&#x2019; associations, faith-based organizations, labour unions, co-operatives, professional associations, chambers of commerce, independent research institutes and the not-for-profit media.&#x201D; CSOs are voluntary organizations with governance and direction coming from citizens or constituency members, without significant government-controlled participation or representation. This is a self-reported indicator. Skills and Knowledge to be passed on will be determined using a survey administered to civil society group members.

In Quarter 2 (July to September 2017) an additional 65 civil society actors participated in discussions on select topics related to the context analysis developed during the June 2017 civil society actor meeting. Discussions on the impact of national and international collaboration between civil society actors were held with a view of improving coordination and collaboration between civil society. A paper on the impact of regional and international collaboration was developed and shared with eight civil society actors. Discussions were also held with three parliamentarians. The discussions centered on exploring their views on constitution making, access to health and addressing violence against women. The discussions are informing advocacy campaigns and messages planned by the program that will target parliamentarians.</narrative>

Participants also validated and appended the topics and sub-topics that the system would be used to share information on, thereby giving more relevance to their community information needs.

Early on in Year 1 the project team understood there would be need to review the proposed timeline of activities and give priority focus to undertaking the CLAs and related sensitisation and relationship building activities. This included providing enough time to secure the right project team members to participate in the CLAs (and future project interventions). These changes were communicated to the Netherlands MFA. Further delays in completing the CLAs, largely the result of security issues and challenges with permissions, has meant some delays to activities related to the outcome; additionally, a project team review held in October 2017 identified that a more strategic and risk adverse approach to implementation would be to roll out the Community Correspondent System (CCS) in all the identified locations prior to setting up Community Action Groups (CAGs).</narrative>

     <narrative xml:lang="EN">Programme beneficiaries refers to members of community action groups (CAGS), surrounding communities served by the CAGs and members of civil society organizations directly targeted by the programme. The project will monitor the indicator; however the project does not have any direct activities that will contribute to its achievement. This indicator is being monitored under Outcome 1 but has the potential to be relevant to Outcome 2. However under this programme none of the programme beneficiaries will receive direct support to build their capacity to influence formal and informal authorities. Programme beneficiaries targeted under Outcome 2 will receive direct support to build their capacity to influence national platforms (which do not necessarily include authorities), programme beneficiaries targeted under Outcome 1 may indirectly have the opportunity to interact with and build relationships with local authorities. &#x2018;the capacity to influence&#x2019; refers to the perception of respondents, i.e. to what extent they feel they are capable and effective in their efforts towards policy influencing, lobbying and advocacy. &#x2018;Formal and informal human security authorities&#x2019; refers to those bodies from the security sector that are targeted through the programme (e.g. the local police and/or a community security mechanisms ) , NOT the entire security sector.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">There is improvement in relationships between local authorities and communities-a case in point where in one community, community members formed a committee to advocate to local authorities to improve social services. This is significant because the community had not had interaction with local authorities before because they did not have trust in the system and believed that they could not influence authorities. Communities have also initiated campaigns to address social problems for example; a campaign was implemented by a community in response to a disease outbreak-further evidence of improved cohesion and collaboration.</narrative>

However, they will begin in the second half of year 2 following the completion of the community level assessments (CLA) within the programme implementation areas. Identification of locations, and selection of relevant PAR and CCS facilitators, among others required a detailed understanding of the context. The CLA process has been completed in the target locations, and CCS local level facilitators have been trained to roll out this component gradually. The target value for year 2 has therefore been increased to 9 to include the YR 1 target.</narrative>
