  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">ESDC will not be core supported during the bridging year 2018. A new assessment will be done in 2019. The overall aim is  to enable disadvantaged formal and informal women and men groups to engage &#x200E;actively in socio-economic activities.  The project tackles two of their own strategic objectives. Strategic &#x200E;Objective 1: Socio-economic organisations have an economic and social role within their community.  &#x200E;Strategic Objective 4: ESDC achieves its objectives efficiently and effectively and complies with good &#x200E;governance standards.  Within rural sustainable development, ESDC supports women and farmer-&#x200E;based organisations, including cooperatives, mainly in organisational and business development and &#x200E;creating enabling environment. Also, ESDC supports sustainable farming and food production as well &#x200E;as building farmers&apos; resilience to fight poverty&apos;s root causes that threaten Palestinian small &#x200E;producers because of the occupation and enabling them to adapt to climate change.  ESDC will work to &#x200E;build the organisational and business capacities of member-based organisations, including &#x200E;cooperatives. ESDC promotes organised member-based organisations, and &#x200E;will apply a non-discrimination and meaningful participation approach in order &#x200E;to instill ownership and transparency among the target group ensuring the active participation of existing and potential &#x200E;members and the engagement of women and men, girls and boys who live in poverty and &#x200E;whose rights are violated, who work together to reach common goals.  The expected results are: &#x200E;
&#x2022; Member-based organisations and initiatives adopt internal policies that are consistent with &#x200E;good governance best practices. &#x200E;
&#x2022; Member-based organisations and initiatives operate businesses and services that are &#x200E;relevant to their mission and members &#x200E;
&#x2022; Women, youth and farmers actively engage in social economy organisations and pioneering &#x200E;&#x200E;cooperatives
&#x2022; &#x200E; Small-scale producers are organised in a socio-&#x200E;economic groups, to protect their rights and &#x200E;develop their businesses and achievements 
&#x2022; ESDC has an effective planning and monitoring system
&#x2022; Institutionalized gender mainstreaming in all aspects of operations.</narrative>
