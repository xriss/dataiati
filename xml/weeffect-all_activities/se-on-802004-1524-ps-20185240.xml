   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project has targeted good governance by training 100 members from targeted coops (90 women and 10 men) on designing and conducting advocacy campaigns. In addition, 10 women members in Anabta Cooperative for Consuming were trained in quality control in making and preserving &#x201C;makdous&#x201D;, which is a product they already produce and sell at a rate of 400kgs every week. The training was to ensure a consistent quality along every step of the production. 180 members participated in 6 exchange visits between coops and selected coops participated in 4 national expos to market their products and network with relevant stakeholders and other coops. 230 coop members and citizens in general engaged in drama sketches that handled the importance of collective decision and policy-making at coops. Furthermore, the project supported 5 coops in tools and equipment that improve services or products already provided/ delivered/ produced by the coops and it was clear from the beginning how they will positively contribute to the value chain and increase coop members&#x2019; satisfaction and quality of services and products.</narrative>
