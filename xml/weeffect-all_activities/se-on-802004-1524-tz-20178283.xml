   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project, which begun in January 2017 will last until end of 2019. The first year has ensured networking efforts - ensuring the project is known in the operational areas and by relevant stakeholders. The necessary studies have been concluded and mobilization of various stakeholders and target groups begun well. So far, gender equality champions and promoters of women and youth political representation have been mobilized and networks are growing. 
As a result, some women and youth groups which were dormant have been revived and now women and youth are discussing issues concerning their representation in decision making. Policy makers and organs responsible for ensuring parity in political representation such as political parties, Ministries of youth and gender, the office of the registrar of political parties and the office of the president at the regional levels have been engaged in ensuring that women and youth are accorded the necessary support to effectively participate in the 2019/20 elections. As a result, there is intense engagement among stakeholders on the subject matter and hopefully more results will be registered as the project moves into its second and third years. The project alongside other stakeholders has made inputs into the political parties bill which was published in November 2018 ready for discussion in parliament. The project was promoting express provisions to ensure increased participation of women and youth. These were not taken up entirely and shall wait for deliberations in parliament o see what changes will be effected. The project held a meeting with women and youth members of parliament this month (November) to lobby them to ensure that they support passage / inclusion of women/youth supportive clauses in the bill. In all the Constituencies, Wards, villages covered by the project, at least there is a woman or youth vying for a leadership position. The women and youth platforms have been strengthened and are acting as empowerment and strategizing platforms for women.</narrative>
