   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The organisation has recruited 58 (37 F &amp; 21 M) new members and one local network (Longido ward ) is in the process of being formalized as new group . The organisation organised for a Tree planting campaign in Monduli , one of the driest district in the region where 124 members Participated. Over 46849 trees were planted. The organisation has facilitated formation of 11 VICOBA (VSLA) groups who have already been trained on the methodology. So far the groups have mobilized savings of Tshs. 12,056,500 and given out loans amounting to Tshs. 4,325,000. The organisation facilitated some of its members to participate in an Agribusiness Expo as a result twelve (12) beekeeping groups were linked with a reliable market during the event. The groups are now selling 1 kg of honey at Tshs 10,000 after value addition compared to initial farmgate price of Tshs 6000 per kg. The organisation has been supporting farmers to adopt appropriate SALM practices and more so green technologies as a way to mitigate against climate change effects and to support their farming activities . As a result 16 farmers are now using biogas in their households as fuel, 3 households are using wind energy for lighting, 4 farmers using solar powered poultry incubators and 11 farmers using solar powered irrigation pumps.</narrative>
