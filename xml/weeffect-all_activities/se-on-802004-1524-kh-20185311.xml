   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project trained 89 agriculture cooperative (AC) members (78 women) in climate resilient agriculture techniques (chicken prototype, vaccination, and vegetable prototype). After training, the project supported 26 model farmers to develop climate resilient chicken prototypes, vegetable, and dragon fruit. In the chicken production model, the project introduced systematic production. For example, the project formed group of producing chicken eggs that supply eggs to a group producing baby chickens that sells baby chickens to a group producing chicken for meat. Meanwhile, the project facilitated self-help group (SHG) members in Oruesey Kandal commune to establish new AC with 36 members of whom 30 are women with USD 982 of capital. This Oruesey Kandal agriculture cooperative, headed by a woman, formed a women group of 21 members. On the other hand, the project facilitated the existing 26 self-help groups/Village Savings and Loans Associations (SHG/VSLA) and two AC with 369 members (273 women=74%) and with USD 140,786 of revolving funds. Besides, three AC that comprised 304 members (208 females = 68%) have USD 45,689 of capital. The project facilitated three women groups (one per each project site). The project facilitated women to conduct value chain in order to identify their market-based businesses. After that, the project facilitated women to develop their business plan for cake production and trained them in traditional cake production (Thang Noun Cake). They gained USD 250 of loan each from AC credit service. On the other hand, the project discusses the trade mark for wine, traditional cake, and pig feet production with the Provincial Department of Agriculture, Forestry, Fishery  (PDAFF) and the Provincial Department of Commerce (PDOC). The project facilitated seven farmers to produce organic rice wine. The project facilitated 24 farmer women and men to participate in gender equality forum in Kampong Thom provinces. 12 AC members (4 members per each commune) to participate in the process of Commune Investment Plan (CIP) development. As a result, some concerns of AC such as the gender issue, agriculture, livestock, health, and village road construction were included in the CIP. The project supports model farmers and entrepreneurs to identify markets and prepare market business plans to sell their products. The markets are Community-Based Eco-tourism (CBET) site, schools, village shops for traditional cakes. Moreover, the project facilitated AC executives to participate in synergise workshop on AC enterprise and management in Kampong Thom province. They learnt about success AC business from private company and from other AC, especially the rice export company AMRU.</narrative>
