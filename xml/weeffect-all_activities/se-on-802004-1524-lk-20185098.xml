   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project started by forming and strengthening 11 cooperatives. To ensure the project&apos;s smooth functioning and performance, 11 strategic plans were developed for those cooperatives and their by-laws reviewed as well. Training programs were conducted on different disciplines such as cooperative values and principles, by-laws and constitution of the cooperative. Since the project also benefits the enhancement of youth employment, a youth career guidance training program was conducted as well. The gender committees were formed under each cooperative, and provided awareness sessions as well for the committee leaders on gender base violence and women rights CEDOW convention. Seven women were selected from each cooperative to create the model home gardens and provided exposure visit and basic training on developing the model home gardens (77 home gardens). Further, the training sessions were conducted for the small-scale farmers to improve their knowledge, skills and capacities on good agricultural practices. The good governance and good governance tool introductory sessions were conducted for the cooperative leaders in order to increase the capacity of the village cooperatives and to develop management, leadership and good governance. Further, the collection of baseline data was completed.</narrative>
