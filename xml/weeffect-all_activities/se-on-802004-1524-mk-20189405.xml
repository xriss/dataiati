   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The implementation of the new project &quot;Institutional Support to the Rural Development Network of the Republic of Macedonia and its Members&quot;  started in September 2018. The project is implemented by the We Effect partner Rural Development Network Macedonia (RDN of RM). In order to ensure that the project will address the main challenges and needs of RDN of RM and its members, during the inception phase of the project 2 workshops on Problems and Solutions (P&amp;S) were realized. The P&amp;S workshops provided the opportunity to the members of RDN of RM to be directly involved in the planning process of the project and not to be involved just in the implementation. On 25 October, based on the findings from the P&amp;S workshops, a LFA workshop was realized aiming to redefine the LFA and updating of the baseline, ensuring that the project will address the needs of RDN of RM and its members. During the Inception phase, RDN of RM in collaboration with Federation of Farmers in the Republic of Macedonia (FFRM) organised the celebration of the International Rural Women&apos;s Day. The &#x201C;Declaration on improvment of social and economic position of rural women&#x201D; was signed by the Minister for Labour and Social Policy, the Minister for Agriculture, Forestry and Water Economy, the Federation of Farmers in the Republic of Macedonia and the RDN of RM during the event. In addition, a public discussion on the topic &quot;The role of women in rural areas - their problems and challenges&quot; was organised as a part of the official event (124 participants / 108 women). The implementation of the project will continue in the period 2019 - 2020 according to the defined LFA and the Operational Plan.</narrative>
