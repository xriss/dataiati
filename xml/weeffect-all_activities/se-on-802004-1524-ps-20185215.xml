   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Supporting PUHC Strategy: Promoting Dignity and Resilience</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project aims at women&#x2019;s increased resilience through access to land, financial and &#x200E;production &#x200E;resources. This will be done through strengthening PUHC in order to address the needs and rights of their &#x200E;members and communities, especially women, in addition to its active members in 2017 (38 Housing coops). Additionally, PUHC will target low income working women &#x200E;to form 3 women housing cooperatives and join the union. It will also encourage men-dominated cooperatives to &#x200E;increase women members&#x2019; real participation and representation. In regards to PUHC staff, PUHC will give &#x200E;priority to women candidates when hiring staff.&#x200E;
In 2018 the focus will be on strengthening PUHC&#x2019;s organisational development, and spreading democratic &#x200E;and participatory practices. This includes  increasing PUHC&#x2019;s membership base, further implementing &#x200E;sound monitoring and evaluation practices, and ensure transparent decision-making (properly planned and &#x200E;documented meetings on various levels). In addition, PUHC will conduct 6 training sessions for PUHC new &#x200E;board members and staff on coops concept, governance Leadership and different management skills &#x200E;&#x200E;(WB&amp;G). New board of Director was elected and half of the Board members are new. These new board &#x200E;members will require training on these concepts together with new members of staff.&#x200E;
The second component will be strengthening business capacities and service delivery of PUHC and its &#x200E;members through the following:&#x200E;
&#x2022; Upgrading and implementing of annual work plan for PUHC and develop business plans for its &#x200E;members: PUHC will support 5 member coops with business development services such business &#x200E;plans to develop members&#x2019; business capacities and assist them in establishing housing models. &#x200E;Brainstorming workshops will be necessary to introduce the idea of business planning to the coops &#x200E;members and exchange knowledge of the current situation of the coops. Furthermore, the business &#x200E;plan will help the coops to look for new investment opportunities. &#x200E;
&#x2022; Facilitate member coops access to service providers:  PUHC will communicate with service &#x200E;providers such as financial services providers and sign at least three MOU between PUHC and its &#x200E;members with the service providers to support the implementation of at least part of the coop &#x200E;business plan.&#x200E;
&#x2022; Provide consultation hours for PUHC and its members: PUHC will provide consultation services for &#x200E;its members such as Architecture consultation, legal, financial and administrative consultation. A &#x200E;legal, financial and administrative manual will be designed, printed and distributed to the coop &#x200E;members.&#x200E;
Third component will be promoting women equal rights of access to housing opportunities and &#x200E;participation at PUHC and its members. PUHC continuously works in encouraging women participation in &#x200E;PUHC BoD, at the moment PUHC has 5 women in BoD and at least 25% representation in the General &#x200E;Assembly. PUHC also encourages the formation of women housing cooperatives. &#x200E;
PUHC will increase women participation and representation in PUHC and leadership positions, through an &#x200E;advocacy campaign as follows:&#x200E;
&#x2022; Conduct workshops with middle and low income working women such as teachers, on the &#x200E;importance of forming housing cooperatives and joining the union in three different districts &#x200E;&#x200E;(Hebron, Ramallah, and Nablus) and in Gaza strip.&#x200E;
&#x2022; Provide incentives for women enrolment (to be member) in PUHC member coops.&#x200E;
&#x2022; Conduct training sessions to PUHC women cooperative on Cooperative development curriculum.&#x200E;
&#x2022; Conduct training sessions for women coops on relevant training topics (leadership of coop &#x200E;organisations, management skills, communication skills, negotiation skills and other relevant &#x200E;topics).&#x200E;
&#x2022; Communicate with local media and networks to share the experience and importance of forming &#x200E;women housing cooperatives in local TV and social media. &#x200E;
Further, PUHC will dedicate about 50% of project resources to women empowerment. &#x200E;
PUHC is an active member of Owneh, an advocacy group that advances the interests of the cooperative &#x200E;moment in Palestine. Other We Effect partners (ARIJ, ESDC, and PACU) are active in this group.&#x200E;
The programme level Steering Committee is also composed of all We Effect Palestine partners. These &#x200E;meetings follow a hands-on, practical approach to examine ways that We Effect projects complement &#x200E;each other. In 2018, PUHC will actively participate in these bi-monthly meetings. In addition, PUHC staff &#x200E;and BoD members are able to participate in joint activities with the other partners in any field related to &#x200E;PUHC.&#x200E;</narrative>
