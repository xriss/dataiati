   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In Anuradhapura and Batticaloa, both implementing partners have achieved results in forming cooperatives in the target locations: seven cooperatives in Anuradhapura district and five cooperatives in Batticaloa district. The membership of the cooperatives district-wise, up to now recorded 295 (women 244 and men 51) in Anuradhapura district and 361 (women 324 and men 37) in Batticaloa district. The project launching programs were conducted at each district level with the participation of We Effect regional office delegates, country office staff and government stakeholders. Moreover, aligning with the project launches, first steering committee meeting has taken place. Savings started at the cooperative level (savings amounts to USD 657 in Batticaloa and USD 2116 in Anuradhapura). Further, the training programs were conducted on different disciplines such as cooperative values and principles, thrift and credit and awareness sessions on environmental issues and preparation of disaster mitigation plans.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project is implemented in 6 Divisional Secretariat Divisions in Anuradhapura and Batticaloa districts. The co-applicant of the project are Rajarata Praja Kendraya (RPK), implementing the project in Anuradhapura District, and Kaviya Self Development Women Centre implementing the project in Batticaloa district. The project aims to contribute to inclusive and sustainable socio economic development of marginalized and war affected communities in North Central and Eastern Sri Lanka. This will be achieved through the implementation of an inclusive and sustainable cooperative approach focusing on socio-economic development of targeted communities with improved living conditions of 80% of 1,744 women and 414 girls, 392 men and 403 boys through reduction of their poverty levels. Empowerment of communities in cooperative structure with increased livelihood opportunities and access to services and resources will contribute towards poverty reduction. Recognition of women will increase through empowerment of women in socio-economic aspects, and sensitization of the men and youths to work towards reduction of incidences of violence among these communities. The development of coops and empowerment of the target groups is expected to have an extended outreach on final beneficiaries, namely, 11,470 community members (6,167 women and 5,303 men) in 26 villages. The Action will promote coops as independent actors and contributors for inclusive and sustainable socio-economic development in the two provinces.</narrative>
