   <narrative xml:lang="EN">PALM foundation, as a national level NGO working with the plantation sector in the country, aims to strengthen the Estate Worker Housing Cooperative Federation initiated in 2016. At the beginning of the project, the partner organisation had initial discussions with Plantation Human Development Trust (PHDT) about the tri-party memorandum of understanding (MOU), which will be signed by PALM foundation, PHDT and We Effect, in order to get a more clear understanding on the project and also to work with the plantation regions. The seven Estate Worker Housing Cooperative Societies (EWHCS) were selected for the project implementation and also selected three plantation estates/companies -Elpitiya Planation, Thalawakelle Plantation and Kelaniweli Plantation -with the recommendation of the PHDT, to implement the project. Due to the unexpected changes in the government the partner organisation could not get the access to the new plantation estates and presently working only with seven EWHCS.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project will be implemented by the PALM foundation, focusing on cooperative development of the plantation sector. PALM foundation, in a previous cycle of the country programme has worked to strengthen the 7 Estate Worker Housing Cooperatives and 4 villages in Nuwara Eliya district. In this programme cycle, the project will create a national level cooperative and district cooperative federations covering the seven plantation regions that represent 418 cooperatives in the entire country (Kandy, Nuwara Eliya, Badulla, Hatton, Rathnapura, Galle &amp; Kegalle) with a systematic 5-year long-term plan consisting of three main intervention areas: capacity development process (organisational development), cooperative business development and gender equality promotion. The proposed network system will widen the service level of cooperatives in community banking, social enterprises and marketing. The regional cooperative federations will directly assist to build up the capacity of primary cooperatives (EWHCS) to further strengthen their capacity in resolving and advocating to the most of social, economic and environmental rights denial in a collective manner. The project is expected to have a national level cooperative union and 7 district cooperative Federations established with the required technical and financial capacity, advocating to the member cooperatives enabling to extend the services in strengthening organisational, community banking and cooperative enterprise development capacities. The long-term impact of the project will be to have an active, well-functioning national and district cooperative federations constituted by the estate worker housing cooperatives of seven plantation regions in Sri Lanka.</narrative>
