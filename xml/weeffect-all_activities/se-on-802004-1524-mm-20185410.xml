   <narrative xml:lang="EN">&quot;Most farmers have gained a better understanding of the soil and crops, yields, gardens and how to select the quality seeds. Seasonal crop calendar will be applied. Their future Action Plan (AP) has been conducted in a participatory manner for individuals or groups for their business. They received training in small-scale household economy of home gardening business and in how to start-up a home business and avoid application/utilisation of chemicals and GMO seeds (genetically modified organism) in the agricultural production. Due to climate change, fertilizer treatment and crop growing do not work well, so to protect the members&#x2019; production climate resilience agricultural production trainings were conducted at the village court/meeting hall.
The project conducted training at the three project areas (Kayan and Tikegyi townships in Yangon region) and in Diak-U township of Bago region. The project provided gender awareness training and during the training the participants were asked to hold group discussions and then share experiences from their private lives and working environment, concerning various aspects of gender equality. At the end of each training the farmers as organisation members understood the need to share and practice, within their organisation as well as in the village development, cases to include more women participation.
Forming VSLA (Village Savings and Loans Association) groups: Daik-U township farmers of Bago region have now formed a VSLA group and at Kayan and Tikegyi townships of Yangon region VSLA groups are about to be formed, after coming to understand the benefits of the VSLA at their respective townships with women participation and gender equality, which would enhance women to be more independent and confident to participate in activities of cooperatives.  &quot;</narrative>
