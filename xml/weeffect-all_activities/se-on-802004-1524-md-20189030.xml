   <narrative xml:lang="EN">&#x2022; The number of women in the Board of National Farmers&apos; Federation Moldova (NFFM) has been increased. NFFM has a new Board elected by delegates of the General Assembly composed of 13 members, including 6 women from all regions. 
&#x2022; NFFM has succeeded to re-establish the presence in an autonomous administrative unit Gagauzia, which practically means an increased presence of NFFM on a national level. 
&#x2022; The micro-finance institution FARM CAPITAL, established with the support of NFFM, is fully functional, enabling access to loans with lower interest rates for rural women and youth. 
&#x2022; NFFM is actively involved in the introduction of the LEADER approach in Moldova, in the frame of the &quot;&quot;Facilitating Active Engagement of CSO in the agro-rural policy dialogue&quot;&quot;, funded by the Commission of the EU Delegation to Moldova. 
&#x2022; NFFM has been selected as one of the official national extension service providers (only 2 organisations were selected at first stage) by the Ministry of Agriculture for the future specialized trainings for farmers. Provision of extension services to the farmers is a practical income generating opportunity for NFFM that is directly contributing to the financial sustainability of the organisation. 
&#x2022; NFFM has submitted 20 proposals for improvement of the agricultural and RD policies in Moldova, out of which 50% are already approved by the Government of Moldova. 
&#x2022; An Octagon Assessment of NFFM was conducted in a workshop facilitated by We Effect. Based on the findings, an Action Plan for Organisational Development was developed, addressing the main issues identified. The implementation of the Action Plan will be followed by We Effect and NFFM.</narrative>
