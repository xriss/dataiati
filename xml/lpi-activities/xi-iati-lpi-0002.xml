   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Living Peace project seeks to achieve its goal by pursuing following objectives at five different levels: 1. Individuel Level: Men and women (spouses), healed of severe mental health and psychosocial problems, adopted positive non-violent coping strategies and experience greater personal efficacy to build meaningful relations with self and others. 2. Family Level: Reduced violence at home and restored peaceful partner relations create a safe and healthy environment for women, men and children. Reduction of violence use by men against their partners and children and increase gender equitable behaviours in the household create a safer environment for all members of the family. 3. Community Level: Restored community-based social support systems increase social cohesion between families, individuals and community structures resulting in higher levels of inclusion, and solidarity between community members. 4. Society Level: Congolese civil society organizations and public institutions of Police, Army and Health Care and religious leaders institutionalized the Living Peace approach in their services to adequately address the consequences of SGBV, promote positive masculinity and prevent (mainly) men getting involved in conflicts and/or (re)join armed groups. 5. Women Social and Economic Empowerment: Women, partners of male participants in Living Peace groups, enjoy greater social and economic autonomy with positive support of husbands that participated in Living Peace groups.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The goal of the proposed intervention is to achieve sustainable, gender-equitable peace at all levels of society in provinces of South Kivu, North Kivu and Ituri in eastern DRC by: 1. The overall goal of LPI is to reduce level of violence and build trust in the community by working with men through psychosocial support programs that will help them to end violence and adopt norms and values that support gender equality at all levels; &#x2028; 2. Promoting women socio-economic empowerment with positive support of husbands through an adaptation of the Living Peace methodology, (Journeys of Transformation).
