   <narrative xml:lang="EN">After the military operation in FATA agencies, the social service infrastructure including the health facilities have been destroyed especially in korram agency. The TDP returned families are deprived of quality PHC/MNCH services because of non-availability of infrastructure, lacking of health staff, medicines and other health supplies. The health information fabric is destroyed and potential diseases outbreak information is not existing in Korram Agency. Under the proposed project, SHED will fill the gaps in health services through revitalize and operationalize the health care system through mobile and static health care services, provision of pre-fabricated structure, necessary equipment, medicines for PHC ,psycho-social support and MNCH services in the following areas of central Kurram (suggested /endorsed by Agency Surgeon and Securities Agencies-Endorsement letter attached) of Kurram Agency:
1. Mian Kali, Masozai, Central Kurram
2. Nika Ziarat, Masozai, Central Kurram
3. Laky Kali, Masozai, Central Kurram
4. Hindu Kali on Dogar Road, Central Kurram

According to Agency Surgeon and security agencies, these areas have no health facilities. People of the area have to travel to Sadda for PHC services taking 3 to 4 hours to get there. The FATA health department/Pak Army authorities are committed to take them over in future to provide staff and other facilities)

SHED will install solarized pre-fabricated structure in fully damaged health facilities in order to make them operational. SHED will also form four health teams for holding free static amp mobile medical camps in the far away area of the catchment population of the areas. Each team will consist of 1 MO, 1 LHV, 1 MT, 2 SMs and 1 female Psychologist. Each Medical officer will be responsible to lead 1 health team. Total 704 Static ampMobile Medical Camps in all the 4 selected areas in 8 months period will be conducted and will reach to 32480 beneficiaries. The teams will conduct OPDs to examine 21120 patients under PHC, 7040 MNCH patients and will provide psycho-social counseling to 3520. The team will also provide MNCH services to the mothers/PLWs about ANC, PNC, safe delivery growth monitoring and will distribute 400 safe delivery kits and 400 new born baby kits on need basis. The reproductive health services will include family planning counseling, spacing between births and use of contraceptives etc. Referral mechanism will be established and strengthened with the nearby tertiary hospitals for complicated cases through ambulance service.

SHED will advocate for provision of vaccinator with Agency Health Office where the vaccinators are not available to ensure that children and PLWs are properly vaccinated in the target health facilities.

SHED social mobilization team will introduce the project to the local communities and form Health Advisory Committees (HACs), 2 for each health facility (male amp female) with membership from 8 to 10 in the catchment area of the selected health facilities. The HAC members will be trained on their role. 

SHED will conduct training to 20 Govt. health staff of the of the Agency health office in a day-long session on record keeping, medicine rationalization, Disease Early Warning System (DEWS) for early detection, notifying, response mechanism for outbreak with reporting and MNCH services. 

The Psychologist will provide counseling to patients suffering from stress situation in SMCs/MMCs. The acute stress cases will be referred to the nearest trauma centers for further treatment.

For sustainability, the pre-fabricated structure, solar system, medical equipment and furniture will be provided and will be handed over to the government line department after project completion to strengthen and support for provision of quality health services to the affected population. The staff of the health facilities will be trained on record keeping, medicine rationalization, patients&#x2019; management and DEWS reporting.</narrative>
