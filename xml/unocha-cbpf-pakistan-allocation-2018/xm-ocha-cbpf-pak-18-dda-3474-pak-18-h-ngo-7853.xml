   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Last phase of IDP&#x2019;s return to South Waziristan Agency was initiated in 2017, to Tehsil Ladha, Makeen and Shawal. According to the IDP return fact sheet as of 31st December 2017, total 16,998 registered families have been returned to Tehsil Ladha, Makeen and Shawal in 2017, while 4,926 families are still in displacement. Along with the registered caseload, un-registered IDPs families have also been returned to these tehsils.
In current scenario, most of the families have been returned to Tehsil Ladha and Makeen, while on the other hand, due to damaged infrastructure, and non-functional health facilities, the population facing sever concerns regarding the healthcare services, which is negatively impacting the sustainable return process. According to EHSAR&#x2019;s Assessment Report, the services delivery in health sector is lacking due to the insufficient resources with the government. The report also indicates that there are total 27 government health facilities in Tehsil Ladha and Makeen, but most of them are not functional, either due to damaged infrastructure or lacking in human resources. According to the preliminary findings of Vulnerability Assessment, 67% of the population are facing sever or moderate difficulties in accessing health facilities, while 62% of the population were not satisfied with the available health services. Furthermore, the VA report indicate that 37% of the PLWs never received medical help during their last pregnancy, while 51% of the deliveries have been done at homes. Overall, 88% of PLWs haven&#x2019;t been visited by LHWs in last three months. The report further indicates that 64% of children didn&#x2019;t vaccinated through EPI program. 
Keeping in view the heavy caseload, and the gaps identified, the need for the proposed intervention is much higher. The proposed project is designed to fill the gaps in the delivery of essential primary health care services including reproductive health and mother and child health care services to the recently returned population of South Waziristan Agency, by targeting 4 government health facilities. Through the proposed project 65,500 individuals will be assisted in 09 months with the following activities.
	Revitalization of health system in target areas through provision of Pre-fabricated health facilities (two) and then services delivery
	Minor Repair works in two health facilities and installation of small-scale solar system in targeted health facilities as alternate electric power generators. 
	Provision of medical equipment and necessary furniture to the targeted health facilities to ensure the smooth operations of PHC services
