   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Immediate humanitarian support to address the immediate critical WASH needs of returned population of Tehsils Ladha and Makeen, South Waziristan Agency (SWA) in FATA.</narrative>

  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">According to PHPF allocation strategy 2018, FATA remains one of the least developed regions in Pakistan having experienced man-made and natural disasters for many years. From 2008 to 2014 more than 5 million people were displaced from the FATA due to the security operations by the military against non-state armed groups. Government initiated the return process with assistance of humanitarian partners, and have facilitated 438,657 (93%) of the displaced families to return to FATA including 74,590 families to South Waziristan Agency (SWA), There remains a total of 29,059 families who are yet to return. 
Despite the efforts of government and humanitarian partners in providing safe drinking water, half of the people are using unprotected water sources (i.e. canals, rivers, open wells, ponds, springs, etc.). Poor sanitation, lack of water, low water quality, and inappropriate hygiene practices are detrimental to the health of school-aged children. The physical environment and cleanliness of school facilities significantly affects the health, attendance rates, and well-being of children. Disease spreads rapidly where hand-washing facilities and soap are not available, and where toilets are in poor condition. A lack or limited supply of electricity limits the operation of existing water supply schemes, while the rocky terrain makes hand pumps generally ineffective. The capacity of FATA line departments is also insufficient due to limited technical staff and presence at the agency level, making it harder to ensure sustainability of current initiatives. WASH cluster KP / FATA and, IVAP detailed needs assessment analysis of SWA shows 55,728 people in South Waziristan require immediate assistance in restoration of drinking water supply 37,155 people require assistance in terms of sanitation and 84,432 people require awareness on suitable hygiene practices.
CARE assessment findings confirms WASH facilities and services are the critical and immediate needs of return populations in SWA. Currently, the communities are heavily relying on unsafe drinking water sources and available water is insufficient and inadequate in-terms quality and quantity. Absence of sanitation facilities and services have led to open defecation practices and poor hygiene conditions resulting in increased incidence of waterborne diseases.
In order to meet the identified critical immediate and urgent needs, CARE will focus on interventions outlined below, 
1- Rehabilitation of 07 existing damaged/affected water supply systems named Zawar Killi, Shaga Bromi Khel,Shabi Khel, Mishta, Landi Khel Shaktoi, Zodai Shaktoi in Tehsil Ladha and  Shaktoi Chalarai and Zair sar in Tehsil Makeen. Provision of drinking water to school children and patients through 04 drinking water supply schemes in institution (schools and health facilities).
2- Installation of 15 communal hand pumps to improve access to quality and sufficient quantity of drinking water. 
4- Provision of water 04 facilities Rehabilitation of existing water supply systems, rehabilitation of wells and installation of  08 hand pumps) in the institutions
5- Provision of sanitation facilities (73 latrines and hand washing places) in the institutions 
6- Hygiene promotion campaign and session in the schools 
7- Water quality testing by using DelAgua water quality testing kit and Pakistan Council of Research in Water Resources - PCRWR laboratory and development of water safety plans in line with social gender inclusive approach. 
8- Implementation of PHAST, community mobilization that is culturally appropriate, secure, user friendly and gender appropriate. (Provision of 1000 sanitation kit and cash for work @PKR 5,000 for latrines construction).
