  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project will provide improved WASH services in 4 Govt. Schools (Both Girls and Boys) and 4 Health Facilities through new installation of water supply schemes (Solar Pressure Pumps) where possible, feasible and appropriate, construction of latrines and provision of improved hygienic hand washing places. Each school and health facility will be reached respectively for the provision of clean drinking water source, construction of latrines and structure for hand washing. The designed structure for latrines in schools will be 3 stance whereas in health facilities there will a separate latrines clearly marked for both males and females. In construction of latrines especially in health facilities accessible toilet along with essential accessories are designed to accommodate people with physical disabilities.
To maintain the hygienic condition of constructed latrine each target school and health facility will be provided latrine cleaning kits which will help with reduction of odor in the latrine and also reduce chances of vector breeding that could lead to fecal oral contamination and related diseases such as diarrhea and malaria. In each constructed latrine in schools and health facilities a separate cleaning kit will be provided. A total 20 latrine cleaning kits (4x3=12 schools +4x2=8 health facilities) will be provided.
In addition to provision of clean drinking water and sanitation facilities in schools and health facilities, the project is aiming to organize 5 trainings for teacher and health facilities staff on hygiene promotion. 75 individuals (25 health staff+ 50 teachers) will be trained on improved hygiene practices. To improve the personal hygiene practices of school children the project plans to target 1,440 school children both girls and boys through school specific hygiene campaigns in 4 girls and boys&#x2019; schools by using CHAST approach. Sessions will focus on children representing a cluster of households, different social background, economic groups and age.
Also PRDS plans to provide humanitarian assistant on war steps basis to the return family of South Waziristan Agency through rehabilitation of 9 communal water schemes. In addition to the convenient access of return families to safe and clean drinking water sources, 1000 return families will be provided sanitation kits for basic latrines along with cash for work support to make sure the returnees with construction of their latrines. The provision of sanitation kit will minimize the health risks associated with open defecation and will enable returnees to construct their own household latrine on a self-help basis that is sustainable and contributes to longer-term development goals. 
Clean water alone will not prevent water and sanitation related diseases. In the same target zones as water and sanitation interventions 14000 beneficiaries will be reached through mass awareness on hygiene education using PHAST techniques. Apart of awareness sessions/campaign on hygiene education, 1000 family hygiene kits will be distributed to ensure the return families with improved hygiene at an individual and household level.)
The project has been introduced with the concerned departments and they endorsed PRDS with a list of Schools and Health facilities for the delivery of proposed WASH service. (Letters of endorsement by the departments along with lists of schools and health facilities are uploaded in document tab of GMS
Likewise the recommended list of schools and health facilities by the agency concerned departments, the communal schemes which are being proposed for the rehabilitation have been prioritized by the political administration of South Waziristan Agency. endorsement letter is uploaded in the document tab of GMS)</narrative>
