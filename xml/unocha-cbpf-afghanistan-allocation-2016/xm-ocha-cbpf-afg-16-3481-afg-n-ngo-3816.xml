   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The overall objective of the action is reducing incidence of mortality and morbidity related to acute malnutrition in children aged 0 to 59 months and pregnant and lactating women by improving their nutritional status through access to therapeutic and targeted supplementary feeding programes. The program will be implemented in Batikote, Behsud, Jalabad city, Khogiane, Rodat and Surkh road districts of Nangarhar province where the high number of returnees and IDP are reported. If the need will arise in other districts of Nangarhar some of the activities will be shifted to those districts of greater concerns.  The proposed action will achieve this objective, by addressing acute malnutrition amongst pregnant and lactating women and SAM and MAM in children under 5yrs old, through scale up the coverage of nutrition IMAM services in 23 HFs and increasing the access to nutrition services through community outreach by nutrition mobile teams. Through this project life-saving treatment services are provided including host communities to additional 6008 children aged 0-59 months with SAM, 7883 children aged 6-59 months with MAM and 1500 PLW with acute malnutrition. The need will arise in other districts of Nangarhar some of the activities will be shifted to those districts of greater concerns.
The key activities of this action will be based around two objectives.  The first objective, which focuses on treatment of acute malnutrition in children aged 0 to 59 months and pregnant and lactating women will involve the following activities: community mobilization, screening, TSFP, OTP, and referral of SAM with complication cases to the Stabilization Center (SC) and TFUs. This will be implemented across 40 static health facilities. Three Nutrition Mobile Teams will deploy to reach returnees and IDPs living in remote villages in the mentioned district. The NMTs will staff by one female and male health professional. Each team will cover two district remote villages. Second objective, which focuses on prevention will achieve through increased knowledge and practices by mothers/caregivers, promotion of infant and young child feeding practices and multi micronutrient supplementation. Taking into account the extra staff workload in the Basic Health Centres (BHCs), there is a need to have one additional female (separate from MoPH staff establishment) to specifically provide nutritional care to the targeted beneficiaries, therefore an additional female staff will be recruited for each of the 40 HFs in target districts where OTP and TSFP will be implemented. Nutrition female staff will be trained for 5 days on IMAM including IYCF and will provide individual counselling to mothers with infants on breastfeeding practices .
Supplies: AADA will ensure uninterrupted supply of health facilities and NNTs with food commodities and screening equipment. The WFP Area Office (AO) will supply food requirement directly to the stores. UNICEF will deliver therapeutic food to province capital and then it will deliver by AADA to target HFs.
To contribute to more sustainable practices, 600 members of Female Health Action Group (FHAG) will be trained to conduct Nutrition Education Rehabilitation Session (NERS) at the village&#x2019;s level. 150 Mother groups are established in hosting villages of returnees and IDPs.  The aim of mother&#x2019;s group is to enable mothers to provide nutrition care to children (6-59 months) with MAM using locally available nutritious food, to prevent further deterioration of children nutritional status. 
748 CHWs (381 male and 367 female) and 37 CHSs will be receiving three days refresher training on IMAM basics to enable them to support nutrition screening (using MUAC) for children between 6 and 59 months, and PLW  at community level and referring them either to the static HFs and NMTs. A team of consisting two staff will be assign to conduct screening of the returnees on the border and refer malnourished children to the nearest OTP/TSFP sites.</narrative>
