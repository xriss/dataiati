   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Food security and livelihood support for the most vulnerable natural disaster and conflict affected households in Kunar Province</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">RI proposes a life-saving intervention that will provide immediate support in the form of emergency food combined with a longer term livelihood intervention that allows households to regain autonomy and break cyclical patterns of aid dependency. Decades of conflict in Kunar province have undermined communities&#x2019; resilience, meaning that many families are unable to survive shocks caused by natural disaster or conflict, have no savings and are not able to cope without access to their livelihoods. In order to ensure that displaced populations survive the initial shock caused by conflict and natural disaster, RI will provide an emergency food kit in-kind/ or in cash. In order to help families recover and thrive longer term, RI will provide agriculture kits in-kind/ or in cash &#x2013; which can nominally be used to purchase agricultural in-puts for re-planting. Gap analysis undertaken by the FSAC cluster has indicated the following food security needs for natural disaster affected communities in Kunar province are: 2,780 individuals (397 households) in need of emergency food, as well as 2,780 individuals (397 households) requiring emergency livelihood support. Similar numbers have been affected by outbreaks of conflict in Kunar province &#x2013; with 1,883 individuals (269) households requiring emergency food, and 2,002 individuals (286 households) requiring emergency livelihood support. Target beneficiary numbers have been calculated on the basis that beneficiaries in need of emergency food are the same as those that will receive livelihood support &#x2013; therefore to avoid double counting, in total RI would support 2,780 natural disaster affected individuals, and 2,002 conflict affected individuals (some conflict affected beneficiaries have already received food assistance, and so would only receive livelihood support). 
The food security program in Kunar province would support households that have been affected in the last six months by natural disaster or displaced by conflict to supplement meager diets through cash for food kits designed to help them survive the winter and replant destroyed agriculture. The decision for cash/in-kind support will be determined by a market assessment at project inception, though RI expects, from previous market assessments in the province that markets are functioning and cash will be the most appropriate modality. Beneficiary selection criteria will be in line with the FSAC guidelines, and will target the most vulnerable households that have been displaced in the last six months, who have severely damaged land with no remaining assets or capacity to cope, or landless/ small holder subsistence farmers with access to land for re-cultivation. Current assessments show that the majority of need is in Asadabad, the provincial centre of Kunar, as well as flood affected areas of Watapur district. However, RI has access in the districts of Chawky, Narang, Watapur, Khaskunar and Sarkani, and will be prepared to respond in these areas should the initial assessment show need in these areas. This proposal has been reviewed by the FSAC cluster to ensure alignment with FSAC cluster technical guidelines and coverage of priority geographical areas. The FSAC cluster has provided RI with a letter of support which has been uploaded under &apos;supporting documents&apos;.</narrative>
