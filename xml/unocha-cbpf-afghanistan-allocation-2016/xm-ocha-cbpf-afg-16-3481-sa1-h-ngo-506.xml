Through this proposal ACTD is planning to implement Trauma care services to improve access of 230,051 people living in 13 priority districts in Helmand ampGhor provinces. The project will focus on support to HC priority area-one (Support emergency health amptrauma care). ACTD propose start date for implementation from 01 July 2016 (pre financed from own resources ampreimbursed after receipt of disbursement of the project budget) ampwill end on June 30, 2017. The project will cover 9 districts in Helmand amp4 in Ghor. Total 14 FATPs will be functioning (10 in Helmand 3 Linked with BPHS HFs amp 7 SA  amp 4 in Ghor all  linked with BPHS HFs). The project will provide care to  over 26,611 cases through its implementation period. 
Out of 10 FATPs planned in Helmand  were already functioning through CHF Round 1 (2015) in [Ali Abad (L)amp  Ghach Hazro (SA) in Kajaki, Kopaka (SA) in Nad Ali, Kwak (SA)in Sangeen, Barang (SA)in Nawzad, Sarbisha (SA) in MusaKala, Shoraki (L) in NahreSiraj, Baibanak (SA)in Washir, SraKala (L) in Khanishinamp  Wala Kor (SA) in Baghran districts
 Through this network of 10  FATPs  190,585 people living in conflict affected areas  will have improved access to trauma care.  
In Ghor access to trauma care will be improved through establishment of 4 FATPs linked with BPHS HFs (1 BHC amp3 SHCs) located in remote amp  insecure areas in four priority districts (Dolaina, Shahrak, Passabanamp  Taiwara). Total 39,466 individuals living in 128 villages in priority districts will have access to trauma care. These FATPs will initially be run as standalone amp  later on may be linked with BPHS HFs in case of early approval for establishment for BPHS HFs by GCMU as these sites has been  proposed to GCMU for approval.  
Targeted locations  in both provinces, are highly insecure  with high number of incidents amp  civilian casualties. An increase in number of incidences has been reported in Helmand, amp  Ghor provinces with start of spring 1395. In Helmand  Kajaki, MusaKala, Nawzad, Washir, Sangeen, NahrSiraj, Periphery of Lashkargah, Khanishinamp   Nad Ali district remained under active fights most of time during the year 2015. These fights has also resulted in temporary/periodic closure of 11 health facilities (1DH, 5CHCs, 4BHCs amp 1SHC). Our experience from implementation of trauma care project since 2014 shows high contribution in trauma care of standalone FATPs in Helmand ampPaktia provinces. At an average each standalone FATP in Helmand has received at an average 230 cases ampin Paktia at an average 190 visits of wounded patients per FATP site. 
In Ghor areas targeted are under continuous threat of AGEs with an increase in number ampmovements in the districts, there are high possibilities of planned attacks from both sites with possibility of mass causalities during the upcoming months. 
FATPs (Linked) will be staffed with 2 Nurses ampstandalone with 3 Nurses. Each FATP will have 2 Guards for support. FATPs will work 24/7 amp and will provide trauma care. All technical staff in FATPs will receive 02 days orientation on medical ethics, 05 days training on Trauma care IP management. FATPs will be provided  with supplies of medicine, equipment ampother related items considering their needs. 
Based on our discussion with HC, ACTD will share list of  CHWs to HC for inclusion into their training program for provinces. Reporting will be collected regularly on monthly basis from the FATPs. Project offices will compile reports amp submit to Kabul. Feedback/recommendations will be shared with FATPs on reports after analysis by PO ampMO teams. 
Dedicated teams will be in place to manage project implementation with support of health team in MO ampProject teams in provinces. Regular supportive supervision ampmonitoring will be held on monthly ampQ basis from POampMO respectively.
