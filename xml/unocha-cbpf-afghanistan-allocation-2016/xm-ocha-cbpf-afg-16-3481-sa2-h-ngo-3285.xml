   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Provision of emergency trauma care services in Ghazni and Baghlan Provinces</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">ORCD will aim to ensure access to equitable emergency trauma care services in Baghlan, Saripul and Ghazni Provinces through: 1) the provision of complementary trauma care services in two provincial hospitals (Baghlan, and Ghazni), 1 DH, two integrated FATPs (in Ghazni) and three standalone FATPs (in Baghlan) 2) the supply of sufficient quantity of medical and non-medical equipment, medicines to health facilities to cover extra needs linked to mass casualties and conflict affected patients 3) Coordination with other stakeholders working the same areas. 

Baghlan has been included in consultation with Health Cluster which has already given recommendation in this regard. The need for such services is still very high because the security is much deteriorated this year as compared to the start of 2015. This warrants continuation of services in Baghlan. 

ORCD has considered MMRCA being the BPHS implementer in Ghazni Cluster 2 as Sub Consultant for the proposed interventions in Dehyak CHC, Muqur CHC+, and Qarabagh District Hospital (DH) which comes under the catchment area of their BPHS interventions. While all major interventions (i.e. bulk procurements, etc.) for the MMRCA portion will be done by ORCD, yet ORCD will be responsible for the staffing and day to day management and routines expenses related to its own cluster in Qarabagh, Muqur and Deh Yak districts. An MOU has been finalized and will be signed as soon as the grant is approved. 


Upgrading Provincial Hospitals in Baghlan and Ghazni Provinces
The upgrading interventions of Baghlan PH already started in 2015 in terms of additional staffing, hiring orthopedic surgeon, upgrading infrastructure, provision of additional supplies. Considering the situation in Baghlan the same will continue with for a period of another one year. For Ghazni PH, orthopedic surgeon will also be hired so that orthopedic specialized secondary level services, surgeries and consultation could also be provided for trauma cases there. This is because orthopedic surgeon position is not included in the EPHS staff list. However, ORCD has identified the need for the Ghazni PH too because of long distance and insecurity of the road located between the hospitals and the nearby national hospitals. 

First aid trauma post services through three Standalone FATPs in Baghlan 
First aid and trauma post services are provided as standalone in Baghlan -e Jadid, Doshi, and Chashma e Shair area (to cover victims of both Pulikhomri and Dahna e Ghori Districts). These FATPs will also cover Nahrin, Pulikhumri, and Khenjan Districts. The locations could alter as needed as decided by ORCD in coordination with PPHD, community or other provincial authorities.
 
The staff of all targeted health facilities will be trained on Basic Life Support (BLS) as per the training needs assessment to be conducted during the first two months of the project. The training will involve triage, trauma care, basic and advanced lifesaving interventions. 

As an innovation Simulation Exercise will be conducted for the staff of FATPs and Trauma Center with the support of World Health Organization (WHO). This is simulation training is in fact a humanitarian training program that streamlines the core competencies deemed essential for all health workers deployed in hospitals and FATPs. It is a robust, evidence and competency based program that will potentially help prepare and equip health workers and other humanitarians for the field and ensure they deliver high quality aid in a safe and secure manner. This performance measured program will primarily focus health care providers but will also include others including logisticians, project managers, security personnel. 
For the logistics and transportation, ORCD has identified Smart Afghan Solutions Logistics Services and for the the construction of the trauma care unit of Ghazni PH, ORCD has considered Momin Construction Afghan Construction company having demonstrated capacity.</narrative>
