   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Supporting Conflict induced IDPs and returnees through appropriate food assistance and access to Agricultural Inputs in Kunduz province</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project aims to improve the livelihoods for 1,500 conflict induced IDPs and returnees families through the provision of appropriate food assistance and access to agricultural inputs for six months.. Furthermore, The project is expected to contribute in reducing malnutrition and anemia among children and women which is caused by loss of livelihoods and food insecurity in recent conflict in Kunduz province by targeting female headed households and children with malnutrition.   

For the agricultural inputs, the project will support those who have recently returned to their place of origin. It will specifically target those without any means to perform agricultural activities because of loss of seeds and agricultural tools during the conflict. The project will provide cash for work to the returnees besides the agricultural input, cash assistance will be provided to meet their daily dietary requirements till next harvest season. The project will provide cash for work assistance for families still leaving in IDPs life. There will also be a provision of unconditional cash grant for at least 100 women headed households, and other most vulnerable members to meet their needs and reduce the depletion of assets and animals of women who depend on these as their source of livelihoods. 
This is also expected to support the existing markets in target districts and Kunduz city to help the province to come back to normalcy. According to ADA and Oxfam assessment team observation, The agriculture package and necessary food items are available in Kunduz market. 11 certified seeds enterprises are operating in Kunduz province. Additionally, cash for work is expected to rehabilitate some of the infrastructures such as canals, roads and catch dams. 
 
Kunduz conflict in September 2015, had a disastrous impact on the lives of  people forcing them to flee their homes to relatively secure districts and nearby provinces. Infrastructures such as land, irrigation canals, roads and catch dams were damaged. Many people lost their income asset such as livestock, harvest and agriculture tools during fights since they left their homes.The major affected areas were Chardara and Imam Sahib districts where heavy fight took place. Most of the displaced people were small land owners and sharecroppers families who are now returning to their place of origin as the security situation has improved relatively. According to DoRR  of Kunduz and observation of ADA, 560 out of 1,230 families who were displaced from Chardara district and were living in various parts of the city have returned to their houses while in Imam Sahib district 890 families displaced from their villages and settled in the district center. 

However these families are returning to the farms that have been destroyed and now they are living in very poor economic situation. The loss of harvest and means due to displacement for last several months have resulted in a situation where they are unable to purchase improved wheat seed and Chemical Fertilizer to cultivate their agriculture lands. Women who depended on poultry lost their farm animals. There is no employment opportunity for these people to earn income and continue their living till the next harvest. Therefore, majority of the subsistence farmers and share cropper are using the destructive coping mechanism for their survival such as selling livestock, taking loans, child labour, migrating to the other provinces and countries. The assessment conducted by Oxfam and its partner ADA in Kunduz  revealed that majority of the people depends on agriculture for livelihoods. If these returnees do not receive support to start the livelihoods activities in addition to emergency relief, there is a danger that the food insecurity will turn chronic. This will impact mostly the children and women who are already malnourished and are suffering from anemia.</narrative>
