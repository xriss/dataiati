   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Water, Sanitation and hygiene project for Waziristan refugees in Khost province of Afghanistan.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">As a result of the survey conducted by CoAR using the Household Emergency Assessment Tool (HEAT), 11 villages are selected for the proposed response to address the urgent and unmet WASH needs of refugees and IDPs residing in Alisher district in Khost province with aim to provide access to potable water, sanitation facilities and hygiene awareness.
. 
&#x64F;There were total 15647 individuals had to be served, out of which 5805 individuals in three villages of Alisher namely Qadam, Sadad and Ladar were covered under UNHCR funding opportunity available for such a purpose, while the rest 9842 in 11 villages (i.e. Talwal, Haroonkhail, Troshay, Kharakay, Karghaday, Terezay, Sarah Dabgay, Star Dabgay, Lar Dabgay, Sataray and Sawakay) remained under-served due to lake of funding opportunity then. CoAR actually is focusing on refugees, however, there are 241 individual IDPs among these 9842 refugees, this minor portion of IDPs had also be addressed as they are living among the refugees and leaving them under-served would cause conflict of interest.

It is thus, the project will reach 9842 refugees living in spontaneous settlements and host communities in Khost and ensure that beneficiaries have 1) Improved access to adequate sanitation facilities, 2) Improved access to safe water supply, 3) an increased understanding of key health risks related to WASH and adopting positive hygiene practices to prevent these. According to the survey using HEAT, open defecation is practiced by 91 percent of the beneficiaries, Hand washing at the most critical times is very poor. About half 40% of the population do not wash hands during the key times and 55% of the respondents wash hands with water only. 86% do not have any dedicated hand washing facility at HH level. Construction of lockable latrines with hand washing facilities in communities and households will mitigate waterborne diseases and hence safe lives, ensure privacy and security of women and children, and give easy access for the elderly and disabled. As bathing facilities are almost non-existent in all areas, they will be built to protect dignity and improve personal hygiene and wellbeing.  Sanitation and water facilities will be located in well-lit areas for safety. Water sources in the target areas are insufficient and unsafe. To meet need for adequate and safe water supply, wells with hand pump will be constructed and well disinfected and a system for regular water testing set up in communities and health centers. To reduce the burden on women and girls who spend many hours collecting water, hand pumps will be located in the communities. Appropriate sizes of jerry cans will aid women and children in water collection. Activities to promote good hygiene practices will be done to reduce health risks and to foster resilient bodies and minds. With community participation at the core, hygiene promotion activities will emphasize on prevention of diarrhea, hand washing, menstrual hygiene, infant and young child feeding (IYCF)), water treatment, food storage and waste disposal. Promotion activities will be accompanied by the distribution of hygiene Kits. WASH committees will be composed of men and women. Men and women of all ages will be encouraged to participate in groups so they can voice their concerns and express their preferences while implementing the WASH activities.

Activities are planned for a logical time frame of 12 months, as it involves construction activities such curing and other vital steps required to accomplish the job and acquiring optimum results. Prominently the project encompass two major components i.e. hard and soft. Hard component mainly consist of drilling of 18 water wells 492 semi-permanent latrines and bathing facilities, while soft component consists of promotion of hygiene i.e. PHAST and CHAST approaches to make sure behavioral changes. to have an impact assessment of PHAST and CHAST we required time frame of at least 12 months as per set procedure.</narrative>
