   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Provision of Health Services for conflict affected population and displaced population of Farah, Logar and Paktia provinces</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">MRCA overall objective in Logar, Farah and Paktia is to make sure that targeted patients have access to equitable emergency services through 1) the availability of professional complementary emergency health services in 2 Provincial Hospitals, 2 District Hospitals and 2 Comprehensive Health Centers 2) the provision of emergency Primary Health Care (PHC) and referral services for the population of white areas affected by conflict in 7 Health Sub Centers (SHC) and one Basic Health Center (BHC) located in Paktia 3) the supply of sufficient quantity of medical and non-medical equipment, medicines to health facilities to cover the extra needs linked to mass casualties and conflict affected patients 4) the provision of MHT services for IDPs and returnees in three townships (Banozai, Rabat and Quli Urdu) of Gardez not covered by BPHS 5) the coordination with other stakeholders working in the same areas.

For the war wounded patients MRCA will ensure that:
1) Chamkani and Jajy Aryub DHs have the required infrastructures, trained staff, equipment, supplies and drugs to become referral trauma centers and be prepared to respond efficiently to mass casualties 
2) Logar and Farah PHs have sufficient extra surgical and blood bank supplies considering the constant increase of trauma and mass casualty cases admitted in these hospitals 
3) First aid and trauma post services are integrated in Jani Khail CHC for admission and stabilization of the war wounded patients referred from the area 
4) Develop the capacity of Tameer CHC located in Zurmat district to stabilize and treat the war wounded patients by adding an OT and blood bank to the BPHS structure with the adequate number of trained staff, equipment and supplies needed and by recruiting a X-ray technician to operate properly the X-ray equipment already available in the CHC 
The staffs of the six above mentioned health facilities will be trained by WHO on triage, trauma care and basic lifesaving activities.
5) In Farah PH, the orthopedic surgeon hired through the 2015 CHF project will continue to provide orthopedic services, surgeries and consultations for trauma cases. Orthopedic surgeon position is not included in the MoPH standard EPHS staff list, however MRCA identified the need in Farah from 2014 due to the long distance and the insecurity of the road located between Farah city and the Regional Hospital of Herat as well as the increased number of trauma cases in the province due to the intensification of the conflict.

For PHC, MRCA will provide PHC and referral care in white areas affected by conflict through 7 HSCs and one Basic Health Center. These health facilities are not part of the standard list of health facilities under the BPHS but are essential to cover the health needs of the white areas where the population is affected by the conflict and the volatile security situation. MRCA will be in charge of the overall management of the HSCs with the continuation of the contracts of one midwife, one nurse, two guards, as well as the drug supply and other necessary materials and equipment. MRCA submitted the list of these HFs for white area to MoPH requesting their integration within the SEHAT project. 

For the mass displacement and IDPs, MRCA will cover the health needs of the population in Paktia province. MRCA will maintain the activities of one MHT, already active during in the last CHF project for the IDPs and returnee families settled around Gardez. The MHT will provide PHC to the IDP families as well as health education sessions using the standard messages delivered by the afghan MoPH. This MHT will also enable to improve the referral system of IDPs to the PH by ensuring the good knowledge of the referral system as well as the availability of transportation for patients showing obstetric complications.</narrative>
