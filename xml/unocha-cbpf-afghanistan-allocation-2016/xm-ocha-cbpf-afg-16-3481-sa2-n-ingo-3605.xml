   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Emergency Response to reduce morbidity and mortality associated with critical rates of Global Acute Malnutrition amongst under-five children in IDP populations of Kabul Province</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This proposal is designed to address the 2nd allocation from CHF 2016 with regards to: Emergency support to address a worsening malnutrition crisis through integrated health, nutrition and WASH interventions in the Kabul Informal Settlements (KIS). The aim of this project is to bridge critical gaps in Basic Package of Health Services (BPHS) treatment of acute malnutrition and prevent further deterioration of nutritional status in the IDP population of Kabul informal settlements.  Conflict displacement is increasing, with more than 137,000 people displaced in Afghanistan since the beginning of 2016 representing a 16% increase compared to the same period last year. As a result of this high influx of displaced populations the Informal settlements have witnessed an increase in population leading to strained living conditions, increased hygiene and sanitation challenges and severe food insecurity which have contributed to an increased level of malnutrition. A recent Rapid Nutrition Assessment conducted in the KIS indicated emergency levels burden of malnutrition in the KIS and very high levels of diarrhea and ARI among children under the age of 5 years. In light of these findings ACF has designed this project to address this challenge and to ensure that the communities affected are receiving the required support to alleviate their health, nutrition, hygiene and sanitation situation and to avoid a further deterioration of the situation and loss of life related to malnutrition in the KIS. ACF will focus on both facility based intervention through reinforcing the health and nutrition service delivery points with nutrition and WASH as well as community based intervention through Mobile clinics approach. ACF will also roll out MUAC by mothers approach combined with SBCC component. This project is going to be integrating health, nutrition and WASH activities both at facility level and community level. ACF recognizes the strong correlation between sanitation amp hygiene with high child morbidity amp malnutrition and with lessons learnt from previous ECHO funded intervention in KIS (2011-2013) and through implementing integrated programs in Ghor, Balkh and Helmand province.The proposed WASH activities in this NUT-WASH integrated project are linked to nutrition hence contributing strongly to the overall nutrition objective of this project as well as the strategic objectives of the nutrition cluster and the humanitarian response plan 2016.ACF intends to support all the 50 Informal settlements with integrated health and nutrition support through weekly mobile Clinics and strengthening 5 health facilities around the KIS with nutrition services and 20 most vulnerable settlements for WASH interventions based on (i) Initial assessment conducted at beginning of the project and (ii) guidance of -KIS taskforce chaired by UN-OCHA on available un-covered gaps for WASH in the KIS. In the 50 settlements ACF will establish 6 mobile teams to provide health and nutrition services, provide support to 5 health facilities in the vicinity of the settlements with nutrition and health training to the staff, which are predominantly nutrition training with only key components of health that is relevant and in link to nutrition and regular monitoring and supervision to strengthen service delivery, community sensitization, Social Behavior change communication activities, MUAC by mothers and key community leaders training approach. The support on health component, as well as the support on treating medical complication of SAM children at health facility level is primordial and is linked to the global objective of the project. ACF will distribute 3000 menstrual hygiene kits to women in targeted communities, and provide Bio Sand filters to most vulnerable settlements (about 1000 vulnerable families) based on high rate of diarrhea cases and HHs fetching water from unprotected sources.</narrative>
