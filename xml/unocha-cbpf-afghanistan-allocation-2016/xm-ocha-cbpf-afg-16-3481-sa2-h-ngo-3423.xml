   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Provision of timely effective trauma care and mass casualty management to conflict affected people of Nangarhar and Faryab province</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Afghan Mortality Survey (AMS) conducted in 2010 shows considerable increase in access of communities to the basic health care services and significant decline in mortality rates. However, despite significant achievements, these indicators are still among the highest in the world. Challenges still remain affecting utilization and quality of services. More than 35% of population need to travel longer than one hour to reach the nearest HF and one third of HFs doesn&#x2019;t have female HW. More than 3 decades, Afghanistan is suffering from ongoing civil strife and conflict. Due to non- stop and even increasing conflicts, the needs have been enhanced to manage increased number of trauma cases, disrupted health services, displacing communities and restricting access to the already limited health services.
1. Nangarhar province is located on the Eastern Region, bordering with Kunar and Laghman in the North, Kabul, Logar and Paktya in the West, and with Pakistan in the East and South. Administratively, the province is divided into 22 districts with Jalalabad being the capital. The province has an estimated total population of 1,525,896 based on CSO 2013 data. 
Nangarhar is among the relatively volatile provinces in eastern Afghanistan where anti-government armed militants including the Taliban insurgents and ISIS loyalists are actively operating in a number of its remote districts. The security situation was increasingly volatile as the conflict grew in intensity and scope, resulting in high casualties and displacement among Afghan civilians. 
Current Structure of Health Care Services including Humanitarian activities: Under SEHAT I, AADA implements BPHS in Nangarhar through 4 DHs, 2 CHC+, 18 CHC, 57 BHCs, 17 SHCs and 926 HPs. The BPHS facilities are mainly linked with the EPHS Regional Hospital for referral of complicated cases however, there are also two provincial hospitals &#x2013; Fatima Zahra and University - run by MOPH and MOHE respectively. 
IOM, ARCS, WFP, NRC, IRC, DRC, SCI, ANDM, AADA, WHO, UNICEF and RRD are somehow involved in response to emergency situation. However, still there was gap in provision of trauma care, which are somehow addressed through establishment of trauma care facilities in the districts with continuous conflicts. AADA has already established 7 FATPs in seven districts of the province and intends to establish three more FATPs in Jaba Kot CHC of Kot, Balabagh BHC of Surkhrod and Torkham BHC of Momandara district under CHF 2nd allocation. 

2. Faryab province is located in Northern Region of Afghanistan, bordering with Jawzjan and Saripul in east, Badghis in west, Ghor in south, and Republic of Turkmenistan in north. The province has an estimated total population of 998,147 as per CSO 2015. The province is divided into 15 districts and Maimana is the capital of the province. Faryab is a multi-ethnic and mostly tribal society, Uzbek, Tajik, Pashtun, Turkmen and Hazara are the main ethnic groups. Faryab province also has a population of Kuchis or nomads whose numbers vary in different seasons. Faryab is one of the most insecure provinces in Northern region. Suicide attacks, road side explosions, abduction of government and NGOs workers have been common over the past years. Although all HFs were reportedly active at the time of our assessment, supervision of remote HFs in several districts is a major challenge. 
There are 51 HFs including 2 DHs, 2 CHC+, 14 CHCs, 20 BHCs, 12 HSCs, and one Prison health clinic) and 564 HPs in the province. In addition to that there are some HFs out of BPHS including 35 Family Health Houses (FHH) and 3 MHTs run by AADA, 1 MCH clinic run by MSI, two ARCS clinics, and one EPHS provincial hospital run by MOPH. There is also two FATPs, one mobile health team and one HSC supported by OCHA, and intends to establish three FATP in Pashtoonkot district.</narrative>
