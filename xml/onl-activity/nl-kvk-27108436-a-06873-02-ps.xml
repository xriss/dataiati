   <narrative xml:lang="EN">1)Protection Assessment Analysis and intervention planning
Oxfam and TdH will analyse the data collected during the assessment in Activity 1 under result 1 to inform two different purposes: 1). The selection of beneficiaries from the nominated pool of HHs based on scores of socio-economic and protection parameters and 2). Identifying the specific basic and protection needs for selected HHs and preparing the response plan with tailored interventions based on these needs. TdH will develop a protection scoring matrix to determine selection of target members of the family that will have assigned weights to prioritise selecting the most critical protectionneeds and avoiding unintended harm of inclusion and exclusion. Parameters include: number of children working, number of children dropped out from School, available income for children, disability, mental health and well-being, violence in the HHs, and others. TdH will carry out the analysis to reach to the target population based on the scoring. The intervention will be designed based on theneeds assessed and so will the referral to other services that are beyond project scope

The action will address protection relatedvulnerability and critical protection needs of women and children of the target group through the provision of protection services for the most vulnerable protection cases (children and women and their caregivers). The delivery of the services will be carried outthrough specialized protection teams in the three governorates who represent three child protection centres that are supported by TdH and will be supported under this action. The services will include: speech therapy, Mental Health and Psychosocial Support (MPHSS), referral and coving for accessing services with other protection service providers such as psychiatric therapy, treatment and other, in addition to provision to specific items to children and women that will be determined throgh a response plan.
The project activities will be implemented in coordination with Gaza Protection Consortium and protection and cash actors in Gaza in liaison with MoSD.
- Provision of structured psychosocial support to children coming from vulnerable households and have protection concerns, suchas phycological distress, subjected to violence including SGBV, out-of-school children, and child laborers. For children, the psychosocial support will be conducted using different methodologies tailored according to the children&#x2019;s&#x2019; needs and ages. For instance, the Healing and Education by Art manual will be used for children aged over 12 years old and CABAC Manual developed by ICRC will be used for children &lt;(&gt;&lt;&lt;)&gt;/= 12 years, finally, psychodrama will also be utilized for children who have emotional and behavioral problems. The Tdh Move on and Engage Curriculum for MHPSS will also be used.  This Curriculum is aimed at youth participants, aged 12-20years, and draws their attention to skills that will enable them to assess both protection and psychosocial concerns and then generate and implement group-based initiatives that address those concerns. Additionally, the Movement Game Sport and Creativity (MGSC) manual will be used for children below the age of 12. Tdh will train the staff of the five implementing partners on the Move on Engage Curriculum andthe MGSC. This training will be a good learning opportunity for implementing partners in order to integrate the implementation of these methodologies into their work.

- Non-structured MPHSS Sessions for Children- (to be elaborated)

- For adults, case managers will utilize the Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) Protocol developed by the World Health Organization to provide structured psychological services. Tdh will train all implementing partner social workers on the CBT Protocol, the training willbe 10 days long. The training will be followed by 4 weeks of supervision. Tdh will hire an expert to undertake the training and the supervision. Along with delivering quality services to beneficiaries, training and supporting partners&#x2019; staff on CBT will increase the capacity of the implementing partners. The structured psychological services will help adults and youth to connect with other family andcommunity members and to help them to deal more effectively with personal challenges and/or challenges related to the current conflict, which can have great benefits in reducing distress and suffering.

- For GBV survivors mainly, women and girls, the MHPSS will include structured MHPSS, individual counselling, group counselling, support groups, and referralto specialized services, as needed.Additionally, GVB survivors will benefit from structured support groups that aim to (1) equip GBV survivors with techniques and tools that support them in regulating their stress and building their resilience. (2) empower GBV survivors to protect themselves and map the services and hotlines in their areas. The support group is a non-judgmental space where people come together and work toward improving their mental health, through psychoeducation, sharing personal experiences, as well as practicing problem-solving and compassion. Generally, the main goal of the support groups is helping members to better manage, cope, adapt and transform. The support group is positioned at level three in the IASC pyramid &#x2013; MHPSS continuum. Level three is the focused non-specialized supports. For GBV cases who have survived complicated trauma or who might be suffering from severe mental health issues, the psychologists will refer the individuals to specialized services. Tdh staff will train partners staff on how to facilitate structured support groups using Tdh methodologies.

- Conduct joint child-parent interaction activities. The child-parent interaction activities will utilize educational and recreational activities to strengthenthe relationship between children and their parents. The child-parent interaction activities will be done in a structured way through organizing at least five sessions in which each session will have its objectives and expected outcome. In general, the sessions aim to increase children&apos;s ability to positively express their feelings and emotions, improve self-confidence, along with strengthening the child-parents relationship. The sessions target the most vulnerable children, such as children who have anti-social personalities, children with violent behaviour, and children who do not have good relationshipswith their parents.
