   <narrative xml:lang="EN">CEPADWN is established on the belief and conviction that a just, peaceful, and democratic societies can be achieved by people who are conscious and aware of their civil and political rights. CEPADWN is an organization dedicated to the cause of nonviolence. To CEPADWN, this means commitment to justice without the use of force that destroys or causes injury to an enemy or his/her properties. Webelieve a movement built on nonviolence should critically analyse injustice and work to liberate both the oppressed and the oppressor.
Community Empowerment for Peace and Development West Nile (CEPAD-WN) is a voluntary non profit-making organization that works toresist violence, transform conflicts, and build peace in communities. Founded in 2014 By Ugandan women who have worked in conflict zone for more than a decade and are scholars of peace and conflict management. CEPADWN registered entity with the then Arua districtlocal government as a CBO in 2014. In 2019, CEPADWN became a member of Arua district NGO forum, West Nile Humanitarian platform andthe charter 4change. This year March 2021, CEPADWN has become a national NGO registered with the NGO Bureau with five years&#x2019; work permit. CEPADWN also has obtained MOU with OPM to operate in the settlements within West Nile. CEPADWN has this year developed and approved policies that guide the operations i.e. PSEA policy, Antiharrasment policy, Child protection policy, Anit fraud policy and Gender policy among others. CEPADWN has functional BOD of that governs it&#x2019;s operation The organization since its inception has worked with civil society organizations, particularly the youth, women, faith-based, refugee population and traditional structures in West Nile to transform conflicts, and to promote nonviolent and democratic principles. Based in Arua, Uganda, CEPADWN works with vulnerable groups and partners across the country to support individuals and organizations to enhance skills needed to transform violent conflicts and build bridges across ethnic, religious, and political divides.

Since 2014, CEPADWN also with funding from Puerto Rico girls&#x2019; school, Forum for youth Advocacy (FOYA) carried several activities including construction of menstrual hubs in 3schools in rural areas, establishment of 4 well-furnished libraries (over 5000 books each, laptops and Ipads for modern learning) in four schools in Maracha Arua and Zombo districts. CEPADWN production and distributed reusable sanitary pads to over 5000 girls in primary school in four different schools. We believe toaddress community challenges, both men and women must be empowered. CEPADWN also trained teachers both male and female, students both boys are girls in menstrual hygiene management and local production of reusable pads.  Withfunding from PARTERA international Canada trained urban youth on nonviolent conflict transformation and peacebuilding. From 2019 todate, CEPADWN received support from Stiftung UmVerteilen, Oxfam IBIS and IFA/zivik, for peaceful co-existence and conflict prevention and in Rhino campand palorinya refugee settlement. Todate, CEPADWN has trained over 100 women and men in Rhino camp and Bidibidi refugee settlements and formed community-based peace clubs in both refugee settlement  In responding to Covid-19 related GBV, CEPADWN has trained and recruited 8 of its trained volunteers to do door to door sensitisation on covid-19 and its related impact on womenand girls.  CEPADWN support the OPM with PPEs and did several community sensitisation and dialogues including creating of male action group to respond to GBV in the settlements.

Strategic Positioning;
CEPADWN works in coordination other actors like the local government that provides technical guidance on the interventions, the office of the prime minister (OPM) department together with UNHCR responsible for refugees coordinates the operations of the partners ensuring proper beneficiary targeting, fair resource allocation, quality and timely delivery of services, other partners with whom CEPADWN shares resources and build on each other&#x2019;sefforts and the community structures who mobilize thebeneficiaries to own the interventions.

CEPADWN is one of the few organizations that have tried to intervene with support from Umverteilen and recently OXFAM in a project of promoting peaceful coexistence in some zones within Rhino camp settlement. CTEN (Community Technology Education Network) and YSAT (Youth Social Advocacy Teams) both South Sudanese led CBOs have attempted to implement activities to promote peaceful coexistence. CEPADWN has been involved in advocacy and lobbying to UNHCR, Government, INGOs and donors to allocate funding in the area of peace and conflict mitigation which is beginning to yield results with the establishment of a separate sub sector for coordination of peaceful coexistence partners in the settlement. Over all being a women founded and women led institution, CEPADWN has very high profile among the partners for their technical capacity in the area of Peace and nonviolent conflict transformation.</narrative>
