   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The expansion of the civic space was supported by the evolution of the legal framework protecting rights and freedoms, reinforced over the past nine years. In addition to a new constitution adopted in January 2014 enshrining rights and freedoms, new progressive laws have been adopted such as the law on access to information (organic law No. 22-2016), the law against torture and ill-treatment (organic law No. 2013-43 dated 23 October 2013), the law against violence targeting women (organic law No. 2017-58dated 11 August 2017) and the law on custody (law n&#xB0;6-5 dated 16 February 2016).
Alongside CSOs, which number has been steadily growing, informal movements have also multiplied across the country. In the month of March 2020 alone, the Tunisian Social Observatory spotted 223 informal protest movements throughout the country, of which 119 (53.4%) were spontaneous and 104 (46.6%) were organized.
However, despite the importance of civil society in public debate and diversification, the capacity of actors to influence public policies and positively invest in reform processes has been gradually weakened in recent years. The political configuration resulting from the 2014 elections, combined with a security context that fostered a political discourse opposingsecurity and human rights, has forced many actors to focus their efforts on preserving civic space, public and individual freedoms and on the process of transitional justice.
In addition, the civic space in Tunisia is marked by a clear divide between traditional CSOs and other unorganized actors. Unorganized activists and informal movements are sometimes subject to distrust on the part of CSOs, and vice versa. Several factors explain this situation: the traditional conflict between formal and informal activism, reflected by the refusal of unorganized movements to formalize for fear of losing the real meaning of their activism, and by their rejection of some CSOs, which they consider they would misappropriate their struggle just for the sake of receivingfunds from foreign donors. For their part, CSOs are sometimes critical of theapproach adopted by individual activists and informal movements favoring confrontation over consultation with authorities and decision-makers.
The particular context marking the last legislative and presidential elections at the end of 2019 deepened the divide between CSOs and other components of the civic space, as well as with the public opinion in general, following the emergence of associations serving as political platforms for presidential or legislative candidates, under the guise of charity work and citizenship
The project partners offer to contribute to enabling: all citizens and community groups to organize and act in a free, secure and respectful civic space of rights, in synergy with the actors engaged in a favorable environment and in constructive interaction with different state and non-state bodies at the local, national and international levels.
This will be done through 3 change tracks:
1- Prevention and expansion of the CS (civic space)
2- Defense and protection of actors
3- Influence for the emergence of an enabling environment


This will lead to:
&#x2022; Outcomes
1- Sustainable and effective activism is guaranteed thanks to the protection and defense mechanisms offered to CSOs and individuals operating in the civic space
2- Actors exert influence nationally and internationally to preserve civic space and ensure an enabling environment for sustainable activism

&#x2022; Outputs
A) CSOs and individuals are strengthened intheir protection and defense capacities
B) A narrative highlighting the role and contribution of HC is constructed and disseminated.
C) Partner civil society organizations have the skills and tools to implement influence and mobilizationactions (national and international) to ensure a favorable environment
D) CSOs are strengthened to carry out a common advocacy to protect the achievements anddevelop favorably the legal and institutional framework relating to the civic space</narrative>
