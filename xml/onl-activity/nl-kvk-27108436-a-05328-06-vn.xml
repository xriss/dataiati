   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project &quot;Improved informal migrant workers ability in access to better and fairer social protection&quot; will be implemented by  the Institute for Development and Community Health- LIGHT in 4 wards of Hoan Kiem and Thanh Xuan districts of Ha Noi city.

The project will use one of the success models supported by LIGHT recent years -self-help group and peer educators- as a ground to gather and empower informal workers, especially women. Self-help group is a group of informal worker aimed at empowering informal worker and networking them for a collective and unique voice to claim their right and get sustainable income and decent work. It has its own leaders and operation mechanism designed by all members and plays a role as a platform for informal worker to share information and experience on health, psychology, employment, legal regulations, social protection, economic activities...  To ensure the sustainabilityand effectiveness of the groups, all leaders are equipped and trained on group management, resource mobilization, policy advocacy, decent work and promising earning income activities... These group are also linked together under policy advocacy activities and sharing workshop of group leaders. This model was built up by LIGHT from 2013 among street vendors and waste collectors in Ha Noi city
Nowadays, the number of self-help group has reached to 13 groups with 203 members and 20 leaders. All of the leaders are female and informal workers. 100% of those groups have jointly carried out policy advocacy campaigns at local level.

The project, therefore, will continue to expand this model among street vendors and waste collectors and expand to other kind of informal workers such as part-time domestic workers and workers at service entertainment, and connect them under a network of informal workers with jointly advocacy activities and sharing workshop of group leaders. This network will continue to be connected to other network of migrant workers that supported by other M.net members through jointlyproject run by M.net and create a unique network for all migrant workers for stronger voice and collective actions to claim migrant workers# right. The project also strengths those group through improving jointly activities on policy advocacy, and sustainability economic activities. In additional, for deeper mainstreaming gender equality and closing gender gaps, the project will poor into the existing model training course on gender equality for group leaders and members and support group#s initiatives for improving gender equality among members.

For further organized and networked of informal workers, the project will try to get officially recognition of association of informal workers. Currently, there is any association of informal worker in Vietnam. Some groups of informal workers has been established scattered somewhere but has not been connected and has been officially recognized by authorities. The project will start its effort with a research include both desk review and consultation with authorities, CSOs, informal workers to find out a best promising model of association for informal workers. This model will be support to pilot at 2 districts and documented as evidence-based for an advocacy for official recognition of association for informalworkers.

It is clear that the voice of informal worker will be higher if authorities understand and support for informal and women migrant workers. Therefore, at the same time with empower and network informal worker to claim their right, the projectalso influence authorities - raising their awareness gender equality, issues of migrant workers, women workers on accessing social protection; facilitate the connection between them and informal and women workers.

Supportive environment plays an important role in improving access to social protection of informal and women workers. The project, therefore, will focuses on key stakeholders who are already work for informal and women migrants (Light, Women#s Union) and who have great position to make influence such as mass organizations, mass media to improve the quality of supportive environment for accessing to social protection of informal and women migrant. To build capacity of those stakeholders, the project will use 2 key interventions includes: training course to improve their knowledge; support them to participate in local, national and regional workshops/sharing/learning activities; advocate and support them pilot specific efforts on improving access to social protection.
