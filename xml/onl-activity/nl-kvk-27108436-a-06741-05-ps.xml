   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Palestinian Farmers Union</narrative>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Registered as a Cooperative Federation under the law of the Ministry of Interior ,PFU is registered in the ministry of Interior Affairs, registration No. (QR-245-A). PFU represents farmer organizations all over the oPt. It has a very small number of employees, who are over loaded. Each of the staff members take different responsibilities, which according to financial resources, has not given ample opportunities to expand the number of employees. The board is diverse and from different geographical areas.PFU includes (12) member Farmers Associations from all the Palestinian Districts, these Associations includes (5831) farmers. The head of each of the 12 associations are board member (9 in West Bank and 3 in Gaza Strip)
PFU works with (76) Cooperative Associations, including (3040)members.
PFU has a democratic structure, with members organized in associations at regional (district) level (12) of which 2 representatives go to the general assembly (every year) at national level were mayor decisions are taken (strategic orientations, new members). PFU is leaded by a board of directors consists of (11) elected members by PFU general Assembly.
PFU works on implementing its goals through (6) employees and it has (8) offices (7) of them are located in the West Bank and only one office is in Gaza Strip.PFU#s understanding of partnership: to have an agreement based on the objective of the partnership and programme. The tools to implement this is an arguable thing and can be modified , but the main issue to have the same objective and interest among partners.
Real partnership is a process that begins from design.  This process continues through implementation, reviewing the work , extracting lessons learned and continuing work to reach the target and objectives of this partnership.
They have transparency mechanism in selection beneficiaries and keep control over the selection process from the beginning of the selection to the end. PFU keeps information flow within the union and members. They have an open process, which they think needs to be more documented. They are accountable to their members and beneficiaries.
They do not have a written complaints system but they do it as part of their work. In their annual plan they represent accountability indicator asone of the ways to measure the strength of the organization.As a union of farmers associations there is no direct relation with beneficiaries as they implement through the member association. However, in projects the selection criteria either beem:
- Through agreement with those member organizations on the selection criteria of the beneficiaries
-  Using the selection criteria of the project proposal
PFU ensures they target the appropriate beneficiaries through close monitoring of the process from thebeginning: through random selection to the evaluation in the end of the project. They already have a questionnaire called the Implementation Services Questionnaire that they use to manage selection.
They involve the beneficiaries in all stages through orientation workshops, progress updates and other tools to make them responsible for the project. Examples include requiring beneficiaries to pay community contributions for equipment, seedlings, etc.
If beneficiaries have a complaint from a member organization he or she can submit to the Union who will follow the case and find a solution.
The complain system is not well developed and the process needs more work. They have a supervising body that will monitor and follow up with complaints.PFU works veryclosely with farmers and farmers organization to represent their problems, work on their rights and advocate on behalf of farmers for sensitive problem they face.PFU is focused on the rights of farmers, including policy and legislation that influences themand lobbying withother organization to improve farmers# situation.

PFU targets small scale farmers all over the West Bank and Gaza Strip who own rain fed land ranging from 5- 10 dunums. They put special attention to women farmers or producers and give them preference in selection.
They expect to  build the capacity of farmers organizations to enable them to defend their rights and benefits, and Improve the economical status of small scale farmers through increase their participation of cooperatives.</narrative>
