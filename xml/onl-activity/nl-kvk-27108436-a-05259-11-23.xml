   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The DeafLoud project aims to bring a stronger and louder voice of deaf people in Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia at the local, regional,and global levels. In Vietnam, the deaf population is estimated at 2.5 million, while it is around 19 thousand in Laos and51 thousand in Cambodia. Regarding the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD): Cambodia signed (2007) and ratified (2012); Laos ratified in 2009; Vietnam signed (2007) and ratified (2015). However, a gap between such policies and their implementation in reality remains significant: persons with disabilities, including the deaf do not actually benefit from the policies or have opportunities to execute their rights. The needs and issues of the deaf remain invisible to the broader population and largely unaddressed. DeafLoud project will focus on four key issues: (i) the government has some attention on the deaf community however they do not provide full and direct participation of deaf people in policy making process and other projects that impacts deaf people&#x2019;s lives(Article 24 &#x201D;Education&#x201D; and Article 30&#x201C;Participation in cultural life, recreation, leisure and sport &#x201D;UNCRPD); (ii) lack of opportunities and access in education, employment, training, personal development which limit deaf people to live independently and to stand for themselves (Article 9&#x201D;Accessibility&#x201D; UNCRPD); (iiI) lack of safe space to discuss their common issues and capacity to organizethemselves as groups or alliances from making their voices heard (Article 21 &#x201C;Freedom of expression and opinion, and access to information&#x201D; UNCRPD); (iv)lack of a strong network in advocating for their rights and make a louder voice The main objectives of DeafLoud project are (i)Empower deaf people in three countries by building skills in sign language, leadership, policy influencing through training,community meetings, public discussion (ii) Amplify the voices of deaf people by providing opportunities for them to share their perspectives through raising awareness campaigns (iii) Build a network of deaf clubs in different regions within the countries and also a network of the deaf community in the Mekong region to bring a stronger voice at the regional level to the global level tofight stigmatization against the deaf In each country, the activities will focus on the important issues relating to the local deaf community. In Vietnam, the project will raise deaf awareness to the government and the public; empower and build a stronger network of deaf clubs throughout the country. In Laos, the need to develop Laotian Sign Language and empower deaf community is essential. More deaf clubs in different provinces will be established to create safe spaces for deaf people. In Cambodia, there is no deaf-led organization or formal group existing yet. With the DeafLoud project, we will work together and share our empowerment journey with Phnom Penh Deaf Club to build on their confidence, leadership skills and be independent to lead their community.</narrative>
