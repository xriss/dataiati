   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The National Association of Women&#x2019;s Organizations in Uganda (NAWOU) in Uganda was founded in the 1960&#x2019;s as the National Council of Women (NCW) and the gender machinery then. It was mandated to coordinate and be a platform for promoting women in politicalleadership and to advocate for women&#x2019;s issues and concerns. After the creation of political women&#x2019;s councils and a Ministry of Gender, NCW was registered under a new name as the National Association of Women&#x2019;s Organizations in Uganda (NAWOU) in 1993 aftera transition of five (5) years.

NAWOU boasts of being the most grounded women&#x2019;s organisation because of its members found in all parts of Uganda and as the oldest women&#x2019;s organisation based on its foundation as the National Council for Women in the 1960s.
The Women&#x2019;s Movement
NAWOU&#x2019;s foundation is linked to the struggles by the Women&#x2019;s Movement, which started with individual activists before independence. The first &#x2018;local&#x2019; formal civil society organization to promote &#x2018;women&#x2019;s concerns&#x2019; and social change was the multi-racial Uganda Council of Women, formed in 1946 (Tripp 2000, Kwesiga 1995, Snyder 1995). But this was preceded by a number of other civil society organizations that were racial in nature.  For example, the British missionary wives formedtheir own association in 1906 and also the MothersUnion, which later opened up to Ugandan women in 1908. Then there was the Indian Women&#x2019;s Association. Many women are remembered forworking to establish linkages between the local Ugandan women and the foreign women.  Sugra Visram, a Ugandan woman of Indian decent was one such woman who embodies the efforts of trying to link women from different backgrounds.  The most notable efforts was the formation of a civil society organization the (Young Women&#x2019;s Christian Association) YWCA and the Uganda Council of Women (Tripp 2000). These organizations that had started early before Independence were able to live through the test of time working to improve the lot of women through various initiatives. Yet, as Kwesiga (1995) notes, after independence in 1962 there was very little support forwomen&#x2019;s organizing.  Karungi (1995) argues that when Amin came to power in 1971, he initially promoted women&#x2019;s rights in a populistmove but then subsequently banned women&#x2019;s organizations.
 NAWOU&#x2019;s footprints go back to women like Freda Adiamo, Rhoda Kalema, Kisosonkole, Irene Emulu, and Joyce Mpanga began to agitate for women&#x2019;s issues at political a forums in and out of the country. These numbers soon grew into organized andstructured advocacy that gave birth to for</narrative>
