   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Legal Aid Service Providers Network Uganda (LASPNET) is a Non-Government Organization established in April 2004 to provide a collaborative framework and strategic linkages for Legal Aid Service Providers (LASPS) in the country. On this Voice linking and learning project, LASPNET will partner with Strategic Link (SL) Consult Limited (a consultancy firm with technical expertise) to advance the use innovative approaches to linking and learning that will not only amplify voices of the marginalised groups butalso build capacity of the different grantees involved to support delivery of high-quality, data-driven interventions by the grantees.

LASPNET thematic areas i.e. capacity building, lobbying and advocacy, networking and partnership, research and documentation as well as information/ data management; are all vital and well aligned to the work that the Voice linking and learning project wants to promote among grantees i.e. connecting the grantees, creating a linking and learning environment and documentation and knowledge management. With the experience and expertise gained over the years supporting various stakeholders in Uganda, LASPNET will leverage on the experience of Strategic Link Consult (SL) Consult Uganda to bring quality to the capacity building interventions through use of more innovativeapproaches such as Visualisation in Participatory Programs (VIPP) which will enlist more participation of women, youth, persons with disabilities and marginalised groups such as LGBTs in influencing their learning agendas.
Furthermore, Strategic Link&#x2019;s experiencein facilitating organisation-led learning based on identified needs# will be critical in empowering the organisations and ensuring sustainability beyond the Voice project.  This partnership led byLASPNET will harness the use of ICT through developing and managinga vibrant on-line and Off-line platform for information sharing and learning among the grantees and other stakeholders.
The Voice Linking and Learning platform will provide LASPNET anopportunity to support the discriminated and marginalised groups who sometimes fall through the cracks of mainstream human rights interventions. LASPNET will also use the lessons drawn from this experience to enrich the other legal aid services and humanrights programs in Uganda.
The consortium between the Legal Aid Service Providers Network (LASPNET) and Strategic Link (U) Ltd has led the implementation of the Voice linking and learning (L&lt;(&gt;&amp;&lt;)&gt;L) facilitation in Ugandasince April 2019 although Strategic Linkhas pioneered L&lt;(&gt;&amp;&lt;)&gt;L facilitation in Uganda since August 2018. This consortium has nurtured L&lt;(&gt;&amp;&lt;)&gt;L facilitation to grow into an inseparable part of Voice grantees in Uganda.
In the two and half years L&lt;(&gt;&amp;&lt;)&gt;L facilitation journey, we have appreciated the Voice goals,objectives and values particularly of; nothing for us without us, leave no one behind and putting the least and furthest first. These values have shaped our own values and we have been learnt new ideas on L&lt;(&gt;&amp;&lt;)&gt;L and unlearned our predetermined positions rightsholders needs.  This understanding and appreciation has positioned us to tailor interventions aimed at empowering the most vulnerable groups.  Our interventions are inclusive, employ self-led &lt;(&gt;&amp;&lt;)&gt; peer-to-peer skills transfer, experiential capacity building and learning as well as unlearning unhelpful language. We have adopted a mindset thatsets us apart from other technical experts and with this we position ourselves to identify and use existing resources among rightsholders to foster their empowerment.
In our facilitation role, we have acquired new knowledge, skills and experience which has enabled us become more creative and innovative in working with grantees and often helping them to explore new ways of working, creative approaches to problem solving and harnessing platforms that are often overlooked. We approach L&lt;(&gt;&amp;&lt;)&gt;L with the expertise in creatingsafe and inclusive spaces for rightsholders such as LGBTIQ and approaches that are vital in the current socio-political environment.
Our core role inleading the Voice Context Analysis Update 2020 in Uganda helped us to understand issues of intersectionality, the current vulnerabilities, challenges and needs of various categories of rightsholders (LGBTIQ, ethnic minorities, WEAV, the elderly, youth etc&#x2026;) and to determine some of the available resources, platforms and stakeholders that need to be engaged to uplift the status of the rightsholders. This experience positions us as knowledgeable L&lt;(&gt;&amp;&lt;)&gt;L Facilitators with in-depths understanding of the needs and aspirations of the Voice rightsholders and who are in position to facilitate their empowerment processes.
Our multidisciplinary team is comprised of facilitators with skills in ICT, use of innovative digital solutions, creation of inclusive and safe spaces,communication, knowledge exchange, story-telling, monitoring and learning, partnership, and capacity building, which sets us apart in the delivery of tailored interventions that grantees and rightsholders need during the current Covid-19 times to remainrelevant in pursuit of their development and empowerment.
We harness digital innovations and solutions that are responsive and support Voice grantees to be connected to each other using the web platform, WhatsApp platform and the online meetings. These platforms have enabled the rightsholders to stay connected including safe spaces for LGBTIQ on the digital platform, learn from one another and reposit their resources for further amplification.

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">LASPNET was registered in 2004 as an NGO as to provide a collaborative framework and strategic linkages for Legal Aid Service Providers (LAPS) in the country. The founders were heads of   Legal Aid service providers who Included Foundation for Human rights Initiative, Legal Aid Clinic of Law Development Centre, FIDA #U. The Network that has membership of 52 organizations across 70 districts.Through its membership, LASPNET   provides a   collective voice, to engage the sector on access to justice issuesthrough aimed at improving service delivery in the justice system.   The Network is established and governed by a General Assembly comprised of Legal Aid Service Providers from which the Board of Directors is elected every two years to provide oversight and policy implementation. The Executive Director who heads the Secretariat works closely with the Board of Directors in policy and institutional governance to facilitate   management of programmes and operations of the Network. LASPNET#s strength lies in the diverse membership and numbers spread across regions; system structures and tools like IIMS as well as our networking and collaborative platforms.

LASPNET champions three critical aspects of coordination:
i. A collective role of bringing together different LASPs in solidarity for strategizing, sharing lessons and experiences, while minimizing duplication;
ii. A capacitating role of ensuring improved quality standards among LASPs but also linking international / regional developments on legal aid to national interventions;
iii. A supportive role of documenting, providing needed feedback, and amplifying voice on key issues regarding access to justice and legal aid at regional and national levels.

The LASPNET programme framework mainly focuses on improving the quality, capacities, and standards of LASPs in Uganda as well as building the much-needed voice on pertinent issues and sustain institutional linkages with state actors so as to effectively complement government#s efforts in enhancing access to justice for the poor, marginalized, and vulnerable persons.

Integrating Gender.
LASPNET is an equal employer which doesn#t discriminate against any gender. Both male and female are given equal opportunityduring recruitment processes. For example, there are currently 12 female and 9 male staff. Under governance, the AGM amended the constitution to mainstream gender and ensure gender parity. There are currently 4 female and 6 male members on the board in addition to having a gender cluster which advocates for gender-based issues. More still, the organization supports youth as volunteers and interns through mentorship and coaching programmes as well as employing them when opportunities arise.


2. ACHIEVEMENTS
What have beenthe principal results in the past three years that contribute to significant, structural, sustained and positive improvement in thelives of men, women, girls and boys suffering from poverty, injustice, insecurity and exclusion?

For over 10 years the network hasgrown into a formidable platform of a group of NGOs that has excelled in research, lobbying and advocacy as well as facilitating capacity building to promote rule of law, good governance and access for justice for most poor and vulnerable through provision oflegal aid services and empowerment of rights holders. Its achievement include

Through research and documentation issues hindering access to justice and promotion of rule of law such corruption an institutional barriers to justice  are brought to the fore for JLOS consideration. Such information is disseminated at forums like   working group and committees of JLOS to which LASPNET represented, as well as at the LASPNET convened National level activities such as the Annual   Access to Justice Conference. Resolution and information from the Conferences   is utilised to contribute to institutional process reforms related to access to justice at National and sub-national level.

Networking &lt;(&gt;&amp;&lt;)&gt;Partnership
LASPNET has effectively galvanized efforts to LASPs to provide outreach activities like Legal aid open weeks. In addition and as a  result of its networking and partnerships, engagements, LASPNET has been able to  partner with the  Uganda Court bailiffs Association to support execution of cases for the poor and vulnerable; under the  coalition in Support of the independence ofthe Judiciary(CISJI) together with six other organizations which include: Foundation for Human Rights Initiative (FHRI), Center for Public Interest Law (CEPIL), Anti-Corruption Coalition Uganda (ACCU), Chapter Four Uganda, the Uganda Association ofWomenLawyers (FIDA-Uganda) and Uganda Law society (ULS) made a case for increased funding of the judiciary to the Legal and Parliamentary Affairs Committee upon which the budget was increased to cater for computerization of court and case backlog reduction;withthe Equal Opportunities Commission   under which both institutions will jointly conduct activities aimed at furthering the fulfilment of each other#s mandate through  legal awareness and sensitization, popularizing themandates of both institutions,case referrals, representing applicants at EOC tribunal sessions, joint lobbying and advocacy for improved legal and policy framework, among others; with National Social Security Fund(NSSF) &apos;s legal services department joint conduct quarterly legal aid clinics, case referral, legal advice and joint sensitization and awareness raising sessions on legal aid and relevant benefits to citizens such as through  legal aid clinic.  LASPNET participates in many national and regional based advocacy anddialogue meetingsconvened by various partners and makes contribution as participants, facilitator and or presenter on issues majorly those related to human rights, legal aid and access to Justice.

Lobbying&lt;(&gt;&amp;&lt;)&gt; Advocacy
LASPNET has supported tracking and analyzing government policies that are developed in various levels to ensure legal aid services are properly captured. Some of the targeted policies and legal framework include the National legal Aid Policy and Law and Administration of Justice Bill. In addition, and in collaboration with the Uganda Child Rights NGO Network (UCRNN) LASPNET was at the fore front of advocating amendment of the children# act. Furthermore, LASPNET is on the Steering committee for JLOS Justice for Children programme. Also LASPNET is a member of the taskforce developing standard operating procedures   for victim friendly justice to support child witnesses and victims of Sexual and Gender Based Violence.

LASPNET in conjunction with FIDA held a National Dialogue on the Revolving Status of theMarriage and Divorce Bill. In conjunction with the Ministry of Gender, Labour and Social Development, Save the Children and UCRNN organized a NationalChild Justice Conference and parallel session   on child justice for victims of violence. Also, LASPNEThas created awareness through several media campaigns and engagements creates awareness of all legal aid services among the public especially the poor, disabledand marginalized people

LASPNET has six cluster groups an arrangement that allows LASPs workingin specific cross cutting   issues to deliberate in emerging issues in the specific areas. These cluster groups include: Land Justice; Child Justice, Gender Justice; Criminal Justice; Traditional and Social Justice.   Within this realm, LASPNET synchronizes the execution of shared activities among LASPs with major emphasis on improving the quality of service delivery, monitoring and evaluation frameworks, supporting policy reform, capacity building initiatives, and promoting evidence based advocacy in setting the legal aid agenda, gender and child justice. For example the gender justice cluster has been at the fore forefront of advocacy efforts of the domestic relations act and the marriage and divorce bill.

To this end and given its experienceinaccessto justice and advocacy for rule of Law, LASPNET has been recognized as formidable civil society organisation in the area of partnership and collaboration as as evidenced with the recent Annual recognition award from the JLOS sector on#Partnershipand corroboration award 2016.# and community excellency award in Networking and Coordinating Legal aid service providers in 2017 from Muslim Centre for Justice and Law This recognition is informed by a series of engagement dialogues, meetings and research whichamong other include bringing to fore issues of access to justice and rule of law as well as advocating for the adoption of a National legal Aid Policy (NLAP).

Information Data Management
LASPNET#s coordination platform enables members to have a   collective voice on the issues of access to Justice and legal aid service provision in Uganda; the spread of network across the country provides support and advocacy intervention from bottom level to top. The platform also provides a forum to enhance the capacity of LASPs to provide professional quality service. Furthermore, LASPNET has an electronic based system of collecting and analysing information called the Integrated Information Management System (IIMS). LASPNET#s   IIMs is the standard casemanagementsystem that has improved the capacity of legal aid service providers to manage information through storage, reference and moderate reporting with trends analysis The development, hosting and nurturing of the IIMS has provided a platform for LASPNET to spearhead use of information technology to improve service delivery as well as to expand research and referral mechanism  as well as offer  basic legal advice through the social web application module.  Therefore this provides LASPNET with opportunity to continue innovating and making it user friendly with wider outreach to enable timely, and effective provision of the services to the poor and vulnerable. In addition, the incorporation of the electronic   standardized Means and Merit Test and a Client satisfaction survey to the IIMS to assess the impact and nature of services provided by the LASPs has enabled   improvement in services delivery by LASPs and aided to analyze case trends in the justice system with a view to informing intervention and policy changes appropriately. Also a sub-module to capture outreach activities of LASPs, GIS module that enables the location referral of clients to NGOs and JLOS service delivery points   and one that enables standardized modes of reportinghas been incorporated. This component will be linked to the JLOS information management system and ease tracking cases and to assess effectiveness and efficiency of the JLOS system.
