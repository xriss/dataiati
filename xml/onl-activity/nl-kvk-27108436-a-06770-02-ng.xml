  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">(DEC)Strength active citizen and system, in more broadly, this action contributes to SDG 1 and 2 in Nigeria (to end poverty in all its forms everywhere and end hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture). Italigns with the EU joint cooperation strategy in Nigeria that targets poverty alleviation, improved capacity of state and local governments to deliver quality of services and better coherence and coordination between the three tiers of governmentin respect of poverty alleviation programmes.  This action is part of what EU calls the Food Security and Sustainable Agriculture (FSSA) thematic instrument under the Global Public Goods and Challenges Programme (GPGC) and it contributes to the policy commitment through the component Supporting the poor and food insecure to react to crises and strengthen resilience#. That component addresses in particular food insecurity in countries in post-crisis situations and will support vulnerable populations to become moreresilient, thereby linking Relief Rehabilitation and Development. The global objective of OSAID is to enhance resilience to food shocks, chronic and acute food insecure people in post-food crisis by improving adaptation to climate change, combating desertification, promoting nutrition sensitive activities and policies and encouraging sustainable and resilient small scale agricultural practices. Finally, this action specifically aligns with the Agricultural Transformation Agenda (ATA) that recognizes the need for resilience development in smallholder farming and the National Agricultural Resilience Framework (NARF) on climate change. The NARF has articulated short and long- term strategiesto reduce food and nutrition vulnerability whilst enhancing environmental resilience and made provisions to:
-Encourage cultivationof drought tolerant crops and develop markets to support local food systems;
-Promote policies to improve water management;
-Promote weather index insurance schemes for farmers;
-Promote social safety net policiesto reduce vulnerability, especially for women and children.
The action will complement but not overlap with the ongoing food security programmes in the target States/ LGAs supported by various bilateral and multilateral programmes such as EU, DfID, SIDA, UNEP, IFAD, and the World Bank in Nigeria.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">DEC Nigeria is a membership, non-governmental, non-religious, non-political organization that provides social and microfinance services to women groups, communities and NGOs in Nigeria to enhance their capacity for sustainable development. The development exchange center was established in November 1987 as a result of a joint research conducted by the Canadian University Services Overseas(CUSO) and the Adult Non Formal Education Agency(ANFEA) Bauchi State.  The research findings showed that women especially those in ruralareas are greatly disadvantaged in both the social and economic terms-usually resulting from some harmful cultural practices, religious beliefs and coupled with a high degree of material poverty, thus making women highly dependent on men. There was a strong need by CUSO and ANFEA to establish a programme to respond and address this issue in a more sustainable way. The centre started as a resource center for the sharing and exchange of developmental information with women groups. DEC hascontinued to pursue its broad objective of empowering women through provision of entrepreneurial skills acquisition and development, training and capacity building workshops, water supply, sanitation and hygiene promotion, health care, education and information, good governance and peace building and microfinance services. DEC head office is located in Bauchi and currently working in 21 states; Bauchi, Gombe, Taraba, Adamawa, Yobe, Borno, Plateau, Nassarawa, Jigawa, Kano, Kebbi, Sokoto, Kaduna, Benue, katsina, Zamfara, Niger, FCT, Cross River, Kogi and Enugu. DEC has a membership strength of over 189,000 borrowers, 146,818 active savers in 7,400 groups, thus giving the center a good representation in the region with a potential of regional poverty alleviation.

A number of factors negatively impacts livelihoods in Taraba state, primary among them are human insecurity challenges and climate change.  Human insecurity challenges and political instability result from prolonged skirmishes of ethno-religious and land resource-based conflicts, which are exacerbated by an influx of internally displaced persons (IDPs) fleeing the Boko Haram insurgencyin Northeast Nigeria, entering Taraba by way of neighbouring Adamawa state. Climatological uncertainties aggravate an already vulnerable agricultural system, as temperatures and the rainfall pattern and distribution become less predictable, and communities face cycles of flooding and drought which negatively decrease production and shut down market opportunities along commodity value chains, thereby placing the Global Acute Malnutrition status of the statewithin the stressed threshold.  As such, the natural resources which poor people in rural areas depend on for their food security #land and water # are degradingin quality against a background of rising competition for their possession . The state#s population of over two million  now live in communities that are experiencing increased exposure to stressed food consumption status and their livelihoods is at crisis level,  with levels of stunting in children at 43% (higher than the Nigerian average of 37%).

The population of Taraba State is heavilyreliant on the agricultural economy, though there is little reliable data to indicate exact numbers (oneestimate is 80% of the population).   The Taraba State Government has identified a number of challenges to food production levels, including: lack ofinfrastructure such as warehouses/silos and market facilities; inadequate supply and distribution of improved agro-inputs; lack of lack of organised markets and weak private sector participation in agricultural development activities; and prevalence of farmer-herder conflicts.

In the light of the above, Oxfam proposes to grow a resilient commodity value chain and rural enterprise model that will benefit small-scale farmers in Taraba state, Nigeria. The action will fast-track agricultural productivity,promote access to markets, increase income, and improve socioeconomic stability in selected communities within the state.  Ultimately, small-scale farmers participating in this action will be able a) to produce (#PRO#) enough food to feed themselves andtheirhousehold; and b) produce a surplus of food that can be sold (#SELL#) into a market to sustain an income (together, #PROSELL#).The global objective of PRO-ACT is to enhance resilience to food shocks, chronic and acute food insecure people in post-food crisis by improving adaptation to climate change, combating desertification, promoting nutrition sensitive activitiesand policies and encouraging sustainable and resilient small scale agricultural practices. Finally, this action specifically aligns with the Agricultural TransformationAgenda (ATA) that recognizes the need for resilience development in smallholder farming and the National Agricultural Resilience Framework (NARF) on climate change. The NARF has articulated short and long- term strategies to reduce food and nutrition vulnerability whilst enhancing environmental resilience and made provisions to:
-Encourage cultivation of drought tolerant crops and develop markets to support local food systems;
-Promote policies to improve water management;
-Promote weather index insurance schemes for farmers;
-Promote social safety net policiesto reduce vulnerability,especially for women and children.
The action will complement but not overlap with the ongoing food security programmes in the target States/ LGAs supported by various bilateral and multilateral programmes such as EU, DfID, SIDA, UNEP, IFAD, and the WorldBank in Nigeria.</narrative>
