   <narrative xml:lang="EN">For about a decade, the security situation in the Tillab&#xE9;ry region of Niger has been characterized by incursions by non-state armedgroups (NSAGs) committing abuses (abductions, forced recruitment into armed groups, extortion of valuables and money/zakat, threats, physical violence, targeted or mass killings) against the civilian population, particularly persons linked to the state or presumed to be linked to the state, thereby violating their fundamental rights. Worse, during the recent attacks, elements of GANEs systematically destroyed food stocks, shelters and extorted livestock. Cases of gender-based violence are also reported with the impositionof veils and the abduction of women and girls without ransom.  This security situation, which is very worrying in the north-Malian border and in the Tri-border area (Burkina Faso-Mali-Niger), has also led to an increase in crime and banditry in the region and a deepening of the social fractures between sedentary and nomadic people, farmers and herders, and inter-ethnic rivalries, which are historical sources of tension. In addition, it has limited access to natural resources.
It should be noted that the Tillab&#xE9;ry region, where more than 85% of households live from subsistence farming, is already among the most vulnerable in Niger. It is confronted with the recurrence of extreme climatic phenomena (drought and floods) that affect food security and the livelihoods of the population.Moreover, the last meeting of the Harmonized Framework of November 2020, estimated that nearly 15% of its population would be food insecure at some point in the year. The SMART survey reveals a prevalence of GAM among children aged 6 to 59 months of age of 9% in this region. On the other hand, the populations of the Tillab&#xE9;ry region also seasonally face peaks of endemic diseases such as Cholera, malaria, etc... due to inadequate WAH infrastructure and practices. Indeed, 41% of the population of Tillab&#xE9;ry use drinking water from unimproved sources according to the EVIAM 2020 survey. Tillab&#xE9;ry is also one of the regions most affected by the second wave of COVID 19. As of January 11, 2021, there were 260 confirmed cases, including 35 health workers and 16 deaths. Also, during the month of December 2020, 53 protection incidents with 83 victims were recorded in the Tillab&#xE9;ry region.
It is in this already very fragile context that the intervention on Saturday, January 2, 2021, in the villages of Tchamobangou and Zaroumadareye - one of the most barbaric attacks ever perpetrated by GANEs against civilian populations since the beginning of this insecurity in Niger - took place.The appalling toll of this attack is 105 civilians dead, including 32 in Zaroumdarey and 73 in Tchomabongou, and 26 others wounded by gunfire. This event is said to be in retaliation for the refusal of these communities to pay the Zakat imposed by the terrorists and was mainly aimed at the able-bodied arms of the said villages. As a result, a large number of women and children are among the displaced. There is also a significant number of living stock (granaries) burned down and livestock taken away by the GANES during the attack (Report No. 28/2021/RRM/ACTED and Report of the Joint Rapid Multisectoral Mission to MANGAIZE of 12 and 13 January 2021).
By the way, the identified site is that of the former Mangaiz&#xE9; refugee camp located on the side of a military post. With recent attacks on certain military bases in the region, in particular the tragic ones of Inates and Sinegodar with important registers registered by the national army, internally displaced persons are at risk of being caught cross-country. in case of attack on the military position of Mangaiz&#xE9;, potential target of terrorists.
Following this attack, a joint assessment conducted by humanitarian actors with the facilitation of OCHA revealed that as of January 13, 2021, a total of 1,045 households or approximately 7,315 people had moved to Mangaize. These include forcibly displaced persons and those who have preventively left the surrounding villages. They are living with host families, already affected by a deficient agricultural season (Ouallam is one of the 17 departments of Niger exposed to severe food insecurity according to the Harmonized Framework meeting), the effects of insecurity and related security measures. In theearly hours of their arrival, their daily lives were assured thanks to the solidarity of the host populations, as well as the support of good wills and assistance provided by the Nigerien State. Relations between the host communities and the displaced are so far good. Moreover, these displaced persons are reluctant to any idea of relocation to an easily identifiable host site, fearing possible incursions by GANEs elements.
The joint assessment noted that the urgent needs are enormous and multi-sectoral (Food Security, Shelter and NFI, Protection, Education and WASH) related to the fact that in their flight the populations have abandoned practically everything and that the host families have no great capacity to receive them. This exposes both the displaced and their hosts to risksof overcrowding, which can lead to protection risks, tensions and even conflicts; the displaced may be perceived as intruders when the emotional impact of these attacks, which are rarely violent in allcommunities, wears off. It should also be noted that during the joint assessment, some households requested support to initiate economic empowerment and the rehabilitation of productive assets through IGAs and livestock. It should be noted that Mangaiz&#xE9; has a large market that remains functional with a similar level of supply before and after the attack, and traders maintain that they can react quickly to any increase in demand. Mangaize also has a renowned livestock market.
Following the multiple GANESattacks, the Humanitarian Coordinator was notified by letter No. 005/MAH/GC/SG/DSHU dated January 12, 2021 by Niger&apos;s Minister of Humanitarian Action and Disaster Management (MAH/GC) to provide food and NFI supportto 5,923 households affected by GANES attacks in Ouallam, Bankilar&#xE9; and Toumour. Oxfam, an active member of humanitarian actors in Niger, intends to contribute to the response to this request made by the MAH/GC.
The table below shows us the situation of needs andthe response. It is necessarytoemphasize for this response of the actors are set the time to mobilize the funds. This explains why,they did not quantify their response and consequently the GAPs remain current for these lines.

Experience in humanitarian intervention: Oxfam, presentin Niger since 1992, is an active member of the humanitarian community playing a solid reputation in humanitarian intervention. This latter has been constructed since 2005, through interventions, direct or indirect through partner intermediaries in all regions: Agadez, Diffa, Dosso, Maradi, Niamey, Tahoua, Tillab&#xE9;ry and Zinder. Oxfam humanitarian interventions in Niger, on own funds or in partnerships with various donors (ECHO, USAID, SIDA, OFDA, Coop&#xE9;ration Suisse, GFDRR, DIFID&#x2026;), cover several sectorswith food security and means of subsistence; de l&#x2019;Eau, Hygiene Assainissement; the protection; conflict management, forced human displacements, DRR&#x2026; etc.
In the Tillab&#xE9;ry region, affected by the drama object of this fund request, Oxfam has contributedto respond, in close coordination with other humanitarian actors, to several humanitarian emergencies we can recall:
&#xF02D; The floods of 2010, 2012;
&#xF02D; The reception, installation and assistance of refugees in the Abala, Mangaiz&#xE9; and Tabarbarey camps from 2012 to2015;
&#xF02D; Recent food and pastoral crises (2005, 2007, 2010, 2015, 2016, 2017);
&#xF02D; Assistance to N&apos;zouet&apos;s internal displacements in 2018
These actions on various humanitarian sectors have always been carried out in collaboration with local actors (administrative and customary authorities, beneficiary communities) and often in partnership with civil society organizations (NGOs and Associations). Despite the volatile security situation and the security measures taken by the authorities in the area since2017 (State of emergency decreed with restrictive measures), Oxfam is still present and working with local actors in favor of the most vulnerable populations .
In order to ensure the implementation of projects on the ground and for effective participation in coordination with partners at the ground level,Oxfam has since 2011 set up an operating office in Ouallam (Tillab&#xE9;ry region) that works with &apos; support of the national bureau.
It should be recalled that since 2019, Oxfam has been implementing the Peace Building TOC 13 project in the Tillabery region in partnership with REPPAD through Danida funds. This project intervenes in the department of Ouallam, notably in the Commune of Tondikiwindi,of which Mangaiz&#xE9; is one of the villages.  The interventiontakes place in the village of Tondikiwindi located at about fifty (50) km from Mangaiz&#xE9;. Access to the intervention zone: to facilitate access to the zone in complete security, the civil-military coordination of the Tillab&#xE9;ry region asks all actors to communicate their planning for ground movements. To this effect, a chronogram misplaced by OCHA has been provided and submitted for approval the week preceding the mission. Oxfam regularly participates in monthly meetings of the Civil-Military Coordination.
Local authorities have taken the commitment to secure the Ouallam-Mangaiz&#xE9; axis (location of displacement).
Oxfam also has a security adviser who will assess the situation. Before each mission each member must submit a security clearance request.</narrative>
