   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Women Peace Makers (known as WPM) began as a youth and women-led peacebuilding network in 2000 comprising of mostly female university students who were particularly concerned about conflict and violence against women in their communities. In 2003, WPM formally registered as a non-profit and non-governmental organization in Cambodia and began to focus its efforts on empowering women, youth, and communities to address conflict non-violently and to stand up for women#s rights through community mobilization,awareness raising,and capacity building on issues related to women#s rights protection and conflict transformation.

Organization vision is WPM envisions a peaceful and gender just society where everyone, regardless of identity and ability, can live free from violence and reach their full potential.

WPM&apos;s mission is works to support the empowerment of women and youth, transform conflict, and prevent violence,including gender-based violence, by providing creative tools and space for dialogue, deeperunderstanding, and strategic intervention on issues of gender and peace.

Today#s WPM is the culmination of over a decade-and-a-half of action and learning in the field with a vision for a peaceful and gender-just society where everyone, regardless ofidentity and ability, can reach their full potential and live free from violence. Since its inception in 2003, WPM has been working very closely with communities across the country, including minority groups, on issues on women, girls, and conflict. WPM hasthus established its long-term commitment, skills, experience and relationship in the community it serves. Over the past two years, WPM has been initiating, piloting and evolving its localisedinformation gathering methodology, called Facilitative Listening Design (FLD), in order to better understand difficult and sensitive topics directly from the perspectives of communities and bring their voices to target audiences for uptake. FLD has been tested insensitive contexts including negative-sentiment against ethnic groups, perceptions of #the Other# along border areas, and understanding perspectives from adolescent girls in minority groups. The learning from FLD has continued to inform interventions and WPM#s direction in addressing a wide range of issues.

WPM is grounded in its approach and community voices inform all of its continued learning and strategic direction. At the national level, WPM serves as a steering committee member of the Gender and Development Network(GADNet), a network of 43 NGOs and individuals working on gender and development throughout the country. It is also an active member of The Cambodian NGOs Committee on Convention on the Elimination of all forms of Discrimination Against Women (NGO-CEDAW), and of the United Nations YouthAdvisory Panel (UNYAP).</narrative>
