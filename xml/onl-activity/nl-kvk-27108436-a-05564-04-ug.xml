   <narrative xml:lang="EN">LGIHE will coordinate co-creation, adaptation and continued development of the curricula for Uganda and South Sudan, with participation from Oxfam, AVSI, UNATU, FAWEU and relevant MoEST/TTC actors.

Also, the organisation will provide technical supportto a network of TEPD facilitators who will then benefit from ongoing professional capacity development during project duration through facilitated peer-to-peer activities and 6 targeted 1-day thematic trainings.

LGIHE will guide the partners in the implementation of the psycho social work package for teachers offering technical expertise and orientation. The implementing partners will manage the intervention within the existing coordination mechanisms (State and National Education Cluster in SSD).

Will hold responsibility for specific activities according to capacity and experience. LGIHE represents a unique perspective contributing to the multi-faceted approach to quality education in conflict and crisis. As local actors they have an important roleto play in transition across the humanitarian-development nexus.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Luigi Giussani Institute of Higher Education (LGIHE) was founded by Rose Busingye, Founder and President of Meeting Point International (MPI) and Dr. George William Pariyo, a renowned Scientific Researcher with the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.
Our educational journey started with a simple dialogue among 5 friends in Uganda whose discussion mainly entailed education challenges that we recurring in the country by then and possible ways on how to address them. As a result, professional development trainings were born that culminated into the official registration of the institute in 2009.

With a need to grow further, coupled with a high demand from teachers to offer academic programmes that could enable them advance in their vocation, Luigi Giussani Institute of Higher Education (LGIHE) obtained accreditation as an institution of higher learning by the National Council for Higher Education.
 2. ACHIEVEMENTS
What have been the principal results in the past three years that contribute to significant, structural, sustained and positive improvement in the lives of men, women, girls and boys suffering from poverty, injustice, insecurity and exclusion?

Highly competent staff were hired, trained and increasingly involved in project development, quality improvement and outreach. Four education officers (facilitators) and one Monitoring and Evaluation (M&lt;(&gt;&amp;&lt;)&gt;E) officer were hired. This improved the quality of services offered.
# The evaluation of our basic teacher training package was carried out with a rigorous methodology (control group difference in difference comparison) in collaboration with a top US university (Notre Dame University) and utilizing both quantitative andqualitative expertise and methodologies.
Major findings of the study
- An increase in the quality of teacher-pupil relationship (trust): The assessment found out that the LGIHE trainings enhance teachers# awareness about the importance of a friendlier, familiar and open relationship between teachers and students whichenables learners to participate freely in class.
- An enhanced awareness amongst the teachers that learners have innate desires and abilities
- A change of attitude towards teaching that affirms that is more of a discovery moment in which the learners are at the centre of the educational process, and play a pro-active role.
- An increasedawareness of child development as related to teaching especially among the teachers that received the full and light program.
- A reduction in violent discipline especially from the students# view: The qualitative research revealed positive examples of teachers and head teachers changing their perception on appropriate methods of discipline other than using physical punishment.
- An increasedlearners# perception that teachers use collaborative and active learning methods: The qualitative analysis reveals how teachers aremore willing to give learners more chances to ask questions, participate and contribute their own ideas in class.
- An increased conviction of education as communication of an approach to life. Teachers now show understanding of the comprehensive value of education in both urban and rural settings.
- An increased collaboration among teachers: The qualitative research found that some teachers andhead teachers sometimes reflect on the content of LGIHE#s workshops as a way to improve their daily activities and try to build amore #familiar# environment. Positive changes in teachers/head teachers# behaviour toward their own families. One of the most interesting findings of the research was that the workshops have introduced a new modality of relationship between teachers/head teachersand their own families.
# The institute made important improvements to the existing set of courses offered. The institute redefinedand improved on the existing short re-training courses. Past experience underscored the importance of developing the teachers# awareness of their role, and the meaning of education. A new continuous professional development training coursewas improved and furtherdeveloped with the specific aim of improving on teachers# pedagogical approach (basic pedagogy, taxonomy of learning objectives andpositive discipline) and didactic approach (lesson planning, creativity in teaching, teaching methodologies, use of monitoring instruments). The institute also further refined the complementary support to training workshops, which includes classroom observations and teachers# coaching sessions with the help of a comprehensive monitoring tool which wasdeveloped in the course of the project.
# The institute was recognized by the Ministry of Education and Sports (MoES), through the National Council for Higher Education (NCHE), as an institute of higher education, with the new name, Luigi Giussani Institute of Higher Education (LGIHE).
# A thorough financial and operational capacity analysis was carried out by an external consultant, resulting in a sophisticated guide to long-term planning by the institute .
