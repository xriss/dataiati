  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">the project &quot;Collective Voice and Action for Migrants Workers rights&quot; will be implemented by M.net - a network of local NGOs for the Rights of Migrant workers at national level.

The project aims that &quot;Migrant workers and informal workers, especially female workers in rural and sub-urban areas, are empowered to claim their better access to social protection and employment&quot;. Its specific objective is &quot;The Network of Action for Migrant Workers - M.net is strengthened to represent and influence other stakeholders, especiallypolicy makers, to improve policies for migrant workers# rights&quot;. To achieve this, the project  will focus on 3 main strategies, include:
1. build capacity for migrant workers# leaders to analyse their issues, and organize, inspires migrant workers to join the migrant worker network to decide on the design, implementation and evaluation of their own working agenda .
The project will connect the existing sets of migrant group/club that are supporting by M.net members and other organizations under a Core Migrant Group. Core workers group (CWG) including representatives from migrant workers groups supported by Mnet members and other existing groups in different provinces (Bac Ninh, Dong Nai, HCMC, Hai Duong, Vinh Phuc, Ha Noi...). They are taking or formal employment in the industrialzones or informal employments (as domestic work, garbage collection, street vending, services#). These members of the group will play a role as a connected line between the Group and their set of groups and, in cooperation with M.net, create collective and uniquevoice/actions at national level. The group will be formed through sharing workshop/forum and be strengthened with jointly activities.
2. Strengthen M.net and make it well organized to be able to develop policy recommendation/proposal with support from its constituencies and allies
Improved access to social protection for migrant workers needs an improvement in policies. This will only come with sustained representation. Policy and policy change happen when pressure, information and campaigning are linked through all levels - workers linked to their organizations that in turn link into networks and alliances.
The Network of Action for Migrant Workers, M.net, has been established by Vietnamese nongovernmental organizations working on rights of migrant workers since October 2014. Theprimary purpose of the network is to enhance the evidence-based policy advocacy by engaging with and creating equal opportunities for migrant workers, especially informal migrant workers, in social protection framework in Vietnam. Currently M.net has 6 members, one coordinator and LIGHT as coordinating organization. But there is no clear structure on Management Board, Advisory Board and otherfunctions.   All of the members have specific expertise, including community intervention, legal advice, research and working for their owned targeted group# However their knowledge on other kind of migrants group is still weak. Their jointly actions are limited.
The project will use M.net as a starting point for a united and strong network for the right of migrant workers and make effective influence at national level. At the same time with support Core Migrant Group, the project will build capacity for M.net, support M.net to be well organized and improve their jointly actions with support from its constituencies and allies.
3. Support M.net and migrant workers leaders increased advocacy capacity and practise their collective voice and action to enhance migrants# access to social protection with improved support from governments
If the 2 above strategies try to influence separately Core Migrant Group and M.net # representative organizations of migrant worker, the 3nd one will focus on strengthen the link between Core MigrantGroup and M.net through support M.net and migrant workers leaders to increased advocacy capacity and practise their collective voice and action to enhance migrants# access to social protection with improved support from governments. The project will support M.net and migrant workers leaders conduct research, pilot model and policy and practise change advocacy activities.

The project in combination with other 4 projects developed and carried out by M.net#s members will create a comprehensive strategy which makes influence at all levels(migrant workers, migrant group and migrants# leader network/group). The other 4 projects carried out by M.net#s members will target at specific kind of migrant workers. They will build capacity for migrant workers on relevant skills and knowledge to fulfil theirrights in accessing social protection services and establish and develop migrants# representation under the organic form of self-help groups. At higher level, the project will target at migrants# leaders, built their capacity and support them to actively joint into M.net and make influence and engage other stakeholders such as governmental agencies, social organizations, institutions and communities for improvement in policy to equal access to social protection of migrant workers. The advocacy activities run by the project are also supported from other 4 projects developed and carried out by M.net#s members. All advocacy campaigns will be proposal by other project carried out by M.net#s members and a jointly action plan will be developed with support and participation of all its members. These action plans will be designed in reviewing other 4 projects developed and carried out by M.net#s members to ensure that all are linked and support together.
