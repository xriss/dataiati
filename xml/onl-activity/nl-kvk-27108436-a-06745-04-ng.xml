Background
Achieving poverty reduction, promoting gender equality and empowering women and girls are key interlinked ambitions in three of the seventeen Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development: SDG 1 and 2 on, No poverty &lt;(&gt;&amp;&lt;)&gt; Zero Hunger and Goal 5 on Gender Equality.  The sustainable development goals (SDGs) explicitly recognize that undertaking actions to give women equal rights to economic resources, as well as access to ownership and control over land and other forms of property, financial services, inheritance and natural resources, in addition to enabling technology, in particular information and communicationswill not only promote the empowerment of women and girls at all levels but in greater collaboration  promote development and reducepoverty. When women have the same opportunities, access to resources, and life choices as men, the benefits extend far beyond womenthemselves. As women work to strengthen their families and communities, they foster theeducation and health of the next generation,hasten economic growth, and strengthen public and private institutions.
Nigeria is the Africa&#x2019;s most populous nation with an estimated population of about 203million people in 2019 . A figure that has put thecountry as the 7th most populous country in the world. Around 50% of them are Hausa-Fulani, Yoruba and Igbo tribes. These tribes dominated two main regional parts of the country namely: North and South. Muslims majority from the North and/or minority in the South account for more than 50% of the entire population, 40%are Christians mainly in the South with significant amount in the North. 10% are traditional African believers. Despite various efforts and concerns showed by local and international human rights groups, women, who account almost half of the entire population, generally lagged behind in all aspects of life (economically, socially, politically and intellectually). The current dimensional studies lead to discover that modern Nigerian women are on the lowest rung of poverty condition. This is due in part to harmful social norms which have prevented change from happening, with women still frequently seen as being wives and caregivers; over a quarter of people think that &#x2018;a university education ismore important for a boy or man&#x2019;. This has made girls in many parts of the country more likely to be involved in child domestic work than boys. Intellectually, higher proportion of Nigerian men goes to school than that of women, thus neither their participation in forming nor administering the government is yet matured. Perhaps, religion and tradition are used as instruments of women oppression in Nigeria.

In Nigeria, women are disadvantaged compared to men in terms of both education and earnings, factors that greatly influence the health of women and children. Overall, 38% of women age 15-49 have received no formal education compared to 21% of men age 15-49. Likewise, the majority of women that were employed in the 12 months before the survey earn less than their husbands. Gender inequality in Nigeria is influenced by different cultures and beliefs. In most parts of  Nigeria, women are considered subordinate to their male counterparts, especially in Northern Nigeria. It is generally believed that women are best suited as home keepers.
However, sustainable development and change at scale will only be achievable when systems, power structures, cultures and practices at the households level, communities and governments are challenged and made to function effectively to the benefit of the people. People-centered policies and pro-poor programmes of governments that are delivered through transparent and accountable frameworks in which the people are involved in the entire process remains critical to theprocess of lastingchange. Oxfam will therefore be working with its partners to advance the cause of facilitating more responsive governance systems, inclusive processes, and participatory approaches by empowering people and building active citizenship at the grassroots to lead theprocess of change. This project will be creating a movement of grassroots citizens who know their rights, have capacities to demandfor improved social services, and organized to challenge inefficiencies in government and market systems and promote women&#x2019;s rightsto realize their full potentials
Description of strategic objective/goal
In a bid to reduce the gap, Oxfam in Nigeria has been implementing several projects to build the adaptive capacity and improve the resilience of small scale women farmers in Northern Nigeriausing the Village Savings and Loans Association (VSLA) methodology alongside other interventions which have increased income and improved the livelihoods of small scale farmers in the areas where we work. To date, Oxfam interventions through this scheme has reached about 200,000 right claimants clustered into about 10,000 VSL groups who are equally organized into umbrella Federations (VSLFs),to form a critical mass of women and men as an interconnected socialmovement with greater power to influence unequal social and economic norms thereby transforming their socio-economic status and being able to influence change at all levels- family, community, local government and even the state level. Oxfam in Nigeria hasalso continued to integrate gender across all her projects and programmes, through targeted gender programming interventions.
The objectives of this project are to:
1) Stimulate grassroots movement of active citizens for the promotion of accountable andresponsible governance systems (household, community, Local/State);
2) Deepen financial inclusion system that supports inclusive rural economic development;
3) Strengthen commodity market systems that works for thebenefits of the rural poor using gender-oriented approaches; and
4) Promote gender justice and women economic empowerment through responsive government policies.

The above objectives will be delivered through a mix of approaches that use financial inclusion as the entry point for the mobilization and organization of the people as financial resources and sustainable incomes are important factors to liberate the army of those whose voices have been gagged by poverty and marginalization. The VSL (Association/Federation) hasproven to be Oxfam&#x2019;s flagship model of getting communities together to drive far-reaching initiatives that will engender lasting and sustainable change across different levels. Activities to deliver on the objectives will be carefully designed and layered onto the financial equality methodology of the VSL.
These proposed interventions will therefore seek to among other things:
&#x2022; Scale up the creation of the umbrella VSLFs and strengthen the capacities of existing VSL Federation to engage local authorities on issues affecting farmers, women and youths.
&#x2022; Stimulate smallholder farmers to claim livelihood outcomes from their duty bearers in Plateau and Nasarawa State.
&#x2022; Organize events that call for collective actions (with participation of male gender champions),ledbywomen networks and VSLFs coalition to make demands to local authorities and account for socio-economic and gender injustices.
&#x2022; Build capacities ofVSLA groups and communities to recognize and value unpaid care and domestic work and the need to support women through shared responsibility within the household and the family to make women more productive.
&#x2022; Strengthen the capacity of partners, women and youthson local government and community policy influencing, advocacy, and budget monitoring.
&#x2022; Integrate community development planning (CDP) into communities to strengthen community governance process and participation in government where communities are involved in LGA/State level full budgeting cycle contributing towards agenda setting, budgettracking and demand for accountability and transparency and ultimately better services
&#x2022; Train and build capacity of women and youths on gender transformative leadership, political participation, and active citizenship with the purpose of laying the ground for more women&#x2019;s participation in councillorship and chairmanship in their LGA in the next 2023 elections
&#x2022; Establish strategic partnership with women&#x2019;s right organizations and key gender stakeholders through the observance of strategic internationalgender days(e.g. International women day, International day of the Girl Child, 16 Days Activism Against Gender Based Violence &lt;(&gt;&amp;&lt;)&gt; International Human Rights Day)
&#x2022; Support the activities of Oxfam&#x2019;s global Enough Campaign in Nigeria, a global campaign on the elimination of violence against Women and Girls (EVAWG), which aims at lowering the social acceptance and prevalence of VAWG by addressing its underpinning social norms.
