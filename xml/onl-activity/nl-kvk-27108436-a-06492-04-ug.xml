   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In 2014, we saw Refugee Youth being the victims of the conflict and all forms of violence#s in South Sudan while escaping the 2013 Crisis, during transits, in reception Centers and in the clusters where they were settled by Office Prime Minister. We understood that Peaceful coexistence, love hope and recovery was vital given the high level of trauma, communities need to have a strong voice tostand for their needs. The gap between NGOs and Refugee Youth in the communities has to be bridged in a conflict sensitive manner as well as recognizing the Youth as potential partners for Peace and that led to the foundation  of Youth Social Advocacy Team.
 In June 2015, Five Young people (John Jal Dak, Amuna Vivian, Jacob Nhial Bol, Tabule Geoffrey, Narcisse Bakouroua) came up with an idea of Advocating for Youth Voices calling for Peace in Rhino Camp luckily our Team leader john Jal Dak was nominated for the UNHCR  Global Refugee Youth Consultations (GRYC) and while the final report was released, we got our organization name was add the word #Youth# that excite us given our founders being all young people, we resolved to rename Social Advocacy Team as #Youth Social Advocacy Team# . In July 2016 Full constitution was drafted, membership was established and key Voluntary Positions of Chairperson, Vice, Secretary General, Treasurer and Information were fully established. In March 2017, we got our registration as a community based organization and during the Word Refuge Day 2017, we were offered Office Space by DRC,UNHCR and OPM Jointly in Ocea A Village behind CatholicChurch of Nationals, this was our first recognition as one of the first refugee led CBOs in Rhino to start freshly in Uganda. In September 2017, we got our first partnership with r0g Agency in Berlinto implement #defyhatenow project. The organization attracted 26Youth Volunteers but with only 4 Female Volunteers the lowest ever# but now we are happy that we have more than 10 females and Advocate for more in order to close the gap. YSAT is in a process of registering as a National NGO in Uganda and South Sudan.
2. ACHIEVEMENTS
We have created awareness about peaceful coexistence to over 10,000 Youth, Women and Children through open air Music concerts,Dialogues, and conferences since 2017 in RhinoCamp and Omugo Extension. YSAT initiated the resolution of Tika Refugee Conflict, calling for the first ever Inter Cultural Dialogue for South Sudanese Refugees targeting the 64 tribes of South Sudanese Refugees as Non Violent Action to reconcile and heal the broken relationship between the communities that fought, as we talk now, Tika was announced during the Peace Campaign we held in Ocea Zone in January 2019 as #Peaceful Zone# by OPM/UNHCR jointly. We were able to partner with 6 Renown National &lt;(&gt;&amp;&lt;)&gt; International Organizations including Oxfam Novib, Norwegian Peoples Aid (NPA), and r0g Agency for Open Culture in Berlin, African Non Profit Chore (ANCHOR), The Nexus Fund, PeaceTech Lab. We were able to record 80,000 USD Grant Fundsin the 2018/19 Fiscal Yearfor YSAT.
