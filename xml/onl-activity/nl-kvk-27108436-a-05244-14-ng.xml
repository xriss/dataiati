This concept- &apos;Access to Justice &lt;(&gt;&amp;&lt;)&gt; Political Participation for PWD&apos; aims at the following:
(a) ensure that within the project period, relevant MDAs have a better understanding of the Disability Act/Law and  commit to adopting good and accountable practices to advance the implementation including budgetary allocation.  (b) The media commits toinvestigative journalism on disability issues that will expose every discriminatory practices including gender violence against women with disabilities. (c) The democratic governance process will be inclusive enough for political participation of persons with disabilities in Lagos State as a model for other states. (d) accessible education and health services for PWDs in public hospitals  in Lagos State.

Solution proposed is through engagement/advocacy, litigation, naming and shaming.  Through this project, CCD will engage relevant stakeholders in Lagos State to sensitize them and build their capacity where necessary on disability issues.  There is aneed to set precedent by engaging in a few litigation advocacies in the key areas.  Therewill be naming and shaming of people that frustrate the process.</narrative>
