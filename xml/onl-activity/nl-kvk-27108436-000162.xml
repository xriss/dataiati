As a country programme we are cognisant of the fact that even if we have  worked on gender equality programmes from different angles before the Norms approach is a relatively new approach in which we need to learn and deepenour thinking as we proceed.  In  its  early  phases  the  programme  will  therefore  include  a  research  work to  learn  what  approaches  have  worked  elsewhere  in  other  countries  or  in  other programmes locally.

Considering the role of family level elders, traditional leaders and schools in shaping attitudes  towards  women,  CSO  led  advocacy  for  changed  perceptions  will  target these  institutions  and  engage  men  and  boys  in  the  process.    The  programme  also seeks to bring a different understanding around unpaid care work at the family and community level as it has a bearing on women reaching their full potential.

Role  models  will  be  identified  to  inspire  girls  and  families  while  institutions  will  be assisted to develop a greater understanding and application of the legal framework within which they are required to function in enhancing changes for women.

Oxfam  in  Mozambique  will  also  participate  in  the  Global  organisational  campaigns promoting Women#s rights.</narrative>
