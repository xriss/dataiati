   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Increased Access to Mining Devel-ANSA</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">A Community mining development fund has been created since 2015 by Ministry of Mine and Energy (MME) with the contribution from non-fiscal revenues (royalties, fees, fines penalties) from mining companies.
It appeared obvious that communities near mining sites have been affected so they should receive benefits from this fund through funding community development projects.
In early 2020, MME has granted mining licence to 14 mining companies to make exploration in Siem Reap, Mondulkiri and Kampong Thom, Stung Treng and Kratie and Preah Vihea. The number of mining exploration will be increased in the next few years and community mining development fund will be increased accordingly.
Ministry of Mine and Energy (MME) has the amount of fund that has been accumulatively collected and earmarked for the community mining development fund since 2015 is 3.3 million USD. The challenge so far is that the Ministry of Mines and Energy only disbursed 14% of this fund by mid 2019. With this small disbursement capacity, another challenge is that the Ministry so far has approved only projects related to small infrastructures, irrigations, public facilities. NGOs have encouraged and advocated MME to broaden the scope of projects to be eligible and be funded such as projects related public interest such as water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH), food security, health and education infrastructure and community centred facility which serve public interest and livelihoods to be supported under this fund. It seems that both specific communities affected by mining and MME lack information, knowledge, experiences and guidelines to disburse the amount for the right purpose for community-based development projects.

The overall objective indicates the longer term objective towards which the project is expected to contribute. The overall objectiveis related to the overall problem and the impact that the project is seeking to contribute to (globally, regionally or per country). It usually addresses the well-being of the target group in terms of quality of life improvement. In the case of an existing Oxfam Program the project is part of, please refer to the Program objective here.

The specific objective(s) are related to the concrete achievements that the project will try to obtain. For most projects it is sufficient to include only one specific objective. There should be no more than three specific objectives.
(maximum &#xBD; page)
&#x2022; A practical SOP will be developed in consultation with MIME, SNAsCSOs, and community to improve effectiveness and efficiencies of the fund to respond to the potentially increased demand by local communities for livelihood development.
&#x2022; Affected communities are able to access mining development fund to address their issues, contribute to community development and livelihood improvement.&#x201D;</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Affiliated Network for Social Accountability Cambodia</narrative>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Affiliated Network for Social Accountability (ANSA Cambodia) is a local non-profit and independent NGO that works to fight against corruption, promote human welfare, and protect citizen rights through the promotion of good governance. ANSA Cambodia initiates independent Social Accountability (SA) approaches while supplementing the existing public social accountability framework endorsed by the Royal Government of Cambodia.
ANSA Cambodia still continues the valued mission and specifies the area of work in Cambodia and other related Lower Mekong Sub-region (LMS) country. As a multinational network with ANSA in East Asia and the Pacific (ANSA-EAP) and ANSA Global, we collectively define good governance as a way of decision-making and implementation of public development programs that aim to achieve desirable and beneficial results for both those who govern and those who are being governed. The key to good governance is the relationship between the government and its citizens, and their ability to constructively engage with each other.
Social Accountability (SAc) is the concept and practice of this constructive engagement between citizens and their government; citizensmonitor the government&#x2019;s use of public resources to improve service delivery, protect their rights, and promote community welfare. Beyond monitoring, ANSA enables citizens to voice their issues and concerns through coalition building and the use of communication and media. Through these methods, ANSA is able to influence public policy and improve public accountability.
VISION: ANSA Cambodia envisions Cambodia developing into a country where citizens are capable and collaborative and a society with integrity, dignity and full of freedom in accordance to national and international laws.
MISSION: ANSA Cambodia is to enhance citizen capacity, fight against corruption, and promote good governance to improve public service deliveries, public resources as well as natural resource management. ANSA Cambodia works with all policy and decision makers and stakeholders to benefit human rights, community welfare and povertyreduction.
GOAL: ANSA Cambodia aims to make Cambodian citizens capable of building a society of good governance, integrity, democracy, human rights and better economy.
