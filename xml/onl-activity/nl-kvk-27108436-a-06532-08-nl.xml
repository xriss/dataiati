   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The objective of the covenant is described, among other things, in chapter 1 of the covenant. With this Covenant, the Parties aim to prevent, mitigate and / or have remedied (or have remedied) negative consequences of investments by pension funds on society and the environment. The Parties want the agreement to fulfill the expectations for pension funds (PF) arising from the OECD guidelines and the UNGPs. In this Covenant, for example, the Parties seek cooperation in order to achieve a more sustainable society with due regard for everyone&apos;s responsibility and possibilities. The Parties have made agreements for this along a &quot;Wide Track&quot; and a &quot;Deep Track&quot;. The aim of the Broad Track is to accelerate the implementation of the OECD guidelines and UNGPs throughout the sector with an approach that is applicable to all Dutch PFs. Agreements are made about this embedding in PF&apos;s policy, outsourcing to External Service Providers and monitoring and reporting by PF. In the Deep Track, the Parties involved work together on concrete Cases to mitigate and / or remedy the negative impact of companies in which PF invests. Cases with - in any case - a social component are chosen. Thisproject supports the efforts of trade unions and NGOs in realizing concrete, executiveactivities resulting from their participationin the various SWG.
SWG Themes; In this working group, the Parties will coordinate and work on the development, as well as highlighting and, where necessary, explaining substantive thematic frameworks, whichcan be used by the PF for the (further) development of their thematic policy.
SWG Knowledge Sessions and Meetings: for the support of PF (and implementers) in the implementation of the Covenant. Initially, the knowledge sessions are focused on the implementation of the Instrumentarium and the due diligence cycle in general. At a later stage, specialist knowledge sessions will follow with attention to specific due diligence steps (such as, for example, Recovery and Redress) and use of thematic examples to elaborate on the details and possible dilemmas surrounding the various duediligence steps.
SWG Editing and Support: this SWG has the task of updating the Instrumentarium annually, and is also charged with providing support to PF and disseminating the Instrumentarium.
SWG Cases: for each Case, an SWG will be compiled of interested Parties in the Case concerned. These SWG carry out a validation of the must-have criteria, draw up a cooperation plan that addresses, among other things, the joint objectives and strategy, the Engagement goals and questions (Asks) of the pension fund (concrete measuresin relation to the negative impacts) , the roles and responsibilities of the Parties, the planning and staffing. After approval of the cooperation plan by theWerkgroep Diepe Spoor, implementation will start. Annually, the SWG uses their Cases to identify and document strategic insights and lessons. At the conclusion of Cases, a workshop is organized for this reflection with external experts, specifically examining policy implications. The Parties strive to document the lessons and insights about the Deep Track in publications. The SWG reports its final findings to the Monitoring Committee and the Steering Committee. The Steering Committee in turn is considering these findings to draw up recommendations for the Broad Track activities. For example, the lessons learned from the Deep Track are included in the instruments to be developed and / or their application.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">IKV was founded in 1966 by nine denominations with a mandate to study the problems of war and peace and to seek ways to promote peace. IKV is known in the 80s by its mass actions against nuclear weapons in the Netherlands. The organization also developedmany contacts with independent groups and dissidents in Eastern Europe under the motto &apos;relaxation from below&apos;. In 2006, the two organizations merged under the name of IKV Pax Christi. As of January 29, 2014 the organization&apos;s name was changed to PAX.

PAX stands for peace. Together with people in conflict and critical citizens in the Netherlands PAX actively contributes to a dignified and peaceful society, anywhere in the world. Peace takes courage. The courage to believe that peace is possible, to goagainst the flow, to speak outand proceed anyway. Everyone in the world can do something for peace, but there is need for courage. The courage to talk to people and invite them to join regardless of one&apos;s background.

Peace Organization PAX combines its work in conflict with national and international political lobbying and public campaigns. PAX works with peace activists in conflict and tries to build bridges between rival groups. In conflict areas PAX initiates and supports local peace initiatives that aim to build bridges between conflicting groups, generate mutual understanding and improves dysfunctional relationships. Besides working with local partners in conflict PAX is doing research in the field of disarmament.

Moreover PAX encourages national and international politicians and policymakers to actively commit to taking peace, security and human rights as starting points for their policies and political choices. PAX works very closely with various national and international networks, and have an employee at the European Union in Brussels and at the United Nations in New York.

PAX develops public campaigns to engage people with its work and to gain their support for its activities; alone ortogether with other (international) organizations. The topics on which we campaign are always issues around which we try to achieveintroduction of new policies or amendment of existing policy, in close collaboration with its partners in conflict areas. Examples include the campaign &apos;Stop blood coal&apos;, the citizens initiatieve &apos;Sign against nuclear weapons&apos;, the &apos;Embassies of Peace&apos;, the international campaigns against cluster munitions, landmines and killer robots, and the crowdfunding campaign &apos;Adopt a Revolution&apos;. With these campaigns PAX tries to show why peace in the world affects us all and what people can do themselves to support a safe and secure existence for people in Congo for example, Syria or South Sudan.

The mission of PAX is aimed at protecting civilians from violence, and improve citizens&apos; (feeling of) security. There are several factors that contribute to people&apos;s security such as increasing mutual trust between different ethnic groups and holding governments accountable for security and human rights.
In addition there areexternal factors affecting security and human rights, such as the arms trade, the use of controversial weapons and repression around the exploitation of natural resources. Through the strengthening of citizen activism (here and there) and our continuous lobbying oncompliance with the International Law PAX&apos; programs contribute to positively influence these underlying factors to create more impact.

Building bridges between antagonistic communities and facilitate dialogue between local communities and authorities or betweenwarring parties and governments is a core activity of PAX. PAX has shown in the past to be able to help bring about a successful conclusion to both local and national peace and negotiation processes, despite often very complex conditions. Additionally PAX focuseson local capacity building, research and monitoring, lobbying and advocacy and public campaigns. PAX makes sure that these elementscombined reinforce each other and thus contribute substantially to the protection of civilians in war zones.

In the Netherlands, PAX seeks to actively engage people in processes that can contribute to peace elsewhere. Peace is everyone&apos;s responsibility. Anyone who believes in peace, can do something for peace. PAX puts peace in motion and calls on concerned citizens to participate. By e.g. placing a simple call on Facebook or by engaging people in starting up an Embassy of Peace. Through Action Alerts and action newsletters we offer people the opportunity to take concrete action for peace in the world. Examples are &quot;Sign Against Nuclear Weapons,&quot; &quot;Adopt a Revolution,&quot; &quot;Stop Explosive Investments&quot;, &quot;peace flights&quot; and the annual Peace Week.</narrative>
