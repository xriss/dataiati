   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Human Economy captures people-centred ideas-an economy that brings benefits for the majority and works for the many not the few. The governments need concrete policy changes towards eight essential ingredients of the Human Economy for people and planet, contrary to the economy where we put profit first.
First, the Human Economy would measure what matters. The current measure of economic progress, GDP, is completely outdated and not fit for purpose. A Human Economy would seek to measure what matters,to measure the manythings currently left out of GDP calculations.   These include the distribution of growth between rich and poor, multidimensional poverty and inequality. They include environmental sustainability for which planetary and environmental boundaries are not transgressed while social foundations are met.   They include factoring in the harm being done to the environment. They include recognizing and redistributing the many millions of ours of unpaid care work being performed by mainly womeneach day.  Measuring what matters is vital to planning more progressive, and equal economies.
Second, the Human Economy would focus on bringing an end to extreme wealth. Since 2015, the richest 1% has owned more wealth than the rest of the planet.  Extreme concentration of wealth into the rich few could render policies to be captured to benefit only the rich few, which is not good for any society. A Human Economy would seek to endextreme wealth and reduce inequality. A key way to do this will be through progressive taxation, where the richest pay their fair share of tax.
Third and fourth, the foundation for harmonious development in the Human Economy is progressive taxation. State budget revenue from this taxation can be used to provide universal freepublic services, especially education and health, for everyone. Freeuniversal healthcare would bring a huge relief from worry about becoming sick to everyone. Investing in good quality public education means that people will not have to spend their money for private schooling, and that the children of the poorest will have as much chance as the children of the richest.
Fifth, the Human Economy takes into account measures for gender equality and unpaid care work.  Gender equality is not simply about socialattitudes or the correct laws. It is also an economic issue as women can be a huge driver of inclusive economic growth. We need to fully measure regularly the contribution of unpaid care to the economy and take steps to reduce it, using public services, and redistribute it fairly between men and women.
Sixth and Seventh, businesses and business activities have always been backbones of the economy. The Human Economy encourages businesses to apply new business models, which are hybrid, responsible, andinclusive. Models balance the benefits of people, including investors, employees, communities and consumers,and sustainability of the planet, which helps develop companies&#x2019; competitiveness in the long term. The development of hybrid, responsible and inclusive business models which pursue both financial sustainability and social and environmental contribution will be a trend of creating competitive advantages in future business models.  Those are also sustainable business models creating decent jobswithfairand living wages for employees.
Finally, in any sustainable economic model, participation of ordinary citizens matters. TheHuman Economy is not an exception. It is an accountable economy and ordinary citizens have their say in governance. The influenceofthe rich and powerful on policy making is minimised. A government is transparent and accountable to all citizens through various mechanisms and forms, especially fostering civic space, stimulating and supporting active citizenship and higher level of democratic decision making.
Above all, the way we run our economies needs to change. Our current economic model, known as neoliberalism, is broken. Continuing on the same way, with the same economic approach, is not an option.  Eight essential ingredients of a Human Economy are stronger, more stable and sustainable ways of running an economy, for the long term, and for the people and planet.

This project gives a focus on analyzing past performance and projecting future trends of Vietnam development. The project explores the discussionamong experts about a new concept of the human economy in the context of Vietnam. A policy research and influencing project on &#x201C;Human Economy and digital transformation in Vietnam: Assessing the digital readiness ofvulnerable population&#x201D; aims:
&#x2022; First, to assess the human economy&#x2019;s specific issues in the context of Vietnam, and disseminate the concept and thinking of the human economy in Vietnam widely.
&#x2022; Second, to assess the impact of digital transformation from policies and practice perspective on different groups, with a focus on vulnerable groups in Vietnam, and to propose policy recommendation on embracing social groups of the population and businesses with better participation in the digital economy, digital government, and digital society, in order to protect digital rights and to ensure social inclusion and equality in the digital era.</narrative>
