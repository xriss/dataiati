In Nigeria, despite the huge resources from oil revenue, massive corruption, absence of accountable government and non-participatory governance persist leading to under development and deepening poverty. Climate Change is also further threatening food security with women left to bear majority of the burden.

The Good Governance Programme adopts a comprehensive approach to promoting the right to Social and Political participation to empower citizens to demand their right toa better life. First it works tofoster transparency and accountability in the inflow of resources from the Extractives sector; promotes and equitable and fair tax regimes; improve quality and quantity of public and private investments in agriculture, education and health sectors; reviewof specific policies and practices that builds resilience of farmers and Food to be recognised in the Nigerian constitution as a right. This will be achieved through effective collaboration with Civil Society partners and alliances, key government institutions, the media and the private sector, schools and the Nigeria Youth Service Corps.

Researches will be conducted and used to empower communities and the public to hold government to account through town hall meetings,face to face advocacies, media publications and appearances etc. Other materials such as policy briefs will be used for policy advocacy.

The programme will also leverage on the successes achieved on the long-term development projects to influence government and private sector for scale up.Communities will be empowered to engage with their Senators in their Senatorial zones.</narrative>
