  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project is titled: &#x201C;Soro Soke or Park Well&#x201D;. &#x201C;Soro Soke&#x201D; is a Nigerian slang of Yoruba extraction that translates to &#x201C;speak up.&#x201D; Literally, the project translates to: &#x201C;Speak up or Park Well&#x201D;; Park Well, being a common street slang used by the Nigerian Policewhen confronting Nigerians. It is during this confrontation that most brutalities and violation of human rights of youths happen.

Project is brought by a consortium of three Civil Society Organizations working in the field of advocacy, youth development, governance programming, policy development/analysis, women health and economic rights, persons with disability rights and vulnerable support. The organizations include:

&#x2022; The Centre for Social Awareness, Advocacy and Ethics (CSAAE).
&#x2022; Youth Empowerment Solutions ProjectInitiative (YES-P).
&#x2022; Centre for Health Education and Vulnerable Support (CHEVS).

The project seeks to ensure that police brutality and violation of human rights of youths is brought to an end by educating Nigerian youths on their rights before the police &#x2013; so they know when their rights are abused &#x2013; and how to engage the police when confronted or under arrest to prevent conflict; Providing effective reporting system to report brutalities and rights violations; Tracking reported and unreported cases and working with support groups to engage the appropriate police authorities to ensure that justice is delivered; Providing support resources that youthscan reach out to for help when confronted by police.

Specific actions proposed under this project are:

&#x2022; Build a formidable network of 72 vocal youth advocates (2 from each state) committed to monitoring and tracking implementation and compliance of new police regulations in their communities. We shall train and equip these young people with the skills and tools to monitor and report their findings.

&#x2022; Assemble a team of pro bono lawyers and legal experts to seek justice for Nigerians facing trumped up charges for agitating for better governance.

&#x2022; Engage government at all levels (Federal, State and Local) through dialogue and non-confrontational approach to pressure them into compliance with the #5for5 demands of Nigerian youths.

&#x2022; Strategic lobbying of lawmakers to enact laws and policies that advance the achievement of the demands for good governance entrenched in the #5for5 demands.

&#x2022; Sustain the &#x201C;Soro Soke&#x201D; spirit by continuous engagement and preservation of the Nigerian digital space with emphasis on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.

&#x2022; Virtual public trainings and sensitization of Nigerians on how to effectively engage the Nigerian police and understand their rights and limitations in cases of dispute.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The actors undertaking this collective action are:

&#x2022; The Centre for Social Awareness, Advocacy and Ethics (CSAAE).
&#x2022; Youth Empowerment Solutions Project Initiative (YES-P).
&#x2022; Centre for Health Education and Vulnerable Support (CHEVS).

The Centre for Social Awareness, Advocacy and Ethics is a non-profit dedicated to helping young people become effective leaders and embrace their roles as critical actors in building a better Africa. The Centre pursues its mission through three distinct but highly interconnected programs that share the common goal of creating positive social, economic and political change one person at a time. They are:

&#x2022; The EmergingLeaders Program.
&#x2022; The Youth Ethics and Anticorruption Program.
&#x2022; The Career Building and Entrepreneurship Program.

The Youth Empowerment Solutions Project Initiative is a youth focused nonprofit organization founded for the purposed of building youth capacity, advocating and promoting youth participation in democratic governance. YES-P is desirous of a nation that prioritizes youth participation in the polity, participation of marginalized groups in the polity, promotion of accountability in governance, promotion of human rights, peace building, capacity building and empowerment for the vulnerable members of the society.

The Centre for Health Education and Vulnerable Support is a nonprofit with interest in the overall health and benefit of women, children, the elderly, the LGBTQ+ community, the economically vulnerable, persons with disabilities and other marginalized persons in the society.

The collaboration to act jointly has been motivated by so many factors but most importantly, at CSAAE (just like Voice), we believe in the principle of &#x201C;Nothing about us Without us.&#x201D; It is for this reason that we have gone into positive collaboration with YES-P and CHEVS. All three organizations are youth led and represent the interest of minorities and an encompassing class of rightsholders. At CSAAE, our workforce is made up of 100% youths and 65% women. All three organizations played key roles in mobilizing, supporting and amplifying the voices of the youths during the #ENDSARS campaign. We believe that if we work together, we can achieve greater impact for commongood.</narrative>
