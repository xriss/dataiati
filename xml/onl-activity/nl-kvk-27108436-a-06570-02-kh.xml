   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Development and Partnership in Action (DPA) is a non-political, non-religious, non- partisan, non-profit making Cambodian non-governmental organization devoted to furthering community development, partnership work with Cambodian NGOs and lobbying and advocacy. DPA is the successor of CIDSE Cambodia which was established in 1979 as part of the larger CIDSE CLV programme created by a consortiumof International NGOs from Europe, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. With a mission spanning more than 25 years,the milestones andachievements of CIDSE Cambodia are significant, not least of which is moving from meeting basic daily needs of beneficiaries to focusing on strategic long-term aims of building capacity and empowering partner organizations to assist in changing their target communities lives. CIDSE Cambodia began funding CNGOS in 1993 and formally established the Partnership Programme in 1994. Due to the evolving social climate and the strong capacity and commitment of its local staff, CIDSE Cambodia decided to localize and in 1996 began a transition process which enabled the organization to emerge as DPA in January 2006. DPA assumed responsibility for all work of CIDSE Cambodia from 1 January 2006, with an emphasis on community organizing (CO) and rights-based (RB) strategies.</narrative>
