   <narrative xml:lang="EN">CO-Integrated Emergency  Drought Respons</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The humanitarian situation in Somalia remains critical due to the ongoing impacts of drought, conflict, locust infestation and the COVID 19 pandemic which has created a global health emergency. In the later part of 2020 up until the recent months of 2021, most parts of the country have been experiencing moderate to severe drought conditions. This drought conditions were triggered by consecutive seasons of below-average rainfall including the below average October to December 2020 Deyr rainfall season, the above average temperatures during the January to March 2021 harsh Jilaal/dry season as well as the significantly below average April to June Gu/longrains which was delayed.
The worst affected region is the Jubaland state which has been experiencing severe drought conditions thathas placed thousands of pastoralist households under acute water stress. Significant pasture degradation and water shortages have been reported in many areas of Jubaland/South Central Somalia due to two consecutive seasons of significantly below average rainfall.Crops have failed; substantial livestock mortality is occurring and prices of basic food commodities have increased in the recent months.
Currently, water shortages are alarming in the Afmadow and Badhaade districts of the lower Juba region thus affecting a high number of already vulnerable people many of whom are IDPs, returnees and vulnerable pastoralists. Pastoralist families across the districts are uprooting their lives and moving in search of water and pasture for their animals, particularly in the areas bordering Kenya. There have been reports of increased prices of water in most of these districts. A quick market spot check conducted on key water points in Afmadow and Badhaade towns by WASDA team revealed that the average price of a 20- litter jerry can of water in the main water points in these towns was Som. Shs 8,000, an equivalent of USD 0.3. Available water is additionally often contaminated and highly saline in these areas as confirmed by WASDA and Oxfam&#x2019;s WASH coordinator. The Somalia Food Security Cluster as of 18th October2021 confirms that half of Somalia is still experiencing serious drought conditions (moderate to severe drought with water shortages and livestock losses), with the worst impacts being felt in Jubaland, South West State, Galmudug and areas of Puntland. The Deyr seasonal rainfall is expected to be below average, with depressed rains not going to be effective in mitigating drought conditions.
It is estimated that 12,700 households in both districts are affected by water shortages. The local authorities have issued an appealletter to humanitarian partners to support affected families with lifesaving assistance. In rural villages it is reported that almost all water sources have dried up, with a significant number of shallow wells and strategic boreholes yielding low water, causing mass concentration of livestock with long hours of queuing at the water sources. Further information emanating from the District Commissioner&#x2019;s office (Afmadow) also highlighted that many pastoral communities from the neighboring towns in Middle Juba region (controlled by Al-Shabaab) who migrated with their livestock as a result of the devastating drought have gradually settled in Afmadow town,putting extra pressure on the few existing hand-dug shallow wells which are now the only remaining sources of water. WASDA as one of the few actors in Jubaland having sustained access and relationships with the affected communities have just completed a 30-day NEXUS/DRA-funded anticipatory emergency water trucking response. Other agencies and local communities are undertaking similar small scale water trucking activities.
It is against this background that WASDA is proposing to undertake an emergency Livelihood, WASH and protection interventions in Afmadow and Badhaade districts of Lower Juba that will meet the immediate food security and livelihood, WASH and protection needs of vulnerable populations affected by drought. The specific activities to be undertaken under the food security and livelihood (FSL) will be 1) cash based interventions in the form of un-conditional cash transfers to improve purchasing power and food access for vulnerable pastoralist households, 2) The activities under the WASH  intervention will include provision of safe drinking water (water trucking, fuel subsidy to borehole, water treatment chemicals), hygiene promotion (hygiene kits distribution, sanitation and hygiene campaign) and 3) protection activities include awareness creation on GBV prevention, provision of dignity kits, radio spot messaging on GBV prevention awareness campaigns and referral of GBV cases to relevant GBV service providers.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In 2004 Oxfam Novib set up a Liaison Office in Nairobi, Kenya in order to support the Strengthening Somali Civil Society Program, at the request of the EU. This request was based on Oxfam Novib&apos;s work in Somalia to date, but intended to be more widely directed atthe entire civil society sector and the specific context in which it is operating in a post-conflict country. The program started with consulting local organisations in Somalia and Somaliland to get a complete picture of the sectors and regions where they are active, the challenges they face and the relationship between civil society, local political structures and the private sector. A program was then developed to strengthen the institutional development of Oxfam Novib&apos;s partners and those of other Oxfams, as well as a range of new NGOs.
In the first year local consultants were trained in Somalia. They were then seconded to civil society organisations to build their capacity in financial and organisational management. Furthermore, workshops were organised on specific themes suchas human rights and the role of civil society in the Somali context. The Liaison Office is now going to support the expansion of the program, focussing on strengthening both organisation and project management, while facilitating more training in the fields of civic education, governance, human rights and women&apos;s rights, HIV and AIDS and child protection.
Over the years, the Somalia Country Office has expanded its intervention on short term humanitarian response as well as development development interventions. In 2015/2016, a decision was reached to move the Country Programme operation, which was largely in Nairobi, from Nairobi to Hargeisa. The country office has a small office in Nairobi , Kenya and large operations office in Hargeisa, Somaliland.</narrative>
