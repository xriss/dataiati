   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Afghanistan is experiencing a complex and dynamic context; natural disasters are exacerbated by a changing climate and protracted heterogenous conflicts. Both internal and external actors and dynamics compound an uncertain political future where addressing genderequality and gains on women#s rights over the past 18 years are at risk. Almost two decades of international aid and development efforts appear at risk. International political entities continue to engage in both diplomatic and military efforts to end the war, most notably through direct talks between US and Taliban representatives (a reversal of previous policies). As of September 2019, the negotiations, which did not directly involve representatives of the Afghan government, have come to a standstill; however, the worryremains that a military withdrawal will be prioritised over a political settlement that protects the social, political, economic and humanitarian gains made since 2001.Existing inequalities between women, men, boys and girls, ethnicities, access to resources, etc., will be further exacerbated by the potential undermining of a democratic governance system. At this critical juncture for Afghanistan, civil society has a unique and crucial role to ensure effective inclusion and participation of Afghan citizens, especially women, youth and minorities in macro level systems like governance, economy, and society, as well as micro level individual agency. Hence, this Action aims to increase the capacity of CSOs to perform their role asindependent development actors more effectively and toenhance efforts to promote a conducive environment for CSOs.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">ACSFo,

Afghan Civil Society Forum (ACSF) was established in February 2002 on the request of 76 participants of Afghan Civil Society Conference in Germany, 2001, as a partnership between Afghan civil society partners and Swiss Peace. In May 2002 ACSF opened its offices in Kabul. In 2010, ACSF changed its legal status to an NGO (since then called ACSFo).

The Bonn agreement induced the processtowards democratic ideals and participatory political structures of which the Loya Jirga (June 2002) and the constitution (January 2004) were the first big steps. ACSF promoted the development of civic education (culture of peace, democracy and justice) among theyoung and undefined civil society in Afghanistan with partner organisations across the entire country in the context of these important events.

ACSF&#x92;s mission is to strengthen civil society and its countervailing power in stabilising the country, so that citizens are aware and committed to participate in the development of a just and equitable society; disarmament and security being prerequisites for democratic development.

From 2002 to 2005 civic education became ACSFo&#x92;s main strategy to prevent human rights abuses andto promote a culture of peace, democracy and justice. ACSF works as a network organization and organized Nation-wide campaigns (with support of DFID, UNOPS/JEMBS and USAID). About 10-15% of the Afghan population was reached leading to 31% women participation in the presidential elections (2004) and 34% in the parliamentarian elections (2005). These projects educated over 11 million Afghans. Since 2002 ACSF also has been able to publish 68 editions of Jamea-e-Madani civil society magazine have been brought out.

F rom 2006-2009 ACSF carried out a country-wide civic education programme financed by Oxfam Novib, contributing to awareness creation on civilrights and democratic processes amongst young and not yet &apos;defined&apos; civil society.
ACSFo also added advocacy and research, peace-building/governance and institutional capacity building to its activities consisting of:

&#x95; Facilitation of National Consultations/Dialogue: collecting public opinion concerning the by the government claimed achievements on security, poverty reduction, health, education, transparency and fighting poppy cultivation.

&#x95; Institutional Capacity Building: ACSFo works with Counterpart Inter&#xAC;national (CPI) to implement the &#x93;Initiative to Promote Afghan Civil Society&#x94; (I-PACS) &#x96; a nationwide approach that supports the development ofa civil society friendly legal framework.

&#x95; Advocacy/Research: ACSFo has set-up advocacy committees on topics such as youth, womenand people with disabilities, environment and transparency and accountability. Concerns of the citizens are advocated at national level and the organisation of National youth conferences (2002, 2004 and 2005).

ACSFo has implemented a research project &#x84;How Peopledefine Violence and Justice&#x93;, examining the people&#x92;s understanding of violence in the past five decades. Results were used to strengthenpeace initiatives via local and people-driven justice and reconciliation processes.

&#x95; Peace-building/Governance: ACSFo is member of the Afghan Civil Society Organisations Network for Peace (ACSONP). Peace-building training manuals have been produced aNational Peace Day was celebrated throughout the country in 2007.

In 2009, ACSFo piloted a Community Policing project in 31 districts of five Northern provinces, bridging gaps between the governmental/law enforcement institutions and the civil society, reducing local conflicts and improving capacities and accountability of the Afghan National Police.

&#x95; Networking/Coordination: ACSFo has expanded its civil society network across Afghanistan, comprising 320 partner organisations and 130 members othermembers.

In recent strategic repositioning discussions it was concluded that ACSFo should continue emphasising rural areas and as organisation try to form an important &#x91;internode&#x92;/cross-point for synergic sharing and strengthening of qualities of individual members (horizontal linkages) and for analysing and forwarding of information originated at central government level and organisations active in the context of local government institutions and structures (vertical linkages). In the current development of the government decentralisation and devolution of government towards provinces, districts and further downwards to grass-root levels civic education, awareness creation in combination with mobilisation and are very important co-processes for empowering communities and strengthening of the democratic basis in Afghanistan, wherein ACSFo plans to play a catalysing role.

ACSFo  is one of the few NGOs that really have added value to civil society development in Afghanistan. Projects of most NGOs areactually to a large extent service deliveries and relief activities, which often use traditional social and political power structures to reach the communities and therewith confirm and consolidate thesepower relations. Critical analysis if activities are reaching the most vulnerable people are lacking in many organisations and perhaps some activities are even counterproductive. Oxfam Novib has endeavoured to strengthen NGOs capacities and to develop insights. ACSFo has been an important player in this CS strengthening process and is in the current local governance programme showing it can also bring the countervailing power function of CSOs in practice.</narrative>
