   <narrative xml:lang="EN">NANA is a non-profit, private development legal entity with legal personality with administrative, financial and patrimonial autonomy. It gathers 32 young members of both sexes. The organization is of provincial scope, with its soothes in the City of Mocuba, street Robert Mugabe, founded the 14 of February of 1998.
NANA and its partners work to ensure that human rights are respected, protected and fulfilled as the primary responsibility of the state. The NANA has a strategic plan (2016-2021).
The vision of the organization is that NANA is an organization with recognized capacity and contributing to the sustainable socio-economic development of the country, to eradicate the poverty of the most vulnerable people with particular emphasis on woman and young girls at rural areas.
The organization mission is to:
I) Participate in decision-making processes and public policy debate;
II) Support to vulnerable groups for the full enjoyment of their rights;
III) Participation in the sustainable management of natural resources and preservation of the environment;
IV) Support the capacity development of community-based organizations working within the NANA mission and vision.
NANA has a track record of partnering with Oxfam IBIS since 2013. The partnership agreement consists of strengthening its thematic and constitutional competencies as well as financial support to develop activities that contribute to strengthening the voices of rural men and women in the sense of know and demand their basic rights. Particularly for this project, NANA will work with rural youth groups, women and girls outside the school system, providing an opportunity for access to information and a non-formal education model that will enable them to solve their own problems and concerns as well as community problems. This education model, in addition to focusing on leteracy and counting, integrates educational content that includes aspects of gender and human rights. NANA will continue to promote local public hearings, where citizens have the opportunity to present the findings of social audits in the process of monitoring the financial performance of the education sector.
In relation to the project Economic and Social Justice NANA will contribute to the following areas:
- Organize social audits related to education and health sector in the district and municipality of Mocuba.
- Organize district and municipality &quot;Public Hearings&quot;as to influence decision makers to improve public services in the district and municipality of Mocuba. This objective is aligned with one of the objectives of the ESJ project that states: #Local policies andbudgets reflect the priorities of the communities in Mocuba district in quantity and quality of public services provided as well asin more transparentand accountable budgeting.</narrative>
