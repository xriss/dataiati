   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Mekong Inclusion Project (IP) works with vulnerable communities and civil society in Laos, Cambodia, Myanmar, Vietnam and Thailand and at the subregional level to ensure continued access to essential river resources for their livelihoods, health and well-being. This project is co-fund from DFAT and SDC in a second phase of (IP2) over 4 years for the 2020-2024 period.

This proposed investment is a continuation of the first phase of the Inclusion Project (IP1) and is built upon the achievements, evaluation recommendations and priorities of the IP partners; and is informed by the changing context and actors within the region. The IP2 continues support to Civil Society Actors (CSA) in each country and at the regional level in terms of organisational and technical capacity to engage in dialogue with and influence decision and policy-making bodies. This includes authorities such as ministries of energy, environment and water resources, private sector actors such as those financing and constructing hydro-dams and engaging in renewable and sustainable energy development, regional bodies such as the Mekong River Commission (MRC), and programs such as the Asian Development Bank Greater Mekong Subregion Economic Cooperation Program to ensure energy and waterplanning and decision-making respect community rights and preserve the ecological values of major rivers in the region.

The aim of IP2 is to ensure target government and private sector actors at the national and regional levels engage with andinclude the perspectives of civil society in hydro-power and Renewable Energy (RE) policies and plans. The Project builds upon the established partnerships including between Oxfam and International Rivers (IR) to strengthen Civil Society Organisation (CSO) capacity and the leadership of women and representatives from marginalisedgroups to influence water governance decision making at all levels. There will be greater emphasis on strengthening networks and alliances; closer linkages between the sub-national, national and regional levels; and on CSO engagement with multiple stakeholders including the private sector and financiers from countries in the region, as well as regional institutions. Community-led projects will focus on developing the evidence based for specific policies or strategies. There will be greater collaboration with the wider Australia Greater Mekong Water Resources Program (GMWRP) to promote engagement between civil society and institutional stakeholders, particularly those supported under the other pillars of the GMWRP including regional bodies, national governments and the private sector. Engagement will focus on promoting more inclusive consultation processes and the relevant international standards for investment, development and managementof river infrastructure with particular focus on hydro-power and RE. The aim will be to ensure target government and private sector actors at the national and regional levels engage with and include the perspectives of civil society in water governance andenergy policies and plans, in accordance with best practice on meaningful public participation and respect for human rights.

Civil society inclusion aims to support riverine communities and civil society actors to engage with and influence national andregional water governance and energy policy and planning processes. This includes engagement with other partners in the GMWRP and with regional institutions and processes related to water resource development, such as the MRC), as well as collaboration with investments of other agencies, including Oxfam#s regional engagement with ASEAN and the (Asian Development Bank) ADB, and IR engagement with hydropower developers. IP2 will also work with communities and researchers to strengthen research and analysis,contributing to the evidence base and level of discussion, dialogue and debate in the public domain and within policy and decision-making fora. Where necessary, Oxfam and IR will ensure the interests of civil society are represented in research and analysis or through direct engagement with key actors, when CSAs are unable or unwilling to engage directly.

Focus on women and marginalised groups aims tosupport women leaders and representatives of marginalised social groups to engage with and influencenational and regional state andnon-state actors in water governance and energy policy and planning processes. A particular focus will be on the inclusion and leadership of women and the inclusion of riparian communities, ethnic minorities, youth and thoseliving with disability, who are disproportionately affected and excluded from decision/policy-making fora. This builds upon the inclusive processes, learning and development of women and community leaders in IP1, by supporting their continued engagement indecision/policy making fora and the developmentof a new generation of leaders. Specific strategies and plans will be explored and developed with partners to promote women#s participation and leadership in policy arenas and to ensure better inclusionofwomen and their perspectives in the policies and practices of different stakeholder groups. The specific approach will be developed for each context and stakeholder group and is likely to include learning events, workshops, dialogue events,informaldiscussion, as well as joint activities such as research, exposure visits or peer to peer learning. A similar approach of consultation with representative groups and development of specific plans and strategies will be undertaken to ensure the participationof youth, ethnic minorities and people living with disabilities. Technical supportwill be resourced at the regional and country level utilising the expertise of country teams and partners and sourcing external support for specific tasks as required.

Implementation arrangements: The IP2 will be implemented by a consortium of Oxfam (currently managing the IP1 contract) and IR. This builds upon Oxfam and IR#s long-term strategic relationship in Oxfam#s Mekong Region Water Governance Program(MRWGP) and in more recent years, IR#s partnership with Oxfam within several other related regional programs, including Oxfam#s Transboundary Rivers of South Asia (TROSA) and Fair Finance Asia (FFA) programs (see Box 2). This model combines Oxfam#sexperience and expertisein promoting gender equality and women#s leadership, providing support to CSOs, and community-based naturalresource management, presence throughout the region, and proven track record in contract management (reflected in Oxfam#s recent DFAT re-accreditation); with IR#s global networks, regional Mekong presence, and expertise in river and water resource management, governance and policy, international standards, private sector engagement and advocacy on hydropower and RE. The consortium arrangementstrengthens the Project#s capacity to adapt to the dynamic operating environment and maximise opportunities by harnessing the strengths and resources of Oxfam and IR at the Project decision making and representational levels. The consortium strengthenstheProject#stechnical resources in a wide range of areas on an ongoing basis consistent with the IP2#s increased emphasis on influencing policyand practice.</narrative>
