   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Value chains and the rural economy: making it work for women and men.

Join us in enabling vulnerable women and men in rural Africa and Asia to address the root causes of their poverty.

Using the power of symbols and principles of inclusion, we helprural populations to improve livelihoods and gender equality, negotiate better prices for their goods and increase their influence on local economies. We mobilize people and institutions to work towards common visions of change.

Women in poor rural areas often can#t own property and don#t have much say in what happens to the household income they help to earn. Peer pressure on men to behave #like a man# restrains them from saving money and investing in household welfare. This holds back families and communities. Greater gender equality typically means healthier children and more productive, faster-growing local economies.

Many organizations work on issues such as agricultural value chains, local economic development, financial services and agricultural extension services. But it#s estimated that less than 1 in 10 of these programs explicitly address gender inequalities. The others could have more impact if they did.

We work with local organizations and businesses as well as UN agencies, other donors to support them put gender frameworks into practice in their programs. We help women and men in marginalized rural communities to articulate their ambitions and understand how greater gender equality can improve their livelihoods and lives. With morecontrol of their own development process, rural communities negotiate better prices for their products, better work conditions, and more relevant services.</narrative>
