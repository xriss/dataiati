   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Urgent support to Palestinian farmers</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The ESDC implemented an 8-month solar energy project funded by Oxfam Novib between January 1, 2019- August 31, 2019. The project directly supported 197 farmers (belonging to 30 farming families- or 240 individuals) living in Ikhzuq Musa in the Jordan Valley, AreaC of the West Bank. The project helped improve farmers&apos; and their families access to agricultural water, specifically their farminglands located in Marj Na&apos;ja village in Jericho governorate. The project also provided five mobile solar pumping models that served five women groups/cooperatives in the targeted area. The project helped restore the livelihoods of targeted farmers and their households who were able to access affordable water sources of irrigation in 1000 dunums of farming lands. Oxfam and ESDC installed a solar energy system on an artesian well in Ikhzuq Musa and installed water harvesting ponds and rainwater harvesting cisterns. As a result, high-cost diesel generators were replaced with solar energy to conserve energy sources and reduce electricity costs, which helped decrease irrigation water costs. Targeted farmers were able to resume farming for high-value vegetables and palms in Ikhzuq Musa. Prior to the project, they had abandoned or significantly reduced their farming activities due to the high costs of water pumping. ESDC reported that farmers paid 1 to 1.8 ILS/m3 when public electricity was available prior to the project, reaching 4 ILS/m3 when diesel generators required power to operate well pumps. As a result of replacingdiesel generators with the solar energy system, the cost of pumping was reduced to ZERO since the annual hours of sun in the Jordan Valley reached 2,861 hours-decreasing both electrical and diesel prices for farmers. At sunset (Iftar) time on the 28th ofRamadan on Saturday, May 9, 2021, and midnight June 29 2021, Israeli settlers broke 105 solar cells panels belonging to Ikhzuq Musa well 33 panels were destroyed during the 1st attack and 72 panels were destroyed during the second attack.  Settlers destroyed 105 PV panels with a capacity of 33,600 kilowatts. Currently,  the well-pumping system is operating through a  diesel generator, as was the case prior to the rehabilitation. This is costing the farmersa lot.
In a partnership with ESCD, Oxfam plans to implement the project within a two-month period due to the urgency and need of the 197 farmers and their families to revive their livelihoods and reduce farming and irrigation costs. The implementation will include an assessment, procurement, rehabilitation works, testing and operating the solar energy system.
The ESDC is keen to restart the operation of the well at its maximum capacity. Since it is currently operating at 60% capacity due to a defect in the solar cell, andcapture the full project potential. ESDC aims to directly contract the same company (Excellent company) which installed the solar system during the previous project through a tendering process. Assigning the works to the same company will facilitate the urgent rehabilitation processsince the same company delivered the works with high quality and is fully aware of the costs of needed materialsfor the rehabilitation.
ESDC will also provide the solar system with a camera system that aims to document any violence in the future. Also &#x2013; supported by Oxfam, ESDC will hire a consultant who will help develop a short video to document the success achieved in the area where success can be captured by filming the farms developed and capturing farmers witnesses.
ESDC team was able to identify105 solar panels in Jericho governorate that were significantly damaged in Marj Na&apos;ja village the energy of these plates is considered to be what feeds the well of an artesian in Ikhzuq Musa which covered 1000 dunums. the well is considered the main source of water for the farmers in the area.  To that end, ESDC intends through this intervention to replace the damaged solar panels with new ones to relieve farmers of the burden of the high cost due to the electric generator. Moreover, this intervention will involve equipping the targeted agricultural wells with a camera system to document any future damage that may affect the well or the solar panels in the future due to the Israeli settlers.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">ESDC complies with Palestinian labour law; employees are covered with health insurance and the insurance to the offices; there is vehicle insurance and social insurance for guests ,The ESDC has a board of directors with a well-defined and written mandate. The board provides the organizations with oversight and accountability and does regular up-keep of business records. ESDC#s mission statement is also available. Finally, there are mechanisms and structures for ensuring participatory management by the organization&apos;s top management.

It is worth noting that ESDC was an ISO 9001 certified, which is a positive point for them in regards to governance structure.

They are well organized in term of their procedures and policies. Some procedures are in place but not systemized. They havea written complaint system, although it needs further work. It also needs to develop an operational manual. ESDC is governed by an elected, multidisciplinary Board of Directors (BoD). The BoD consists of 9 members, 6 men and 3 women. The term of the BoD is two years, after which elections are held and the General Assembly elects the new BoD.
ESDC is governed by the following core values: Equality, Democracy, Partnership, Cooperation, Transparency, Integrity, Social Justice, Civil Peace. ESDC staff consists of more than twenty full time employees specialized in capacity building of cooperatives and community based organizations (CBOs), agriculture, water and environment. The staff work from one of ESDC&apos;s three offices: Ramallah, Gaza and Tubas.

ESDC#s general assembly consists of 26 members from both genders, where members are from different areas and specializations in the field of development. They meet at least one time every year. The board of directors consists of 9members elected by the general assembly members every two years.ESDC staff consists of more than twenty full time employees specialized in capacity building of cooperatives and community#based organizations, agriculture, water and environment based on three offices in Ramallah, Gaza and Tubas.
 For the complaint system: the system primarily uses emails and letters, as well as oral complains. All methods of communication are put into the complaint system.
 Vision: A Palestinian cooperative society that is economically independent and socially just
Mission: Eventuating Integrated Development in Palestine through Economic &lt;(&gt;&amp;&lt;)&gt; Social Empowerment for the target groups
ESDC continues to align its organizational values withthe internationally-accepted co-operative principles. It also upholds the values of transparency, integrity and accountability, social justice, and peace. ESDC recognizes itself as a member of civil society in Palestine. Its stated strategic objective within the development programme:
1. To contribute in the national endeavours in improving the livelihood &lt;(&gt;&amp;&lt;)&gt; food Security for the target groups.
2. To increase the capacities of  civil society organization, including cooperatives  in providing relevant services to their members &lt;(&gt;&amp;&lt;)&gt; communities.
3. To reinforce the gender equitable &lt;(&gt;&amp;&lt;)&gt; equity in ESDC&apos;s operations &lt;(&gt;&amp;&lt;)&gt; activities.
4. To build the capacities of ESDC to be more efficient and effective in management &lt;(&gt;&amp;&lt;)&gt; supervision.
Target Beneficiaries: CBOs , small scale farmers , vulnerable groups(youth, women) and vulnerable areas that are affected from displacement, the wall and settlers violence, communities who are vulnerable to food insecurity. ESDC#s geographical focus is in all of the West Bank and Gaza Strip with a main focus in rural areas and vulnerable communities (for Vulnerability definition ESDC uses definitions from national publications,UN OCHA, and other related organizations).
ESDC#s understanding of partnership: As a local NGO, they share a common objective with internationalNGOs and donors to meet and work with each other to achieve agreed objectives. The local partner brings technical expertise and relationships with local communities, where the international and donor partners contribute financially and in developing thecapacities of the local partner. They also the international skills and capabilities particularly in terms of advocacy and lobbying. Therefore, the agreed objectives are achieved through collective action from both partners , each of them participate within the scope of their capacity.
ESDC has a mechanism to identify beneficiaries in their work and are accountable to them through a well defined, organized system for beneficiary selection. ESDC ensures participation of all community members in the developmentof selectioncriteria and the selection process. ESDC presents the list of beneficiaries to the local community, receives feedback on it, and ifthere is a complaint, feedback, or a contradiction, they are open to discuss.They have a system for selectingtarget groups with communities and involving local communities in all project stages: announcing the project in communities, setting criteria with communities, involving communities in needs assessments, designing the interventions, promoting the project, selecting beneficiaries, involving local communities in the selection of beneficiaries, monitoring the progress of projects. ESDC also publishes projects details on their website.

ESDC is also accountable to its target group through a feedback system, in which complaints and any notes in regard to activities and other issues related to implementation and activities, can be sent and addressed.
ESDC also has forms to measure beneficiary satisfaction. However, this system should be more organized. ESDCrequires more capacity building in this area including mechanism to ensure regular reporting.

Level of accountability and transparency is good in general but needs a stronger documentation system that is integrated into their operational manual and M&lt;(&gt;&amp;&lt;)&gt;E system.
ESDC works very closely with farmers and CBOs especially cooperatives, and support them in term of capacity building, marketing legislation issues, and with line ministries on the Cooperative Law.  Therefore, ESDC is strategically focusedonthe rights of farmers, policy and legislation that influences them and lobbying with other organization to improve farmers&apos; situation.

ESDC defines Vulnerability according to the country context, clusters&apos; definitions and UN agencies especially UNOCHA. They need to systemize their work according to this criteria, and not change on a project by project basis.

ESDC has its own gender strategy and give preference to female headed households as target groups, as wellas female producers and women#s cooperatives.

ESDC has both internal and external evaluations for its projects to measure impact and outcomes.</narrative>
