   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Today, the elderly is the fastest growing demographic group in the world due to increase in life expectancy. According to the decree No. 2822/LSW of 2004, the elderly people are the population at the age of 60 and over.  Based on the estimation of the current demographic data in the IXth Five Year 2021-2026 Socio-Economic Plan of Lao PDR, the country will enter into the elderly society in 2038. Thus in order to prepare the current young population to be the future elderly with resilient to abuses, they need to understand and address the issues currently faced by the elderly and advocate for policy change towards the elderly. Lao PDR has little study and record on the elder abuse for advocacy of policy change. This project is aiming at empowering the youth to influence policy change towards the elderly. This will be achieved by involving the youth to study and address the issues faced by the elderly especially advocate for policy change. The elderly will be the active participants of the project in providing information on their abuses within the families and communities and in raising voices through the youth on how do they want to see policy and social changes towardsthe elderly. Finally, participation from older adults will be mobilize in order to create empowering intervention strategies that are designed in accordance to the requirements of the elderly and are in line with the principles of respect, dignity, and choice.

1.4 Campaign on the &quot;Respect for Seniors and Life Long Learning&quot;

2.3 Support activities in sociological inclusion of the elderly and youth in community affairs

2. Equality. All humans have the right to life, health, shelter, education, work, the freepractice of faith and equality before the law
3. Inclusive Communities. As human we are dependent on each other, with rights and responsibilities for our common life
4. Compassion. As human being we need to transform indifference, share love with everyone and act accordingly.
