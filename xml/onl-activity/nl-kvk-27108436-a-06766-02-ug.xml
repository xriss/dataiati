  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">CCOVID-19 is expected to further spread within communities in Uganda, including refugee communities (RRP 2021/22). Oxfam will continue to implement COVID 19 sensitive interventions building on ongoing responses and humanitarian activities in Nakivale, Kyangwali and Rwamanja. Oxfam targets 100,000 beneficiaries (52/48 M/F) under this response. A mixed implementation model will be adopted, withdirect implementation in Kyaka II and Rwamwanja and Nakivale, while in Kyangwali implementation will be through a local partner &#x2013; Foundation for Urban &lt;(&gt;&amp;&lt;)&gt; Rural Advancement (FURA). FURA is a long term Oxfam partner with experience in epidemic preparedness andresponse.

Community engagement (CE) approach will be integrated during project implementation, putting the community at the centreof Risk Communication and IPC. The project will ensure women, girls and other marginalized groups fully participate in the design and implementation of COVID-19 measures and that their needs are considered in the response.

IEC materials will be context specific building on the ongoing COVID 19 responses with additional information including peaceful coexistence and information around COVID 19 vaccines. The project will continue to strengthen and/ or link established referral pathways to existing UNHCR Interagency Feedback, Referral and Resolution Mechanism (FRRM).

Soap distribution will target the COVID at Risk groups. The project will employ CASH Based Intervention (CBI) during soap distribution. This will be implemented within the common, collaborative and integrated interagency approach being promoted by the Cash Working Group.

A range of communication channels will be employed by the project for risk communication (RC) including mass media using local radio stations, social media, information boards and other channels depending on the preferred access to information of different groups at risk. Two-way communication channels will also be used to move beyond message sharing and into dialogue and meaningful engagement. Participation of communities will be sought to ensure inclusion of vulnerable and marginalized refugees including COVID 19 at risk groups. Messaging will also include GBV specific IEC materials, COVID 19 Vaccination (debunking myths and perceptions) and peaceful coexistence. These will be integrated within the broader hygiene promotion messaging targeting refugees and host communities.

 As a technical lead for IPC (COVID 19 Business Continuity Plan for WASH and Health) for South West,  this response will further reinforce IPC through expansion of water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) infrastructure, supporting construction of bulk contactless hand-washing points in communal areas (in markets, at health facilities, at settlement gates) and at households (material support for tippy tap construction) and undertake pipeline extensions (including to isolation and quarantine centres) and hand pump rehabilitation to increase supplies of water. Communities (host and refugees) including institutions will be engaged/consulted as far as possible to ensure ownership and sustainability of the action. Focus will also be on sustainability of installed water supply systems and extension of water supply services to underserved areas.
Additionally, this phase will strengthen the capacity of VHT structures, school health clubs and faith based leaders to ensure sustainable maintenance of established IPC measures, continued risk communication for behaviour change among pupils in schools and community level, and further strengthen community based surveillance and referral system so that sick get medical attention as soon as possible.  Faith leaders are indispensable message carriers who increase awareness, Improve uptake of recommended behaviour. They are obligated to the community,to not only provide religious teachings, but also persuade members of their church/Mosques to take time and understand the risks associated with the novel coronavirus.
Peaceful coexistence will be integrated within the project to promote social cohesion between different ethnic communities (refugees) and host by promoting continuous engagement with community leaders and structures during community engagement dialogues for monitoring and resolution of disputes
Specific activities will include;

Risk communication activities / across settlements or to specific settlements:

- Refresher Training/capacity building of Village Health Teams (VHTs), Child to Child clubs, Refugee Welfare Council, Partners staffs on COVID-19 preparedness and response actions in line with the Ministry of Health SOPs and Protocols).

- Production and Dissemination of translated hygiene and risk-awareness audio messaging on COVID-19 and countering misinformation to communities through Boda Boda Talk Talk, radio talk shows/forums. This will also focus on Education of communities on COVID-19 to avoid stigmatization of people who have recovered from COVID-19 or have been discharged from quarantine facilities, dispelling myths around COVID 19 Vaccination etc.
