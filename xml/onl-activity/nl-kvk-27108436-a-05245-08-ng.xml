   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Cognito Studios and Network of Incubators and Innovator in Nigeria (NINE) has formed this consortium to provide linking and learning facilitation services to Voice in Nigeria. This is a platform to connect all Voice grantees in Nigeria, support their learning journey and provide a safe space for networking, sharing and documenting their learning journey. To achieve this, they are proposing the following key activities:
1. Support grantee linking and learning by  developing customized tools to meet theirrespective needs; organize MSC  story review meetings; organize pause and reflect sessions; strengthen collaboration by connecting grantees working in similar areas, for more impactful output;
2. Organise and develop linking and learning activities and platforms
3. Develop capacity strengthening approach for grantees
4. Promote innovative ideas of grantees and promote their publications;
5. Participate in Voice community of practice.

Cognito started offering knowledge management services after observing gaps while working with development partners, who treat knowledge management as an afterthought and not integrated into programme planning. It was identified as an essential need due to knowledge leakage or loss in some cases, as organizations do not deliberately capture and store knowledge in easilyretrievable formats for use.  Due to the fact that knowledge largely deals  with soft skills, it is easily  lost during staff retention or just not prioritized.

NINE is a resource/knowledge management and mobilization organization that create linkage platform for incubators, innovation-driven organizations, development agencies, academia and development focused individuals to gather and linkand create learning of knowledge for the growth and sustenance of their efforts in programme development, building innovation, entrepreneurship and startups incubation in Nigeria.

This grant presents an opportunity to apply  years of vast collective  experience and expertise in knowledge management garnered bysupporting various organizations&apos; knowledge management efforts,  to support linkingand learning processes within Voice with innovative approaches that can add value to the quality of programming and enrich other core competencies of the grantees and rightsholder groups.

The Cognito and NINE teams possess  strong skills and experience in communication, creative output development, content creation, marketing communications, and capacity strengthening.  We are tech savvy,  innovative, creative with a passion for excellence and employ the use of Human Centred Design (HCD) to achieve a win-win situation for all stakeholders.</narrative>
