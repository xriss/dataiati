2. ACHIEVEMENTS
Men and women, girls and boys have positive mind change in response to Covid-19 prevention and management which has led to installation of hand washing facilities at homes and other public units as result of the Covid-19 community awareness we have conducted in Ocea zone.

People in the operational areas have massively engaged in farming which has reduced starvation and over dependence on food ratio distributed by WFP and other relief agencies.

Our advocacy for community peace has reduced the prevalence of SGBV, child abuse and other social misfits in Ocea &apos;C&apos; village restoring peace and harmony to the larger extent.

People in Ocea C village have taken positive initiatives in planting trees as a result of SHA staff and volunteers advocating for treeplanting through practice demonstration by having plantedsome in the area.

The rate of pregnancy among adolescent girls have been reduced in Ocea zone from the month of June compared to when learners were sent home due to the lockdown aimed at curbing the spreadof corona virus in March.

4. STRATEGIC POSITIONING
We are aware of the difference in environment in the geographical setting of our operation due to the facts that the people we serve are from diverse historical backgrounds and heritage. we therefore work in both risky and safe environments in executing the organization&apos;s mission. But with affirmative risk mitigation measures put in place.

RhinoCamp has brought in Refugees from Majorly South Sudan and a few others from the Democratic Republic of Congo, Burundi, Sudan and Rwanda. Notably, these groups have diverse cultural and Geographical (regional) settings endowed with the possibility of different behaviours and attitudes. Some of these communities have conflicting differences from their Countries of Origin possibly bringing with them anger and the feeling of revenge. Yet the Refugees are now living with the Host Communities containing in their differences andsimilarities. It has been noted that such difference created a few recorded misunderstandings and conflicts in the settlement. Attempts to genuinely create harmonies living and peaceful coexistence never fall in vain as such diversity could be transformed into strength of the entire Settlement.

There are also other relevant social actors; local government agencies, private companies, NGOs and other local agencies providing both relief and development programs and services atvarious capacities. In Rhino Camp, we work withCommunity structures, Health institutions, local Non-Governmental Organizations, International Organizations and Donor Agencies supporting our mission as well as Beneficiary community that form the basis ofour Principle objectives.

We are so unique in our work in the sense that we are based within the community with our members being members from the communities having the same historical background. Our staff and Volunteers understand the real problemsof their people and are understood better by their people. Besides, they understand and speak the local languages making us an immediate response agency in times of needs.
Finally, the formation of theorganization was supported by the local people itserves. It is endorsed by Board of Directors comprised of persons from the RefugeeCommunity and Ugandan Nationals.
