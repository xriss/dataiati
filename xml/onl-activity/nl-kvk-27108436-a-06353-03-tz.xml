   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Voice of Encouragement (VET) is a local non-political, non-profitable organization established in May 2017 and  became officially  registered  in  November  2017,    to  respond  current  need  for  Tanzania  marginalized and  vulnerable  groups  in  order  to  sustained  and  strengthen  and  promote  human  rights culture, equal education for all, tackle early marriage and unwanted pregnancy. VET was founded by nine members (six women and three men) who are passionate about girls and young women&apos;s rights and developmentin Tanzania.

VET is managed by independent non-partisan indigenous professionals whom have been experiencing practically &lt;(&gt;&amp;&lt;)&gt; technically on various fields of capacity buildings of humanitarian sectors, Health sector and community development projects as theyhave had special trainings (TOTs) to the sectors of humanitarian interventions, Human rights,   Health, child protection and capacity building programs.

VET  works with  adolescent girls and young women in Tanzania. Their mandate is to curb teen pregnancy, childmarriage, gender based violence and ensure that the rights of adolescent girls and young women are adhered to all over Tanzania. VET is engaged in promoting gender equality and addressing young women empowerment issues since its inception. Most projects focus on the issues of violence against women (VAW) capacity building and tackling child marriage and teen pregnancy. Over the few period of time with enough experience of working on teenage mothers and young women issues; the organization has well increased its conceptualunderstanding and knowledge of the issues of marginalized young women and the young women vulnerable to domestic violence and political participation as well.

Voice of Encouragement in this project intends to Strengthen young women in political participation anddecision making as well. As it  is  well  known  that,  there  is  a  low  level  of  young  women  involvement  in political participation and decision making in Tanzania from local government level to central government level. Young women are either neglected or are afraid of engaging in political activities due to cultural issues and fear as well.

Therefore, this project will strengthen young women including indigenous young women, young women from minority ethnic groups, and young women with disabilities to see opportunities in political activities and decision making as well, in Tanga and Morogoro regions. In addition, VET works with NGUVU YA MWANAMKE, a network of university girl-students in Tanzania.

The project aim to identify 30 girls with leadership traits and conduct 3 days leadership skills training to university and secondary schools female students. After the training the university girl-students will be linked to Nguvu  ya  Mwanamke network  and  the  school  girls  will  form  Voice  clubs  in  their  respective schools/localities. The  participants  will be  sought  from  indigenous  ethnic groups  and  women  with disabilities. Furthermore, the counterpart will hold 1 day discussion meeting between the Tanzania women parliamentarians group and two young women representatives from each region on mentoring program for young womens participation in political engagement. The counterpart will work with FUWAVITA to meet withwomen parliamentarians to echo out issues that young women experience on leadership and politics.</narrative>
