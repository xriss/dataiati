   <narrative xml:lang="EN">To ensure and address the immediate food needs of target communities in Sool and Sanaag who are facing food insecurity levels of IPC 4, 3.500 HHs (21:000 individuals: 12.390 female, 8.610 male), they will receive multi purpose cash transfer for a period of three months, mitigating the impact of the drought throughout the lean season.
The livelihood component of this intervention will protect both household and community assets through the protection of core breeding animal by provision of fodder to vaccinated animals, targeting 90.000 head of livestock, benefiting 9.000 HHs (54.000 individuals; 31.860 female and 22.140 male). Training and provision ofveterinary start-up kits for 40 Community Animal Health Workers will benefit 3.600 households for treatment of their livestock.
In the WASH component of the action these communities directly benefit from a comprehensive package of immediate access to safe water, sanitation facilities and improved hygiene practices, including Cash for Water for 3 months for 1.760 of the most vulnerable households, improved storage capacity by provision of 16 communal water tanks, 2 jerry cans per household, and 420 emergency latrines for 4.167 HH (25.002 people), improved access to water by provision of fuel for 5 strategic borehole generators for 3 months, and maintenance of the boreholes will benefit 25.000 individuals (4.167 HH). To promote a safe water chain, Oxfam will distribute water treatment tablets for 3 months to cash for water recipients through hygiene promotion activities, for point of use household water treatment, with a focus on community engagement and participation. This will be accompanied by promotion of the adoption of good hygiene practices. Oxfam will also focus on community engagement initiatives including action planning, periodic review meetings on progress and programme processes, as well to obtain community feedback on the implementation modalities. Community volunteers will be trained on safe water chain, transmission route of water and sanitation related diseases, and preparation of oral rehydration solution (ORS) to promote adoption of good hygiene practices and manage dehydration amongst communities.
All this will be further supported throughprotection interventions. An ongoing protectionanalysis will ensure that activities can adapt to changes in the protection situation, that protection trend information can be shared with appropriate stakeholders, and that advocacy can be carried out where appropriate and necessary. Information on protection and existing services will be disseminated to women and men in target communities so that they are able to make informed decisions when faced with a protection threat or issue. WaSH and EFSL community committees and volunteers will be trained on protection risk analysis, and on how to receive and transmit protection information responsibly. A totalof 3.500 households will benefit from better information and a improved programming as a result.&apos;</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In 2004 Oxfam Novib set up a Liaison Office in Nairobi, Kenya in order to support the Strengthening Somali Civil Society Program, at the request of the EU. This request was based on Oxfam Novib&apos;s work in Somalia to date, but intended to be more widely directed atthe entire civil society sector and the specific context in which it is operating in a post-conflict country. The program started with consulting local organisations in Somalia and Somaliland to get a complete picture of the sectors and regions where they are active, the challenges they face and the relationship between civil society, local political structures and the private sector. A program was then developed to strengthen the institutional development of Oxfam Novib&apos;s partners and those of other Oxfams, as well as a range of new NGOs.
In the first year local consultants were trained in Somalia. They were then seconded to civil society organisations to build their capacity in financial and organisational management. Furthermore, workshops were organised on specific themes suchas human rights and the role of civil society in the Somali context. The Liaison Office is now going to support the expansion of the program, focussing on strengthening both organisation and project management, while facilitating more training in the fields of civic education, governance, human rights and women&apos;s rights, HIV and AIDS and child protection.
Over the years, the Somalia Country Office has expanded its intervention on short term humanitarian response as well as development development interventions. In 2015/2016, a decision was reached to move the Country Programme operation, which was largely in Nairobi, from Nairobi to Hargeisa. The country office has a small office in Nairobi , Kenya and large operations office in Hargeisa, Somaliland.</narrative>
