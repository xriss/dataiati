   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Kebetkache Women Development &lt;(&gt;&amp;&lt;)&gt; Resource Centre is a community action, advocacy and education non-governmental organization working to promote the rights of women in Nigeria and Africa. Kebetkache#s mission is to contribute to the achievement of good governance, and sustainable development through capacity building, advocacy for quality health, respect for women#s human rights, peace &lt;(&gt;&amp;&lt;)&gt; security, equal opportunities and environmental justice.
Kebetkache Women Development &lt;(&gt;&amp;&lt;)&gt; Resource Centre registered with the Corporate Affairs Commission in November 2003 and is also registered with the Special Control Unit on Money Laundery (SCUML).  Kebetkache is committed to strengthening the efforts of community organizers, advocates and scholars who are working to improve the conditions of women; Providing information resources and collaborates on community based project aimed at developing women leadership;defending and promoting human rights and the advancement of democracy and social justice as well as quality service delivery as it relates to maternal health, community development activities,  peace &lt;(&gt;&amp;&lt;)&gt; security, environment, and HIV/AIDS.
Over the past 3 years, Kebetkache#s activities of  research, community mapping, consultation with community gatekeepers, capacity building and networking in four states target to build a critical  mass of informed Nigerian citizens actively demand fair taxation practices and participatory  budgeting towards enhanced transparency and accountability.  The project has built the capacity of over 800 community womenand men in Delta, Rivers, Enugu and Cross Rivers states.  Those trained have been formed into budget advocacy groups. About 21 budget advocacy groups were formed within the first phase of the project in Rivers, Bayelsa, Akwa Ibom, Delta, Enugu and Cross Rivers states. Some beneficiaries in Enugu have embarked on monitoring the implementation of government budget in their localities, some beneficiaries have conducted step down training to other community members.  Some beneficiaries in Rivers state havemonitored implementation of  Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC) projects in their communities.  Trained community members linked to the tax Justice and governance platform in their states.  In Rivers state the Ministryof Women Affairs have committed to ensuring that  they willincorporate women/community needs into the budget, the director for women affairs  during advocacy meeting  and the training in Port Harcourt in 2017 and 2018 encouraged Kebetkache to ensure that community women submit reports of their needs assessment to the Ministry. The Ministry of Budget and Economic Planning in Rivers state has also committed to ensuring that community participates in budget processes in the state. In Enugu state, the Directorate of Visit Every Community (VEC) has committed to working with communities to ensure their needs are given priority during the budget process. Project beneficiaries are therefore encouraged to take advantage of the opportunities offered by the project to influence relevant Ministries and department to ensure their voices are heard in promoting fair taxation and participatory budgeting.

The KEBETKACHE Women Development and Resource Centre is one of the partners that will continue with the implementation of the F4D SP in Nigeriain phase II, contributing to the Outcome on Increased Citizens Voice. The desired change is to achieve womens active role in governance and in holding government accountable in budgetary and fiscal issues and to ensure that their voices are heard in termsof decision making. To this end, community leadership has strong influence. Women need to influence the community leadership to gain support for women inclusiveness and participation in local governance.
Some activities havebeen planned to achieve thesedesired objectives mentioned above. KEBETKACHE will continue to work with existing community women groups in all the project states, as mapped in phase I. This will be done through scheduled visits to states and communities. Meetings will be held withidentified women leaders, and key informants in target states. Kebetkache will also access information on existing women groups from other CSO partners working on the project in the various states. Kebetkache targets to map 100 community women groups acrossthe project states.  The exercise will identify the existence of the organization, registration status, leaders, mission, activities, impact over the years and capacity gaps/needs.
KEBETKACHE will continue to use extract from its Gender Context Analysistoengage stakeholders through town hall meetings and other media. The aim of the exercise is to provide context for thequantitative and qualitative content analyses of gender roles that are to be included and address by the project. This is necessaryto support feminist claims, predict effects on target audiences, identify areas to effect changes in behavior, mindset, address stereotypes.
To empower communities, there is need for exchange visits to Link Communities with relevant Platforms. Community members will be linked up with existing relevant platforms for citizens participation and engagement with the government. Existing platforms will be identified during the mapping exercise and linkages will be created between the project beneficiaries and these platforms. These linkages will be created in the form of training, mobilization, exchange visits, peer review, cross movement dialogue as well as solidarity meetings, or collaboration with Kebetkache with other CSO partners during the course of the project. Some of these platforms are networks and coalitions that are focused on addressing transparency issues with budgetary and fiscal issues. Exchange visits and cross movement dialogue will be held for trained women and men todiscuss, plan engagement, share knowledge, experience, information, strategies and ideas. Each engagement forum with platforms will last for one day.
There will be Advocacy Initiatives to create necessary linkages. This will entail local actions and initiatives undertaken bytrained groups to promote transparency and hold government accountable on issues of budgeting, taxation and other fiscal issues. The project will provide support for the groups to mobilize and initiate their actions. There will be varied actions based ontheinterest and audience the groups seek to engage with. Examples of actions are interactive sessions with policy makers or local government officials; advocacy meetings with elected officials or any identified stakeholder; radio discussion; radio jingle; production of stickers; mass action or direct engagement; town hallmeetings; public enlightenment; rally; monitoring of budget implementation. Groups will be encouraged to be pro-active.
The Power of Voices Partnership (PvP) is an influencing programme with the Netherlands Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The programme  FAIR for ALLled by Oxfam Novib is five year long initiative implemented jointly with consortium members Huairou Commission, SOMO and Third World Network-Africa (TWN-Africa) aimed at supporting and collaborating with people&#x2019;s rightful demands towards companies, governments and multilateral organizations for economic, social and environmental justice, promoting global trade and value-chains that are fair for all. The main focus of the FAIR for ALL programme proposal is to support and strengthen CSOs to play their diverse roles; as educators, mobilizers, creators and watchdogs to make trade and value chains FAIR for ALL.

In Nigeria, FAIR for ALL programme aims at strengthening capacity and raising awareness about the socio-economic costs associated with the Nigerian extractives sector, while advocating for improved governance to ensure that firms in the sector operate in a manner that respects human rights and is conflict sensitive. In addition, the programme will influence policy debates and initiatives to ensure sustained and prudent management of taxrevenue and other revenues from the extractive sector, and promote accountability in delivering public services.

The Nigeria FAIR for ALL programme will be implemented by Oxfam in Nigeria and partners, aiming to: 1) Mobilize citizens and strengthen capacities oflocal organizations to increase the level of accountability of public actors; 2) Monitor state budgets andbuild strong alliances (in particular with women&#x2019;s organizations) towards a well-regulated extractive sector, ensuring better management of natural resources, and more transparent public-private deals; and ensure 3) Fair and inclusive trade and fiscal systems, with proper taxation of extractive industries and investment of revenues through pro-poor spending in basic services. These objectives will be achieved by increased knowledge on public finance management, including overall fiscal knowledge and literacy on public budgets and government expenses, and increasing capacity to foster citizens&#x2019;participation in budget processes. To achieve main objectives of the programme in Nigeria, Oxfam will collaborate with KEBETKECHE</narrative>
