   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Dialogue for Stability: Inclusive politics in fragile settings (2016-2020) The number of countries and regions that are affected by conflict and fragility is globally on the increase. In Central America, a number of countries are hard hit by fragility and criminality; in the Horn of Africa and parts of sub-Saharan and West Africa instability and internal conflict continue to persist and in the MENA region, a number of countries are at risk of collapsing as a result of religious and political sectarianism. Also in the Eastern European neighborhood, high levels of tension and the use of force remain very worrisome. These conflicts are not limited to national borders. Increasingly, international dimensions are at play as the conflicts in Syria and Ukraine painfully reveal. The increasing instability at the eastern and southern borders of Europe also has an immediate effect on Europe&#x2019;s own security and stability levels, as the current migration flows clearly unfolds. These developments require a fundamental rethink of the strategies and responses by the international community, informed by an in-depth understanding of the underlying root causes of the conflicts and fragility dimensions in these countries. To better understand and define its own role and positioning in the changing world order, NIMD recently embarked on a reflection process as part of the preparations for its multi-annual plan for the period 2016-2020. This resulted in the publication of its new Multi-Annual Plan entitled (MAP): &#x2018;Stronger Parties. Deeper Democracy&#x2019;. The MAP describes the vision, objectives, challenges and priorities for the period 2016&#x2013;2020 and is underpinned by an elaborated Theory of Change. Its overall vision is &#x201C;to contribute to legitimate and inclusive political systems which create favourable conditions for peace and security by accommodating divergent views and interests in society and by setting differences in a non-violent way&#x201D;. Since NIMD is increasingly working in political environments which are extremely polarised and divided and in countries that moved either just out of conflict, find themselves in conflict or are at risk of moving towards conflict, NIMD has furthermore prepared an approach for working in fragile and conflict-affected settings. In line with NIMD&#x2019;s Theory of Change, this approach focusses on three interrelated levels related to political system, political actor and political culture change. Over the past few months, NIMD has engaged in consultations with the Stabilisation and Humanitarian Aid Department (DSH) of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to explore the possibilities for the Ministry to continue its support the NIMD beyond the current subsidy that comes to an end in December 2015. The outcome of these deliberations has resulted in the approval of a first grant under the Strategic Partnership for lobby and advocacy and the invitation to submit a five year programme to contribute to inclusive politics in fragile settings and for NIMD institutionally, on knowledge and innovation, monitoring and evaluation and fundraising. This programme called &#x201D;Dialogue for Stability: inclusive politics in fragile settings&#x201D;, particularly aims to contribute to open and accessible political systems and the legitimacy and responsiveness of political actors in countries affected by conflict and fragility. The programme therefore directly contributes to the vision and objectives laid down in NIMD&#x2019;s MAP and the goals on inclusive political processes and legitimate and capable governments as defined in the policy spearhead on Security and the Rule of Law of the MFA. Furthermore, it contribute to the aim of peaceful and inclusive sustainable development and accountable and inclusive institutions as defined in the 16th Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) recently adopted. NIMD will concentrate its efforts on a selected number of countries (Burundi, South Sudan, Ukraine, Tunisia and Colombia) where it can build on its existing political and partner networks, knowledge base and infrastructure. These country programmes will be based on a country specific baseline and theory of change, informed by an in depth political economy analysis. Furthermore, explorations and a limited number of activities will be conducted in Jordan, Lebanon, Kurdistan and Israel-Palestinian territories. Depending on the political environments and potential entry points in these three countries and one region, they could overtime evolve into fully fledged programmes. Next to these country programmes, the Dialogue for Stability programme will further deepen NIMD&#x2019;s knowledge base, invest in its skills-set and develop tools and instruments regarding interparty dialogue, capacity strengthening, political culture and gender diversity and inclusiveness. A specific part of NIMD&#x2019;s knowledge agenda will be devoted to strategies, skills and expertise for working in fragile and conflict affected settings in recognition of the fact that working in such sensitive contexts requires a tailored approach. Furthermore, NIMD will strengthen its knowledge base on new thinking about participatory democracy and stimulate and explore (programmatic and political) innovation in its new and existing programme countries.</narrative>
