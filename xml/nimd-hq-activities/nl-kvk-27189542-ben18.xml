   <narrative xml:lang="EN">1. Political update 2018

Immediately after his investiture 6 April 2016, President Talon announced his intention to embark on deep structural reforms. To this end, he promptly set up a political and institutional reforms committee, which shared the results of its work with the Government by the end of 2016. The Government sent a draft revision of the Constitution to the National Assembly in March 2017 for review, using an &#x201C;emergency procedure&#x201D;. 

It was the latter that sparked a great upheaval throughout the political class but also in the ranks of civil society organizations and citizens, who strongly challenged a process that was not considered participatory and inclusive. At the vote in Parliament, 23 MPs (one of whom abstained) managed to get the bill reject. Indeed, the approval of three quarters out the 83 MPs was needed for the draft to be declared admissible. This rejection has subsequently weakened the entire political class, with numerous split offs in all major political parties and party alliances. 

The parliamentary groups in the National Assembly have been undergoing major restructuring since then. Two blocks are now distinguished at the level of the National Assembly: a block that declares itself from the opposition, with about twenty MPs at this point; and the block of the parliamentary majority composed of about sixty MPs. The movements and cleavages between the two blocks continues, while MPs created new parliamentary groups while others disappeared. 

It should nevertheless be emphasized that all political parties were unanimous on the need to reform the current party system in Benin, especially in term of party financing. It cannot be asserted that the government of Patrice Talon has definitively abandoned to review the current Constitution. Analysts expect him to bring even the constitutional review back on the table, possibly after the 2019 legislative elections.

Currently reforms previously proposed by the Government are being taken over by groups of MPs of the majority to be introduced as a law proposed by parliamentarians. It seems a new strategy to get reforms through with less upheaval. These reforms relate to key elements shaping the political system, such as the Electoral Law and revision of other laws shaping the partisan system.

The second major political development in 2017 was the internal crisis faced by next to all major political parties. La Renaissance du Benin (RB) saw the dismissal of its president and a congress electing a new board, and court cases. The Social Democratic Party is also facing a crisis, caused by a conflict between its current president, Emmanuel Golou, and its former president, Bruno Amoussou, who presides one of the major party alliance (l&#x2019;Union fait la Nation - UN). Finally, the Force Cauris pour un B&#xE9;nin Emergent (FCBE), a party alliance created by the former President of the Republic Boni Yayi, has fractioned to the point of risking complete disappearance. Most of its leaders decided to plead allegiance to the current president, while others declared themselves of the opposition. It was reported by the media that president Talon is currently negotiating to create his own alliance of political parties. 

The latest development is one of crisis within the local councils, with the dismissals of mayors and contested elections of new mayors.

Against this backdrop, efforts to facilitate well-informed inter-party and party-parliamentary dialogue are as welcome as ever. The current mode of governance -with attempts to push reforms through the National Assembly- demands even greater vigilance and flexibility in our efforts. The stakes are high with the upcoming legislative (2019) and presidential (2021) elections.


2. Problem Analysis &amp; Theory of Change Update 
The Theory of Change and problem analysis, as elaborated at the beginning of the programme, remains very much valid. 

The two political dialogue sessions held in 2017 on the constitutional review and partisan system reform informed the respective processes. Budgetary restraints and AWEPA&#x2019;s internal problems meant that there was little follow-up during this year. Both processes are formally on hold, but strong indications suggest that the political system reform agenda will keep moving forward. It is therefore opportune to continue offering opportunity for political dialogue. And focus on specific reform topics with concrete input from political parties and civil society, and to continue to involve MPs in order to prepare the ground for future system-level reforms.
 
All political parties but one are in flux. Capacity strengthening remains an interesting entry point in the current political context, especially with the ongoing reform pending. The intention is to help parties that show the will to impove. The aim is to support parties to better articulate positions and build capacity in terms of communication &#x2013; competences that will come useful in the 2019, 2020 and 2021 elections.

Our work with the National Assembly will facilitate work on system reform, builds the capacity of key political actors (MPs, Government officials) and bring accountability elements into the parliamentary culture. NIMD makes a start with this in 2018, building on previous AWEPA work. This component is funded under the EU project for which the SP provides co-funding. The latter co-funding element &#x2013;in the form of a law-making and law-editing training for Parliamentary staff- that features in the 2018 SP plan for Benin.*)

Building a critical mass of young politicians through the Benin Democracy School remains relevant. 2018 should feature a regular school year for a new group of students, while strengthening the ties with alumni and developing a plan to make most of the growing network. And ultimately improve the political representation of women and youth.</narrative>
