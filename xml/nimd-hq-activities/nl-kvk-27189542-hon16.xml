   <narrative xml:lang="EN">EL SALVADOR&#x2019;S POLITICAL BACKGROUND El Salvador is located in the northern part of Central America, and is part of the so called Northern Triangle together with Honduras and Guatemala. The three countries face a lot of similar challenges especially in the area of security. Socio economic situation Although the economy has steadily increased over the last decade in El Salvador, a large proportion of the population continues to live in poverty and the level of unemployment remains high. Young people and women are even more vulnerable to the socio economic situation. Furthermore, the country experiences some of the highest crime levels of the world. On top of that, climate change poses a serious challenge for El Salvador, because it is particularly vulnerable to extreme climatic events such as hurricanes, floods and droughts. As a result, tensions around sufficient clean water supply have built up. The country is dependent on Guatemala and Honduras for its water supply. Democratic system Over the last decades, the democratic system of El Salvador has been dominated by two parties : the conservative right-wing party &#x2018;Nationalist Republican Alliance (ARENA)&#x2019; and the &#x2018;Farabundo Mart&#xED; National Liberation Front (FMLN)&#x2019;, which transitioned from a guerrilla movement to a leftist political party. After an initial domination of the political landscape by the ARENA party from 1989 until 2009, in 2009 the FMLN managed to win the elections for the first time and subsequently installed the first left-wing government in El Salvador. In February 2014, the FMLN won the elections again with a very narrow margin. In March 2015, elections took place for the Legislative Assembly, the Central American Parliament and the municipal governments. For the first time in history Salvadorans chose plural or multi-party municipal councils (before that the &#x2018;winner takes all&#x2019; system was applied). These elections also had another new feature: for the first time a quota regulation of 30% for women was applied for the electoral lists. Despite a high perception of corruption and friction between the judiciary on the one hand and the presidency and legislative assembly on the other, the democratic institutions are perceived to be functioning reasonably well. THE APPROACH OF NIMD IN EL SALVADOR NIMD&#x2019;s work in El Salvador started at the end of 2012. As a result, the programme was focused on preparing the political parties for the changes in the electoral system for the 2015 elections. In light of the changes in the electoral law for the municipal elections, NIMD developed a &#x2018;train the trainers programme&#x2019; for all political parties on dialogue skills and consensus building: important skills to have to ensure governability at local level. NIMD did this in coordination with other organizations. Inclusion of underrepresented groups In its work, NIMD pays special attention to the inclusion of underrepresented groups in politics. The establishment of the quota regulations was an important step forward in Guatemala and resulted in over 30% of women elected in the Legislative Assembly. NIMD supports capacity building of women politicians through an intensive training course for women politicians from all political parties and from national and local level. Furthermore, NIMD seeks to contribute to a democratic culture where the rights of women and men are respected. We do this by investigating the barriers that hamper political participation of women and by exchanging best practices on gender sensitive policy and legislation. Capacity building of youth Young people tend to shy away from a career in politics, not seeing the possibilities that the political arena offers to positively influence important decisions about the future of the country. NIMD is in the process of establishing a Democracy School for young people from political and civil society to prepare them for their careers. At this school they will be able to practice democratic skills and behaviours and learn how to speak, listen and debate with mutual respect and focus on programmatic content. Environmental Dialogue NIMD also facilitates dialogue between civil society and political actors on issues related to environmental governance and security, such as water management. This approach is part of our Democratic Dialogue for Environmental Security programme. The programme is implemented together with Cordaid and is being carried out in El Salvador, Colombia and Guatemala. Programme deviations/ToC update: The main bottlenecks and challenges experienced within the program were the lack of interest of political parties to initiate a debate on electoral reform during much of the year, due to the divergent positions of the main parties and the lack of willingness / consent to push for a platform for the dialogue; however, it was satisfactory that at least three of the political parties used the electoral reform proposals that were identified and worked with them during 2015(NIMD and NDI joint workshops). In addition, at the end of the year, a large multiparty meeting was held to exchange views on the electoral context and challenges (almost all party representations attended it), demonstrating that NIMD maintains the ability to convene on the issue and that there is at least willingness to sit down to dialogue, given the imminence of the electoral process in 2017.</narrative>

   </title>
   <description>
    <narrative xml:lang="EN">In Honduras, according to long-term researches of democratic political culture (LAPOP 2014), most of the population reveal attitudes of high or low support to the system and low support to some democratic values (such as tolerance to other people&#xB4;s political ideas), which characterizes the country as one between authoritarian stability with tendency to democracy in risk (LAPOP 2014). Political analysts and key informants consider that there is also an important deficit of compliance to some of the basic elements of the democratic culture and its inherent values -rule of law, accountability, check-and-balances, tolerance, inclusion, participation&#x2026;- among political actors (e.g.: political parties and its members). The recent sociopolitical history of the country, is proof of this: a coup d&#xB4;etat in 2009, frequent bizarre decisions from Parliament and Supreme Court, tendency to models of authoritarian rule, corruption scandals and a high level of corruption perception (TI), social inequity, and low Human Development Index (UNDP) increasing levels of political discrimination or violence -including gender motivated. To understand how political actors do internalize democratic values (such as the ones mentioned above), a small survey of 36 participants was applied in July 2016 to young members of the main Honduran political parties (5) in the main city of the country (Tegucigalpa) to ask their opinions and perception about some democratic institution, democratic values and dialogue skills. Young politicians usually offer a good sample of the attitudes and beliefs prevailing within Honduran politics: most of them became part of these political organizations through spontaneous and volunteer registration or after being targeted and selected by recruitment campaign, therefore they have a deep commitment and sense of group belonging that make their internalized opinions about certain issues, highly representative of what other people alike them think. Political actors can be more or less aware of the values (democratic or antidemocratic) implicit in their opinions and actions. Specific trainings designed for political actors (like the NIMD Schools for Democracy) can provide tools and exercises to facilitate the internalization and practice of democratic values, rule of law and gender sensitive &amp; inclusive politics, however it is necessary to measure how much these topics are internalized before and after the trainings. The data collected with the referred sample of young politicians will provide in the future a standard of comparison of this awareness. Additionally, data collected with similar questionnaires applied before and after each training of the School of Democracy, will offer evidence of any change in the awareness and internalization of such values.</narrative>

      <narrative xml:lang="EN">Related to this outcome and indicator, political actors are attendees (men and women) and alumni (men and women) of the School of Democracy, who are members of political parties and who in the measurement period include democratic values, rule of law and or gender &amp; inclusive politics, dialogue skills, in their political actions, public statements and communications. Percentage (%) is referred to the 100% of young politicians who participated in the survey. Quantitative data: 77% of young politicians consulted expressed respect for inclusion (diversity) values 74% of young politicians consulted expressed acceptance of equal gender inclusion 56% of young politicians consulted participate in different organizational activities (besides politics) 50% of young politicians consulted supported basic elements of rule of law 81% of young politicians consulted support democracy as the best system of government 84% of young politicians consulted appreciate transparency as a value 56% of young politicians consulted responded showing some dialogue skills 42% of young politicians consulted expressed tolerance to political opponents. Qualitative description: A group of 36 young politicians (18 to 35 years old) from five (5) majority and minority political parties participated in a private survey of 24 questions (some of them of multiple items), performed by NIMD Honduras in July 2016, to know their opinions and perceptions about democratic values, rule of law and or gender &amp; inclusive politics, dialogue skills. 53% were women, 47% were men. Most of the questions included in the survey were inspired in questions included in the famous research on democratic political culture performed in Honduras over the last 10 years (2004-2014) by Vanderbilt University (LAPOP), which covers many aspects and elements of the democracy by asking popular opinion in every Latin-American country. The questions included in the survey were focused on obtaining information about inclusion (respect of racial, gender and sexual diversity), participation in different organizations and community issues (not only politics), opinion and support of basic elements of rule of law and democracy (e.g. check-and-balances; support or not of coup d&#x2019;&#xE9;tat or reasons to oust a president); transparency and accountability; dialogue skills and tolerance to other ideas and opinions. Averages and percentages were obtained after tabulation of the answers -from sets of questions- intended to measure each value or characteristic. The values obtained can be compared to similar responses in 2014 LAPOP research (e.g.: tolerance obtained in Honduras a 50.1% and support to democracy got 69.7 in whole Latin America in LAPOP, 2014; compare with 42% and 81% of baseline survey, respectively) and provide data for a private baseline to identify weak or strong attitudes toward democratic values, not only from political actors who are potential participants of NIMD&#xB4;s Schools of Democracy, but among final attendees of these trainings (at the beginning and after completion of their participation) to evaluate real impact and changes in their attitudes (if any).</narrative>

   </title>
   <description>
    <narrative xml:lang="EN">In Honduras, political actors -from official and opposition parties- have currently limited capability to relate to each other and to CS. To overcome polarization and mistrust resulting from the 2013 general elections, the ruling National Party *(without a majority in Parliament)- managed to establish a governing alliance (1) with the Liberal party (27 seats and former main opposite party within the traditional bipartisan system), other minority parties and defectors from opposition parties, to take control of the legislative branch and the legislative process. This tactical alliance has proved to be fruitful for both parties: it helped them to enact laws, to approve Budgetary provisions, to control the board of the Parliament and decisive Ordinary Committees and as the pivotal base of the election of the new Supreme Court of Justice (together with other minority political forces). On the other hand, the governing alliance diminished the political influence and possibilities of the other two main opposition parties (Libre and PAC) However, in some relevant occasions Liberal party PMs did not follow this dynamic -blocking opposition parties- and voted together with Libre and PAC (against a constitutional reform and the appointment of a high state official) proving that the alliance with National Party has limits. The capability to attract and relate to CS actors for the enactment of legislation and its performance on policy goals is limited and it depends mainly on the issue. That is the case of relevant themes for NIMD.</narrative>

   </title>
   <description>
    <narrative xml:lang="EN">Normally, in Honduras political parties have very little interest in consulting, collaborating and harmonizing their political behavior with other civic actors. This characteristic is a consequence of several factors, some historical, mainly related to the predominant bipartisan and patronage system of the last half century, as well as the prevailing authoritarian rule model, that prevented the development of a truly democratic arena within the country, which would have favored the strengthening of democratic political practices (like democratic dialogue and legitimate popular representation) among the main political institutions and other stakeholders. Civic actors (CS organizations, organized groups of citizens related to specific interests, social movements) gained access and influence to parliamentary representatives and executive officials during the first decade of 21st century, as a consequence of demands from international development cooperation to democratize the socio-political scenario in Honduras (Parliament used to negotiate a legislative Agenda with thematic CS sectors). Civic actors influence decreased substantially, mainly because of a diminished lobbying capacity, polarization after the 2009 coup d&#x2019;&#xE9;tat and the lack of support from a wide base of people (including social pressure), that became obvious to political actors. Sense of trust and mutual understanding among and between political and civic actors depend more on personal initiative and leadership of political and civic actors or their lobbying capacities. For example, stakeholders from private sector and from other economic and productive areas, show their influence by using lobbying strategies to consult and obtain collaboration from political actors which ease collaboration in harmonizing legislation and public policies. Actions of coordination, dialogue and consultation between political actors and between political actors and civic actors, related to political reform, women&#xB4;s political participation, fiscal reform and climate change including water management (not exclusive), usually happen through bilateral meetings, thematic debates, fora and encounters between political and civil society. &#x2022; Political reform is facing obstacles, mainly because of lack of political consensus, interest and trust between political actors; this lack of collaboration extends its effects to the exchange of positions and harmonization efforts with civic actors. The only exception is the initiative for a new law on politics/campaign financing (supported by OAS-MACCIH), which has already produced opportunities for collaboration between the parties that participate in the Electoral Reform Committee and some SC actors involved in transparency and accountability issues (at least meeting 1 time per month). &#x2022; About women&#xB4;s political participation, consultation and collaboration among and between political and civic actors has increased during the last years, especially for the common goal of the 50% quota (gender parity) and rank ordering rules (&#x201C;zipper shape&#x201D;) effective implementation in the 2017 elections; all relevant parties and some feminist organizations have accomplished an important joint work in the revision and proposal of a &#x201C;gender parity and rank ordering rules&#x201D; (&#x201C;zipper shape&#x201D;) (on certain moments meeting 1 time weekly). &#x2022; On fiscal reform, collaboration between political actors (ruling and opposition) has been evident in some tax reforms (within Parliament) in order to harmonize proposals and bills (specially tributary Code) and also between some political actors (ruling party) and private stakeholders, as well as some groups of interest (like the Promoter Group of Tax Dialogue, which has been able to meet and have conversations each 2 weeks with the main figures of government, ruling party and opposition parties and relevant MPs (Budget and Finance and External Cooperation Committee). &#x2022; Finally, climate change and water management issues have become of increasing interest from some minority of the political actors (mainly ruling party), but with different approaches: Climate Change issues show limited consulting and collaboration among political actors and between political actors (in Parliament) and CS actors (sometimes null), mainly because the main actions respond to an external (international) demand, governmental formal actions and laws enactments from Parliament and have not produced a sense of trust and mutual understanding between political actors and CS actors, because of the absence or minimal comprehensive vision on environmental protection from the official sector. On the other hand, Water Management issues respond more and more to a decentralized and local perspective, where collaborative response and participation on the national level is progressively less relevant.</narrative>

      <narrative xml:lang="EN">For purposes of the outcome indicator, political actors are political parties integrated in Parliament Committees whose representatives work or coordinate actions together with CS actors (also known as Civil Society -CS, include Civil Society Organizations, citizen/interest groups, social movements), or have interaction and encounters to dialogue about issues of common interest or disagreement. This actions of coordination, dialogue and consultation can be through thematic debates and encounters between political and civil society related to political reform, women&#xB4;s political participation, fiscal reform and climate change including water management (not exclusive).

Qualitative description: Percentage (quantitative data) is built by dividing the # of relevant political actors related to each issue of public concern (political reform, women&#xB4;s political participation, fiscal reform and climate change including water management) who collaborate actively with CS actors at least 1 time per month, by the total # of political actor&#x2019;s time (100). In the current legislative year, there are different share of members of Parliament integrated to specialized Committees, who indicate that they consult civic actors at least one (1) time per month on imminent legislative debates. Highest percentage is related to women&#xB4;s political participation (67%) issues and tax (44 and 36%) issues; lowest are political reform (18%) issues and climate change and water management (14%) issues. However, data for this indicator should be studied more and in detail.</narrative>

      <narrative xml:lang="EN">Quantitative data: 1 active CS consultation of law making process in political reform (financing) 1 active CS consultation of law implementing process about women political participation: 50% quota &amp; rank ordering rules (&#x201C;zipper shape&#x201D;). 1 active CS consultation of law making process (proposal phase) of fiscal reform 2 active CS consultation of law making process on climatic change and water management Qualitative description: 1. Political reform: there is one (1) law making process going on (related to politics/campaign financing) that includes CS consultation (1) due to the intervention of the OAS Mission to Support the Fight against Corruption and Impunity in Honduras (MACCIH). MACCIH is advising and outlining a new normative framework on political/electoral financing, in close effort with the Electoral Affairs Committee, in consultation with political and civil society actors. 2. Women political participation: CS consultation has been effective in the process of formulation and proposal of legislation related to equal political participation of women: a joint proposal of effective regulation of the principle of alternation within the mandatory 50% quota (parity and zipper system) in voting lists in next primary and general elections (2017) has been prepared by the Gender&#xB4;s Equity Committee of Parliament together with political and CS actors that will be decided up at the end of 2016. Consultation of CS is currently happening (1). 3. Fiscal reform: The Executive branch (Presidency) has prepared a new Tributary Code to reform fiscal issues, after seven (7) months of socialization with different stakeholders. This proposal will be discussed and approved by Parliament in the second semester of 2016. A platform of CS actors and Group for the promotion of Fiscal Dialogue (GPDF) has demanded (July 2016) an inclusive process of discussion within the Parliament before its approval (at the time of the preparation of this baseline is not clear if Parliament will assign this relevant fiscal instrument to the Budget Committee or if it is going to create a special Committee). 4. Climate change (includes water management): climate change and water management affairs had an important boost in 2014 with the enactment of Climate Change Act (Environment and Climate Change Committee was involved) and in 2013 with the approval of Water and Sanitation Sector Law (2013); both lawmaking processes were done by Parliament and included active participation and consultation of CS actors. Currently, there are not specific lawmaking processes going on, though, there are strong critics of the public policy process following the implementation of the act, led by the Environment Ministry (MiAmbiente), which apparently lacks enough CS participation and consultation. On the other hand, Water management legal provisions promote decentralization of water management to local governments and requires active CS consultation during their implementation at local level. Climate change Law (2014) making process included a process of consultation with civic actors, led by the Inter-Agency Technical Committee on Climate Change (CTICC), responsible for the development of the National Climate Change Strategy (ENCC) in 2010 (the Strategy had an extensive process of national consultation, which included different regions).</narrative>

      <narrative xml:lang="EN">We understand # of structural changes and mechanisms as the # of changes in laws/bills, regulations, public policies and proposals, that rule or provide procedures for consultation, representation or direct participation (inclusion) possibilities of diverse political and civic actors in law and policy making processes. Political actors refer to political parties and political movements; civic actors (also known as Civil Society -CS) include Civil Society Organizations, citizen/interest groups, social movements. Quantitative data: &#x2022; Laws, bills, regulations, public policies, proposals formulated 2 constitutional provisions for consultation and direct participation and they are: articles 5 and 213, related to plebiscite, referenda and &#x201C;citizen&#xB4;s law initiative&#x201D;. 2 laws regulating citizen&#xB4;s participation mechanisms (1 at national level, 1 at municipalities level). 0 provisions for mandatory public consultation in National Congress Organic Act. 0 Constitutional provisions for public policy making. 1 law for public policies framework. &#x2022; Laws, bills, regulations, public policies, proposals implemented 0 Plebiscites or Referenda (national level) 0 Plebiscites (municipal level) 1 citizen&#xB4;s initiative (law reform proposal) 7 public policies (national level) Qualitative description: There are two (2) constitutional provisions (art. 5 and art. 213) that allow direct participation of any group of citizens in the law making process and its regulation Act (Citizen&#xB4;s Participation Mechanisms Act, 2013). A group of 3,000 citizens can submit a bill proposal to Parliament to be discussed and, if supported by parliamentarians, approved (&#x201C;citizen&#xB4;s law initiative&#x201D;); this provision is part of a group of mechanisms for direct people&#xB4;s participation (art. 5) which include plebiscite and referendum (2% of citizens registered in national electoral census can ask for it to Parliament). Citizen&#xB4;s initiative has been used only once (1) since this mechanism was enshrined in Constitution (2011) and no national plebiscite and referendum has been organized ever (0). Plebiscite exists at municipal level since 1990 and proved to be effective to support some municipal decisions (such as banning alcoholic beverage sales); however, its usage diminished over the last decade mainly because of implementation costs (none during the last year-0). The lawmaking process established by the 1982 Constitution and regulations included within National Congress Organic Act (2014) DO NOT require parliamentarians, alone or integrated to Congressional Commissions, to consult civic actors during the discussion or approval of new legislation. Nonetheless, lately the selection and appointment of senior state officials and some lawmaking processes included more political and civic actors, especially if the law is potentially conflictive and if there is external cooperation involved in the issue (e.g.: public televised audiences and hearings during selection and appointment of candidates to high positions -like Supreme Court; or last year, regarding a new proposal of criminal code which has been under wide civic consultation: the technical assistance to this process has been provided by the Spanish International Cooperation Agency and the Agency demanded it as a condition to grant the assistance). Currently, there are 29 ordinary Congressional Committees responsible for many and varied issues of public interest. The Congress Organic Act establishes as mandatory the integration of representatives from all parties included in the Parliament in ordinary and special Committees, allowing multiparty participation within the committees (29 of the ordinary ones are multiparty integrated). Although the integration of committees and their internal debates are multiparty orientated, during debates and proposals enactments in Parliament &#x2018;plenaries prevails the exclusion of opposition parties&#x2019; opinions and inputs, as a consequence of the influence of the ruling governing alliance between the National Party and the Liberal Party. There are no constitutional provisions established for public policy making (0). In 2013, the Parliament approved one (1) Act creating a public policy framework on social matters (Public policy framework law on social matters), which established -among others- procedures to guarantee inclusion and coordination as well as mandatory participation of all relevant social actors (civic actors) in areas of governmental social action (for example, social protection, social investment, social economy, social development, social integration). Before and after this law enactment, at least seven (7) public policies were discussed and approved with active participation of CS actors (among them -most relevant- 2nd Plan of equality and gender equality in Honduras 2010, Social Protection Policy 2012, Human Rights Public Policy 2013), though, according to key informants, on a regular basis social actors have little influence over public policy making due to fragmentation and reduced effective lobbying.</narrative>
