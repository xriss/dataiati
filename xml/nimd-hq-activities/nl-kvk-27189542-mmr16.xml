   <narrative xml:lang="EN">MYANMAR&#x2019;S POLITICAL BACKGROUND Since 2011, Myanmar has gradually been returning to civilian rule, cumulating in historic nationwide elections held on November 8th, 2015, and the subsequent installation of new parliaments 3 months later. Over the past few years, a series of social and economic reforms were launched in Myanmar, opening up the country to the global community after a long period of isolation. At the same time, the country is still trying to end conflict with some of its numerous ethnic groups. THE APPROACH OF NIMD IN MYANMAR Together with Demo Finland, NIMD started working in Myanmar in 2014. The programme in Myanmar has two key aims. The first is to help the politicians from all the political parties to enhance their knowledge and skills for working in a democracy. The second is to develop the practice of collaboration. The programme works on both of these aims by running the Myanmar School of Politics (MySoP), an intensive retreat lasting up to one month, held at a secluded location. During MySoP, politicians from different parties discuss and learn together in a multiparty setting. During 2014 and 2015, these schools have been held in Shan State, Mon State, and Tanintharyi Division, with Kayin State and Kayah State added in 2016. MySoP is followed by activities for its alumni. These activities provide an opportunity for the politicians to keep coming together to learn and practice interparty dialogue. Bram Steenhuisen is Demo Finland&#x2019;s and NIMD&#x2019;s Country Representative in Myanmar. In an interview with Demo Finland he gives an insight into the school&#x2019;s activities.</narrative>

   </title>
   <description>
    <narrative xml:lang="EN">Myanmar political dynamics are characterized by polarization and mutual distrust caused by recent history as well as unfamiliarity with the concept of multiparty dialogue. The levels of trust and engagement between political and civic actors are equally low, and the ruling party exerts a high level of control over the political arena. In general there is a general lack of inclusive consultative mechanisms, both party members as well as people from all parts of society are excluded from influencing policies. Furthermore there is no clear linkage between parties and their MP&#x2019;s, leaving parties out of influencing the decision making process. Unfortunately, it is not feasible to make general surveys among party members in Myanmar. There is strong sense of superstition towards international (democracy) support actors for trying to influence the Myanmar transition it is difficult for an organization to ask about these matters, this needs to be carefully prepared well beforehand. As we did not want to jeopardize our emerging reputation of a trustworthy and impartial organization by asking all kinds of &#x2018;delicate&#x2019; questions to party members without having ample time to prepare them, we chose to interview those political party members who were participating in our programme and to whom we could explain why we were asking those questions. It is for that reason the sample size is not too large. However, we do hope to broaden the # of participant for the mid-term measurement after three years.</narrative>

      <narrative xml:lang="EN">Quantitative data: 4 (out of a total of 26 documents studied) Qualitative description: In Myanmar the # of political documents is rather limited, many parties do not have a manifesto or election programme. Furthermore some political documents are classified or their location is not made public. Some political parties do not have websites or sometimes their websites cease to exist, making it even harder to access information. For that reason we have felt pressured to accept the fact that we could only include a limited # of official political documents and extended the way to measure this indicator meaning also to include (a limited # of) Facebook and media statements. For this desk research 26 political documents have been collected from 15 political parties in Myanmar. The political documents included in the research are election manifesto&#x2019;s, party&#x2019;s policies, stance and work programmes that are public declaration of principles, aims, organizational attitudes and planned activities, these account for 54 percent. The other 46 percent of the studies documents are other political documents such as proclamations or directives. The collected information from different sources was used to check against whether the party made reference to the party&#x2019;s engagement with its constituencies through a consultation moment in order to gain inputs for producing such political documents. Documents have been selected from these parties: Zomi Congress for Democracy, Democratic Party (Myanmar), National Unity Party, Union Solidarity and Development Party, Pa-O National Organization, Kachin State Democracy Party, Lisu National Development Party, Wa Democratic Party, Kayin People&#x2019;s Party, Lahu National Development Party, Kokang Democracy and Unity Party, National League for Democracy, Mon National Party, Arakan National Party and Shan Nationalities League for Democracy. When studied, only 15 percent &#x2013; 4 documents &#x2013; of a total of 26 political documents suggest that they have inputs from particular constituencies through consultation moment for particular issues. These documents were issued by the Zomi Congress for Democracy, National Unity Party, Pa-O National Party and Kachin State Democracy Party. They all are in the category of election manifesto, policy, stance and work programmes. Obviously, the political documents issued by the political parties basically all show an interest in their constituencies. All the issues, sectors and social classes shown in the policy documents all address issues those common in any similar countries. The same is true of other political documents such as proclamations, directives and official requests that express public expectations and demands on their behalf. The rest of the collected political documents accounting for 75 percent &#x2013; was made up of policy objectives, work plans and other forms of party&#x2019;s statements. The 75 percent documents issued by both nationwide large/small Bama and ethnic based parties have a # of things in common: &#x2022; The election manifesto declares a lot of issues to be addressed and a great # of sectors and social classes to be improved and social infrastructure to be developed. They include the promotion of democracy and human rights through constitutional amendment, establishment of federalism, improvement of legislative and judicial bodies and gender equality. Such sectors as agricultural, fishery, forestry, industrial, service provision, national defense and security, international relation, macroeconomic, investment and public administration are intended to improved, and also the document aims at narrowing the gap in socioeconomic conditions between urban and rural areas through the development of social infrastructure. In addition, the document focuses on the interests of workers and peasants through social welfare provision and the importance of preserving national characteristics. Even the USDP, military affiliated ruling party at that time, declares the amendment of the constitution and promotion of human rights. &#x2022; The manifesto is general and vague. Despite the description of the issues to be addressed and things to be improved in its presented declaration, it lacks the discussion about how each issue has been brought to the party, how to achieve these goals, prioritization among them and timeframe. &#x2022; When provided by some parties, the work plan along with policy ambition does not show how to achieve the particular aim, but more likely to be policy declaration again.</narrative>

      <narrative xml:lang="EN">Quantitative data: On a scale from 1 to 4, the baseline measurement score is 2: political actors hearing the concerns of constituency, but not able to change policies. The values related to different scores are the following: 1- political actors not hearing the concerns of constituency; 2- political actors hearing the concerns of constituency, but not able to change policies; 3- political actors hearing the concerns of constituency, with some ability to change policies; 4- political actors hearing the concerns of constituency and able to change policies. Qualitative description: In Myanmar, political actors at state/regional level seem to experience that their concerns are heard however they are not able to change policies within their parties. This is mostly related to the quite hierarchical and top-down structure of political parties in Myanmar and in Myanmar society at large. Policies, as far as they exist, are written at headquarters and political actors do not have a lot of influence in this process.</narrative>

      <narrative xml:lang="EN">The most recently available 2015 Asiabarometer measures public trust in institutions in Myanmar. A small portion of Myanmar citizens expressed a &#x2018;great deal of trust&#x2019; in various political institutions, with a larger portion expressing the other positive category, &#x2018;quite a lot of trust&#x2019;. There was considerable variation in the trust of different institutions, with the executive, military, and NGOs receiving the highest trust, and police and courts the lowest level of trust across institutions. Cross-national comparisons of the trust in political institution showed Myanmar&#x2019;s low trust levels in the executive, police, courts and military, while the low trust level of parliament was on par with other countries in the region. We choose the level of trust in parties as our baseline measurement, collapsing the categories &#x201C;a great deal (7%)&#x201D; and &#x201C;quite a lot (36%)&#x201D;.</narrative>
