   <narrative xml:lang="EN">1. Political update 2017
Political polarization, informal governance and the parliamentary elections of October 8th, defined Georgia&#x2019;s political landscape in 2016. The polarization between the two main parties, the ruling Georgian Dream (GD) and the United National Movement (UNM) of former president Mr. Saakashvili did not recede. While GD&#x2019;s overall approval rankings shrank in 2016 and the coalition itself fell apart (after the Free Democrats Party and later, the Republicans left), the UNM had difficulties to re-shape itself and expand its electoral base. This polarization contributed to the deterioration of citizens&#x2019; trust in the parliament and in political parties. The two individuals heading the parties continued to exert power from beyond the formal framework of politics and governance. While Michael Saakashvili, currently the Governor of Odessa in Ukraine, continued to address and mobilize (via video messages and online) support to UNM, the former Prime Minister, Bidzina Ivanishvili, remained a defining political force for GD and its governance while officially distancing himself from any political role and therefore denying responsibility. This is a fundamental problem, as governance without accountability undermines the credibility of political institutions and risks portraying democracy as a cover-up for behind the scenes influence by interest groups and individuals. 
The elections of October 08, 2016 were generally appraised by international observers as free and fair, solidifying Georgia&#x2019;s position of as a regional leader in democratic reforms. However, there are challenges that merit closer attention: The inability of pro-democracy political parties (The Republicans and the Free Democrats) to clear the 5% electoral threshold has weakened democratic forces in the country. The rise of the nationalistic &#x201C;Alliance of Georgian Patriots,&#x201D; which was able to gain enough votes to clear the electoral threshold is a clear sign of disillusionment of the Georgian voters with standing politics and shows that anti-democratic propaganda has taken root in Georgia. 

2. Programme &amp; Theory of Change Update
With GD currently primed to obtain super majority in the Parliament, it will be highly important that it does not turn its constitutional majority into a political weapon against the UNM and in favour of its own partisan interests; political pluralism must survive and thrive; efforts will need to be made to strengthen democratic political groups both within GD and UNM as well as in other groups and political parties. Therefore, the NIMD will continue its efforts to address the capacity of political actors, further improve the political and electoral playing field and enhance democratic political culture. This will be done through bilateral support programs to political parties, multilateral dialogue efforts to advance the participation of women, youth and national minorities and the operation of Democracy Schools. In 2017, as well as onwards, NIMD&#x2019;s theory of change of simultaneously addressing the interrelated issues related to political actors, culture and system will attain heightened importance amidst rising anti-democratic sentiments, decreasing trust in political parties and further deepening polarization between the GD and the UNM, with a yet unclear role for the populist and anti-western Alliance of Georgian Patriots to play in that setting.
