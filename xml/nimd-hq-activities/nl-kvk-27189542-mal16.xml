   <narrative xml:lang="EN">MALI&#x2019;S POLITICAL BACKGROUND Mali is one of the least developed countries in the world, ranked 176th out of 187 on the UN Human Development Index, with an average GDP per capita of $670. Located in the Sahel band, the territory is vast and landlocked (1.2 million km2) with little natural resources and a small domestic market. This challenging development context is exacerbated by an ongoing political and security crisis that affects the whole sub-region and most visibly since 2012. That year Mali encountered both an occupation of large parts of the country by rebel and jihadist forces, and a military coup d&#x2019;&#xE9;tat deposing two-term democratically elected president Tour&#xE9;. In 2013, after a military intervention led by France stopped the advance of jihadi forces, there was a formal restoration of constitutional rule with the election of new president Ibrahim Boubacar Ke&#xEF;ta (IBK) and a new national assembly. In addition a UN Multidimensional Stabilisation Mission (MINUSMA) was deployed in 2013 to maintain peace and provide security for the population. The comprehensive Peace Accord that was signed between different armed groups and the Malian government in June 2015 opens new perspectives to improve the governance situation in the northern regions and to build peace in a fragile social-economic and multi-ethnic context. However, the weak state of the political system, characterized by a few opposition parties and weak linkages to people, combined with ongoing weak state capacity to deliver basic services such as health, food security and education cause the general population to disengage from the political process. THE APPROACH OF NIMD IN MALI The NIMD programme in Mali started with exploratory visits and project through a local organisation in 2002/03. After several years of support and building relations and trust, NIMD facilitated the set-up of an independent political party dialogue platform in 2008: the Centre Malien pour le Dialogue Interpartis et la D&#xE9;mocratie (CMDID). Since then CMDID has been the main local partner and implementer of the NIMD programme, and the host of the interparty dialogue whereby all parliamentary parties are invited, plus representation of a large group of extra-parliamentary parties. Facilitate dialogue for political reforms The NIMD programme is focussed on supporting political reforms that improve the way political parties can operate and that ensures democratic elections and policy making can take place. Important issues have for instance been the need of one (rather than three) bodies that coordinate and organise the elections, the need for better rules around the rights of the opposition in parliament, and the need to update the political parties act. Strengthen links between parties and citizens In general the Malian parties are weakly organized and do not really represent the common interests of ordinary people. Moreover, also in policy making there is little formal role, as there is little opportunity to present changes to legislation as the presidential system ensures a powerful executive with a weak counterbalance from parliament. Our programme therefore works for better organized parties that better collaborate for policy change, and to link parties to citizens and civil society to better take up their issues and represent these on the national level. Build capacity for women and youth to participate Politics in Mali is dominated by older men, often the same men who were already politically active and involved at the start of the multiparty system back in 1992, and there is little room for women and youth to play a significant role. This is mainly due to conservative mindsets and cultural practices, as well as practical means; one needs resources to be active in politics. Therefore the NIMD programme has a clear focus on both building capacity (skills, knowledge) to empower women and youth, and on engaging with men to change these perceptions and practices.   Programme deviations/ToC update: At the end of 2016 the platform held elections for its steering committee, according to the principles as set out in the statutes there should be an equal representation of parties, however the smaller parties grouped together and ousted the two largest parties from the committee, these two parties subsequently withdrew their support for and participation in the platform. As this happened towards the end of the year it will primarily influence the programmes ability to perform in 2017</narrative>

      <narrative xml:lang="EN">All of the MPs interviewed said they did not see the political environment as conducive in terms of being able to produce laws, pointing to the following factors: - The power held by the executive branch versus that held by the legislative branch, with the former controlling what is on the agenda for parliamentary sessions as well as restricting parliamentary legislative initiatives. - The high rates of MP turnover after each legislative election, preventing the continuity needed to work on producing laws. - Problems tied in to the recruitment of parliamentary staff, which is based more on candidates&apos; political affiliations rather than their actual skillset, resulting in staff who are not qualified to support MPs in their legislative mandate. - Practical problems concerning MPs: outside of members of the parliamentary Leadership and committee Chairs, MPs do not have actual physical offices where they can perform legislative tasks, nor do they have support staff, with parliamentary assistants being solely assigned to standing committees. Regarding parties outside of parliament, recent experience shows they have often played the role of catalyst for reform without actually initiating things in this respect owing to the above-mentioned difficulties in terms of proposing laws.</narrative>

      <narrative xml:lang="EN">Currently there have been no draft laws submitted to vote which were the result of a harmonisation of the various points of views held by parliamentarian groups and in support of government actions and the opposition. Additionally, no formal dialogue structure between groups within the National Assembly is in place. As part of the CMDID platform two draft laws have been submitted for debate since 2015 between the majority and the opposition: the electoral law and political party charter. The political parties have duly considered the content of the laws and suggested modifications, with the draft law having been submitted to the National Assembly for due amendment and voting on. The CMDID Foundation and AWEPA have succeeded in implementing a monitoring committee made up of MPs and political leaders, whose mandate involves advocating for due consideration of the proposed changes to the platform by MPs.</narrative>

Contact in this regard occurs as part of their work as parliamentarians, with government members being present during Parliament plenary sessions and frequently summoned by standing committees. The actual frequency with which this happens is down to the parliamentary schedule, with contact on a daily basis occurring when Parliament is in session. Moreover, this contact happens as a result of MPs&apos; personal initiatives, who frequently meet with political actors from the government or from their own political parties. However, actors from political parties have noted that even though they regularly work alongside MPs, the latter do not always toe party line, with priority being given to their own personal interests.</narrative>

      <narrative xml:lang="EN">Level = medium Exchanges between MPs and civil society are frequent and occur mainly within the framework of the standing committees who invite CSOs to hearings for relevant legislation (e.g. the law on the creation of the National Observatory of Cities was subject to intense consultation between the Law Committee and civil society). Contact likewise also occurs via parliamentary thematic networks such as the Women Parliamentarians&apos; Network (REFEP), who frequently consult with CSOs on gender-related matters and activities. Lastly this contact also occurs at the personal initiative of MPs, who are requested by CSOs on a daily basis to advocate for causes against other parliamentarians. Nevertheless, the quality of these interactions is not optimal as they remain quite formal and restrictive (as they are only for specific legal texts). Outside of Parliament co-operation between political and civic actors is difficult and almost non-existent. Relationships are not institutionalised and mutual suspicion and manipulation is common. It should be noted nevertheless that the CMDID has involved civil society organisations in all of its activities starting from 2013 and takes into account civil actors&apos; contributions when considering political matters. This experience is behind the above statement that no sustained, organised co-operation is in place.</narrative>

      <narrative xml:lang="EN">The prospect of the Algiers Peace Agreements has provided a new mechanism for co-operation between political actors and civil society to have exchanges and suggest proposals to make improvements to regional policies. Political actors and civil society have been highly consulted with respect to changes to the Agreement. Some points of convergence between certain politicians and civil society have been noted, although the actors from the two sides have been engaged separately. Consultations have also taken place between certain parties and CSOs condemning the institutionalisation of interim authorities, although generally speaking these points of convergence have not been the subject of reconciliation. The explanation for all of this would be how fragile co-operation is in the first place as well as the need for each actor to discuss the matter for visibility&apos;s sake rather than actually proving to be an influential factor on decisions</narrative>
