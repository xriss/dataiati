   <narrative xml:lang="EN">BURUNDI&#x2019;S POLITICAL BACKGROUND Burundi has witnessed decades of violent civil conflict between ethnic groups. Despite the fact that a peace process has made democratic transition possible, strong political distrust and a lack of inclusive dialogue between different groups continue to pose significant challenges. THE APPROACH OF NIMD IN BURUNDI NIMD started to work in Burundi in 2008. The implementing partner organization in Burundi is &#x2018;The Burundi Leadership Training Programme (BLTP)&#x2019;. In the run up to the 2010 elections, NIMD and BLTP worked on getting the political parties to talk to each other and develop themselves as democratic parties. However, since the 2010 elections &#x2013; which many opposition parties boycotted &#x2013; Burundi has experienced several years of serious political deadlock, including a period when the different parties would not meet each other and several opposition leaders lived in exile. In 2013 and 2014, as part of a strategy for unlocking this political deadlock, NIMD and BLTP managed to engage the main 13 political parties in an 18-month capacity building project. This was a series of training sessions on how to develop a political party programme, including topics such as how to write a programme, how to develop policy positions and how to involve members in the provinces in such a process. These were multiparty training sessions so representatives of all the main 13 political parties attended the programme together. So at the same time as providing training on very useful technical information and skills, it was also a significant move towards building trust between the parties. In addition to the different multiparty trainings, NIMD also facilitated the process of parties holding internal party discussions, including consulting with their members in several provinces, and helped them to translate these discussions into policy positions on key issues. 2014 saw the last 6 months of this project and the start of a second project focusing on helping the parties to prepare for participating in the elections in 2015. This consisted of training sessions on topics such as how to select candidates, how to observe elections, how to work within the new electoral legislative framework and how to develop communication strategies for getting messages across to the electorate. These activities were executed both in the capital as well as in provinces esteemed to be potentially risky during elections. NIMD and BLTP also arranged for the independent electoral commission to participate in some of these sessions to enable them to exchange information with the political parties and to increase trust in the management of the electoral process. Democracy Schools Since 2011, NIMD and BLTP have also been running democracy schools in Burundi. The school programme started in two provinces and was aimed at training community leaders in democratic knowledge and skills. Currently, there are schools in 8 provinces. We constantly work on furthering developing the set up of the schools and the curriculum. For instance, the training modules now also address security problems because that is an important issue in Burundi at the moment. This means that the schools are now also open to policemen.   Programme deviations/ToC update: The political crisis that started in 2015, continued in 2016. The nature of political violence changed from popular protests and clashes between protesters and security forces to targeted assassinations of high profile politicians and security officials, extra judicial killings, kidnappings and disappearances. The ruling party has increasingly consolidated its monopoly on power and state institutions. Political space for opposition parties to operate in the country became extremely limited. The Ministry of Home Affairs, charged with the management of political parties, continued the practice of splitting up political parties, creating government controlled versions of opposition parties and denouncing the original. Opposition parties have either seen their leadership assassinated, forced to flee of the country, or unable to organize functionally operating party structures. The exiled leaders of key opposition parties continued to be organised CNARED, a opposition coordination mechanism through which they aim to be recognised and effectively participate in the internationally mediated dialogue process on the Burundi crisis. Due to its composition CNARED remained an unacceptable counterparty for the Burundian government, as they accuse key members of its leadership to have been involved in the attempted coup d&#x2019;etat of May 2015. The pluriform composition of CNARED also remained a source for internal frictions which further hampered its effectiveness as an opposition platform. 

There have been little indications that the consultations facilitated by former President of Tanzania Mkapa under the auspices of the East African Community have produced a dialogue that will resolve the crisis. In part, this was caused by the hostile position of the ruling party, but the weak and divided opposition also played a role and the absence of sufficient coherent political front of the Heads of State in the EAC region formed a further explanatory factor. The efforts of the UN to support this process and new resolutions of the UN Security Council have also been met with outright refusal and condemnation from the Government of Burundi. In the meantime the Government of Burundi has pushed forward its own internal Burundian consultation process led by the National Commission for Inter-Burundian Dialogue (CNDI). This has been seen as a way to produce pre-determined conclusions that will endorse the position of the ruling party and could pave the way for constitutional amendments that will remove presidential term limits, ethnic quota linked to the Arusha peace agreement and enable further reforms that will negatively impact on political space. While a constitutional revision has not yet taken place, several  laws were passed and CSOs were banned that has already significantly reduced the democratic and civil space. These processes are expected to continue in the following year. 

A solution or breakthrough from one of the (international) dialogue attempts has failed to take place. At the same time, Nkurunziza&#x2019;s position has not been substantially challenged by newly formed armed opposition groups, among other reasons because they did not have sufficient capacity to sustain an armed rebellion. 

Throughout the year, there have been speculations that internal divisions within the ruling party and security forces could lead to a challenge to the President&#x2019;s power from within, but given the failed coup attempt in 2015 it is difficult to assess if this was a realistic scenario at any point during 2016. The threat of rapid deterioration into widespread political and ethnic violence in this case, which could have been the trigger for an international peacekeeping intervention, has not fully vanished at any point of the year. The year 2016 as such, closed with almost as much uncertainty as it started. A continuation of the current political deadlock therefore also presents itself as a likely scenario for (the first part of) 2017.</narrative>

   <description>
    <narrative xml:lang="EN">In Burundi during the 2015 elections, around which the baseline was measured, the level of polarization between political actors is very high. The level of polarization was raised due to president Nkurunziza&#x2019;s announcement to make himself electable for a third term. This decision has been claimed to be both unconstitutional, as well as against the provisions of the Arusha Peace and Reconciliation Agreement. The current government, that took office in August 2015, is not recognized by the main opposition parties. Apart from that, opposition leaders have been persecuted and harassed, while unclaimed attacks on military bases have taken place outside of the capital Bujumbura. While various international mediation attempts have taken and are taking place, none of these seem to offer a solution to the current situation in the near future. Polarization therefore remains high, and scenarios of increased tension and violence cannot be ruled out.</narrative>

The selected political players, who are set in the list below, comprise 9 actors of the opposition 4 of the presidential group. This clarification is important as it helps explain why to be registered does not mean participate in elections. Actors of the opposition, who boycotted the elections, are tagged with (*). Only 4 political parties out of 16 took part in the elections. 9 political parties, coalitions and independent candidates had publicly announced they would not participate considering that the context was not conducive. Note: The chairman of the CENI claimed he never received the paper to officially announce the boycott of the opposition. Therefore he considered that the elections would be held as if all the lists were involved. Accusing him of being controlled by the government, the opposition questioned the legitimacy of the CENI.

   </title>
   <description>
    <narrative xml:lang="EN">In general, the difference between different parties&#x2019; organizational capacity is quite large. There is a stark difference between the governing party, which has a functional structure, and the opposition parties, that attempt to operate while facing persecution and sometimes exist only because of infighting in the parties they originated from. A characterization of the parties grouped by allegiance to either the government or the opposition is provided below, indicating the difference that the current landscape means: The ruling party (CNDD-FDD), is focused on consolidating its bases for the continuous mobilization of members around activities for security building and local development (local infrastructure, building party headquarters, etc.); Two parties which have been integrated into the institutions of the Republic (UPRONA, FNL Bigirimana) face a very uncertain future because despite their legal status and seats in parliament their political identity is questioned. These parties exist in their current form after a split has occurred and leaders of their parties still lead independent political groups (Agathon Rwasa for the FNL and Charles Niditije for UPRONA). It remains questionable to what extent these parties will be able to to reorganize and reconstruct their bases in anticipation of uncertain future elections. Nditije&#x2019;s and Rwasa&#x2019;s political group formed a joint list of independents and despite them formally boycotting the elections they won seats in the national assembly. Rwasa and its members decided to take their seats, despite their boycott. Rwasa became the 1st Vice President of the national assembly and several members of Rwasa&#x2019;s group have been appointed as ministers in Cabinet. Despite Rwasa&#x2019;s shown effective leadership control over much of the old FNL structures and popularity his group formally is not a political party and this therefore poses significant challenges for consolidation and sustaining his political organization. Still the choice of UPRONA, FNL and Group Rwasa to enter institutions opens up some space of freedom and action they are all trying to take advantage of to find, in their own way, their respective bases to revive them and even lay the foundation for expansion; For the opposition parties united against the third term of President Nkurunziza, which have boycotted the elections and did not win seats in the assembly the focus is on survival. They exist despite the risks and the security constraints exercised by the Government. The functioning of the bodies of these parties is affected by this constraint. The meetings still held have no agenda turned to reconstruction and redevelopment objectives. In light of this report, the actors of these parties residing in the country operate in semi-clandestine fashion. Their leaders are largely abroad in exile. A key group of leaders have formed an opposition alliance called CNARED. This alliance includes a group of former CNDD-FDD politicians who initially protested against Nkurunziza&#x2019;s third term (les frondeurs) and have since established their own political party (PPD). For obvious reasons this group has no legal status in the country. Another opposition party that initially participated in CNARED but since has decided to take an independent stance is UPD. This party&#x2019;s leadership also consist of a group of former CNDD-FDD politicians that were expelled from the party in an internal conflict in 2008.</narrative>

     <narrative xml:lang="EN">This data is the aggregated result of measurement of scores of all key political parties on three aspects of organizational strength: a. Existence and regular meetings of a national structure: 0,58 b. Electoral organization in different constituencies: 0,90 c. Political position on the dialogue process: 0,55 In the breakdown of these scores, it can be noted that while under aspect B parties scored higher in general, aspects A and C had lower scores. Especially under aspect A, a notable difference exists between the ruling party that has a functional structure, and key opposition parties that either operate in secrecy and therefore are significantly challenged in organizing regular party structure meetings, or where sometimes party life is almost non-existent. The indicator is operationalized by the percentage of parties with increased scores. Individual scores of parties, available in the table below need to be compared between measurements. In order to be able to identify developments for individual parties, individual party scores and aggregates are available below. As extra information, the total aggregated score of all parties can also be compared between measurements.</narrative>

The former president of Tanzania, Mkapa, has held two rounds of consultations in May and July 2016 and presented his progress report to the heads of state at the East African Community Summit in September. He stresses the large differences between the vision of the opposition and the ruling party, and the lack of willingness to participate in any meaningful dialogue. While the government has launched its own dialogue process, this is controlled by the ruling party and does not entail a shared agenda towards peace and stability. The EAC continues its support for Mkapa&#x2019;s attempt and pressure on the government. New rounds of talks are expected in October.</narrative>

As there is still no national agenda for peace and stability, NIMD and BLTP will monitor the evolution of the internationally facilitated dialogue to see whether any agenda may result. For the time being the baseline is therefore 0%. We will therefore ensure the monitoring of the move towards that agenda for the mid-term and final evaluation.</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">Recognition and approval ratings of political actors by citizens is on average quite low, just over 57%. However, political parties tend to be some of the least trusted and approved institutions. Looking at the data, a markable difference between approval and recognition (operationalized as trust in political actors) is visible between the government and the opposition party. While the government earns a high 72 percent, the opposition pulls down the average with 43 percent. In general, opposition parties are highly divided and weakly organized institutions. While the ruling party has acted oppressively over the last period, it is also in full control of the Burundian state. A qualification therefore can be that in the minds of citizens, the governing political party could be conflated with the institutions of the state.</narrative>

     <narrative xml:lang="EN">This score is based on a measurement of trust based on a series of questions, which can be answered on a 1 to 5 scale (further explained in the methodology section). For all questions, a score closer to 1 indicates higher levels of trust, while a score closer to 5 indicates low trust. This measurement was done through a MOIT (Measurement of Interparty Trust)-test with focal points of all key political parties during two trainings on non-violent communication and negotiation skills and interparty dialogue in the framework of the project with the United States State Department&#x2019;s Bureau of Conflict and Stabilization Operations. The test was conducted directly by BLTP&#x2019;s programme responsible. The MOIT is based on a questionnaire, with all 22 questions. These questions are tested, validated, items used to assess both trust and the drivers of trust, on a common 5-point scale. In designing this questionnaire, the items have been mixed up, and they have been adjusted to suit the context. After the questionnaire, the answers have been re-ordered, so that averages for trust and drivers of trust can be calculated. An overall average has been calculated, to see how all interviewees score on average when it comes to inter-party trust. This overall score can be compared at mid and end term measurements</narrative>
