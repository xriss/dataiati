   <narrative xml:lang="EN">1. Political update 2017
Since 2012 Mali has been facing a fragile political and security situation due to armed rebels and jihadi groups in the northern and central regions supporting various political agenda&#xB4;s from independence to illegal trafficking. In 2015 a peace agreement was signed which opened up an opportunity for a political settlement of the crisis. However, violent attacks continue to occur as the United Nations multidimensional Stabilization Mission in Mali (MINUSMA) attempts to contain the conflict. The inability of the authorities to control the fighting led to the dismissal of the Minister of Defense this year. 
In 2016 mixed patrols, whereby Tuareg rebels and the government work together to prevent Jihadi groups from gaining control of geographical areas, have been established. However their existence has been hampered by the fact that interim authorities are still yet to take office, even though legislative provisions have been made. Also this year a Disarmament, Demobilisation and Reintegration (DDR) process is slowly being initiated, but here the weak levels of trust among the stakeholders including towards the UN are slowing down the process. 
At the same time the government and political parties continue to struggle to fulfil their political roles, this was highlighted when four leading member of the majority party joined the opposition in September after accusing the government of bad governance and incompetence.
Also, local elections will be held on 20 November 2016 and this has raised questions concerning the areas in which the Malian government is not represented, not only logistically but also legitimacy of the chosen government thereafter will continue to be questioned. The elections also highlight displacement of the population in the north.
Notwithstanding these challenges the peace agreement remains the backbone for stabilization of the country because it contains important reform initiatives for a redefinition of political governance in Mali. A national conference will take place in late 2016 to enable stakeholders to form a unified view on specific reform issues. In 2017 a review of the constitution is also expected to take place. 
Mali also recently adopted a law providing for a 30% representation of women in the general and local assemblies recently. The upcoming local elections will serve as the first application of the new law, this is a first step towards gender equality, and access to decision making, as other legislation and cultural norms continue to subjugate women. 

2. Programme &amp; Theory of Change Update
The reform initiatives being undertaken for the peace accord offer important opportunities to ensure more inclusive participation in national processes. The challenges of inclusivity that Mali faces currently manifest themselves in the &apos;national accord conference&#xB4; and the constitutional review process, both of which are needed for effective implementation of the peace agreement, and both require ownership and acceptance by the broader population to be successful. However the government and the international community are struggling to implement these processes inclusively and this speaks directly to the work of our programme in Mali in 2017.
The objective of the NIMD 2017 program is to help ensure inclusive participation in these national processes to formulate clear and broadly supported policies. This includes the use of advocacy and communications to express the different views and interests of the population as well as explain the content of political documents to political stakeholders.
The theory of change remains valid as it focusses on creating democratic process for institutional and constitutional reform that guarantees inclusion so that the population recognizes itself in both the reforms and in the action of the political and ruling elite. Interventions will specifically focus on dialogue between the political parties and outreach to citizens to increase their participation in the above mentioned political processes. In addition special attention will be given to women and youth participation in these processes to ensure broad support for the outcomes.
Furthermore, to ensure a broader funding base and more sustainable future for the local partner CMDID, capacity strengthening activities will focus on their fundraising abilities. NIMD will work with CMDID to develop the technical and strategic capacities as well as network to obtain funding from a range of donors.
