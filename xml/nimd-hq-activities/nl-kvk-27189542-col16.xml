   <narrative xml:lang="EN">COLOMBIA&#x2019;S POLITICAL BACKGROUND In 2014, Colombia went through two electoral contests. In March, a new Parliament was elected (using the gender quota of 30% for the first time), and in July, after a second round, Juan Manuel Santos was re-elected as President. These events produced a polarized political landscape. On the one hand, new political parties (like the Democratic Centre, led by former President Uribe) refused negotiations with the FARC-EP (Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia). On the other hand, Santos achieved his second presidential term based on the campaign promise of reaching a final peace agreement with the FARC-EP before the end of 2018. At present, peace talks between the government and the FARC-EP are still going on in Havana. The &#x2018;basic agreements&#x2019; of these talks are public. One of the agenda points on which the two parties have already reached consensus is political participation. This means that political inclusivity will be an important aspect of the peace process. It is expected that the negotiations will come to a successful conclusion in the near future. Democratic institutions It has become clear in recent years that Colombia needs to reform its democratic institutions to make them more inclusive and political parties more representative and disciplined. This becomes even more urgent in the face of a possible peace agreement with the FARC-EP. Therefore, the national government presented a proposal for political reform in September 2014, including issues such as congressional closed lists, the elimination of presidential re-election, implementation of the &#x2018;zippered list&#x2019; and compulsory voting. However, the vast majority of these reforms were not adopted by Congress in 2015. Also, local elections will take place in 2015, during which more than 2,000 government officials such as mayors, governors, councilors and deputies will be elected. This situation poses a challenge to the political parties, both in terms of representation as well as candidate selection. THE APPROACH OF NIMD IN COLOMBIA In 2015, NIMD&#x2019;s activities in Colombia will focus on three programmes: The UNDP-NIMD-IDEA Respect for Women Political Rights programme (WPR Programme), the NIMD-Cordaid Programme for Democratic Dialogue for Environmental Security (PDDES), and a new initiative together with the Colombian government that focuses on the political participation of the youth. Through the WPR Programme NIMD will continue to support the women branches of all political parties in Colombia in order to strengthen their political skills and remove barriers to increase their participation. The PDDES programme brings together civil society actors and political parties around the democratization of environmental governance. The programme is implemented together with Cordaid and is being carried out in Colombia, Guatemala and El Salvador. The third project, which is jointly executed with the Ministry of Interior in Colombia, aims to develop a strategy that combines technical, administrative and financial efforts to stimulate the political participation of young people. In addition to these programmes NIMD also offers direct bilateral support to the political parties in areas such as the capacity building of think tanks, candidate selection and the improvement of communication with civil society. This is one of the reasons why NIMD has opened a local office in Colombia in 2014. STRENGTHENING WOMEN IN POLITICAL PARTIES IN COLOMBIA In Colombia, violence against women has increased considerably in recent years. According to the newspaper El Tiempo, every six hours a Colombian woman is abused due to the armed conflict in the country, and a daily average of 245 women are victims of some type of violence. While there has been very little documentation of the violence used to impede women&#x2019;s participation in politics in Colombia, violence against female leaders of social movements is common. Since 2011 UNDP, NIMD and International IDEA have worked with women and political parties in Colombia via the Democratic Strengthening programme. At the individual level, this work has included supporting the nomination of candidates, the promotion of women in legislative benches and commissions, and the creation of meeting spaces for elected women and social organizations. More than 1500 women took part in these activities. The political parties received technical support to assess and reform their internal rules and regulations.</narrative>

   </title>
   <description>
    <narrative xml:lang="EN">Colombia has a closed political system, with limited options for the emergence of political alternatives and an absence of regulations for the exercise of political opposition. However, due to the peace process there is a window of opportunity for political stakeholders to make changes in order to implement what was agreed upon under the &#x201C;political participation&#x201D; part of the accord. The legislative changes that need to be made constitute an important opportunity for NIMD to promote the aperture of the political system. The President submitted a constitutional reform act to Congress that establishes a simplified process to approve the legal reforms required to implement the Peace Agreement that has been signed with the FARC. In spite of the opportunity to make significant changes to Colombia&#x2019;s political system, a strong polarization has characterized the current political scenario. The Government coalition and a large part of civil society promote the ratification of the peace agreements, in contrast to the Centro Democratico political party that has several unresolved issues with the agreement. The data collected shows evidence of a good level of attendance during NIMD events, and political stakeholders mention the importance of the support of NIMD.</narrative>

   </title>
   <description>
    <narrative xml:lang="EN">Political parties in Colombia face high expectations regarding the implementation of the political participation part of the peace agreement, however, there is little awareness and knowledge on conflict resolution tools and other instruments to peacefully resolve conflict and process social demands. The information collected shows that political parties are still weak in the implementation of democratic values as evidenced in the limited existence of horizontal coordination mechanisms, communication channels with local levels as well as the lack of consultation with their members and supporters. Additionally, the training and knowledge sharing actions that could mitigate this weakness appear as the lowest valued category in the perception indicator. In contrast, the sense of trust and mutual understanding between political actors is perceived as relatively positive; an important attribute needed to contribute to the stability of the peace building process.</narrative>

      <narrative xml:lang="EN">In the focus group discussion, political parties were asked how they perceived the democratic values of their encounters with other parties. They ranked the existence of democratic values with an average percentage of 68 (derived from different questions about this topic). The collected data also showed willingness from the political parties to collaborate with new political parties/movements and to make alliances around common interests, as has been seen with coalitions made around the peace agreement plebiscite.</narrative>

      <narrative xml:lang="EN">A self-assessment survey was conducted among 9 political parties and contained 28 questions which addressed different subjects such as representivity, strategic planning, training, coordination, decision-making, communication and transparency. The collected data shows that parties assess themselves with an average of 81% out of a maximum of 100%. Particular weaknesses in political parties were identified in the strategic planning (61%) and training (76%) categories which produced the lowest results. It is worth noticing that almost all political parties have a positive perception regarding their accountability but this is rather a consequence of legal regulation, and not of the voluntary choice of the parties. In fact, most of them comply only with the minimums established by law.</narrative>

A few political parties annotated that they didn&#x2019;t have any initiatives for the strengthening of these spaces in the last year due the peace process agenda and budget constraints.</narrative>
