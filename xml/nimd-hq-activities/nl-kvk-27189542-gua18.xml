  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Guatemala is facing times of political turmoil. The president tried to expel the UN Commissioner against impunity and corruption. Both congress and government are doing everything possible not to be prosecuted for illicit party financing and other crimes. For the moment, they have impunity because of their functions. 

Civil society organizations, networks and youth platforms continue to raise the issue of impunity, corruption and the need for electoral and political party reform. The actions of government and congress did not lead to massive outrage in 2017. The question is, if a situation arises during 2018 where people massively are going to protest, like in 2015. 

Meanwhile, the judicial system can hardly cope with the workload. More and more investigations and trials are started. Recently the powerful politician Alvaro Arz&#xFA;, mayor of Guatemala City, was charged with illegal financing of his political party. If this means weakening the powerful network of conservative entrepreneurs and (former) military officials is yet to be seen. It is however clear, that with going after Arz&#xFA;, the prosecutor and CICIG are creating even more resistance towards their actions. 
  
The political issues high on the agenda for 2018 are (further) reform of the political party and electoral legislation, constitutional reform regarding the judicial sector and the election of the new prosecutor and state controller. Each of these issues will be a moment to measure the temperature of the country: are decisions taken in favour of impunity and self-enrichment, or in favour of transparency, justice and reform?



2. Problem Analysis &amp; Theory of Change Update (max 2 pages)
The problem analysis for the Northern Triangle of Central America continues to be valid. The three countries suffer from a lack of confidence in political actors. In NIMD&#x2019;s view, to overcome this crisis, important changes are necessary in the political party system to make it respond to the needs and demands of the population. Furthermore, the countries need more resources to address issues of poverty, education, healthcare, insecurity and employment. The objectives that NIMD formulated in the MAP continue to be valid:
1. Inclusive and representative political party system;
2. Political inclusion of underrepresented groups with a focus on women and youth, including youth- and gender mainstreaming in policy and legislation;
3. Better linkages between politics and regional, national and local level;
4. Enhanced capacity of political parties to deal with environmental issues with a focus on water;
5. Technical assistance and facilitation of dialogue on fiscal reform.

For NIMD an important angle for 2018 is to continue to support laws that ensure an equal level playing field in politics. This means supporting Congress and EMB in processes that reduce illicit campaign financing and political corruption and positive measures for inclusion of women and/or indigenous people. NIMD also continues to support the transparency commissions in congress and at departmental level.

Like in El Salvador and Honduras, NIMD Guatemala is advancing with objectives 1 and 2, while less human and financial resources are available for the other three objectives. NIMD will include in the training curricula the issues of environment/water, regional integration and fiscal issues to sensitize future generations politicians on those issues.
