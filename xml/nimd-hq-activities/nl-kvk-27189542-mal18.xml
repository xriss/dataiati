   <narrative xml:lang="EN">1. Political update 2018: Axis a- The Political System
A large majority of Malians saw the 2012 crisis as an opportunity for major change in governance. The citizen mobilization observed during the draft constitutional revision illustrates the frustration of a large majority of Malians with the failure to meet its political expectations. Immense challenges have put the Malian state to the test since. And keep the country in a state of fragility that makes observers question the prospects of consolidation of the democratic process. The resolution of &#x2018;the issue of the North&#x2019; and the return of peace and stability remains the main preoccupation for most Malians. The complexity of this situation creates doubt among many Malians. 

The upcoming general elections (mid 2018) will take place in a context of fragility and suspicion. That is, if we can go by the current accusations related to electoral register and the doubt over the integrity of the electoral authorities. The search for consensus on such issues is an important condition for peaceful and credible elections. Furthermore, the dissatisfaction of a large majority of the population creates a sense of openness of the electoral process. The political leaders consider that there is not clear favourite candidate. This situation leaves many candidates with a hope of winning the elections. Which in turn increases the possibilities for disputes and claims. In addition, mobilisation and voter participation will be an important issue in the upcoming electoral process. Traditionally, voter participation is poor. Ttoday&#x2019;s level of disappointment can aggravate that. It is therefore important to work on this dimension.

The government&apos;s willingness to organize local and regional elections is an important step inspiring confidence. On the other hand, recurrent territorial claims of the Tuareg populations have now created a sense of regionalist belonging throughout the country. This translates in growing demands of the populations of different cercles to turn their constituencies into regions, with the objective of acquiring a certain autonomy with regard to their administrations. 

Axis b- The actors
The political context remains dominated by three actors: parties, civil society organizations and religious movements. 

After the 2013 presidential and legislative elections, the partisan context showed a democratic dynamic, with the emergence of a majority movement and political opposition. A flexible political polarisation has persisted over the past four years, and has allowed a certain animation of the political life after the decade of consensus. It helped raise interest of the population politics. This dynamic needs reinforcing by promoting genuine debates on national public policy issues. This with a view to ensure that expectations of different national currents get a voice and get taken into consideration.

Moreover, social media brought new protesting dynamics. They offer an new outlet for the frustrations of the populations and occupy the political space, to the great displeasure of the parties. Young people, mostly non-militants of traditional partisan structures, took the centre stage. The evolution of religious movements on the political scene is also seen as a loss of credit in the political actors. However, religious leaders seemed to appreciate the challenges put up by the youth associations at their true value. These youth movements have warned religious leaders to refrain from venturing into the political field, at the risk of a systematic discredit. This situation must provide an opportunity to open discussions on the nature and the sphere of the religion and the political. This to assess the formers limits and evoke the principles and rules that govern the State. A reflective and self-critical relation on the basis of constitutional principles must exist between the two actors, in order to safeguard secularism and the Rule of Law enshrined in the 1992 Constitution.

Axis c- Political Culture
The political culture is characterized by the lack of appropriation of democratic principles and rules, both at the level of the actors and the population. Extreme poverty and low levels of education represent obstacles for citizens to take part in the political process. Moreover, political debate and balanced information is not always accessible. This because it takes place behind closed doors, for lack of means or linguistic reasons. Ever-increasing corruption and unfulfilled electoral promises have contributed to de-politicization and public disinterest in public affairs. This culture of resignation is reinforced by the fact that an important fringe of the political class is primarily in search of personal profit at the expense of meeting public expectations. Any change in this situation requires a fundamental work of education and citizen awareness. 


2. Problem Analysis &amp; Theory of Change Update (max 2 pages)

3. Programme outlook (max 4 pages)

a. Political system
Objective - An institutionally and politically conducive environment for political stakeholders

Results a.1 - An assessment of the current political system, with consensus on its conclusions
The rejection of the draft constitutional revision does not mean that a majority of the combined political class and civil society remains critical about our political system and inadequacies. There is agreement that Mali needs system reform. Several attempts at constitutional revision have however failed, for reasons of procedure or substance. CMDID wants to draw inspiration from these failures, and open the debates on the shortcomings of our political system in order to define the weaknesses and to propose relevant tracks of reforms in connection with the socio-political evolution of the country.

Interventions: A combined academic-political approach, in which CMDID sets-up an ad hoc think-tank, composed of political, institutional and civil society actors, and it will seek broad, national consensus on the conclusions.

Result a.2 &#x2013; Deepened understanding of the challenges of decentralisation to regional level, in relation with populations&#x2019; concerns
The strengthening of the mandates and responsibilities of the regional councillors bring about the need to take into account aspirations of the populations, not at the central but at the regional level. The concerns and aspirations need to find translation in the regional development programs. CMDID wants to play a role at this level, with a view to strengthening the relationship between elected officials and the public. 

Intervention: pilot project facilitating exchanges on the prospects of collaboration between populations and elective bodies, based on experiences from other countries.

Result a.3 - A political consensus on the conditions for the organization of elections
The repeated modification of the electoral law and the fragmentation of decision-making and management in the electoral process form grounds for suspicion and contesting at each election. The fragility of the political context increases the risks of a political breakdown.  This calls for stakeholders to dialogue on the shortcomings of the process (law and regulations, organizational structures, etc.) and agree on the mechanisms and organizational conditions of these elections. 

Intervention: the foundation offers its platform for political and institutional actors to agree on actions that can help to hold credible and peaceful elections.

b. Political actors
General objective - Actors are accountable and develop policies based on social expectations

Result b.1 &#x2013; Stronger capacity of political actors in electoral matters
CMDID initiates training modules based on the electoral law and trains party resource persons, with particular attention for vote tallying monitoring. Experience from parties in the region (Ghana) will help to craft systems to compile and tally the results at political party level. The aim of the exercise is to support efforts to limit chances of electoral fraud, and enhancing the case for solving electoral dispute in court (rather than through violent protest). 

Intervention: CMDID develops a training module &amp; trains party resource persons, combined with a short exchange mission to Ghana.

Result b.2 - Political actors contribute to the mobilization of voters through sustained and programmatic communication

The political space claimed by civil society and other actors through social media warrants that political parties rapidly catch-up in the use of digital tools. The use can primarily aim to better respond, and use them proactively as a support for their electoral offer. 

Intervention: CMDID initiates a training program on the use of social media, an on their integration in political parties&#x2019; global communication approach.

Result b.3 - Political parties commit to peaceful elections
The 2007 and 2013 Code of Conduct has proven useful in informing activists and voters and promoting a constructive attitude in the electoral process. The commitment contained in the Code of conduct is that parties opt for litigation rather than challenging elections on the streets, which is a good springboard to prevent electoral violence.

Intervention: With support of other international partners, CMDID develops an updated edition of the Code.

Result b.4 &#x2013; Amendment of the Political Party Charter, based on reforms prepared through the CMDID platform
Tightening the conditions for the creation of political parties and the capping of campaign expenses are among the measures proposed by the political class for the revision of the Charter. Moreover, the delicate question of CMDID access to public funding also requires an amendment. 

Intervention: CMDID works with the Government and the National Assembly so that the different proposals of the political class all well interpreted by these institutional actors and the parliamentarians take their considerations into account.

Result b.5 &#x2013; CMDID&#x2019;s financial and technical capacity improves
The sustainability of CMDID depends on the diversification of its funding sources and the adaptation of its status to the realities of the legal context. In this sense, CMDID is developing an organizational and institutional development plan that will serve as reference for initiating a reform of the foundation. The adoption of the Law on Foundations now frames the analysis of the structuring of the foundation and points towards pertinent measures of reform. Similarly, the search for the extension of the foundation&apos;s partnership base in order to increase funding opportunities remains a priority objective.

Intervention: CMDID goes through a process of internal reform, sustains its fundraising efforts, and evaluates the organisational development goals.


c. Political culture
General Objective - Promoting democratic principles and values

Result c.1 - Electorate mobilised and voter turnout increases compared to previous elections
CMDID plans to undertake a civic education programme on the roles and responsibilities of the various actors in the electoral process and the need for voter participation. This program aims to equip community leaders and party activists with understanding of institutions, the rights and duties of citizens towards the latter, and the process of electing representatives and office holders. CMDID plans to undertake this campaign with support from other international partner(s), office holders and opinion leaders, and uses local radio and local languages to pass its messages and reach its audiences. 

Intervention: civic education programme.

Result c.2. National election debates
In parallel, political parties take part in political debate in the national media, addressing both bottlenecks in the electoral process and items from their political programs. This allows political actors to share their analysis and, in particular, present their programs. The opportunity will also be used to call upon the public to ensure the electoral process is peaceful.

Intervention: national radio election debates.

Result c.3 &#x2013; Potential political leaders learn about democratic values and skills
The entrenchment of democratic values and principles has failed since the start of the democratic process in 1991. CMDID intends to set up a Democracy School to offer political actors and aspiring political leaders the opportunity to familiarise themselves with democratic ground rules and acquire skills for their participation in the democratic political process. This specific process will take place in ad hoc training sessions with participants selected in collaboration with political parties.

Intervention: creation of the Democracy School and an initial series of sessions.


d. Gender &amp; diversity
General Objective - Improvement of gender participation and representation

Result d.1. - Law No. 052 of 18 December 2015 establishing measures to promote gender in access to nominative and elective functions is known and applied
CMDID works with Gender Watch Commissions and representatives of Party Youth Networks in five regional capitals. They benefit from institutional support to continue the lobby towards political party leadership, electoral bodies and State representatives of the State in the regions. The lobby focusses this year on wide dissemination of the law aiming at understanding and application of its provisions during the next elections.

Intervention: lobby support to Gender Watch Commissions and Party Youth Networks in five regional capitals.

Result d.2. &#x2013; Women and youth participation and representation becomes a national issue
Gender and youth are considered as a cross-cutting theme in CMDID&#x2019;s approach. CMDID will dedicate radio debates, both at the regional and local level, to the issue. These debates allow zooming in on the bottlenecks. 

Intervention: technical advice and media support for Gender Watch Commissions and Party Youth Networks.</narrative>
