   <narrative xml:lang="EN">ZIMBABWE&#x2019;S POLITICAL BACKGROUND The contested 2008 presidential elections led to an upsurge in political violence and a five-year period of power-sharing between the main political parties. Since the 2013 elections, relations between the former liberation movement ZANU-PF and opposition parties have remained polarized. THE APPROACH OF NIMD IN ZIMBABWE The focus of NIMD&#x2019;s programme in Zimbabwe is to try to build trust and dialogue between the parliamentary parties. It also looks at the political participation of women and young people. NIMD works in Zimbabwe together with strategic partner, DIPD (Danish Institute for Parties and Democracy), and implementing partner, Zimbabwe Institute.    Programme deviations/ToC update: Zimbabwe&#x2019;s political, economic and social context continues to be fragile. On the economic front, the country continues to face a debilitating liquidity crunch resulting in the government being unable to pay civil servants on time; limited cash in the banks and the introduction of a new quasi currency called &#x201C;bond notes&quot;. The beginning of the year was characterised by citizens&#x2019; protests, emergent social media based movements and &#x201C;national shutdowns&#x201D;.  The response by the state was a violent clampdown, which has reduced the spirit of consensus and consultation, which had prevailed since the inclusive government period. Zanu PF remains riven by internal struggles, while the opposition parties continue to be fragmented.  The divisions in the political parties are mainly over leadership renewal processes.  These divisions make it difficult to build consensus on how to resolve the myriad of problems facing the country on all fronts. Even with elections on the horizon, substantive moves towards consensus have been limited. 

The programme had foreseen to implement several activities relating to the National Peace and Reconciliation Commission (NPRC). However, Parliament held initial public consultations on the National Peace and Reconciliation (NPRC) bill that resulted in the bill being withdrawn for re-consideration and re-drafting to ensure that all the clauses are aligned to the constitutional prescripts that provide for an independent NPRC. The bill is expected to be re-gazetted early in 2017 and taken through the public consultation process again. This means that these interventions were moved to 2017.

This fragile situation and ever changing context demands for flexibility in the programme. It is necessary to be able to implement if there is a political opening and to be able to adjust activities to suit the ever-changing context.</narrative>

These fluctuations indicate an organisation in transition and are in line with ZI&apos;s transition from a fairly large organisation under the JOMIC project, to a more modest one at present. The Ability to Adapt and Self-Renew, which at 2.9% is the lowest scoring - indicates that ZI is weakest in its internal capabilities. In particular, suggesting that ZI needs to put more focus on its communications policies in order to better establish its identity and mission in the public imagination. Moreover, it was noted that the organisation needs to develop an effective mechanism for internal learning - for staff advancement but also for documenting and learning from the lessons derived from its operations as an organisation. The financial health of the organisation was prioritized for improvement, with the indicator scoring 2. The Ability to Attract and Relate, at 3.8, was scored the highest. One of the biggest strengths of the organisation is the leadership (including the Board) of ZI, which was scored the highest under this capacity. ZI has also been successful in creating a vision and mission, and translating those into objectives and action. The &#x201C;spider web&#x201D; diagram below provides a more detailed picture of the overall scores on each of the key issues. The six highest (blue) and lowest (red) were highlighted in the diagram.</narrative>
