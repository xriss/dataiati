 There are many experts working on most if not all aspects of the Rio Conventions

 There are many analyses pertaining to the Rio Conventions but most all are focused on reporting requirements

 There are numerous stakeholder consultations but most all are either targeted to focal area or sustainable development objectives

 Regional and nonstate stakeholders participate in many governmentsponsored consultative dialogues but these are nearly all very targeted to focal area or sustainable development interventions

 Technical recommendations by the advisory commissions do not take into account similar technical recommendations by other advisory commissions</narrative>

 Technical working groups and workshops under Rio Conventions are not institutionalized by rather temporary organizational mechanisms under focal area projects

 There is no formal or institutional agreement on the sharing of information across ministries agencies or nonstate actors

 Numerous progress reports are prepared and submitted resulting in an overburdening of government staff and low commitment but these remain targeted to focal area priorities

 Expert meetings do not adequately address the crosscutting barriers to effective implementation of national environmental legislation

 Development partners in Costa Rica are committed to supporting the countrys improved access to better data and information on innovative approaches to meeting global environmental objectives</narrative>

      <narrative xml:lang="ES">33 Awarenessraising dialogues and workshops

 Media professionals generally have no special training of Rio Convention issues in particularly of the linkages between noncompliance of national environmental legislation and global environmental impacts

 The private sector is primarily focused on traditional approaches to maximizing profits seeing environmental issues as an added transaction cost that reduces profits

 Public dialogues take place through the construct of donorfunded projects on focal areas and do not adequately address the conflicting impacts on other environmental priorities

 Regional government representatives are not adequately familiar with approaches to meet Rio Convention  obligations given their heightened obligations to meet socioeconomic development priorities within their shortterm regional development plans

 The general public in Costa Rica is generally aware and concerned about global environmental issues but increasingly behaviour is detached from these values due to increasing socioeconomic pressures and in the absence of innovative approaches to comply with existing environmental legislation</narrative>
