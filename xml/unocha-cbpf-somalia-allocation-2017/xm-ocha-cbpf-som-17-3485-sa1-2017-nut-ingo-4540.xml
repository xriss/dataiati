   <narrative xml:lang="EN">INTERSOS in collaboration with other health and nutrition stakeholders, seeks to deliver integrated rapid response, providing preventive and curative nutrition services to drought affected population living in Jowhar district of Middle Shebelle. The intervention will target pregnant and lactating mothers together with children aged below 5 years among the host communities, IDPs and returnees.  Active case finding for malnourished cases will be done through mass screening of children aged below 5 years and pregnant and lactating mothers for rapid identification of malnourished cases.  Moderate acutely malnourished children and pregnant and lactating mothers will be referred for enrolment in the SFP programmes run by WOCCA in Jowhar district. The project will support a network of 4 Outpatient Therapeutic Programmes (OTP) (1 static and 3 mobile) sites fully equipped with OTP commodities including Ready To Use Therapeutic Foods (RUTF), essential medicines for treatment of endemic diseases, vaccines, trained OTP nurses, vaccinators and hygiene promoters. The trained OTP nurses will treat severe acutely malnourished children in the static and mobile OTPs according to treatment protocol.  Mass screening will be done by trained health workers deployed in the 3 mobile clinics and trained 48 CHWs   each assigned at least one village in the areas covered by the project. Immunization status of all children screened will be checked by both static and mobile OTP staff and children who are eligible for vaccination and do not have updated immunization status   will be immunized by the vaccinators and assistant vaccinators in the mobile OTPs. Severe acutely malnourished children with medical complications will be referred by the mobile clinics and the CHWs to the stabilization Centre in Jowhar for nutrition rehabilitation. Hygiene promoters will during the activities of the mobile clinics disseminate hygiene promotion messages to the communities to prevent outbreak and spread of communicable diseases like AWD/cholera and measles. During the same time, mothers will be counseled individually and in groups by trained health workers and Community Health Workers (CHWs) on appropriate maternal infant and young child feeding as part of efforts to prevent malnutrition. The project will also provide micronutrient support by distributing multiple micronutrients (MNPs) and Vitamin A supplements through the static and mobile clinics. Staff dedicated to the static and mobile OTPs will be subjected to proper trainings on infant and young child feeding, integrated management of acute malnutrition and nutrition, health and hygiene promotion. Efforts will also be made to link households with children with Severe Acute Malnutrition (SAM) conditions and suspected cholera cases to WASH interventions and food security/ livelihood programmes. Beneficiaries will be encouraged to preserve the environment by returning the packaging materials for RUTF back to the static and mobile OTP clinics for safe disposal. There will be regular coordination meetings at the field level between WASH, Health and Nutrition clusters to foster synergy, avoid duplication of efforts/ resources and share information on response efforts. INTERSOS will keep the nutrition cluster, Ministry of Health and UNOCHA regularly informed on progress of activities through sharing of progress reports and also share any challenges encountered for rapid assistance.</narrative>
