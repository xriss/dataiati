   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Emergency Response for Drought Affected Schools in Kismayu District</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">As severe drought continues to worsen across Somalia due to the failure of three consecutive rainy seasons, there is need to implement interventions aimed at retaining children currently in schools, to prevent dropouts. This proposed project therefore aims to preserve the gains made by the current ongoing intervention on &#x201C;Supporting Emergency Education in Kismayo (SEEK) Project&#x201D; by focusing on activities aimed at retaining children in eight (8) schools (3  under existing SHF and additional five (5) schools in Kismayo) who might otherwise drop out owing to the drought. This is aimed to be achieved through provision of supplementary school feeding and drinking water to the students, support to the community education committees (CECs) in water management and hygiene promotion to minimize the risk of  acute watery diarrhea (AWD/Cholera). This proposed intervention will be implemented in Daxiiska IDP camp, Marina camp, Buulo Abliko, Alanley, Via Afmadow, Olole, Towfiq Mosque and Suuqa Xolaha in Kismayo district, areas which are currently witnessing an influx of IDPs forced to move into the area due to conflict, forced eviction and because of the current drought. The influx of displaced populations into Kismayo (and particularly the Dalxiiska, Marina and Buulo camps) has placed pressure on limited basic education services and facilities (including learning spaces and teaching/learning materials, and other amenities required for suitable and conducive learning environment), and may lead to possible drop-outs, with a bulk of these unlikely to return to school after end of the drought. The proposed intervention is therefore focused towards providing immediate life-sustaining and integrated assistance for IDP girls and boys, as well as host communities at 8 schools drawn from the various target settlements (like Dalxiiska, Alanley, Via Afmadow, Olole, Towfiq Mosque and Suuqa Xolaha. During drought emergencies like is the case now in Kismayu, girls and boys have different vulnerabilities and capacities and therefore, different protection needs. ADRA also recognizes that education can be both empowering and protective for girls and boys, and this action will therefore be designed to be protective of all children affected by the drought situation at the camp. The intervention will adopt an integrated response model that will address protection concerns consisting of forced evictions, sexual and gender based violence and denial to assistance, which are commonplace in IDP settlements. Similarly, ADRA will also adopt a conflict sensitive approach in the supplementary feeding program, to avoid fueling tensions at the camp. Key activities to be implemented by the project include but are not limited to: a) provision of safe drinking water in schools, b) hygiene promotion in schools, c) rehabilitation/provision of water storage in schools, d) provision of emergency supplementary school feeding, and, e) support to Community Education Committees on school water management to ensure broader lifesaving impacts, among other key activities. The project will target a total of 3,057 learners (1314 girls 1,743 boys), and purposes to support a total of eight (8) schools within Daxiiska IDP camp, Alanley, Via Afmadow, Olole, Towfiq Mosque and Suuqa Xolaha. This intervention is planned to leverage and complement a larger 2 year UNICEF funded program that is being implemented by ADRA Somalia in the same camps, and will adopt an integrated approach that will focus on: drought, protection and life-saving interventions.</narrative>
