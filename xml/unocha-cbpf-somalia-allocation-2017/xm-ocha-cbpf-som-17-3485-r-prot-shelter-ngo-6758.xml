   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Gender Based Violence (GBV)  and child protection, provision of NFIs,  dignity kits and Solar lamps to new IDPs in Togdheer Region</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The recent massive drought in 2016/2017 has widely occurred in Togdheer region and its districts Burao, Odweyne and Buhoodle districts according to UNHCR Displacement Dashboard of July 2017  around 32,260  people displaced mostly pastoralists, agro-pastoral and rural-poor households that consistently moved to the urban and rural villages in search of protection and survival means. 
In this region, the drought calamity has exacerbated the protection and living condition and other humanitarian situation of the affected population specially the most vulnerable groups such as women, children, the elderly, disabled persons, female and child-headed households and minority families whose level of marginalization and vulnerability increased to high extent with reduced coping capacity and resilience.
The majority the displaced people fled to Buroa, Odweine and Buuhodle towns that during their displacement and within the IDP settlements in these areas faced life-threatening protection concerns and other serious forms of violence like rape, abuses, exploitation, psychosocial effects and attacks and child/forced marriage perpetrated by the host communities or within the IDPs themselves. With an increased vulnerability and marginalization, the coping capacity and resilience of the new displaced people drastically reduced and also lost their important possessions and basic household materials.
CCBRS has long experience in child protection, GBV prevention and response and distribution of NFIs to most vulnerable IDPs. CCBRS has also presence and ongoing projects in target project locations.  The proposed project therefore aims to address the child protection needs and GBV issues through reducing risks of child protection problems and GBV issues against vulnerable boys, girls, women and men, improving quality of response, provision of immediate medical screening and treatment,  ethical psychosocial counselling and other emotional support and free legal aid and advices for poor survivors to access equal justice and protection through home-based, outreach, effective referral and linkage system.
With this project, CCBRS has also planned to mobilize and empower various community segments, active social groups, the support structures and schools communities for protecting IDPs and other vulnerable persons of the host communities. Capacities, knowledge and awareness of the local authorities, IDP committees, and community based child protection mechanisms (CBPMs), service-providers and other social actors as protection activists, will be built and strengthened for identifying, monitoring and responding to child protection and GBV survivors.    
Additionally, the unaccompanied ad separated children mostly girls affected by multitude physical, sexual, social and psychological impact will be timely identified, documented, traced and reunified with their families /parents and other primary care-givers
To promote protection awareness among the targeted communities, the project will invest and utilize additional effective communication channels such as creation of child right clubs (CRCs), girls&#x2019; and boys&#x2019; forums, women to women educational forums and other networks to prevent, eradicate and respond key protection issues and concerns. Production of culturally and religiously sensitive information education communication (IEC) materials on existing protection problems and other rights violations is also one of the project core activities. 
It is also the project plan to support 2,300 newly drought-displaced households who are the poorest and most vulnerable families among the internal displaced communities in the target areas which made a total of 13,800 individuals with the emergency assistance of fundamental NFIs supplies to improve their living condition, 150  households are also given solar lamps material for their needs. Moreover, 150 vulnerable women and girls will be given dignity kits to improve their hygienic and living conditions</narrative>
