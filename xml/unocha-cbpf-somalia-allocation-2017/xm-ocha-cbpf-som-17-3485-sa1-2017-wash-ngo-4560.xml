   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Rapid WASH Interventions for Drought Affected Populations in Xaradheere, Badho, Abduwaq Districts, South Mudug Region and Galmudug Region</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The proposed project intends to support 4,889 drought-affected pastoralists households ( 29,274 pastoralist) in Xaradheere, Badho, Abduwaq Districts, South Mudug Region and Galmudug Region with life-saving WASH services in a maximum period of 6 months. This is a life-saving project that is line with the 2017 Humanitarian Response Plan Objectives 1 amp 4, and also the WASH Cluster&#x2019;s Strategic Specific Objectives 1,2amp3. Galmudug Region Districts are among the worst drought hit Districts where the latest FSNAU-FEWSNET release (February 2) with130,000 people being in crisis  (IPC 3) and 8,000 in IPC 4) with the Coastal Dheeh (Xaradhere) areas, Adado and Abduwak Districts being among some of the worst hit Districts. The deteriorating in drought situation is compounded by the presence of recent conflicts in some Districts and lack of or limited access in others, making the responses a challenge in many cases.  

According to an Inter-Agency Assessment conducted in December 2016 in Galmudug state estimates that over 250,000 rural people comprising mainly of nomadic pastoralists and agro-pastoralists are experiencing drought related stress in different ranges in parts of Galgaduud and Mudug regions. A few number of people, mostly children and pregnant/lactating women, have been reported to have succumbed to hunger, thirst or AWD/Cholera in far-flung settlements within Galmudug Districts especially Hobyo which neighbours Xaradheere District. A high number of households have lost their entire animals to the drought. 

Therefore, the proposed project plans to save lives and mitigate the effects of the drought by:

-	Providing  10,758,195 liters of treated water to 29,274 people facing water shortages in 18  locations/settlements through a water trucking program for a period of 7 consecutive weeks in the month of March 2017 and the first three weeks of April 2017.

-	Support 7 strategic Boreholes serving 3,480 people or 580 HHs and their animals with fuels subsidies totaling to 3,779 litres in 6 weeks. The water from these boreholes will be chlorinated. The proposed fuel subsidization program will increase the current water output of the 7 boreholes by an additional 338 Cubic liters of water with the aim of meeting the high demand of water.

-	Rehabilitate 3 strategic boreholes located in Korodhi settlement in Haradheere, Huuurshe and Miirjiicleey settlements in Abduwak District and Farjano Quester/Settlement in Adado District with the aim of increasing access to drought impacted pastoralist and urban populations. The 3 strategic boreholes were selected on the basis of its location as refuge areas for the drought displaced pastoralist from the 3 Districts and for water trucking.

-       Undertake operations and maintenance training for 21 Borehole Operators.

-       Provide hygiene promotion for all the 29,334 pastoralist targeted under the various activities (water trucking, fueld subsidy for 7 strategic boreholes) as well as women headed households targeted under the emergency WASH kits provision.

-	 Distributing Emergency WASH Supplies including hygiene kits to 2,690 drought displaced households to improve their hygiene and sanitation standards resulting in the prevention of AWD/Cholera. women and Women-headed households will be given priority in the provision of the emergency hygiene kits as they are impacted more by drought making them and the children highly vulnerable.

-        CPD plans to use the proposed project to complement its current Emergency WASH project Xaradheere District  (funded by UNICEF) and the rehabilitation of Seego Borehole (funded by Diakonie) to increase the number of beneficiaries supported with life-saving WASH services and reaching additional areas not previously reached.

-        CPD being the Coordinating Agency of the WASH Cluster in Galgaduud and South Mudug region, it will strive to continuously coordinate with other agencies responding to the drought.</narrative>
