  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project intends to provide access to an integrated package of emergency lifesaving services including food, health, nutrition, WASH and education to 25,000 IDPs and host community in Kaxda district along Afgoye road. 
Food Security: A large percentage of the target IDPs are originally farmers and pastoralists who have lost their assets as result of prolonged drought and conflicts. Non access to basic food for families is resulting quite high prevalence of acute malnutrition. The project intends to respond to the apparent lack of access to food security by providing food vouchers worth $70 dollars per month for three months to 700 households. The food vouchers project will be designed based on Somalia food security cluster guidelines. Among other criteria, new arrivals, caretakers of children less than five years and PLW women with severe acute malnutrition identified by health/nutrition unit of the project and households who enrolled their children to the schools.
Health/Nutrition: For the target population, access to basic health and nutrition services is limited, increasing morbidity and mortality from treatable conditions. Health challenges/needs are mostly profound among the most vulnerable groups, pregnant and lactating women and children less than five years. Global acute malnutrition among this population is over 20% whereas severe acute malnutrition prevalence stands at 6.6%. Additionally, children below five years of ages&#x2019; death rates are at 4.61% with morbidity as high as 45.7% recorded. In response to this, WARDI will sustain service delivery in one health Center located in Kalkal and set up one mobile outreach. Both facilities will provide integrated maternal, neonatal and child health and nutrition services. Key services to be availed will include immunization, management of childhood illnesses, detection and management/referral of severe acute malnutrition and provision of focused antenatal care and skilled delivery. Critical component to the intervention will be aggressive community education and sensitization on critically important issues of infant young child feeding, prevention and treatment of diarrhoea, hygiene promotion and health facility delivery. In total 25,000 persons will access high quality free of charge health and nutrition services. 
WASH: The project will increase access to sustainable safe water to reduce the risk of AWD/cholera and GBV against women and girls through the establishment of 12 communal water points to 11 IDP camps and 1 school supplying water through piping system, WARDI will sign agreement with the boreholes management to continue supplying the water to the IDPs by supporting maintenance and operation cost. WARDI will desludge 50 filled IDP latrines, construct 30 new IDP latrines and three gender sensitive twin IDP school latrines to the new constructed IDP school in Kalkal area (KM12). General cleanup will be conducted twice/month to 16 IDP camps. Comprehensive hygiene promotion awareness campaigns including distribution of 1000 HP kits will be conducted by 10 trained CHPs to reach more than 25,000 IDPs and host communities in Kaxda district. 
Education: The project will improve access to basic education to 160 children through establishment of one school composing four temporary classrooms in Kalkal area. 4 teachers and 1 head teacher will be employed and incentivised for a period of 9 months, provision of Learning/teaching materials. The children will have access to meals two times a day to attract more children to school through school feeding programme. In the WASH component, the programme will construct three gender sensitive twin latrines and 1 water kiosk through piping system, as well as hygiene promotion awareness campaigns to the children.</narrative>
