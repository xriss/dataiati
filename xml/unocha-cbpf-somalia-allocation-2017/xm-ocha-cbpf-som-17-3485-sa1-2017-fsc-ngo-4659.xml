   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Emergency Food Support for Vulnerable Communities in Bardera, Gedo region and strengthening responses to outbreaks of Acute Water Diarrhoea (AWD) / Cholera  in Kismayu Urban, Lower Jubba region.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The overall objective of the project is to provide immediate household access to food through unconditional emergency food vouchers and conditional cash vouchers to 858 HHs (5148 people - , 1802 men, 2059 women, and 515 boys 772 girls) in Bardera, Gedo Region. The targeted beneficiaries have been affected by the on-going drought due to failures of two consecutive rainy seasons.  As a result, there have almost been no cereal harvests for 2 seasons. An assessment by SADO indicated an increase of cereal prices by 75% in the local markets due to disruptions of the supply chain. The assessment noted the increase as follows: 1 Kg of Maize from $0.4 to $0.7 (+75%) 1 Kg Sorghum from $0.3 to $0.6 +100% and 1kg of cowpeas has increased $0.9 to $1.6 over the last 3 months). The price may further increase in the coming months. Similarly, pastoralists have also been severely affected by the impact of the drought. Increased movement of animals into the Juba regions highlights the lack of pasture and water facing livestock owners. Animal body conditions have deteriorated and resulting in decrease of the value of livestock in the local markets. The medium sized goat is now sold at $32 which is a drop of 60% from it&#x2019;s a value ($80) this time last year. Generally, the coping mechanisms being employed by families illustrate the severity of the situation.
In Kismaayu town, there has been severe outbreak of AWD cases and the objective of the WASH intervention in Kismaayu is to improve access to water, sanitation and hygiene services to 1200 people (3240 girls, 3120 women, 2880 boys and 2760 men) and prevent further spread of AWD / Cholera outbreak for most IDPs, returnees and vulnerable urban poor mostly in Shaqallaha, Gulwade, Alanley, Farjano and Fanole in Kismayu in Lower Juba.   
The proposed food security intervention has 3 components:
1) Unconditional food vouchers for 450 HHs &#x2013; this component targets the weak and most vulnerable families. These beneficiaries will receive unconditional monthly food vouchers at a value of USD 99.3 USD per month for 3 months. The vouchers value will allow families receive food items consisting of 50kg of rice, 8.5kg of beans, 6 litres of oil, 0.9kg of salt, and 4kg of sugar. 
2. Conditional food vouchers &#x2013; these will target the poor but able beneficiaries who can conduct labour work. A total of 408 beneficiaries will benefit from 30 days job opportunity. They will participate in rehabilitation of 4 WC. The CFW workers will excavate soil volume of 12,000m3 within a period of 30 days. Unskilled labourers will receive $150 while the skilled receive $300. They will redeem them at a designated money vendor.
3) Water Users&#x2019; Committee (WUC) will be formed for each of the catchments and their capacity in water management and maintenance will be improved.
 SADO&#x2019;s priority WASH  interventions for Kismaayu town will be oriented towards case tracing procedures and will include (a) Protection, dewatering/disinfection of water points as immediate response to contamination and retrain Water Users Committee (b)  Construction / desludging of more communal latrines (c) engaging qualified hygiene promoters and water quality monitors that can undertake the emergency response  in addition to hygiene promotion activities focusing on hand washing with soap at critical times, HH water safety amp latrine use (d) provision of hygiene kits &#x2013; soaps, water storage containers and household water treatment products (f) Private partnership to ensure IDPs have access to safe water through Caafi. SADO will also work with MOH and Kismayo district administration to enforce public health regulations for business premises under poor hygienic standards as will be  reported by AWD  case tracing team that will be established. SADO will put make efforts to orient its activities around the case tracing procedures as currently being implemented by the partners at Kismaayu level.</narrative>
