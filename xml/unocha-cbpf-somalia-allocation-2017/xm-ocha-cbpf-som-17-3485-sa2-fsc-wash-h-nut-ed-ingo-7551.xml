   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Integrated Multi-Sectoral Response in Alla Amin and Najah IDP settlements of North Galkacyo</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The integrated program will reduce morbidity and improve wellbeing through food security, nutrition, health, education and WASH interventions for IDPs in North Galkacyo of Mudug region in Puntland state of Somalia through basic service delivery at established key entry points including schools and mobile outreach clinics. Cash programming, in addition to other integrated multi-sectoral needs-based support, will form the core initiative to address the immediate dire needs of vulnerable households in Alla Amin and Najah IDP settlements in North Galkacyo.

- Key nutrition activities will include the screening and treatment of malnourished infants and children without complications. RI will refer complicated malnutrition cases to North Galkacyo Hospital for treatment and follow up. Screenings will occur during mobile outreach and at the community level. Community nutrition workers and volunteers will conduct nutrition awareness sessions and household visits. Health, nutrition and WASH volunteers will prioritize households where there are malnourished children for social and behavioral change communication (SBCC) messaging. 

- Key health activities will include the establishment of two mobile medical units linked to North Galkacyo Hospital to serve the IDP settlements of Najah, Alla Amin and other nearby IDP and host community populations in the catchment area. These settlements are greater than 5 km from the nearest health facility and would benefit from this expansion of coverage. The outreach services will improve access to essential lifesaving primary health services, including maternal, reproductive, neonatal, and child health care. Additionally, the health program will treat communicable diseases and improve surveillance and control mechanisms. Through community outreach activities, health promoters will raise awareness around common childhood diseases, maternal and reproductive health concerns. These health promotion activities will be linked with hygiene promotion and improved nutrition promotion activities which will specifically target households with malnourished children. 

- Key education activities will be the establishment of three temporary learning spaces to serve the out-of-school IDP population. Students will receive school kits that will include notebooks, pencils, bags and each learning space will be equipped blackboards, chalk, desks, chairs and other materials to facilitate educational activities. Incentives will be provided to encourage the recruitment and retention of qualified teachers. Latrines and handwashing stations will be constructed and water access secured for the temporary learning spaces. RI will also implement a school feeding program to encourage enrollment, retention, and learning outcomes for IDP students. 

- Key food security and livelihoods activities will include the transfer of unconditional, unrestricted cash to the most vulnerable IDP households as defined by a transparent vulnerability criteria and through consultation with communities. 

-Key WASH activities will include the targeted distribution of hygiene kits and increased access to water through water vouchers and water trucking to the temporary learning spaces. Hygiene promotion activities will complement the nutrition and health awareness raising activities in the community, during mobile outreach, and in schools. 

There will be clear synergy between the activities across the integrated response. Households with at least one malnourished child will be prioritized for household nutrition, health, and hygiene promotion activities. Cash programming and take home ration school feeding program will increase food security while the water vouchers will increase access to potable water all the while increasing household purchasing power.</narrative>
