   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Education in Emergency for drought affected IDPs/Returnees and vulnerable HC children in Baidoa and Diinsor districts.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">With an enrolment rate in Central South Somalia for primary school children being only 30% there is an urgent need to retain children in schools and to prevent school drop-out. Providing life-saving assistance through an existing community structure like the school, can allow children to have access to the most basic services and to fulfill their basic rights. According to the Inter-Agency drought assessment conducted in December 2016, Baidoa town is experiencing water shortages as the quantity of water from the boreholes is not sufficient to serve the population. Poor livestock conditions as well as deaths caused by lack of water, pasture and infestation of diseases has been reported. Limited access to education facilities have been reported school aged children are not able to attend school as some of them have migrated to far areas. Moreover, the education system is characterized by lack of functional schools, severely low enrollment of children, high dropout rate, lack of trained teachers, lack of teaching and learning materials. This situation has been severely worsening in the last months due to the drought crises and cholera outbreak. Many displaced families cannot afford to pay school fees in schools in Baidoa town and IDPs consider education to be the least priority because of the poor living conditions. Likewise, in Diinsor town only two public primary schools are currently open and the drop-out rate registered by the District Commissioner is close to 40%. The two primary schools in Diinsor are also severely understaffed. Moreover, the schools are not provided with any support by humanitarian organizations. INTERSOS started working in Diinsor in 2016 and it is still the only International Humanitarian actor in the area. With this Action INTERSOS proposes to respond to the drought crises by supporting 9 schools in North Baidoa IDP settlements and 2 schools in Diinsor as well as their students through school feeding program, provision of safe drinking water, hygiene promotion and trainings on water management for schools personnel. The activities in North Baidoa IDP settlements will be complementary to the education in emergency SHF funded project already implemented by INTERSOS in 9 schools in North Baidoa.
INTERSOS will respond with a multi sectoral intervention to ensure minimum wash and hygiene standards aiming at retaining children in schools. A rapid and life-saving response will be essential in the proposed Action in order to prevent a further deterioration of the situation.
The following are the names of the schools targeted by the project:
North Baidoa: Bakaraweyn, Warsan, Tabarak, Wajid 2, Alla amin, Mursal, Garasgoof, Duceysane, Sarmanweyn,
Diinsor: Waaberi Primary, Holwadag Primary</narrative>
