Nutrition sessions will include sessions on Infant and Young Child Feeding, hygiene and health promotion as well as food and nutrients education.

Generating community demand for improved maternal and child nutrition calls for a more integrated approach and building of capacities within communities to understand the nutrition services and ensure that women and children under five survive and remain healthy during pregnancy and through out the first five years of life amidst the presented climatic, political and geographical complexities. Creating awareness and demand in the communities will equip them with necessary knowledge to effectively participate in sustainable improvement of nutrition status among the Internally displaced hence the program will work with community health workers and community key leaders to establish well supportive and effective social environment within the community for the nutrition program. 

Technical nutrition team and the community health workers will be trained to build their capacity in management of acute malnutrition through a 5 day training on Integrated Management of  Acute Malnutrition for the technical team and a 3 day training for community health workers (CHWs) which will include training on identification and referral of malnourished children under five and screening skills, reporting, peer health education and conducting community meetings and sessions. 
mobilization sessions will be done through the community key influential people and the camp leaders to create awareness of the program and also to ensure program ownership and utilization. at least 10 key leaders per  settlement  shall be targeted for community program conception meetings and awareness.
