   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Increased access to quality emergency primary health services in  Eldere (Galgaduud) and Harardere (South Mudug) Districts</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The high burden of morbidity and mortality coupled with poor public health infrastructure, persistent perennial drought resulting food insecurity and inadequate humanitarian assistance are among the main contributing factors the humanitarian crisis Somalia. The country is still one of the countries with highest maternal mortality rates (MMR) in the world and is estimated at 723/100,000 live births with less than 50 % of the pregnant women having access to skilled birth attendants. Infant mortality (137 deaths/1,000 live births) is as well among the highest. The population remains at risk due to inadequate humanitarian support to the health sector and the on-going severe drought in most parts of the country which had led to frequent acute watery diarrhea (AWD)/Cholera outbreaks in almost all affected regions. Eldere and Harardere districts are situated in Galgaduud and South Mudug regions in Galmudug State, Central Somalia and the area is largely food insecure due to its dependence on erratic rainfall to produce crops and pasture. In the recent past, severe drought has continued to worsen across Somalia, due to the failure of three consecutive rainy seasons during 2015-2016, followed by a prolonged dry season Hagaa (July-September, 2016) and significantly below-average Deyr rainfall (October-December, 2016). Water sources have been drying up due to the prolonged dry spell and water scarcity has been a major problem. This has led to aggravated conflicts of water for livestock and human beings, and led to a surge in water related morbidity (AWD/Cholera) in the districts. The area has been chronically insecure due to on-going inter and intra-clan conflicts largely related to revenge and control of resources. Currently, the security risks in the region are linked to external and internal threats and influences associated with the political situation at the national level intertwined with the internal conflict. This has led to frequent population displacement and settlement of IDPs within the two districts.  
In Harardere, out of the total 17,090 children under 5yers screened in 2016, 24% were classified with acute malnutrition (MAM and SAM) while 10,696 children under 5 years were diagnosed with different morbidity including 1770 cases of AWD while in Eldere, out of the total 16,566 children under 5 years screened, 19% were classified with acute malnutrition (MAM and SAM) while 18,2017 children under 5 years were diagnosed with different morbidity including 910 cases of AWD. Cases of morbidities and acute malnutrition are expected to increase due to the increasing drought resulting in food insecurity, water scarcity and population displacements due to resource instigated insecurity.  
To avert this worsening health and nutrition situation, CISP will implement life-saving emergency primary health interventions including maternal, neonatal and child health through both static and mobile health clinics in drought affected areas scale up disease outbreak surveillance system for early cases detection and timely responses accelerate response to epidemics and communicable diseases outbreaks by conducting rapid assessments, joint field monitoring and supervision, regional and state health cluster coordination meetings enhance the capacity of health workers including regional rapid response teams for effective emergency responses and disseminate health information on the prevention and control of AWD/cholera outbreak. CISP will support service delivery in 4 MCH in Eldere (Eldere hospital, Wah-weyn health unit, Hul-aduur Village MCH and Osweyne Village MCH) and 3 MCH in Harardere (Harardere town MCH, Jowle MCH and Dabagalo MCH). Additionally, there will be two mobile clinics (Eldere-1 and Harardere-1) each with an auxiliary nurse and a Community health worker (CHW) who will conduct hygiene and sanitation promotion, health education, immunizations, screening, treatment of minor childhood illnesses and referral to the MCHs.</narrative>
