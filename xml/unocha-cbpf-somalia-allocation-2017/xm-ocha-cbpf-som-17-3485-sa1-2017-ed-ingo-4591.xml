   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Support to Quality integrated Basic Education for Drought affected children in Nugal Region of Puntland state, Somalia</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The persistent, scorching drought that ravaged most parts of Somalia, including Puntland affected almost all sectors of the society, and education is not an exception. The drought assessment report released by the Ministry of Education on 19th January 2017 indicates that almost 12,000 children dropped out of school as their families moved to other locations, in search of pasture and water for their stocks and livelihoods. The most critical needs include access to clean, safe drinking water, good hygiene and sanitation, and access to schooling among others. Children, especially girls, are forced to move a long distance with their parents in search of water and food for the family, leading to high rate of school drop out for the girls compared to the boys.
 Most of these children are displaced in new locations (schools) in Dongorey and Garowe districts of Nugal, without adequate learning materials, as their families are now forced to prioritize access to water and other lifesaving tools like education. This project will be prioritized, for education to ensure that the children do not lose out on their right of education, through providing safe drinking water, supplementary school feeding, scholastic and recreational materials, trainings as well as the incentives of their teachers since the parents can afford to pay the fees of their children.. The massive displacement of children in the new locations means additional pressure on the already overstretched facilities like, teaching materials and hygiene and sanitation facilities 
Safe drinking water will be trucked to all the targeted schools on weekly basis. This however will also depend on the water storage capacity at the schools for 6 months. The water will be supplied up to end of the project, covering also the holidays as children will still continue coming to school to compensate for the school period lost due to disruption caused by the drought. Some of the schools had been closed during school term, so teachers will and school administration would want to compensate for that loss during the holiday period. SCI will be providing 10 litres of drinking water per child per day(refer to Spheres Minimum standards for emergencies situation)
Under the school feeding programme, SCI will provide supplementary food items like Powdered milk, Dates cooking utiensils, and cooking demonstration training for mothers to all the targeted schools,  while World Food Programme (WFP) will be providing the grains like maize, pulses and vegetable cooking oil. The utensils will be provided once at the beginning of the project, while the food items will be supplied on monthly basis. The schools will store the food in their stores where they keep WFP provided food items.
  
In response to the above problems, the project will be implemented in the Districts of Dongarey and Garowe in Nugal region of Puntland. The project will directly target 3,500 children (50% girls) of different ages from  communities most affected by the effects of the drought (both host and displaced),  with the most needed, life- saving interventions like safe drinking water, hygiene and sanitation facilities and  . The project will be school-based, targeting 15 schools hosting children most affected by the drought, . Gender-sensitive, recreational facilities sanitary kits for mature girls will also be provided.  All this is aimed at ensuring that children, both boys and girls are retained at school, and are protected.
Save the Children will also provide incentives to some teachers in the targeted schools, especially to those who are not benefiting from incentives from the Ministry of Education or any other agency. With the massive influx of new children to their schools, it means additional responsibilities on the shoulders of these teachers, and the incentives will motivate them. The project will target 20 teachers to benefit from the incentives</narrative>
