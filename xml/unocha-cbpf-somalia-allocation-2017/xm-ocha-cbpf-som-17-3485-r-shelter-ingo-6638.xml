   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Objective is to protect the newly drought and conflict displaced IDPs through provision of combined emergency shelter and NFI kits. The project will set-up camp management committees and train their members in humanitarian principles and approaches for self-management by IDPs of the new camps in Galkaayo South district of South Mudug region and Adado amp Dhusamareeb districts of Galgadud region. 

Transfer modality of relief items shall be restricted but flexible vouchers redeemable with hardware shops under MoU with the project. A list of relief items from which the beneficiaries can choose shall be printed on the voucher. The beneficiaries are flexible to choose from these items up to the value of the voucher accordingly to their own priorities of needs. This practice is most gender responsive since women often prefer different items than men that suit better their special needs, e.g. for privacy. The flexibility also achieves a higher degree of ownership.

15 gender balanced camp management committees in new settlements within the larger IDP camps shall be established and their members been trained in camp management skills and approaches in humanitarian aid. Especially women that head households will be encouraged to represent their interests in the committees. They shall integrate informal leadership in the camps including elements that have usually conflicting interests with the potential of violence against individuals or groups. Social control within the committees shall contribute to the containment of oppressive elements. By integrating informal leaders into a camp committees, thus being faced with practical tasks of getting the camp organized, and the recognition of their work, many antagonistic factors shall be overcome. The committees shall cooperate with local authorities as far as they exist. Committee members will receive an initial five-day training and then &quot;on-the-job&quot; assistance and support from community mobilization workers. For their practical tasks they will receive a tool kit for improving drainage channels and cleaning the camps. Tasks include: enhance formalization of the spontaneous settlement, provide recognized leadership to the IDP communities, represent IDP communities towards local authorities and formal humanitarian actors, assist in selection of beneficiaries, reporting of evictions, settlement planning, maintaining camp cleanliness, negotiating with land lords and IDPs to demarcate public spaces, access roads and firebreaks, conflict prevention and mediation. 

DKH will implement this project through its local partner CPD who already partners with DKH in other projects in the area. Through funding from the ACT Alliance, DKH is implementing an integrated food security and WASH project through CPD with components of CTP unconditional cash transfers to IDPs, cash for work for host communities and water vouchers for humans and livestock for both IDPs and host communities in Adado district. With funding from IOM, CPD implements a WASH project in Adado and Dhusamareeb districts. Funded by SHF, CPD is running two projects in the targeted areas with a food security project providing conditional and unconditional cash transfers to drought affected populations in Harardhere and Hobyo districts while a WASH project is providing water to the affected people through water trucking, fuel subsidies to major boreholes and rehabilitation of main boreholes and supporting hygiene promotion activities in Adado, Abudwak and Harardhere districts. With funding from UNICEF, CPD is running a WASH project. CPD is also implementing an RSH project that is providing supply needs to partners and responded to AWD cases in Adado, Dhusamareeb, Galkayo South and Abudwak districts.

DKH, through the partner CPD, will collaborate with other interveners in the targeted project areas.</narrative>
