   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Provision of Emergency Integrated  Primary Health Care services to populations affected by drought and Acute Watery Disease in Bulo Burte and Jalalaqsi Districts of Hiran with special focus on maternal and child health services  by equipping and fully operationalizing two health facilities and one mobile outreach.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The two districts of Bulo burte and Jalalaqsi had  been under the control of various armed groups including alshabab for a long time until recently in 2014 when the joint efforts of the Somali armed forces and AMISOM had pushed these groups out of the main towns and nearby villages. The two districts have a joint population of 182,563 persons and these figures are estimated to rise to 214,741 persons in 2017(PESS,2014 Report).Prolonged draught, AWD outbreak, conflicts and constant displacement of populations has created a fragile humanitarian situation in the two districts. The situation is further complicated by a wave acute watery disease that hit the two districts hard leading to loss of live. Between 27th November 2016,when the first case of acute watery disease was reported in Bulo burte to date, a  combined morbidity of 234 persons were successfully treated in two Cholera treatment centers managed by WARDI located in Jalalaqsi hospital and Buloburte with a case fatality of 5 persons. The situation is currently under control but recurrence of AWD is expected in the coming month as water shortages owing to the prolonged drought continue to persist.
Response to the situation has been greatly hindered by absence of essential services including health, WASH and nutrition. 
In response to the situation, WARDI is proposing to upscale and optimize emergency lifesaving health services provision in the two districts by fully equipping and optimally operationalizing the outpatient department of Jalalaqsi hospital currently managed by WARDI and a health centre in Bulo burte town. The proposed health centre in Bulo burte will further be augmented by a mobile outreach that will attend to 12 accessible villages in the outskirts of Bulo burte town.
Once fully operational the proposed intervention is expected to provide integrated Primary health services to an estimated 60,000 people including 12,000 children under the age of five years,5,400 pregnant and Lactating women and 42,600 others. The two proposed health facilities are currently on the front line in responding to the AWD outbreak and will have the Cholera Treatment Centres (CTCs) attached to them fully equipped and staffed  to adequately respond to AWD/cholera cases.</narrative>
