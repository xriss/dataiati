  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The number of people in need of humanitarian assistance in Somalia has reached 6.2 million in late 2017, more than half of the population of Somalia. The severe drought which began in late 2015 and the ongoing conflict are contributing to an increase in displacement, leading to the number of IDPs now surpassing 2 million. Most displaced persons have found their way in urban centres, and in settlements that are largely informal and unplanned. Merging with urbanization, the displacement dynamics have increased pressure on services in most towns and cities.
According to UNHCR PRMN report, as of October 2017, the towns and regions that hosted the highest number newly displaced persons are Banadir- Mogadishu (286,000), followed by Bay- Baidoa (257,000), Lower Shabelle (176,000) and Mudug (122,000). The drought displaced IDPs in this locations continue to increase with an average of about 500 new persons arriving per week. Despite the assistance provided in response to the drought, there are still needs among the affected populations and huge gaps in service provision. Notably, the existing services are already overstretched. IDPs settlements are overcrowded with poor living conditions and limited security provision. The basic needs of the IDPs are not met due to inconsistent service provision, exclusion from accessing services, or from the sheer absence of services due to poor targeting. Protection Concerns have been reported in all settlements. The Protection Cluster&#x2019;s August 2017 GBV data indicates that 76% of GBV incidents were reported by IDPs, and from all the reported cases, 96% of GBV survivors are women. Forced child recruitment is on the rise, especially in areas under the control of non-state armed actors. Exploitative relationships between IDPs and land-owners or &#x2018;gatekeepers&#x2019; are recurrent, affecting IDPs&#x2019; access to assistance and information, and increasing vulnerability and risk of forced eviction.
The proposed project will contribute to addressing the gaps identified by improving access to Protection, NFI and CCCM services in an integrated approach in Baidoa, and Galkayo as this locations are receiving large influx of newly displaced persons. Jointly, the locations have more than 1.4 million IDPs of which 46% are newly displaced persons. 

At the initial stages of project implementation, DRC will call for planning meetings with different actors with the support of the CCCM cluster Coordinator. Rapid service mapping of actors will be conducted to understand who is doing what and where to inform intervene areas and avoid duplication.

The project is designed to protect the lives of 15732 people of which 3636 are men, 3717, women, 4067 boys and 4,586 girls by providing well-tailored integrated services in response to the gaps as identified by needs assessments conducted by humanitarian agencies including DRC.  Through the integrated approach, the project will increase access to coping mechanisms whilst trying to reduce threats and vulnerability to threats for the displaced persons. Different sectors will maximise assistance as they will be able to share critical information and inform immediate programming and re-design of programs. This multisectoral approach will be useful to create synergies enabling the concentration of services and expertise within the same location and same population leading to achieving a greater impact. This project will play an important role in filling the gap and assisting those in emergency situation in a timely manner therefore contributing to the Somalia HRP objectives of providing live saving assistance and Protection.</narrative>
