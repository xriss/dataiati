   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Providing Non-food items people displaced by drought in Middle Shabelle (Balcad) and Hiraan (Belet Wyene) regions.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project will involve the distribution of 1,800 NFI kits to 10,800 people displaced by severe drought in Middle Shabelle (Balcad district) and Hiraan Belet Weyne). The beneficiaries will be targeted based on vulnerability criteria that will prioritize women headed households, the elderly and children headed households especially girls.  The beneficiaries will be distributed equally across the regions with each region getting 900 NFI kits comprising of 2 blankets, 2 mats, 800 gms bar soap, 1 bucket, sanitary clothe and plastic sheeting

SYPD will closely coordinate with Norwegian Refugee Council(NRC) to avoid duplication. SYPD will start the project implementation with community consultations and coordination with government authorities to identify vulnerable people displaced by the drought. This will include consultations with local authorities, community elders and host communities to identify and register the most vulnerable people for NFIs support. 

The project implementation will involve the following activities:

1. Market analysis: SYPD will carry out a market survey/analysis to determine appropriate methodology and where markets are functioning effectively cash vouchers will be used to ensure that beneficiaries have the choice of what combination of NFIs they would wish to prioritize. The analysis will involve survey on supplies in the market and cost analysis to ensure that the cost of NFIs at the local market are affordable and guarantees value for money. 

2. Beneficiaries registration: SYPD will hold consultations with community members to jointly determine the targeting criteria, identify the most vulnerable and register beneficiaries for the NFIs and solar lamps. SYPD will prioritize vulnerable women, young girls and boys who bear the greatest suffering of displacement. SYPD will also target host communities to ensure that other vulnerable people within the target locations are also assisted based on needs and also avoid conflict between the host community and displaced people. SYPD will target about 100 host community households (600 people) from each targeted district. 

3. NFIs / Vouchers distribution: SYPD will distribute NFIs through cash vouchers to about 1,800 households (10,800 people) who include 3240 women, 2160 men, 2700 girls, 2700 boys. The age and gender disaggregation is based on the demographic profile in Somalia and prioritization of women and girls who are the most affected by displacements. The actual gender and age breakdown will be reported once beneficiary registration is completed. The cash vouchers with a value of $80 will afford an individual household  2 blankets, 2 mats, 800 gms bar soap, 1 bucket, sanitary clothe and plastic sheeting.

SYPD will promote the dignity of the beneficiaries by placing the decision of the content of priority NFIs in their best interests. The approach will empower displaced people in prioritizing needs and give them the power of making decisions for their needs. At a time when the purchasing power of households id being affected by the severe drought, NFIs provision through vouchers will not only help vulnerable household access to NFIs but will also reduce operational costs and directly benefit local markets, and revitalize or strengthen local economies, as well as benefit host communities. 

4. Post distribution monitoring: Each distribution will be followed with a post distribution monitoring to get feedback on the distribution process and utilization of the NFIs kits, one month after distribution.</narrative>
