   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Somalia has remained in conflict for over 25 years, which has, coupled with recurrent droughts, exposed the population to vulnerability and very weak.
The 2015/2016 and the recurrent 2016/2017 droughts in parts of South West and Northern parts of Somalia comes barely five years after the worst drought hit in Somalia in 2010-2011, internally displacing hundreds of thousands while others moved across the border to Kenya&#x2019;s Dadaab refugee camps and Ethiopia&#x2019;s Dolow Ado refugee camps. Many destitute pastoralists have moved to IDP camps around the regional administrative towns in search of humanitarian aid. This recurrence and severity of impact on the population and their livestock is a clear pointer to weakened copying mechanisms. The conflict continues particularly in the Southern Central parts of Somalia, and so is naturally induced environmental turbulences which are not about to end soon. 
BREC conducted needs analysis visits to the three districts of Buur Hakaba, Berdale amp Qansah-dhere with a dual aim of understanding the progress in the implementations of the educations projects in these districts while also seeing the existing gaps and verify access to vulnerable beneficiaries. 

Since the percentage of enrollment for school aged children in Bay region is estimated to be less than 25%, the dropout of students also increased because of drought which has also caused the mass exodus movements of poor people into urban and peri-urban towns to seek for better basic services and basic rights for education, health, hygiene and livelihoods. 

BREC wants to intervene through this programme and provide support through accessible community structures such as the schools and be able to help children get their basic rightfully their basic services in order to carry out the basic rights for the children in IDPs, Returnees and vulnerable groups. 

During the Inter-Agency drought assessments conducted in Dec2016 and Jan &#x2013; Feb2017 in Bay region districts, in Burhakaba, Qasahdhere and Berdale districts, water shortages were recorded as the highest. There was very minimal or no water available at the shallow wells and catchments, causing insufficiency to water to the local communities in these 3 districts. 

Livestock conditions and deaths because of lack of fodder and water and invasion of diseases were reported. Restricted access to schools were also reported school aged children are unable to go to schools while many of them had migrated with far places. Likewise, the education scheme is set apart lacking functional schools with severe affect of low enrollment for school age children, dropout rate increased, lack of trained teachers, lack of teaching and learning materials as well as lack of incentives. 

This situation of education were severely worsened and deteriorated in the last months due to the drought crises and cholera outbreak. Many displaced families who are unable to afford to pay school fees in schools in the 2 towns and IDPs deemed education to be the least priority because of the poor living conditions. 

To take action BREC proposes to react to the drought crises against education and related issues of program to support 13 schools in Burhakaba, Qasahdhere and Berdale and the students through: 

&#xF0FC;	school feeding program,
&#xF0FC;	 provision of safe drinking water
&#xF0FC;	provision education supplies to 13 schools in 3 different district in Bay region with 2500 School-age children 
&#xF0FC;	Sanitation and hygiene promotion and provision of hygiene kits 
&#xF0FC;	trainings on water management for schools staffs,
&#xF0FC;	training of teachers and CECs
