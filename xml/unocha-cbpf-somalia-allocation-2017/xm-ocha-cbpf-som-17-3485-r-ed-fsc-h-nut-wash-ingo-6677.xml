   <narrative xml:lang="EN">An elevated risk of famine persists in parts of Somalia due to severe water scarcity, food consumption gaps, high acute malnutrition and high disease burden.
According to FEWS NET publication in July 2017 April to June 2017 Gu rainfall started one to two weeks late in most parts of Somalia. Rainfall performance varied across the country, but was overall below average and erratically distributed. The majority of rainfall was received between late April and early May, making the season much shorter than normal. In central regions, rainfall started late and was consistently below average throughout the season in Galgaduud and northern Mudug. Rainfall totals were relatively higher in Hawd Pastoral livelihood zone of Abudwaq and Dhusamareb and Central (cowpea) Agropastoral livelihood zone of Elder, Elbur, and Harardhere. No rainfall was reported in June.
The project thus seeks to detect, treat and prevent morbidity and reduce mortality among drought affected, vulnerable populations with high burden of active Internally displaced persons/Cholera outbreaks and with no access to basic health , Nutrition and WASH services which are not integrated in the districts and integrate these services for efficient service delivery
The project will involve the provision of life-saving emergency primary health care, nutrition and WASH services including maternal and child health services through both static and mobile health clinics in drought affected areas, community sensitization and mobilization, The project will open 3 fixed health facilities in Elder that offer integrated health, nutrition, WASH, Education and Food security and 2 outreach which will also carry out integrated services while in Elbur the project proposes to open 1 fixed health facility with integrated health, Nutrition, WASH, Education and food security services and 2 outreach which will also render integrated Health, Nutrition and WASH services.
In nutrition screening and treatment of SAM cases for 16,358 children will be carried both at the health facilities as well as in the community, and 7361 pregnant and lactating given multiple micronutrients. In the community there will be trained CHWs who will be doing malnutrition screening at the community level. Training on integrated management of acute malnutrition will also be done to equip the health and nutrition staff with necessary skills and competency to diagnose and effectively manage malnourished child. 
For WASH activities will focus on distribution of hygiene kits to discharged patients from CTC if kits are made available to 6000 persons, Targeted approach and bucket disinfection at the water point instead of the blind/at large well disinfection to 6816 household members , WASH support at CTC level (provision of disinfected water, provision of adapted sanitation infrastructures and related hygiene promotion) and enhancing the capacity of health workers including regional/District rapid response teams for effective emergency responses, and dissemination of health information on the prevention and control of Internally displaced persons/cholera outbreak in the districts.
In heath the project will provide primary health care services to 35,170 people in both fixed and outreach strategy, carrying out treatment of minor ailments, routine immunizations and campaigns and training of health workers on treatment and management of AWD/cholera and measles case management since early detection and effective management of measles case reduces case fatality rates.
In food security the project will ensure families with children with severe acute Malnutrition (SAM) receive food vouchers to support the family basket after the child is discharged from the therapeutic programme, targeting 511 households (3066 people).
In education the project will ensure 230 school going children both boys and girls study in a clean learning environment and are screened for AWD/Cholera and Malnutrition</narrative>
