  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The proposed project intends to scale up emergency response in Baidoa by contributing to the reduction of morbidity and mortality for drought affected children and their families in Baidoa through the provision of emergency food, WASH, health, nutrition and education. The project will also build on the gains so far realised in the integrated education, food and WASH SHF grant to ensure that children have access to continuous learning in a safe environment as well as provide key basic services primarily food, water, health and nutritional support. WV will continue to support the 3 public schools to strengthen their capacity of so as to cater to the educational needs of newly arrived IDPs children as well as vulnerable children from host communities. Through construction of additional learning spaces, rehabilitation of classrooms, provision of teaching and learning material, the project will increase the capacity of the public schools to accommodate new enrollments with a special focus on IDP arrivals. In addition teachers will be supported through monthly incentives as well as trained on child centered teaching methodologies for emergency settings. CEC members will also be trained on overall school management with a focus on water and school feeding management of the target schools. 
While recognizing the barrier of accessing education also lies at the household (HH) level mainly due to wide spread food insecurity and depleting HH economic capacity, World Vision will continue to support school feeding for learners and conditional cash support in the school catchment area to motivate and enable parents to send their children to school as well meet other basic needs of children. Target HH from the most vulnerable HH will receive cash transfers to allow them access to basic services even though they are not able to work. 
To protect children from AWD/ Cholera and any other communicable diseases, the project will also improve access to sanitation facilities and hygiene by constructing additional latrines, provide sanitary towels for girls and carry out hygiene promotion for the growing school population. The proposed health and nutrition intervention include support establishing two school health dispensaries , hygiene and nutrition champions to manage common ailments among the school going children as well as routinely facilitate and coordinate monthly screening of the children to diagnose malnourished cases, refer and follow up appropriately, other cases will be strategically linked to the existing health and nutrition programs to ensure the affected children access the services within the school vicinity with minimal disruption of their learning schedules. Through extended home visits and linkage with CHWs the guardians will be supported through health promotion and outbreak awareness and reporting framework to avert possibilities of fatalities arising out the outbreak while also inculcating positive behaviour change within the family unit as well. 
The project will run for a period of 9 months targeting 16988 people (2706 men, 6192 women, 3289 boys and 4801 girls) in Baidoa.</narrative>
