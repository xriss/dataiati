   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Lower Juba indicated a critical nutrition situation with 12850 acutely malnourished children under 5. The current drought has worked negatively to worsen morbidity rates, infant and young child feeding practices,  and food and water prices All this amidst trade disruptions and reduced humanitarian assistance further worsening the nutrition situation. According to the FSNAU post Gu assessment food security situation in Dhobley was sustained as serious Currently this population struggles to meet food requirements and remain and are currently experiencing shocks that make made the situation to deteriorate further. They still highly vulnerable to more shocks  that could push them back to crisis situation or beyond if no support is provided (joint FSNAU FESNET). Dhobley IDPS,showed serious levels of both GAM(11%) and SAM (1.4%) in the Gu assessment, but this have further deteriorated because of the drought (wamo relief ans rehabilitation services (WRRS), 2017). Morbidity rate is also high with cases of measles and diarrhea diseases reported (WRRS 2017) CDR and U5DR which went up significantly due to diarrhea and measles outbreak, and low coverage of vitamin A vaccination/supplementation in the last season could worsen this season.Nutrition services need to be  scaled up in the area so that we avoid the impending disaster.
The project staff 27 (9 female and 18 men) will primarily target children 6-59 months with screening and Treatment of SAM cases, and pregnant and lactating women (PLW) with education, support and micro nutrient supplementation. The two groups will be identified through screening that will be done by both Community Based workers (CBWs) and project staff. Our  Community health workers (6 female and 2 men) will carry out routine screening , as part of their day to day activities, but will also be involved in mass screening which will be done Quarterly. Project staff will carry out screening every time they visit a treatment site. CBWs will also pass messages that relate to identification of symptoms of malnutrition, Nutrition health and hygiene promotion and use of available nutrition and health services in the community. 
The project is also expected to reach grand mothers, women of child bearing age, fathers and child caregivers , that might not have children with malnutrition. These will be reached through CBW , who will be IDP, living and working in the community, planned awareness campaigns and mass screening exercises.
The project just like the allocation strategy will focus on mitigating the effects of the ongoing drought in an integrated manner. The project intends to integrate treatment of malnutrition by treating Moderate acute malnutrition,Uncomplicated severe acute malnutrition, and complicated severe acute malnutrition all which have reported increased prevalence in the last few months in Dhobley of Afmadow district. These will integrate other health and WASH related integration like hygiene promotion, IYCF education and EPI.These interventions are life saving interventions because they focus on those at risk of death due to any additional shocks. The project will also target children under five , pregnant and lactating women as the most vulnerable and should be prioritized in emergency settings.</narrative>
