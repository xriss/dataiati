   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Integrated emergency response and Early recovery support to drought affected communities in Togdheer region, Somaliland</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The standing problems in the proposed areas include food insecurity, hygiene and sanitation problems and high death rates of animals. Outbreaks of Acute Watery Diarrhoea (AWD) have been reported in several parts too. Education interruption by this drought in particularly rural communities is very high as a large number of school have been closed as a result of this drought as recorded by the Regional Education Officers (REO) in Togdheer region. Several others are on the verge of closure if this trend is not controlled. This is attributed to the fact that many families have been forced to move to other areas in search for water and food.  The nutritional vulnerability is evident among the children under five and pregnant/lactating women. FSNAU analyses (issued 29th May 2017) predict that communities in Eastern Somaliland in particular will continue to rely on support by aid agencies for the upcoming months:
Hence, the proposed project&#x2019;s integrated and targeted intervention logic will chiefly put emphasis on addressing the critical needs of the affected households to help them recover from the effects of the drought but as well laying a basic foundation for fostering resilience and recovery. This is largely in line with the Humanitarian Response Plan strategy (HRP), strategic and cluster objectives that aim at ensuring that vulnerable and most affected communities have access to integrated lifesaving support.
The project will improve household immediate access to food through provision of unconditional transfer depending on the severity of food insecurity as per IPC classification, vulnerability and seasonality of the livelihoods. 180 households will be selected giving more priority to households with children screened for malnutrition and those discharged from CTCs. This will help to reduce malnutrition levels that are reported to be high in the communities. The project will support the rehabilitation of 4 berkerds, provide hygiene kits to 200 households, conduct hygiene and sanitation awareness campaigns in order to provide access to safe water, sanitation and hygiene for people in emergency. In order to ensure that emergency and crisis-affected children and youth have access to safe and protective learning environments that encourage retention and increased enrolment the project will conduct disease, malnutrition screening in the schools and offer treatment and other support to those that need it. Hygiene and sanitation awareness, and construction of hand washing facilities, formation of school hygiene clubs shall all be done to make schools a better place for learning and also encourage retention. 
Improved access to essential lifesaving health services (quality primary and secondary health care) for crisis-affected populations aimed at reducing avoidable morbidity and mortality is another cluster objective that will be achieved through this integrated approach. Mobile teams consisting of a midwife, nurses, community mobilizers/ volunteers and a supervisor identified from the main urban center will be put in place to conduct disease and malnutrition screening based on Mid-Upper Arm Circumference (MUAC) and edema for all children 6-59 months and other vulnerable people in the target sites. Those found to have medical complications will be treated on site by the mobile teams. MAM and SAM cases with complications will be referred to the stabilization center in Burao. Nutritious food (RUSF amp RUTF) and other supplements and IYCF IEC materials will be obtained from Unicef and or WFP. Communications in this regards have been started with Unicef. Pregnant and Lactating Women (PLW) and Care takers will be targeted with Infant and Young Child Feeding (IYCF) promotion and sensitization activities. The IERTs will also conduct immunization for children under 5 and PLW. The project will be implemented in 6 villages spread out in 2 districts of Odweine and Burao in Togdheer region. It will directly reach out to 22,664 beneficiaries</narrative>
