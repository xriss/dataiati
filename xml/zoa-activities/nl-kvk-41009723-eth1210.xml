   <narrative xml:lang="EN">While in Ethiopia the two targeted Woredas have limited presence of (I)NGO&#x2019;s, there are several local structures and institutions that the programme can and will tap into and to which the programme will offer capacity building support: &#x2022; Local Administrations at Regional, Zonal, Woreda and Kebele level: DPFSA, bureaus of Agriculture, Water, Health, Education &#x2022; Woreda Council &#x2022; Woreda Justice Bureau &#x2022; Woreda Women and Children Affairs Department &#x2022; Traditional elders and traditional structures for peace/settlement negotiations &#x2022; Youth and Women representatives &#x2022; Churches (more than 80% of population in the area belongs to a protestant denomination).</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project received initial approval by the ministry of Foreign Affairs on 28th June 2012 for a total amount of 64% of the proposed budget at the time of submission in March 2012. ZOA was then asked to submit a revised project plan by latest 15th September 2012. The Ministry decided on the revised plan on 16th November 2012, after which ZOA started further implementation of the project. ZOA found it best to not start the revised project immediately after submission in September 2012 so not to run the risk of beginning project work on a wrong footing, we considered the operational risks of starting the project without having received the donor&#x2019;s ultimate directions, too high. Therefore, we could only start full project preparations in second half of November and were left with six weeks in 2012 to this effect. The extent of project activity in 2012 has been limited; work has focused on project preparations mainly. (Actual operations took off in 2013.)</narrative>

This training was for staff from the Regional, Zonal and Woreda Justice Bureaus. Including the trainer and two ZOA staffs, 12 people participated. The training was decided to hold in Jimma, since the group was a mix of Nuer and Agnuak people. In Gambella the tension between the two groups was too high to put them together in one meeting hall. To prevent problems, the training was held outside Gambella. The evaluation showed that Government staff members have been closely involved in community cohesion activities. All staff members who attended one of the trainings reported back they learned what community cohesion means, how they can talk with others about community cohesion and conflict and resolve conflicts.</narrative>

The study is discussed in an interactive workshop with the CCLC members from Akobo and Wanthoa. The CCLC members train the other members in their committees. The CCLCs are now the ones that notice, discuss and report conflict. They solve conflicts together with the community and come together on regular basis (weekly or monthly). A handbook has been published that can be used as training material for the governmental Justice Bureau, to train their own staff and the CCLCs. 100% achieved.</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project received initial approval by the ministry of Foreign Affairs on 28th June 2012 for a total amount of 64% of the proposed budget at the time of submission in March 2012. ZOA was then asked to submit a revised project plan by latest 15th September 2012. The Ministry decided on the revised plan on 16th November 2012, after which ZOA started further implementation of the project. ZOA found it best to not start the revised project immediately after submission in September 2012 so not to run the risk of beginning project work on a wrong footing, we considered the operational risks of starting the project without having received the donor&#x2019;s ultimate directions, too high. Therefore, we could only start full project preparations in second half of November and were left with six weeks in 2012 to this effect. The extent of project activity in 2012 has been limited; work has focused on project preparations mainly. (Actual operations took off in 2013.) The necessary revision of the project plan for Ethiopia was governed by the strict 70--30 division on direct--indirect costs in humanitarian projects. This rule is a directive by the authorities for all NGOs that are active in the country. As a consequence, ZOA had to make cuts equally in the direct and indirect costs components. The project aims to support communities in very remote areas which are challenging to get to. With the 40% budget reduction, ZOA Ethiopia faced the challenge to meet all logistics needs. The 40% reduction had also directly affected the targeted number of beneficiaries. However, ZOA Ethiopia managed to attract other funding for this geographical area, through which these beneficiaries remained to be included in ZOA&#x2019;s humanitarian services aiming at human security improvement.</narrative>
