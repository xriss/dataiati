   <narrative xml:lang="EN">We are able! DR Congo</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">By 2025, through engagement with public authorities (formal and informal powerholders), men, women and youth with disabilities and other excluded groups, through resilient and capable local CSOs/DPOs in this fragile and conflict-affected country, are successfully influencing laws, policies, practices and norms for improved food security for all.</narrative>
  </description>
  <description type="3">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The We are able! program targets people (including women, men, and youth) with a disability, while, as spin-off, the program will also create opportunities for other excluded groups,3 such as vulnerable women, persons affected by leprosy, youth in general, excluded ethnic groups, internally displaced persons (IDPs) and refugees, as much as possible or necessary in the specific context. Intersectional traits often make people particularly vulnerable. Refugees with disabilities or disabled women and men of particular ethnic backgrounds often face the most severe forms of food insecurity. We are able! identifies and targets groups and individuals with particular vulnerabilities while creating synergies that allow others to benefit as well.</narrative>
  </description>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The activities in DR Congo are part of the We are able! program in DR Congo, Burundi, Ethiopia, South Sudan, Sudan and Uganda. Food security in these countries is low. People with disabilities (PWDs) are even more likely to live in food insecure households. We are able! wants to see PWDs improving their right to food and food security by creating an enabling environment for right-to-food action at grassroots level. While PWDs are the core target group of the We are able! program, we create benefits for other excluded groups like vulnerable women, youth in general, marginalised ethnic groups and internally displaced persons (IDPs), as applicable per context.</narrative>

      <narrative xml:lang="EN">1) AHADI: The organisation has lobbied at the level of the local authorities (chiefdom, administrator) to grant them a plot of land where they can establish their association. This has been granted. They have conducted training in groups of persons with and without disabilities to increase respect and social inclusion. 
2) AHID: Lobby for the release of illegally arrested persons with disabilities. The organisation pleaded with all relevant administrations and authorities and have started seeing results. 
3) AHID: The organisation has created visibility of persons with disabilities through various activities including regular appearances on local radio. Through their beekeeping project the organisation is known for its high quality honey produced by its members. This has led to recognition and respect resulting in local authorities participating in the yearly international day of the person living with a disability and the willingness of local authorities to assist persons with disabilities whenever needed. 
4) AHID: The organisation has managed to ensure that its members are invited to participate in meetings at the chiefdom level. Participation in these meetings creates space to influence discussions. 
5) FEUPAS Grand Lac: The organisation, in collaboration with local authorities, created fishponds to open up opportunities for persons with disabilities to generate income to increase their independence. The ponds have been established with the permission of Provincial and local authorities. 
6) AGSAMH Advocacy for the participation of persons with disabilities in security councils. It was established that from now on, a representative of persons with disabilities participates and speaks on behalf of persons with disabilities in the decision-making bodies. Before when authorities met they did not take into account the needs and interests of persons with disabilities but now persons with disabilities are represented. 
7) FOJEVI Bushovu Advocacy for the representation of persons with disabilities in local meetings. Persons with disabilities now receive invitations or have access to the announcements in order to represent themselves in the various decision-making bodies.  
8) APVH Facilitate access to agricultural inputs for person with disabilities. The organisation identified all persons in need of agricultural inputs and shared the list with the president of the CPR (Cooperative?). Inputs were distributed to all the identified persons on the list.</narrative>

      <narrative xml:lang="EN">1) Mungumwa Buholo: The organisation has promoted the employment of persons with disabilities within the public and private sector. The organisation had identified persons with disabilities within the community capable of working and wrote letters to all partners
7
and influential stakeholders. As a consequence the chiefdom&apos;s civil registrar is a person with a disability and the secretary of the group&apos;s office is also a person with a disability.
2) AVMC: The organisation lobbied for a change in mentality with regards to the treatment of persons with Albinism. Sacrificing and ritual murders of persons with Albinism still occurs in Congo. To decrease this practice the organisation brought together relevant actors in charge of security issues such as the Congolese National Police, the Armed Forces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the National Intelligence Agency, the chiefdom, local leaders and human rights organisations. The organisation had documented all the cases of insecurity and death threats against albinos in different villages. The organisation advocated for the abandonment of these bad practices and educated families of persons with albinism and persons with albinism to be vigilant, not to be alone in isolated places and not to walk around in the late hours.</narrative>

      <narrative xml:lang="EN">AGSAMH In collaboration with other organisations, AGSAMH has been able to block a policy imposing taxes on persons living with disabilities carrying out commercial activities at the chiefdom level. AGSAMH in collaboration with other organisations have managed to obtain tax exemptions for persons with disabilities running small-scale businesses. They have also managed to have authorities give out &#x2018;indulgence cards&#x2019; to persons with disabilities with small-scale businesses at the Territory level. This card helps prevent harassment by persons demanding tax. Before these cards were given out, persons with disabilities were regularly harassed, sometimes illegally arrested and their goods stolen. According to the organisation the harassment has seized.
FOJEVI Bushovo In collaboration with other organisations, FOJEVI has been able to block a policy imposing taxes on people living with disabilities carrying out commercial activities at the chiefdom level. (See information under AGSAMH for more details).
AVMC In collaboration with other organisations, AVMC has been able to block a policy imposing taxes on people living with disabilities (PVH) carrying out commercial activities at the chiefdom level. (See information under AGSAMH for more details).</narrative>

      <narrative xml:lang="EN">AGSAMH The organisation succeeded in enforcing compliance with the rights of parents of a baby with disabilities to register their baby at the Chieftaincy Civil Status Office. Before the organisation noted that persons with disabilities could not present their birth certificate and many even did not know about the existence of such certificates. The organisation raised awareness of the general public on the rights to register a baby with disabilities and at the level of the Civil Status Office to comply with the birth registration law. The other achievement of the organisation was making the birth certificates free of charge. Before a fee was charged for these birth certificates. This could also be counted under SCS011, but the WeAreAble consortium does not report under this indicator.</narrative>
