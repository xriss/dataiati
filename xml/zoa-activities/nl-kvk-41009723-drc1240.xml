   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In DR Congo, this Reconstruction programme will focus on the following outcomes:

Outcome 1. Increased mutual respect and inclusive informal and formal cooperation (including cross border cooperation) among families and communities in the Ruzizi Valley, which has been linked to accountable forms of local/regional in country and cross border governance.

Outcome 2. Inclusive improved food security and participation in cross border value chains, with strengthened local governance (including cross-border governance) and developed links with the overall development efforts of the (re-emerging) legitimate government structures, with specific attention for youth, demobilised combatants and marginalized women.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The proposed Promoting Human Security in Ruzizi Valley Programme foresees to work during the coming four years with some 16,800 smallholder families (102.000 persons), which is about one
third of the population of the Ruzizi Valley part of Cibitoke Province on the Burundi side and the opposite part of South Kivu Province of the DRC. Special attention is given to high risk groups of 900 youth and former combatants and 1080 marginalized women.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">ZOA proposes this Promoting Human Security in Ruzizi Valley Programme, to enhance stability and security in the border area between Burundi and the DRC as preconditions for people to rebuild their lives and livelihoods and contribute to structural poverty reduction. The programme will contribute to legitimate government, build local government capacity and will create a visible peace dividend.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project received initial approval by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on 28th June 2012 for a total amount of 60% of the proposed budget at the time of submission in March 2012. ZOA was then asked to submit a revised project plan by latest 15th September 2012. The Ministry notified ZOA of the approval of the revised plan on 16th November 2012, after which ZOA started implementation of the project. ZOA found it best to not start the revised project immediately after submission in September 2012 so not to run the risk of beginning project work on a wrong footing, we considered the operational risks of starting the project without having received the donor&#x2019;s ultimate directions, too high. Therefore, we could only start full project preparations in second half of November.</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">No progress yet on outcome/output level as in description due to a revision of the project plan in September 2012. The work in the project for which the costs were eligible, started from 1st July 2012. In July and August the original project plan was revised on request of the external donor, to accommodate the partial approval. The partial approval had the nature of a budget cut that was to be entered into the project plan by designing a revised plan at a lower cost, meanwhile not altering the character and heart of the project. As a result of the 40% budget cut, the number of beneficiary households was reduced by 40%, to a total of 16,800 households (8,400 in each of Burundi and DR Congo), representing approximately 75,600 people. The number of unemployed youth and demobilized ex-combatants on which the project will focus was reduced by 40% also, to the new number of 900; the number of marginalised women, in particular childmothers, divorced women and young widows, was reduced to 1080. The project will now target 450 youths and 540 marginalized women on each side of the border. The nature of our intervention was not changed.</narrative>
