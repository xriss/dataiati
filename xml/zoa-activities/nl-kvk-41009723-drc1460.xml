   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This intervention is directly an estimated population of 60.000 people, or 10,000 households, in 38 villages of 4 health areas, including the total population of the latter is to 77346 inhabitants, with a total of 12891 households. That is to say in our vision, we want to reach 75% of total households in these 4 health areas of the zone of health of Mutwanga.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Within the Great Lakes, ZOA will focus its programming on North Kivu, DRC (in particular the eastern part of Beni District, close to Uganda&#x2019;s border) and in Burundi on the northern part of Cibitoke province (close to borders with DRC and Rwanda).  ZOA and its partners will focus on a bottom up approach, facilitating and strengthening community processes to enhance protection mechanisms and promote human security including conflict prevention and resolution.

The four outcomes to which the ZOA interventions will contribute are closely linked to each other. Improved agricultural production should not only lead to improved access to food and income, it is also a prerequisite for an improved nutritional status for all household members, while improved community governance as well as improved mutual acceptance and collaboration will create the necessary stability and enabling environment for households to undertake individual and group actions towards improved food and livelihood security.</narrative>

Thus, directly the project assisted 9000 households for the outcome 1 (6989 agricultural households and 2011 households breeders); We can add the households that received the seeds and broodstocks of the reimbursed rotating credits, which are 1042 households in total (779 agricultural households and 263 households). If we add that to our 9000 beneficiaries we have a total of 10042; If we compare them to the 16098 total households we find 62% of households that have access to a minimum agricultural kit and improved seed.</narrative>
