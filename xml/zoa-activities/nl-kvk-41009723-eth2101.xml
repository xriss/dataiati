   <narrative xml:lang="EN">We are able! Ethiopia</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">By 2025, through engagement with public authorities (formal and informal powerholders), men, women and youth with disabilities and other excluded groups, through resilient and capable local CSOs/DPOs in this fragile and conflict-affected country, are successfully influencing laws, policies, practices and norms for improved food security for all.</narrative>
  </description>
  <description type="3">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The We are able! program targets people (including women, men, and youth) with a disability, while, as spin-off, the program will also create opportunities for other excluded groups,3 such as vulnerable women, persons affected by leprosy, youth in general, excluded ethnic groups, internally displaced persons (IDPs) and refugees, as much as possible or necessary in the specific context. Intersectional traits often make people particularly vulnerable. Refugees with disabilities or disabled women and men of particular ethnic backgrounds often face the most severe forms of food insecurity. We are able! identifies and targets groups and individuals with particular vulnerabilities while creating synergies that allow others to benefit as well.</narrative>
  </description>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The activities in Ethiopia are part of the We are able! program in 
DR Congo, Burundi, Ethiopia, South Sudan, Sudan and Uganda. Food security in these countries is low. People with disabilities (PWDs) are even more likely to live in food insecure households. We are able! wants to see PWDs improving their right to food and food security by creating an enabling environment for right-to-food action at grassroots level. While PWDs are the core target group of the We are able! program, we create benefits for other excluded groups like vulnerable women, youth in general, marginalised ethnic groups and internally displaced persons (IDPs), as applicable per context.</narrative>
