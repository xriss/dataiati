   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Result Area 1: Improved implementation of policies and regulations on GBV and protection of W/G including psychosocial support and self-care.

When W/G know their rights, have access to and use MHPSS and legal protection services, while in parallel formal/ traditional authorities will implement laws and policies against GBV as well as protect survivors after being informed on these topics, W/G will be less vulnerable to physical and emotional harm .

Result Area  2: Changed attitudes and beliefs of civil society to facilitate inclusion of W/G and promote gender equality.

Changing harmful norms and attitudes includes transforming violent masculinities by targeting influential powerholders (men/boys) as allies and positive role models, to jointly advocate with women and youth groups for GE, as well as for equal participation of W/Y groups.

Result Area  3: Increased and effective participation of W/Y in leadership and peacebuilding.

Increased, influential participation of W/Y in leadership and peacebuilding is possible when W/Y facilitate political positioning and influencing across ethnic/religious/conflict lines, together with male counterparts (as well linked to RA2).

The overall strategic objective of the Leaders of Peace programme is, that by the end of 2025, women and girls live in a more empowering and inclusive environment in South Sudan, where they feel safer and better enabled to realise their rights, so they can play an influential role towards conflict prevention and sustainable peace.

To achieve this, the alliance will enable civil society organisations with the capacity, resources and legitimacy to influence government, and societal actors in various areas. CSOs are supported and complemented in their advocacy activities by their counterparts and/or the Ministry. At the same time, the programme mobilizes key decision makers to work towards inclusive laws, policies and norms and practices. Through lobby and advocacy of our CSO stakeholders LoP will change duty bearers&#x2019; attitude towards gender equality and female participation in decision making and the peace process.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">South Sudan has been engaged in a peace process for years. It remains important to emphasize the role of women and youth in peacebuilding. The consortium consisting of Plan International, AMA (Assistance Mission for Africa), EVE, HealthNet TPO, and PAX implements the Leaders of Peace (LoP) Programme in Eastern, Western and Central Equatoria, Unity, and Lakes. Juba will be the central location to link advocacy work to national platforms and decision-makers. The LoP Alliance is led by Plan International Netherlands and is implemented in strategic partnership with the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs under the Strengthening Civil Society framework (Women Peace Security grant instrument) from January 2021 to December 2025.</narrative>
