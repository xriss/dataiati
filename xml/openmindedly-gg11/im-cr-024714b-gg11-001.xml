  <title>East Africa Drought Appeal</title>
  <description>A large scale drought devastated large parts of Ethiopia, Kenya, South Sudan and Somalia where funds were urgently required to provide emergency food, water, therapeutic feeding for malnourished children and medical treatment.  The Disasters Emergency Committee (DEC) co-ordinated an Appeal for all fourteen of its member agencies involved in the relief operation. The drought withered crops, killed cattle and led to massive increases in food prices. More than ten million people have been affected over large areas of Kenya, Somalia, Ethiopia and the rest of the region.  At its height the crisis saw more than 1,300 people a day &#x2013; the majority of them children &#x2013; arrive in the Dadaab refugee camp in eastern Kenya, near the border with Somalia.  With a population of over 350,000 people, Dadaab was already the world&#x201F;s largest refugee camp. Despite the enormous challenges of reaching those affected in Somalia in particular, DEC agencies and their partners helped hundreds of thousands of people.</description>
