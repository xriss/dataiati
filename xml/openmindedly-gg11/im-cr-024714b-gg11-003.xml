   <narrative xml:lang="EN">SIM Survival Yard Project, Mahagaga, Diapaga Region</narrative>
  </title>
  <description>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project will develop approximately 20 &quot;survival yards&quot; in the Diapaga region to enable selected, extended families (a total of up to 600 direct beneficiaries) to become self sufficient in running their own food-producing gardens, as well as providing them with other support facilities and services including latrines, improved stoves, mosquito nets, immunisation, child education and improved nutrition, hygiene and clean water.  Mahadaga is a small but growing market town with a population of around 400,000 people. It is situated in the eastern part of Burkina Faso, a country with limited natural resources and increasingly prone to drought. Reduced food production, poor sanitation and disease are rife due to the many limitations of the area. In order to enable and encourage rural development - and in particular to provide food security - the project will develop survival yards to enable carefully selected extended families to become self sufficient, as well as providing wider benefit to the local community.  Each yard will consist of a garden (measuring 25m2), a well and a system for pumping the water. The gardens will allow a wide variety of produce to be cultivated, with emphasis placed on improved soil fertility and water retention within the soil. The food produced will be harvested throughout the year with a portion of the garden specifically dedicated to the production of vegetables which will be sold at the local market. In addition, the wells will provide water to other community members and the new techniques employed will be shared with the wider community. The standard of living for each family unit will improve considerably and the survival rates of children will be greatly enhanced. At the same time the local communities will also benefit from the output and improved nutrition provided by the gardens&apos; produce.</narrative>
