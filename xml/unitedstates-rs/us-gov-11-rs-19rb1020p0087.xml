    <narrative xml:lang="EN">Serbia&apos;s integration into Euro-Atlantic institutions continues to be a key U.S.~foreign policy goal in the Western Balkans. Serbia has made considerable progress on its path towards European Union (EU) membership. It has taken steps to normalize relations with Kosovo, and the EU recently opened negotiations on the first chapters in Serbia&apos;s accession process (chapters 32 and 35 of the acquis communautaire, which relate to financial controls and the normalization of relations with Kosovo). Nonetheless, Serbia faces external pressure and continuing challenges as it seeks to establish the rule of law, strengthen the watchdog role of civil society and independent media, combat organized crime and corruption, strengthen human rights protections, and create conditions that support widespread economic growth.Targeted U.S.~support will focus on helping Serbia further integrate into the EU as it moves forward with negotiations and opens additional chapters in the accession process. Assistance will focus on strengthening democratic institutions and the rule of law; reducing corruption; increasing the capacity of civil society organizations (CSOs) and independent media; fostering broad-based, inclusive economic progress; enhancing export and border controls; and building good relationships with neighboring Balkan countries. As a whole, this support will help build Serbia&apos;s resilience in the face of external pressure from Russia. In addition to the funding requested in this section, Serbia will also benefit from funds requested through the Europe and Eurasia Regional operating unit, which include resources aimed at improving conditions needed for broad-based and sustainable economic growth throughout the region. U.S. assistance will build resilience and reduce vulnerability to Russian aggression, increase European integration, and provide continued support for enduring programs.</narrative>
