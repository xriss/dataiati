In fact Sector Budget Support of which the Intergovernmental Agreement signed in Amman on October 3rd, 2019, it includes among main areas of support, the establishment of a Community Technical College in Ajloun in order to contribute to the development of an advanced system of TVET that responds to the need for a qualified work force to drive growth and job creation in those sectors where Jordan can build and hold a sustainable position of competitive advantage over the medium to long term. The Community Technical College in Ajloun should constitute an advanced training center for technological innovation, beneficial to develop the necessary skills for the development of tourism and conservation of cultural heritage and landscapes in which Italy has an incomparable added value in terms of best practices, technical skills and advanced qualified competences and considering the fact that for Jordan travel and tourism have become one of the significant drivers of economic growth over the last years. Keeping this in mind, the rationale behind the Project is to contribute to the definition of a strategic plan for the development of responsible and sustainable tourism in Jordan and of the necessary needs in terms of human resources. Analyzing the current international competitive scenario and actual trends both at regional and international level, this strategic plan could have positive effects in enriching tourism in Jordan in order to increase the tourism sector&apos;s contribution to the economic, social and sustainable well-being of the country, acting on fundamental levers such as technological innovation and organizational, the ability to adapt to market transformations, the enhancement of the territorial and cultural heritage; the development of skills; favorable conditions for entrepreneurial activities. The definition of this strategic plan will allow the identification of new professional profiles and technical skills required in a wider perspective of human resources development and employment in the tourism sector by focusing on cultural heritage, cultural and creative industries, sustainable tourism and cultural infrastructure are sources of income generation and job creation, including at the community level, thus improving living conditions and fostering community-based economic growth.
