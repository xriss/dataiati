   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Drujba A.D. (Drujba) is the result of the merger in April 2003 of Stind A.D. (Stind; located in Sofia) and Drujba (which originally consisted solely of a plant at Plovdiv, in southern Bulgaria), both of which have been owned by Yioula Glassworks S.A (Yioula), Greece, since their privatizations in 1997 and in 1998, respectively. In 2002, the combined sales of Drujba were Euro 46.9 million ($ 49.8 million) and net earnings amounted to Euro 5.4 million ($ 5.7 million).  

After the merger, the companys share of the Bulgarian market is about 72%. The combined capacity at the two plants (after full commissioning of the new furnace in early 2004) will be approximately 264,000 tons per year.  The merger of Drujbas original Plovdiv and Stind operations aimed at more efficient production planning, better capacity utilizations, and more efficient use of management time. Although the sponsor had sought the merger several years ago it was delayed due to lengthy regulatory requirements of Bulgarias State Securities Commission and various other regulatory agencies.

The proposed project is to refurbish and modernize the operations of an existing Bulgarian glass manufacturer, Drujba.  The project involves an investment in a modern 120,000 tpy natural gas fired furnace and related production lines at the companys plant in Plovdiv.   Capacity at the companys Sofia operation will not increase.</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">The new furnace, the production lines and the related assets being constructed as part of the project are located at the companys plant in Plovdiv, Bulgaria, which is situated about 130 Km southeast of Sofia on an area of 170,000 square meters.  The plants buildings, warehouses and other facilities occupy about 70,000 square meters. Electricity is provided to the plant from the local grid, which is very reliable.  However, in the event that power from that source were to become unavailable, there is a power generator at the plant that can supply the necessary electricity. Water is provided by the city, and the plant also has access to its own water wells.  As for transportation, about 70% of the products are transported by trucks and the remainder by rail, and both the roads and the rail facilities are good.</narrative>
