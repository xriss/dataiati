   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Provision of shelter support to the most vulnerable returnee families in Kurram, FATA</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) has been home to 3.18 million people according to 1998 census, however, it is now estimated to be almost 7 million in 2016. Different Pakhtoon Tribes are living in FATA and this area has been facing a situation of unrest due to militancy, sectarianism, its geographical location and socio-economic challenges. Rise in the activities by militants and sectarian violence resulted into deteriorated peace not only in the area but also all over the country. Govt. launched a military operation in Kurram agency in 2009 initially. Military operations and sectarianism in the region subsequently affected the population and there was huge number of families displaced from the region to other areas of FATA and mainly in KPK. After the military operations in 2014, some areas of FATA have been announced as cleared areas by authorities. Proposed areas of Kurram agency are among the areas declared as &#x201C;cleared&#x201D; ones. Kurram is situated on the border of Afghanistan and has an area of 3,380 square kilometers and according to the recent estimates 500,000 is the population of Kurram Agency. 
According to inter cluster assessment report in Kurram an estimated 12,000 families from Alisherzai, zemussht and Masozai tribes from central Kurrram have stated returning to these areas from April 2016 after the de-notification. Due to the conflict in the area, 80% of the houses are damaged and people are in dire need of support in terms of food, shelter and livelihoods. Alisherzai tribe also faced a destruction of 80 to 100% of its housings and the current dwellings are too dangerous to live under.
Cesvi is aiming to provide shelter support through cash assistance to the most vulnerable returnee families in central Kurram which is one of the most priority needs and most important in terms of encouraging voluntary return and to restart the life in the area. Provision of shelter support through cash assistance is also in conformity with Pakistan humanitarian strategic plan and cluster&#x2019;s recommendations. The proposed project is built on the lessons learnt and achievements of previous PHPF-funded project successfully completed by Cesvi in March 2016 in Bara. Cesvi and its implementing partner will be providing shelter support through cash assistance to the most vulnerable families of Kurram, who are newly returned to their native areas. Extremely vulnerable families will be selected to receive shelter material and tool kits through cash support and trainings on construction practices through technical teams in the field. Community organizations will be formed to provide support to field staff in selection of the beneficiaries and to monitor the work of Cesvi and its partner in the field. Training to masons and the direct and indirect beneficiaries of the project will be provided prior to the construction of the shelters together with provision of IEC material in which through pictorial messages, it will be ensured that houses are being constructed safer and better than before.
To revive the life in the recently returned areas, it is also very necessary to help the local economy to boost and play its role in normalizing the lives of the natives. Therefore, Cesvi is proposing the cash assistance modality for the provision of shelter support. For the purpose, beneficiaries will be provided with PKR 60,000 in three tranches to supporting local economy. Planning for project procurements and activities are in accordance with humanitarian principles to ensure independence and value for money concept through supporting the local markets and getting optimal benefits from the efforts and resources being utilized.</narrative>
