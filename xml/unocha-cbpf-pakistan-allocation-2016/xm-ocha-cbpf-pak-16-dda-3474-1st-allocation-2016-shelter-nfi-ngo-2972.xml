  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Militancy and the resultant military operations in the conflict affected areas of FATA resulted in mass exodus of the families to the nearby settled areas and the TDP camps. Due to recent improvement in the security situation and completion of most of the military operations, returns to the de-notified areas are taking place gradually. With the change in situation the focus of the humanitarian community is also shifting towards the returnees with the main objective of sustainable returns and rehabilitation of the returnee families at their areas of return. 
The proposed project is the continuation of the efforts of the humanitarian community and the Govt. to assist the families at their areas of origin to provide sustainable solution to the returnee families. The project will complement the govt. efforts to resettle the families&#x2019; at their areas of origin through providing a long term permanent solution to their shelter needs. 
The project will target 310 of the most vulnerable families of Orakzai Agency at their areas of return with the provision of cash assistance for rehabilitating their houses according to their indigenous construction practices, with incorporation of the possible DRR measures. 
FRD has already been part of the phase one assistance at Orakzai agency with the UNHCR support and is still is on ground to assess the needs of the returnee families in terms of shelter and to provide emergency assistance to the eligible families as per the shelter cluster criteria of assistance in phase one. (The phase one intervention of Shelter cluster start simultaneously with the process of return, where the FRD teams accompany the returnees to their villages, assesses the condition of their shelters, and issue tokens for shelters and NFIs to those vulnerable families who have damaged houses and who need immediate assistance with the emergency shelter and NFIs). The proposed interventions will be the part of phase two interventions as per the shelter cluster strategy to enable the families to have suitable shelter solutions to their needs. Since the needs on ground are enormous therefore the interventions will target only the most vulnerable families with special priority to the women headed and child headed families. Over all the intervention will assist 310 most vulnerable families with priority to the women, child headed and the elderly headed families with no other support from any other source. 
Each beneficiary family will be provided with cash assistance of rupees 600 $ in three tranches. Each beneficiary family will utilize the assistance money for construction and FRD technical team will provide technical guidance and layouts to the beneficiary. Since preference in the identification is given to the female and the elderly therefore the field teams of FRD will also facilitate the arrangement of the skilled and unskilled labor from within the community with the facilitation of the community organizations formed as part of the community mobilization activities of the project. 
After the completion of the shelter each beneficiary will be provided 100 $ cash for the solar panel and other accessories to ensure lighting inside the shelters. The amount will be disbursed after verification of the completion of the shelter by the technical team of FRD.</narrative>
