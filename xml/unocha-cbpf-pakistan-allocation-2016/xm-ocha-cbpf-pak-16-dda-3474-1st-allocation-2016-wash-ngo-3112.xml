   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The proposed activities will be carried out in Mosazai tribe of Central Kurram Agency FATA. The returned communities including men, women, boys and girls with no access to WASH, Health, Education, Shelter, Nutrition and other basic services are facing severe problems after return back to their homes who either were residing in camps or host communities in different settle areas due partially to military operations and partially sectarian clashes in Kurram Agency FATA.  Most of the community infra-structures including, WASH, Health Facilities, Education Institutions, Roads etc are fully or partially damaged and need to be restored on urgent basis. On their return to their respective areas the returnees found that all the drinking water sources have been damaged or destroyed and they have scarce water sources for drinking, washing and cooking. The returned communities are using water from the damaged sources and or a few temporarily rehabilitated water sources but still have insufficient water to fulfill their daily needs of drinking, washing and cooking. The available water, whatsoever, is highly contaminated and contains various pollutants which is not fit for drinking.
About 80% of the diseases are caused by unsafe drinking water, inadequate sanitation and poor hygiene practices. The major diseases caused by unsafe drinking water are diarrhea, dysentery, cholera, typhoid, hepatitis (A,BampE), different types of intestinal worms etc.  Therefore, clean drinking water and safe sanitation services are considered to be the only way of reducing the chances of these diseases which cause to expend more than 40% of expenses of the total income of a household. 
The main objective of the project is to provide drinking water supply to return community, schools and health facilities as well as sanitation facilities for 4523 returned families including men, women, boys and girls these will include the returned communities, 08 education institutions and 02 health facilities in Masozai tribe of Central Kurram Agency FATA. The installation of tube for community and rehabilitation of WASH facilities in schools and health facilities are expected to provide them with sufficient amount of water as per SPHERE standards and increased accessibility to this very basic need. The intervention is also expected to reduce the vulnerability of women and girls that fetch water, to possible abuses. Similarly, the proximity and sufficient supply of water will also help reduce the queuing time and time taken to go to the source and come back home. The intervention will help provide sufficient clean drinking water to schools and health facilities to save the children from de-hydration as well as other water borne diseases.
The project will directly benefit 4523 HH (27138 individuals) in Kurram Agency including returned communities, school going children (boys amp girls) of 08 Schools and the 02 health facilities (staff and patients), situated in the target areas. The provision of clean drinking water and the safe sanitation education will help create healthy atmosphere within the community, school and health facilities.
The Hygiene education will help change the behavior of the target communities, students and health staff toward use of safe sanitation methods, This will also contribute to save environment from pollution which is also a cross cutting theme of AHO intervention in the area.</narrative>
