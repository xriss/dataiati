  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The main purpose of the proposed project is to provide a protective environment for returnee (girls, boys), women and their families from violence, abuse, neglect and exploitation through prevention and protective services in targeted return areas of Kurram Agency, FATA. . 
Pakistan Village Development Programme (PVDP) will  establish 12 Protective Learning and Community Emergency Services (PLaCES) for providing protective and social services to affected children (boys and girls) and women in recently de-notified return areas of  Kurram Agency. These PLaCES will be managed by 20 trained Facilitators (male and female). The services would include psychosocial support, social and recreational/sports activities, delivery of communication/information messages and related sessions, life skills based education, social services to vulnerable children and women through identification and referrals including monitoring, integration and community mobilization. PLaCES will promote protective environment for children (girls and boys) and women through structured, age- and gender-appropriate activities and services all in one location while adhering to the existing Minimum Standards for Protective Spaces for children and women, developed by Child Protection sub-Cluster. The project will also focus on children and women with disabilities and provide equal opportunities to them throughout the project implementation. Furthermore, women headed households and missing, separated and unaccompanied children will be identified and referred for services provisions. During the project implementation, psychosocial support and counselling services will be provided to children and women with psychological distress and hence reduce their distress and related concerns. 
The project will also deploy six (06) trained Child Protection Monitors (3 Male and 3 Female) who will be responsible for monitoring, reporting and referral of vulnerable cases to available service providers. These CP Monitors will support PLaCES Facilitators in times of reporting and managing the PLaCES activities. The Child Protection Monitors will further provide support to organize the local communities to form 24 community-based Child Protection Committees (12 men and 12 women) and 24 Adolescent Groups (12 girls and 12 boys) through community mobilization meetings, awareness raising sessions in the community. The community-based Child Protection Committees and Adolescent Groups will be engaged in monitoring, identifying and referral of vulnerable children and women, including missing, unaccompanied and separated children, and promoting their access to services through the community-based referral mechanism. 2 trained and skilled psychologists (1male, 1 female) will provide psychosocial support to girls, boys and women identified with psychosocial distress. Psychologists will provide psychosocial support through individual, groups and family counselling sessions inside and outside PLaCES. 1 Project coordinator will be hired and will implement the project activities and lead the whole child protection team in the field. Project coordinator will work in the field and will report to project manager who will be over all responsible for the project implementation and coordination with other stakeholders. Throughout the project implementation, PVDP will develop closed collaboration with other humanitarian organisations, FATA Disaster Management Authority (FDMA), local Government authorities and departments, Child Protection sub-Cluster, Protection and GBV sub-Cluster.</narrative>
