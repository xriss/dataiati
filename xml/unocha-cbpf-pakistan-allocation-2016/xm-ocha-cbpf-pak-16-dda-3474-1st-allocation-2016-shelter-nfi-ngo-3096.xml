   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The proposed intervention is based on the needs assessment finding for the provision of Shelter Repair cash assistance  to 310 families of Alisherzai of Kuram Agency in response to the displacement.
Kuram Agency is one of the Federally Administered Tribal Areas of Pakistan. It has a population of 448,310 and an area of 3,310 km2 (1,280 sq mi). Major tribes living in Kyram Agency are Turi, Bangash, Orakzai, Zazai (JAJI), Mangal, Ghilzai and Para Chamkani. Its sub divisions are Upper kuram Agency, Central Kuram Agency and Lower Kuram Agency. Like all other agencies kuram agency is also badly affected by the militants. The Pakistan army began operation in 2008 to clear the agency of militants and restore normal life in the area. This military operation in Kuram agency has forced hundreds of families to evacuate from the area and take shelter in TDP&#x2019;s camps. Along with the militants insurgency kuram agency is victimized by sectarian violence.
In March 2015, the Pakistan army declared the area clear from the militants. By end of March the IDPs started return to their hometown but major problem ahead was their shelter. As their homes, schools, health units, roads and bridges etc. are destroyed by the military operation. FRD intervened in the area and address the problem on temporary bases by providing tents to the families whose houses are not able to provide them shelter. But it is a temporary solution. Those families need permanent shelter which can save them from the harshness of weather and provide security to their females, children and belongings. The project will complement the govt. efforts to resettle the families&#x2019; at their areas of origin through providing a long term permanent solution to their shelter needs. 
The project will target 310 of the most vulnerable families of kuram Agency at their areas of return with the provision of cash assistance for rehabilitating their houses according to their indigenous construction practices, with incorporation of the possible DRR measures. 
FRD has already been part of the phase one assistance at kuram agency with the UNHCR support and is still is on ground to assess the needs of the returnee families in terms of shelter and to provide emergency assistance to the eligible families as per the shelter cluster criteria of assistance in phase one. (The phase one intervention of Shelter cluster start simultaneously with the process of return, where the FRD teams accompany the returnees to their villages, assesses the condition of their shelters, and issue tokens for shelters and NFIs to those vulnerable families who have damaged houses and who need immediate assistance with the emergency shelter and NFIs). The proposed interventions will be the part of phase two interventions as per the shelter cluster strategy to enable the families to have suitable shelter solutions to their needs. Since the needs on ground are enormous therefore the interventions will target only the most vulnerable families with special priority to the women headed and child headed families. Over all the intervention will assist 310 most vulnerable families with priority to the women, child headed and the elderly headed families with no other support from any other source. 
Each beneficiary family will be provided with cash assistance of Dollars 600/- in three tranches. Each beneficiary family will utilize the assistance money for construction and FRD technical team will provide technical guidance and layouts to the beneficiary. Since preference in the identification is given to the female and the elderly therefore the field teams of FRD will also facilitate the arrangement of the skilled and unskilled labor from within the community with the facilitation of the community organizations formed as part of the community mobilization activities of the project.
After the completion of the shelter each beneficiary will be provided 100 Dollars cash for the solar panel and other accessories to ensure lighting.</narrative>
