   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Provision of Shelter Cash Assistance to the extremely vulnerable returnee families of Orakzai Agency.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">SRSP vision of development is &#x2018;to reduce poverty and ensure sustainable means of livelihood in KP and FATA, whereas the mission is &#x2018;to build social capital by mobilizing communities for poverty reduction, improved livelihoods and sustainable development. On humanitarian part, SRSP is also involved in the relief, recovery and rehabilitation of the affected population. 
This project aims to restore lives of 300 extremely vulnerable families living in the return areas of Orakzai Agency in vulnerable situations affected by conflicts through the provision of a very basic need i.e Shelter.
In the return areas in Orakzai Agency, since 2015 more than 2500 registered families including men, women, girls and boys have returned to their area of origin. In 2016 alone approximately 1820 families comprising of 10428 individuals including 5522 male and 4906 female belonging to various tribes have returned whereas more returns are to be commenced in near future. The majority of the returnees are living in tehsil Upper Orakzai. According to the recent inter cluster mission conducted at Orakzai Agency, there has been a considerable amount of damage to the houses and other infrastructures.
Reference to this specific project, SRSP has a long history of dealing in various cash based interventions (conditional, un-conditional, vouchers, micro-credits) in many projects. The multi-sectoral nature of SRSP lends itself to the use of cash-based interventions as a cost-effective tool to address multiple needs, both during displacement and upon return. It will help to reduce the vulnerability of conflict affected communities in the targeted area of Orakzai Agency by addressing their housing needs through provision of Shelter cash assistance to the extremely vulnerable families. SRSP wishes to continue the Phase-II assistance through provision of $ 700/= as shelter cash assistance to 300 extremely vulnerable returnee families of Orakzai Agency, with priority given to those families whom have not been assisted during the Phase-1 assistance. Community will construct 1 room shelter by themselves using this conditional cash grant of $ 600/= and an additional $ 100/= for solar system upon completion of the 1 room physical structure. Mobilization for construction and technical assistance to the beneficiaries will be provided at every step by SRSP, which will result in improvement and restoring the old life style up to some extent through provision of adequate shelter. Phase-II assistance was based on provision of either the Roof Repair Kit or Shelter Cash Assistance to the vulnerable families identified after applying the beneficiary selection criteria to the assessment data recorded during phase-I assessment survey conducted.
During the course of this project, SRSP would utilize the information gathered during its Shelter amp NFI needs assessment at Orakzai Agency. All those vulnerable families who do not have a single dry room and were not a part of the phase-1 assistance will be prioritized as prime beneficiaries of this project with a specific focus given to female headed households, children and elderly, families with income less than 10,000 PKR, persons with disabilities etc. 
Activities under the project include:
1) Formation of new and strengthening of existing Village Reconstruction Committees (VRC).
2) Assessment of damages.
3) Short listing families based on vulnerability criteria.
4) On ground verification/ identification of the shortlisted families.
5) Signing MOU with the identified families.
6) Mobilizing community on construction.
7) Stage wise monitoring of construction work.
8) Release of Cash Tranches as per agreed modalities.
The proposed project has already been coordinated and approved by the shelter cluster.</narrative>
