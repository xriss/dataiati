   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Make Way - embracing intersectionality for health equity &amp; justice.

The Make Way programme (2021-2025) aims to ensure youth in all their diversity can fully realise their sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR). We promote an intersectional approach to addressing SRHR issues. This means making overlapping vulnerabilities visible to understand their effects on people&#x2019;s SRHR.

We develop innovative tools and build capacities of other civil society organisations to advocate the needed policy and societal changes.

Our partnership consists of Akina Mama wa Afrika, The Circle of Concerned African Women Theologians, Kenya, Forum for African Women Educationalists, Liliane Foundation, VSO Netherlands, and Wemos, and we work in partnership with the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

We implement Make Way in Ethiopia, Kenya, Rwanda, Uganda, Zambia, the Eastern and Southern African region and at the global level.</narrative>

      <narrative xml:lang="EN">Analysis of the EAC Bill included in the context analysis.

The EAC SRH Bill 2021 is an SRHR policy that seeks to ensure that all people can access SRHR. If this Bill is passed it will operationalize existing country level laws on SRHR. As an instrument of the EAC, provisions in the Bill cannot contradict provisions made in partner states&#x2019; constitutions. The Bill is very youth focused and makes most of its provisions for adolescents and young persons. Provisions include access to SRHR information and services for young people without parental consent, CSE, SRHR for adolescents with disabilities, provisions for consensual sexual acts between young people (this is mostly criminalized in partner states), provisions on safe termination of pregnancy and surrogacy (this would be the first law in East Africa to legislate on this).</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">There are very many contentious issues in the Bill and it has remained silent on SRHR for people on the periphery, e.g., sex workers, LGBT+ persons. Also, it only allows abortion in as far as the partner states&#x2019; constitutions allow it. etc. The language on &#x201C;rights&#x201D; was eliminated from the title of the Bill, although it remains within the body. Success would mean that provisions on respect and promotion of rights of people in all their diversity are maintained in the Bill. This issue is so contentious that participants took quite a bit of time pushing back on the provision on &#x201C;Non-discrimination&#x201D; and even use of the word &#x201C;promotion of rights&#x201D; within the bill, making sure that the language is so limiting that it does not include sexual minorities.

There are existing policies on the harmonisation and alignment of global health initiatives, i.e., the WHO&apos;s Global Action Plan for Healthy Lives and Well-being for All (GAP). The GFF&apos;s 2021-2025 Global Strategy also focuses on partner alignment behind country priorities and has established an Alignment Working Group which will pilot an alignment programme in ten countries. Th ACT-A initiative is another example of global health initiatives coming together.</narrative>

     <narrative xml:lang="EN">With &apos;Successful&apos; we mean: cases of advocacy where we saw changes in agenda-setting, strategy content, and meaningful civil society contributions

With &apos;Harmonised&apos; we mean: having global policies agree with each other and not create silos/fragmentation

With &apos;Aligned&apos; we mean: aligning with national policies in terms of funding and priorities

With Global Health Initiatives (GHIs), we mean: Global Fund, Gavi and the GFF

&#x200B;

The indicator is counted when the change has to do with either policy priorities, with funding, or with both.

This indicator is counted if at least one actor changes.

There are existing policies on the harmonisation and alignment of global health initiatives, i.e., the WHO&apos;s Global Action Plan for Healthy Lives and Well-being for All (GAP). The GFF&apos;s 2021-2025 Global Strategy also focuses on partner alignment behind country priorities and has established an Alignment Working Group which will pilot an alignment programme in ten countries. The ACT-A initiative is another example of global health initiatives coming together.</narrative>
