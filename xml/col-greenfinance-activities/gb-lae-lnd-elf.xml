   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The ESG Leaders Forum (ELF) is a practitioner-led initiative to further embed ESG integration into the Chinese investment community and transfer best practice from UK counterparts. 

Facilitated by joint leadership between CoL and BIFS, ELF will allow UK ESG practitioners to participate in targeted workstreams aimed at increasing uptake of ESG practices in China.

Given China&#x2019;s recent commitment to reach carbon neutrality by 2060, the Chinese investor community
needs to understand its role in working towards this goal.

ELF seeks to equip and support asset
owners and managers who are on the journey to align investment with net zero but have yet to make
explicit commitments.

ELF will consist of three independent workstreams for driving dialogue and change:

&#x2022; Stewardship framework pilot
&#x2022; Scaling ESG solutions across asset classes for institutional investors
&#x2022; Capacity building roadshows</narrative>
