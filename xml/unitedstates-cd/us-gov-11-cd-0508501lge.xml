    <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) is a strategic priority for the United States due to its size, location, and role in the Great Lakes region of Africa. Following prolonged periods of insecurity and political turmoil, recent efforts by the U.S. government, the Government of the DRC (GDRC), and the international community have placed the DRC on a positive trajectory. The most recent Demographic and Health Survey showed general improvements in a range of social indicators, and there has been progress with respect to security in the volatile east of the country. The country, however, remains fragile. In this context, U.S. assistance seeks to consolidate recent gains by improving the capacity and governance of core national-level institutions, creating economic opportunities for all segments of the population, and addressing the root causes of the crisis in eastern DRC. These investments will ultimately improve the lives of the Congolese people through better delivery of basic services such as health and education, increasing stability and security throughout the country, and strengthening the business enabling environment.</narrative>
