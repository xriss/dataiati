   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This award strives to conserve biodiversity and manage natural resources in ways that maintain their long-term viability and preserve their potential to meet the needs of present and future generations. Activities include combating illegal and corrupt exploitation of natural resources and the control of invasive species. This includes &#x201C;Modeling Disease Risk in Threatened Amphibians in the Albertine Rift in Democratic Republic of Congo.&#x201D; In partnership with the Wildlife Conservation Society, this project will support a conservation effort for the Itombwe massif clawed frog, Luvubu reed frog, white-striped reed frog, Itombwe screeching frog, Mwana screeching frog, Mukuzira long-fingered frog, Itombwe golden frog, parkers tree toad, Mokanga forest tree frog, and the Itombwe river frog in Democratic Republic of Congo, by seeking to create a predictive model of Bd distribution for the entire Albertine Rift area. Specific activities include: (1) identification of areas with the highest biosecurity risk in the Albertine Rift; (2) creation of a predictive map that can be used for identifying chytrid-free zones; (3) build an improved understanding of batrachochytrium dendrobatidis distribution and identification of species at greatest risk for developing the disease chytridiomycosis; (4) present findings at the 2014 African Amphibian Working Group meeting and will sharing information with governmental stakeholders, conservationists, and herpetologists working across Africa along with the IUCN Amphibian Specialist Group..</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) is a strategic priority for the United States due to its size, location, and role in the Great Lakes region of Africa. Following prolonged periods of insecurity and political turmoil, recent efforts by the U.S. government, the Government of the DRC (GDRC), and the international community have placed the DRC on a positive trajectory. The most recent Demographic and Health Survey showed general improvements in a range of social indicators, and there has been progress with respect to security in the volatile east of the country. The country, however, remains fragile. In this context, U.S. assistance seeks to consolidate recent gains by improving the capacity and governance of core national-level institutions, creating economic opportunities for all segments of the population, and addressing the root causes of the crisis in eastern DRC. These investments will ultimately improve the lives of the Congolese people through better delivery of basic services such as health and education, increasing stability and security throughout the country, and strengthening the business enabling environment.</narrative>
