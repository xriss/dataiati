   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Supporting quality education, protection mechanisms and food security for conflict-affected people in Kachin State</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project aims to respond to the critical unmet humanitarian needs in education, protection and food security for people in 20 IDP camps who have been displaced as a result of the ongoing protracted crises in Kachin.

PIN will support inclusive education for all children in 20 learning spaces (15 night study centres   in GCAs and 5 ethnic schools in NGCAs) in IDP camps by reducing barriers to education and improving teachers&apos; capacity to provide quality and inclusive education opportunities for conflict-affected children. Within this comprehensive strategy for inclusive education, PIN and KBC will distribute school supplies, teaching kits and student kits ensuring all students have the basic material provision needed to allow them to attend school. Parent awareness sessions on the importance of education and education&apos;s impact on child development will further reduce the barriers for access to education. PSS will be provided through child-centered creative group activities.

To improve the quality of education for children, teachers from NGCAs and night volunteer student guides in GCAs will be provided with an in-depth teacher training session before the beginning of the new school year. Following the TICC curriculum, which is designed to improve teaching in insecure contexts, it covers lesson planning, PSS, pedagogy, child and teacher well-being and etc., this training will build teachers&apos; capacity in teaching methods and classroom management. As part of this support, PIN and KBC will work together to improve the quality of night guide classes in GCAs through piloting a new methodology for the provision of night study classes. Coordination of training delivery has taken place with KBC who act as camp administrators. It has been adapted by PINs EiE Advisor for the Myanamr context and used in previous MHF projects.       Teachers in NGCA schools and night volunteer student guides will be provided with subsistence allowance enabling them to focus on their teaching related tasks and learning. At the beginning and the end of the project a numeracy and literacy survey (ASER) will be carried  out to identify critical gaps among children and catch-up needs which will be diseminated to the EiE cluster for wider use in future project design.

Within the protection component of this project, HI will build the technical and pedagogical capacities of key community members to spread awareness regarding the threat posed by mines, ERW, IEDs and  SALWarms    , increasing durably the capacity of affected communities to prevent accidents and to adopt life-saving behavior. HI will provide life-saving messages   and Information Education Communication (IEC) materials to prevent and reduce the risk of accidents (death and/or injuries). RE Sessions are tailored to promote individual and community life-saving behaviors of youth, girls and boys in accordance with their different vulnerabilities, roles and needs. The increased knowledge of population will contribute to reduce the risk of accidents and to promote safe behaviors to minimize the negative impact posed by arms. The proposed training will build on HI&#x2019;s  experience providing MRE to communities and school children in South-East (Kayin and East Bago). HI is also providing MRE sessions in Thailand in the refugee&#x2019;s camps in Mae Sot. HI is co-chairing the VATG of the MRWG at national level with UNICEF. Furthermore, HI is planning to bring MRE project manager from the Thailand MRE activities in Mae Sot to deliver ToT training to new HI staff and KBC in Kachin. 
The project also targets food insecurity through supporting access to livelihood opportunities for the most vulnerable, including women, youth and person with disabilities-led households. This intervention will provide life and business skills training as well as targeted vocational training aimed at equipping beneficiaries with the skills they need to open their own businesses...
