      <narrative xml:lang="EN">1. TNMAC has a limited institutional and technical capacity to effectively plan, manage and coordinate all mine action related activities.
2. The national key strategic documents (National mine action strategy 2016-2020) endorsed by GoT is being implemented.
3. TNMAC reports regularly to CIIHL; GoT reports regularly to international community to fulfil convention obligations; financial support depends on 2 key donors (US and UNDP) and UNDP/OSCE support; audit report submitted timely.
4. Effectively plan, manage and coordinate Land Release activities in country. TNMAC has a basic capacity to effectively plan, manage and coordinate mine action related activities. It is not yet able to function fully independently. Technical support in strategic planning, coordination and resource mobilization is still required.
5. Approximately 9.6 km&#xB2; of confirmed hazard areas remain to be released from landmines/ERW in Tajik-Afghan border and the Central Region until 2020. 45 un-surveyed minefield records (MFR) with app. area of 1.4 km2 remains to be surveyed in Tajik-Afghan border.
6. The established national mine action NGO is not fully operational. MoD has the required EOD and demining capacity but a mechanism to address residual threat has not been agreed;
7.There is a need to establish external QM capacity to be able to conduct QA/QC activities in other MA programmes; PoP Outreach programme signed agreements on cross border project between Tajikistan and Afghanistan.
8. a) Integration of VA into existing UN and Governmental disability related programmes is successfully continued. However, this process requires strengthening the capacity of the governmental and non-governmental structures; b)   Approximately 90% of the victim needs assessment (ICRC/ RCST) data is obtained..

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">The capacity development target is considered as achieved and the team has met several times with TNMAC colleagues, discussed and worked out the handover plan to make sure that all necessary documentation, archive and equipment/assets properly and smoothly transferred to TNMAC by the end of the award (S-PMWRA-18-GR-0021) 30 September 2019.
Advocacy is to be considered as one of the key Mine Action pillars, aimed to get familiar national and international communities with threat of mine action in the country. UNDP STMAP supported TNMAC in arrangement of International Mine Action Awareness Day, that took place in Tajik State National University campus on 4 April 2019. The aim of the event was to inform the participants with achievement of HMA operations in the country and to raise and discuss the mine action challenges. The representatives of national key entities, embassies, NGOs and INGOs, landmine survivors, mass media and students participated in the occasion. The visibility materials, factsheets and press releases prepared and disseminated among the participants.
UNDP STMAP support team contributed to land release activities and as part of his consultancy duties were to make sure that all missions that are related to land release and TS/NTS activities should be properly planned supported by information from IMSMA in 2019. 

In the 1st quarter 2019, NTS teams of UST engaged with preparation activities to the new season, i.e. explored the documents/maps, deployed the staff, provided refresh trainings and discussed the budget. During the year TNMAC and UST IM staff obtained number of on-the-jobs trainings, desk assessment and specific IM related knowledge from UNDP IM Specialist.
Appropriate recommendations have been provided to review the national standards, instructions and other guidelines for more effective and efficient operation activities. The TNMAC is expecting to review all mentioned key documents upon approval of new deadline of Tajikistan&#x2019;s obligation on Ottawa Convention (APMBC) and endorsement of Tajikistan&#x2019;s new implementation plan for 2020-2023.
In January 2019, TMAP hold a 5-days workshop with participation of Mr. Gregory Cathcart, ISU/Geneva, Mr. Olaf Juergensen, Development and Mine Action Specialist, UNDP Istanbul Regional Hub, TNMAC and UNDP STMAP colleagues. During the workshop the team has looked through all parts of draft Extension Request, discussed and shared objective comments/recommendations on the document. Afterwards, all comments and recommendations have been addressed and the final document developed and submitted to the Government consideration and endorsement. Fortunately, the new Extension Request has been accepted and approved for further proceeding.

STMAP VA provided technical support to TNMAC in preparation of up-dates for the Victim Assistance parallel meetings and Victim Assistance Plenary session at the Meetings of the States Parties to the AP Mine Ban Convention in Geneva, Switzerland. 

VA department of TNMAC and STMAP coordinated its efforts with national (MHSPP and its structures) and international partners (UNDP Rule of Law and Access to Justice project, WHO, UNICEF) in data gathering for preparation of Tajikistan up-dates. 

In cooperation with TNMAC VA Officer, STMAP VA Advisor contributed for preparation of Victim Assistance related part to the Draft Extension Request of Tajikistan to APMBC. All necessary information and analysis have been provided to reflect the VA context in the request.
An animation/cartoon on prevention of landmines and unexploded ordnances (UXO) casualties among the children and members of their families in rural areas of the country has developed. It proposed releasing of 2 cartoons with 5 minutes each in Tajik and English languages. The cartoons developed and released and recorded in DVD and disseminated among target communities living in Tajik-Afghan, Tajik-Uzbek borders and Central Region through Tajikistan National Mine Action Center networks.   
STMAP IM supported TNMAC IM staff to provide statistics from IMSMA to TNMAC Operations unit for the preparation regular TNMAC reports for the Government. The technical support has been provided for the digitalizing (georectification) un-surveyed 30 Minefield Records. Currently, only 30 remaining minefield records are not surveyed, and according to latest desk assessment those minefield records have 41 SHAs in Tajik-Afghan border and Central Region of Tajikistan. 
Developed the general map of un-surveyed areas based on Desc assessments (remaining Minefield records). On-job trainings has been provided to Public Organization Union of Sappers of Tajikistan&#x2019;s Ops and IM staff related to online data collection (Survey123), geodata collection, working with topographical maps, GPS device and ArcGIS Desktop.
Also, technical support has been provided to prepare the detailed Work Plan and Prioritization of future NTS missions. Based on the preliminary assumption for Non-technical survey, TNMAC prepared the following work plan aims to:
&#x2022;	Complete survey all suspected areas in the Central Region by the end of 2019
&#x2022;	Complete survey of 38 remaining suspected hazardous areas in Tajik-Afghan Border by 2023
IMSMA Core web applications has been designed for Land Release Operations (Data review and Validation). Currently Progress reports is available for LR implementing partners to enter and review the progress data. TNMAC QA Officers are trained to work with Web Application for data validation designed to control the land release data flow submitted by IPs.</narrative>
