Baseline for the LFS Programme implemented by the International Indigenous Women&apos;s Forum (FIMI), relying, to that

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">7 large organizations have strengthened their institutional capacity. 1 in Africa, 2 in Asia, 2 in Latinamerica, 1 in the Arctic and 1 in the Pacific.                                                                   During the 2WCIW, 7 regional LFS&#xB4;s partners networks (Network of Indigenous Women in Asia (NIWA), Asia Indigenous Women Network (AIWN), Continental Network of Indigenous Women of the Americas (ECMIA), Alianza de Mujeres Ind&#xED;genas de Centroam&#xE9;rica y M&#xE9;xico (AMICAM), African Indigenous Women&#x2019;s Organization (AIWO), Saami Women&apos;s Forum (SNF), National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Women&#x2019;s Alliance (Natsiwa) received grants as part of their institutional strengthening process. In this process, they were able to identify their own creative initiatives based on their needs prior to and during the conference. Their participation in the 2WCIW allowed them to strengthen internally, acquired greater project management and administration capacities and increased their leadership and participation in decision-making spaces to the enforcement of women&apos;s rights and gender equality. Also,through capacity building and indigenous women&#x2019;s meaningful participation, their participation elevated indigenous women&#x2019;s self confidence and capacity in critical areas, improving their participation in decision-making processes and promoting self-confidence of their cultural and gender identities. For example, the 7 regional networks of Indigenous Women have come together to bring a &#x201C;Global Political Declaration of Indigenous Women- that presents their priorities and recommendations as well as add the Indigenous woman&#x2019;s voice on to the global statement. The collective document was presented to different organizations and stakeholders at national, regional and global level.</narrative>
