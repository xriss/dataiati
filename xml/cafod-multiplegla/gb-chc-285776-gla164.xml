   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Strengthening Family and Community Health in a rural community in El Salvador</narrative>
  </title>
  <description>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Over the past several years, public health system in El Salvador has been in a state of crisis and disintegration. Previous governments had plans for privatising health services, but these had generated strong opposition from large sectors of the population. As a consequence, a national health commission was set up, which included governmental and non-governmental representatives, to examine alternative models for healthcare management. The community health project on of the communities in the Chalatenango department was one of the experiences of participatory healthcare under consideration, with a health team made up mainly of local health promoters. 

Subsequently, the institutional relations with the Ministry of Health improved considerably. Currently, the Clinic belongs to the Ministry of Health and offers a comprehensive healthcare coverage, an integral maternity programme, and secure employment for the staff, as well very good indicators of health and community participation. For this reason, the Clinic earned recognition of the WHO and the University of El Salvador as a &#x201C;model rural clinic&#x201D;. The clinic now has a multi-disciplinary team of medical doctors and an outreach team that covers a 40 kms radius, attending isolated rural communities as well as Honduran migrants from the border regions. 

However, the authorities are unable to cover all the necessary expenses of the Clinic and thus it needs to seek certain level of support from other sources. Therefore, this project aims to strengthen the participatory community health system in the community, which emphasises women&#x2019;s and children&#x2019;s health, and to address health promotion issues such as gender equity and domestic violence, health as a human right, as well as dental and mental health care. They aim to improve wellbeing of girls, boys, women and men of all ages in the community as well as in the neighbouring communities.</narrative>
