   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Supporting training of social and pastoral leaders for social justice and ecumenical dialogue in LAC</narrative>
  </title>
  <description>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">CESEEP is an ecumenical organisation created in 1982 by a group of bishops, pastors, theologians, biblical scholars and social scientists to provide training for community leaders, social movements and people from Christian churches, open to dialogue and cooperation with people of other religious beliefs. It offers courses on ecumenism and inter-religious dialogue, mostly with Latin American and Caribbean character, which are also open to people from other Portuguese-speaking countries. CESEEP also provides organisational support for Bishops&apos; Ecumenical Pastoral Study Days, also supported by CAFOD. Additionally, CESEEP organises other courses, of shorter duration, which are held in partnership with other institutions or churches. CESEEP wants to contribute to social changes, with the aim of building a more just and egalitarian society. 

The training offered by CESEEP as part of their various courses and activities has a strong theoretical angle and aims to train people so that they are able to develop social activities and training in their own places of origin. CESEEP&#x2019;s training includes critical reading of reality, with tools based on popular education methodology, deepening those themes and subjects that affect people most, especially the poorest ones. It also includes understanding of the reality from the popular reading of the Bible and reflecting on the actions of communities and pastoral and social movements, to make them more efficient in achieving their planned goals. CESEEP&apos;s collaboration with ecumenical organisations and bodies, and others that are open to inter-religious dialogue, is aimed at broadening the debate and acting on common issues such as actions and events that damage the environment or human dignity, especially regarding gender, race and religion.

This project is a continuation of support provided to CESEEP and is aimed at contributing towards organisation&apos;s new three-year plan 2022-2024.</narrative>
