  </title>
  <description>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Radialistas Apasionadas y Apasionados was created in 2001 to contribute to the democratisation of communications, especially of radio, with particular focus on gender, citizenship and protection of the environment. It was set up as a production and training centre for radio broadcasters from all continents, although prioritising Latin America and the Caribbean. During these past 20 years, Radialistas have worked to expand their services, and with Radioteca.net, Radios Libres and RadioLAB, they have consolidated their position as one of the most renown radio production and training centres in the region.

This new project will focus on training and capacity building for women radio broadcasters. Radialistas continue to believe that it is crucial to strengthen the capacities of community media and they want to explore other ways of doing this work, not only via courses or publications. Additionally, this new project will include a more continuous processes of accompanying women radio broadcasters as the partner wants to focus more on women, especially in rural and indigenous areas, who have fewer opportunities to access training. 

Therefore, the aim of this project is to develop training in different formats (podcasts, webinars and courses), in order to accompany a group of radio broadcasters, mainly women from rural/indigenous areas, to train them in radio broadcasting. Additionally, hundreds of other radio broadcasters will also benefit from these training processes via the website. 

During the two stages of the project, Radialistas will directly and intensively train 20 women radio broadcasters, while at the same time at least 200 other women radio broadcasters will be participating in the various activities organised as part of these training processes. Additionally, Radialistas would continue to send a fortnightly bulletin to the Radialistas network and, with the same frequency, another one to Radios Libres.</narrative>
