   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Emergency Nutrition Response Project in West Wellega Zone of Buji Dermeji,  Lalo Asabi and Nedjo  Woredas in Oromia Region</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In the last few months internal displacement due to conflict and ethnic tensions has increased in Oromia Region. It is remembered that, due to ethnic and border related issues hundreds of thousands of Oromo Region, East/West Wellega Zone of 13 Woredas communities were displaced due to the conflict erupted in Benishangule Gumuz. During times of conflict water and food availability are increasingly scarce with insufficient food, immunity is compromised and threatens the survival of these at risk groups. Curative measures for addressing severe acute malnutrition are essential to prevent mortality associated with malnutrition. In the proposed Woredas IDPs are settled at collective centers and some of them are scattered in the community and living together with the host community. The scatters IDPs gradually bring a critical food shortage gap for the host communities due to sharing of the food and other basic needs. The fragile nutrition service  systems delivery  of most conflict attacked districts remain vulnerable to the impact of Nutrition emergencies due to precipitating human resources for Nutrition  crises, disruption of Nutrition supply chain system and ultimately poor service delivery. The integrated CMAM project will provide support with integrating Health Cluster staffs and Health Extension Workers to IDPs and host communities in underserved areas affected by conflict of Buji Dirmeji, Lalo Asabe and Nedjo IDP affected Woredas of West Wellega Zone, Oromia Region. The emergency response mechanism through Community Based Management of Acute malnutrition (CMAM) will saves the lives of vulnerable groups (Children under five years, Pregnant and Lactating Women). Timely addressing Moderate Acute Malnutrition further stops acute Malnutrition and severe acute malnutrition further stops deterioration into complicated severe acute malnutrition. Those community members are in need of emergency humanitarian support in all aspects especially nutrition interventions which are recommended by the respective regional, Zonal stakeholders and multi agency teams. This project will provide immediate lifesaving Nutrition assistance in response to food insecurity for IDP community and host communities through addressing the immediate causes of malnutrition by offering the much needed critical acute malnutrition curative services at all levels of Health Center and Health Posts at IDP collective Centers and in the Host Communities. The project will also link with other government routine health services and partner projects to prevent future relapses. Therefore, the project will create synergies for stronger complementarily, integration and sustainability and strengthen CMAM services in the existing facility in a way that will safe guard against malnutrition for vulnerable groups in the future. The project will improve access for life saving critical basic services for highly vulnerable groups, specifically children under five, Pregnant and Lactating Women in Oromia region, West Wellega Zone of Buji Dirmeji, Lalo asabe  and Nedjo Woredas IDPs and Host communities. The goal of the project is to contribute reduce mortality and morbidity in related to malnutrition, improves access to life&#xAD;saving nutrition interventions for the most vulnerable populations&#xAD; notably under five children, pregnant and lactating women, establish/strength multi sectoral coordination for the management and response of malnutrition, increase the awareness of the community on malnutrition regardless of their nutritional status through IYCF-E, Health and Nutrition counseling for both IDPs and Host Communities. These Woredas need support technically and logistically for system strengthening and to deliver proper CMAM services. The CMAM project also will be considered Gender balance when recruiting staff for this project and most of the technical support for program will be provided to HEWs who are mostly female, and Woreda health staff who are both male and female.</narrative>
