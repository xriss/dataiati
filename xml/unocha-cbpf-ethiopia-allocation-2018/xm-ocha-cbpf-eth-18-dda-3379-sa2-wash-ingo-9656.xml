  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Due to three consecutive failed rainy seasons, an acute drought continues to affect the Somali region, exposing pastoral communities to critical forage, lack of access to basic food, loss of reduction of livelihood assets and livelihood opportunities, affordable market products and safe water, causing immense malnutrition, and severe livestock emaciation and mortality rates. According to the 2018 Humanitarian Response Document released early March 2018, 7.8 million people are food insecure in Ethiopia and 8.49 million in need of non-food assistance. Out of these, 1.79 million food insecure people (or 23%) and 2.59 million people (or 30.5%) in need of non-food support are in Somali region, which clearly illustrates the impact of the drought in the Somali region. In addition, a huge number of people are internally displaced in the region due to the drought, looking for support and establishing themselves in sites to receive the support they need to subsist. The Somali region is currently hosting 818,250 Internally Displaced (IDPs) in 331 sites. These people are likely to remain displaced as the humanitarian needs are expected to remain significant, particularly in parts of the south-eastern lowland areas of the Somali region. 
In addition to drought, tensions between Somali and Oromo communities and conflict along the border has displaced around 1.070 million IDPs, who are currently residing in 439 IDPs sites in Ethiopia (11th round DTM). While some of these displacements date back to 2012, the vast majority occurred in 2017. The conflict IDPs are hosted in 601 sites in Oromia and Somali regions. Those displaced from across regions are mainly hosted in transit or collective centers, while those displaced within a region are settled along border areas (OCHA, June 2018). More people have been displaced by conflict along the Somali-Oromia regional boundary since DTM 10. According to recent Multi-Cluster Initial Rapid Assessment report (19 June 2018), conflict IDPs in the border between Jinacsen (Oromia Region) and Tuliguled Woreda (Somali Region) caused new displacement of 4,193 families, who are currently residing in Gabo-gabo Kabele of Tuliguled Woreda. Since the displacement, the IDPs are residing in six different sub-kabeles within Gabogabo with varying needS: food and water shortage, next to zone latrine coverage with high prevalence of open defecation, limited access to schools and health facilities and separation of children from their caregivers are challenging the IDPs and adjutant host communities to live a human life.
As per the sectors/interventions outlined in the Allocation Paper, Oxfam is proposing to assist the conflict induced IDPs and catchment host communities in Tuliguled woreda through lifesaving WASH response, with gender and protection as key cross-cutting theme. Interventions proposed are highly aligned with Allocation Paper of EHF: (a) provision of water supply to alternatives to water trucking &#x2013; Oxfam is proposing for rehabilitation of existing ground water sources, by increase the performances and outreach of the targeted schemes, to ensure continuous access to safe water (b) Installation of sanitation facilities &#x2013; to restore dignity, reduce risks and meet the immediate sanitation needs of the affected population and (c) Hygiene promotion including WASH NFIs &#x2013; to meet the immediate needs while influencing for safe hygiene practices of the targeted communities.
  
Gender and Protection mainstreaming will be at the heart of this project as all the interventions proposed consider the differential risk and vulnerability exposure of targeted women and girl IDPs.</narrative>
