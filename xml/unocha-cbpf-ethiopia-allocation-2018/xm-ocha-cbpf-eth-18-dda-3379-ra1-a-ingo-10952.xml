   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Due to the recent conflict between Gedio and Guji Zones, large number of households had been displaced from their place of residence. The conflict resulted in destruction of homes, crops and livestock in both zones leaving many destitute.  The mid-year review and recent reports from the EOC&#x2019;s based in Bule Hora and Dilla revealed that IDPs have started to return back to their previous area of residence. Still there is higher need of humanitarian assistance required to sustain the lives and livelihoods of the returnees and most vulnerable households in both locations until they are able to provide for themselves. The most vulnerable households (particularly women and child headed families) are the worst affected groups who are in need of significant livelihoods support. 

Inadequate crop seed supply and livestock are the major problems identified in the targeted locations. Provision of agricultural implements along with crop seed supply as well as restocking of core livestock breeds for households who have lost their livestock is thus identified as key intervention area in this project. Assessments also show that there is a higher need for veterinary services in the targeted locations for those who have remaining livestock and those who will receive conditional cash grant for restocking. Hence, Save the Children designed this project with the aim of restoring and preventing further deterioration of food security and livelihoods for the most vulnerable households in the targeted areas. The project targets both returnees and host communities in the selected woredas. Through this EHF fund allocation, Save the Children will implement animal health services through voucher systems, restocking through conditional cash transfer via bank systems and crop production through provision of early maturing crop seeds. 

Promote and strengthen resilience of local community through provision of early maturing crop seeds: Crop seeds are one of the basic inputs in crop production which are not readily available and accessible for smallholder farm households in the aftermath of humanitarian crisis. This project targets to support access to short term maturing crop seeds that are adaptable to the local climate and environment. Targeted households will receive training on improved agronomics practices and techniques in crop production and management to improve their resilience capacities and coping strategies. Through this activity, Save the Children intends to enhance food security, livelihoods and resilience.   

Provision of farm implements and restocking through conditional cash transfer via bank systems: In addition to provision of agricultural inputs, this project proposes to provide conditional cash grants to target beneficiaries in order to procure small ruminants (sheep and goats) to supplement and sustain their livelihoods and purchase farm tools. Complementing this activity, Save the Children will be providing voucher based animal health services which is a key factor in increasing livestock production and productivity as healthy animals are more productive. Targeted households for this activity will be selected by committees (local authorities, community representatives, the elderly, women representatives and other key stakeholders). Each household recipient will then be given vouchers that will enable them to contract the services to the respective CAHWS and be able to pay for the services they will receive. Through this services, beneficiaries will be able to get health service/treatment for their livestock. The animal health intervention planned under this project will greatly supplement the food production and improve milk production which will in turn play crucial role in improving the nutritional status of children and their families.</narrative>
