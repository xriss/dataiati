  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">According to the Humanitarian and Disaster Resilience Plan (HDRP), Ethiopia is still struggling to get out of the consecutive humanitarian crisis caused by different factors that ranged from natural disaster to manmade conflict which has resulted in massive livestock loss and massive displacements in several parts of the country. More than 7.8 million people are dependent on direct food assistance, while an additional 3.6 million people are supported through public works under the Productive Safety Nets Programme (PSNP). 
When it comes to the case of recent unprecedented inter-communal conflict in Gedo and West Guji zones created surge of internal displacement, which at its height displaced some 818,000 people. According to DMT Round 12, there are 603,703 IDPs in both zones and those IDPs continue to return to their areas of origin. 
Due to the government led massive return program, the humanitarian need now has shifted from life-saving to rehabilitation. Based on the current need assessment which prioritizes durable shelter solutions, this project is designed to enable returnees from west Guji and within Gedeo to reconstruct their destroyed houses through cash amp voucher based intervention. This project will provide access to durable shelter materials using cash amp vouchers as a modality, to enable targeted households repair and replace roofing of their damaged houses that were looted and burned. 
According to Gedeo zonal administration and zonal DRMC office&#x2019;s priority, Gedeb woreda needs such rehabilitation interventions where there are 57643 (30262 male and 27381female) returnees from West Guji and within Gedeo to the woreda and there are a total of 3888 houses destroyed. If needed World vision is willing to readjust project location based on further discussion with the government and emergency operation center based on severity of existing needs.
Targeting criteria will be set to prioritize the neediest hhs and this will be done in collaboration with local authorities, EOC and returnee representatives. Accordingly the project will prioritize pregnant and lactating women, children headed households, female headed households. These are the returnees whose houses are burned, properties are destroyed and whose entire livelihood is distorted. Even though they are in their place of origin they cannot stay in their homes even when walls, foundations etc are structurally sound. Providing roofing material means that families currently either staying with relatives or in other inadequate shelter, could quickly make their homes safe and habitable. 
Due to the shortage of the resources at hand, prioritization will be mandatory. As a result 583 HHs (3498 returnees) will be selected out of the entire returnees in Gedeb woreda and those selected households will access basic durable shelter construction inputs through vouchers from identified suppliers where they receive basic durable shelter NFIS like CGI sheeting and nail through restricted cash and Voucher modality so that they can rebuild their damaged and burnet houses. This cash  based intervention modality is designed to be implemented through restricted cash transfer approach which makes use of card vouchers to ensure returnees utilize the money for the intended purpose. Vouchers can be redeemed for a wide variety of durable shelter NFIs in the shops that can be existing capable shops around the returnee areas or temporary set up by traders from Dilla town at the returnee sites as the beneficiaries cannot travel to the town as they will incur additional expense for transportation. The Traders will be identified and contracted by WV, using robust selection criteria with the primary focus on the capacity of the shop to supply a wide range of preferred construction materials. The total number of hhs that benefit from this project are 583 and they will receive cash value of Iron sheet, nail and skilled labor and the value for these is calculated to be 9250ETB ($336).</narrative>
