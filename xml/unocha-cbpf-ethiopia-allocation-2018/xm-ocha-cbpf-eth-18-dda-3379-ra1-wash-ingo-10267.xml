   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Lifesaving Emergency of  WASH Response for flooding and Drought Affected IDPs in Two  woredas of Shebele Zones</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In Somali Region, Ethiopia following the heavy rainfall received in the highlands of Oromia many rivers, including Genale and Wabi Shebelle and related tributaries have over flown, broken the river banks, which caused over flooding covered vast areas in Somali Region. Consequently, flooded water has damaged the already limited water source/infrastructures and Latrines in many Kebeles of Kalafo and Mustahil woredas (P1 category Hotspot), ). According to OCHA flash update May report, Many people&#x2019;s houses/shelters and livestock have been washed away which caused displacement and homeless people. The damaged latrines and water infrastructures by the recent floods impacted negatively on the availability and access to safe drinking water and also availability of sanitation and hygiene facilities as the flooding affected population are currently drinking water from un-protected sources (rivers and ponds), scarcity of water purification chemicals, practice of open defecation which caused the outbreak of water borne related diseases and the re-emergence of AWD in the three woredas of Kalafo, Mustahil, and Ferfer which have been the epicenter of the recurrent AWD outbreaks in the last couple of months. The following table illustrates WASH facilities damaged by the Shebele river seasonal flooding. People are moved back to their dwellings or villages with no infrastructure, which is destroyed by flooding. ADRA will rehabilitate the WASH infrastructure with allocated budget from OCHA to their flood damaged sites not the evacuation center. According to August Zonal DPPB report where ADRA prioritized the activities and implement accordingly.

In this regard, 26,514 people in Mustahil and 54,366 people in Kelafo are in for Urgent WASH Support in their dwellings. Therefore, ADRA is proposing an emergency WASH project in Kelafo and Mustahil for flooding affected woredas to provide immediate and long-term sustainable and safe water solutions and improving sanitation and hygiene facilities to mitigate public health and nutritional risks through the followings:
1-	16 Hand Dug wells rehabilitation in across seven kebeles in 11 sites (2 Kebhanle site, Dayax site, Goblow Site, Shubo Site, Muse-done, Allow-Igarsi, Niri-Niri site, Dhur-dhere, Dorale, Caga-dhurwa, and Mirdhis) in 2 woredas through Emergency WASH response
2-	44 Multi Family 4 Stance latrine construction with associated hand washing facilities in across 16 sites (2 Kebhanle site, Dayax site, Goblow Site, Shubo Site, Muse-done, Allow-Igarsi, Balanbale, Niri-Niri site, Dhur-dhere, Moyko, Marayle, Dorale, Tun-dhow, Caga-dhurwa, Budul, and Mirdhis) in 2 woredas through Emergency WASH response .
3-	Three (3) community-based water management committee training for each water facility rehabilitated. 
4-	Hygiene promotion activities will focus on providing immediate hygiene information and good hygiene practices linking health and nutrition information, education, communication messages accordingly. There will also be longer-term hygiene promotion activities through training of trainers (TOT) by using Community-Led Total Sanitation (CLTS) approach.
5-	 Provision of sanitation tools and equipment, particularly at flooding IDP sites health and education centers.
The proposed project will enable ADRA to build upon on its current Emergency WASH projects in kohle woreda funded by ADRA- Czech and the recently-completed OCHA HRF-funded WASH project in Kohle and God-god woreda in Somali region. The action will also complement the OCHA HRF funded emergency project on  livelihood protection  , which currently ADRA is implementing in Gode woreda of Shebele Zone of Somali Region of Ethiopia.</narrative>
