   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project is a livestock-based intervention focusing on preparedness for humanitarian shocks and response to the ongoing crisis such as flood, conflict and disease outbreaks affecting livestock and ultimately humans. 
Somali Region of Ethiopia is one of the regions where nearly 40% of the population are pastoralists and agro-pastoralists. It is a region that is most seriously affected by drought and flood induced disasters in the past. According to the flood damage report in Somali Region released in June 2018, Shebele and Dawa Zones are among the areas severely affected by flood. It affected 27,251 households and displaced 16,336 households in Shebele Zone and affected 2,566 households and displaced 1020 households in Dawa Zone. 
Moreover, Dawa Zone is among the areas severely affected by inter-ethnic conflict since September 2017. As of May 2018, in Moyale Woreda of Dawa Zone, the communities of more than 9 villages live in the worst humanitarian situation after they were displaced from their homes. According to multi-agency assessment conducted in last week of May 2018, 5,645 households (93,870 individuals) were affected by the violent clashes.
The 2018 Ethiopian Humanitarian Disaster and Resilience plan has shown that out of the 2.4 million households that need livestock support nationally, 629,249 households are in Somali Region indicating the second highest need next to SNNPR. The region has the second highest projection of SAM cases (89,353) in 2018 having a total of 99 hotspot woredas. All of the woredas targeted for this project are priority 1 hotspot woredas. 
In response to the dire needs of communities affected by flood and conflict, this project aims to contribute to the preparedness for and response to humanitarian shocks in Firfir, Mustahil and Kelafo Woredas of Shebele Zone and Moyale, Mubarek and Hidet Woredas of Dawa Zone. 
To enhance improved preparedness for humanitarian shocks and weather-related crisis, the project planned to address the areas with high potential for fodder production through capacity building interventions such as training targeted community members on fodder production, management, harvesting, hay making, preservation and storage for 120 households. They will also be provided by all the necessary input such as fodder seeds, hand tools, water pump and pipe. Moreover, they will be assisted in better management of water for fodder production. The project aims to construct 2 fodder banks in Shebele Zone. Interventions that improve marketability, durability and value addition of the biomass produced/collected are also planned in this project. 
The response element of the project mainly focuses on provision of package of emergency animal health services for flood and conflict affected communities. Voucher based livestock treatment will be provided for 6000 households in the 6 woredas. Risk- based participatory surveillance and response activities will be supported which includes technical and logistic support for government-led livestock vaccination programme. The intervention also aims to strengthen the community animal health delivery through mapping, refresher training and provision of booster kits for community animal health workers in the 6 woredas. Milking goats will be provided for 200 IDP households severely affected by conflict and hosting children, pregnant and lactating women severely affected by malnutrition. 
A total of 187,300 individuals are the direct beneficiaries of this project out of which 1,360 are conflict IDPs. The intervention directly addressing IDPs is restocking households hosting acutely malnourished children and PLW. 
The project is based on the previous experience of VSF-Suisse in the area and on-going interventions. Therefore, there will be a participatory monitoring and evaluation mechanisms targeting towards better accountability to the community and enhancing learning. Gender, nutrition and protection will be mainstreamed in the project and monitor</narrative>
