   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Responding to Emergency Health Needs of Conflict affected IDPs in SNNP and Oromia  Regions, Ethiopia</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The ongoing conflict between Gedeo and Guji in SNNP and Oromia regions has led to massive displacement of more than 800,000 internally displaced persons (IDPs) in Gedeo zone. The movement and geographical distribution of the displaced persons is very dynamic. After several months of the conflict, IDPs are reported to move back to their areas of origin, mainly to Guji. As of October 2018, official&#x2019;s figures shared by OCHA reveals that 286,565 IDPs/returnees are reported to be in West Guji while 137667 IDPs/returnees are reported to be in Gedeo zone. Many of these IDPs have lost their homes and are now without proper shelter, with inadequate NFIs, and with little access to safe water, sanitation facilities, and basic health and nutrition services. Robust and comprehensive emergency health services need to be provided to reduce and prevent mortality and morbidity associated with this emergency. SNNP and Oromia Regional Health Bureaus (RHB) and partners have reported huge gaps in essential medicines and health supplies in all health facilities as the influx of IDPs/returnees has exceeded expectations. The availability of essential medicines and health-related supplies is critical to saving lives and reducing morbidities among those vulnerable groups.

The objective of this project is to timely and effectively respond to emergency health needs of the IDPs/returnees through the provision of essential life-saving health supplies and commodities to treat common health diseases/conditions and prevent disease outbreaks. The project will support RHBs and partners to monitor and technically support the emergency health interventions being provided, and facilitate smooth health supplies and services delivery to the targeted beneficiaries. The direct beneficiaries are all conflict-affected IDPs and returnees in Gedeo and West Guji in SNNPR and Oromia regardless of their age, gender and social status, an estimated 424,232 persons (women, men, boys and girls) in total. These beneficiaries will receive essential health services and hygiene promotion provided through health facilities, including community facilities in all locations. This project is seeking a total amount of $ 299,921.00 to implement the planned interventions which includes procurement and distribution of emergency health medicines and commodities, support technical supportive supervision to health workers and health facilities to ensure quality and continuity of health services, and facilitate monitoring and easy delivery of supplies and commodities to all IDPs locations in Gedeo and West Guji zones.

The project interventions are aligned with health cluster strategies, priorities and objectives. Furthermore, the activities under this proposal have been prioritized and agreed upon in consultations with RHB, WHO, and health cluster partners. UNICEF will ensure implementation of the project through close coordination with RHBs, WHO and health cluster partners. All supplies will be procured per national standards. The project including the commodities will be monitored regularly through UNICEF field offices and RHBs monitoring structures in SNNP and Oromia regions.</narrative>
