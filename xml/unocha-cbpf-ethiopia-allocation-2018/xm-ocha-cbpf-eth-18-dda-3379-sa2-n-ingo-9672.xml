   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Emergency nutrition specific and WASH sensitive response for IDPs and host community in Birbirsa Kojowa and Bule Hora Zuria districts of West Guji Zone, Oromia Region.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Owing to the worsening situation in West Guji Zone secondary to increased number of IDP, Plan International Ethiopia (PIE) propose this emergency Nutrition response project as an extension of the current ongoing Community Based Management of Acute Malnutrition (CMAM-E) funded by OCHA/EHF and integrated multi-sectorial projects in other districts of West Guji Zone. This project proposed to meet the urgent nutritional and WaSH NFI need of IDP and their host communities in Birbirsa Kojowa and Bule Hora Zuria Districts. 
The proposed project aims to contribute to the reduction of mortality and morbidity among IDP and host communities (children under five and pregnant and lactating women (PLW)) through strengthening and expanding geographic coverage of integrated Community Based Management of Acute Malnutrition (CMAM), including Infant Young Child Feeding (IYCF-E) (Nutrition) and WaSH NFI responses. 
This intervention will prioritize the prevention of and early treatment of acute malnutrition among IDPs in particular and host communities in general by supporting local health systems in Birbirsa Kojowa and Bule Hora Zuria districts of West Guji Zone, Oromia Region. Activities will focus on enhancing the quality of nutrition services and ensuring the availability of Severely Acute Malnutrition (SAM) and Moderately Acute Malnutrition (MAM) treatment supplies at all level with giving emphasis on mobile clinics at IDP camps and health facilities. In both proposed districts logistic and technical support to Health Workers (HWs) and Health Extension Workers (HEWs) will be provided during regular MUAC screening, and in parallel, awareness of acute malnutrition and IYCF among IDP and the host community will be raised. Furthermore, IYCF-E will be reinforced, integrated and implemented with CMAM at all level. Under this project among IDPs and host communities, children under 5 and PLW will benefit from overall CMAM services, and complementary hygiene and sanitation activities including the distribution of water treatment chemicals, laundry soap and water container (jerry cans).
38 Out-Patient Therapeutic Feeding (OTP) and 8 Stabilization Centers (SCs) will be strengthened through technical and logistic supports. Moreover, they will be further strengthened by furnishing with essential CMAM supplies as required. Moreover, various modalities (nutrition and education sessions, support groups, and community mobilization) will be utilized to create awareness on the importance of taking children to the nutrition centers for monitoring or treatment, regardless of their gender. Health and nutrition education campaigns will be tailored for both male and female caretakers, with a strong emphasis on men&#x2019;s involvement in child caring practices. Community awareness activities will cover both men and women to ensure practical applications are carried out at the household level among IDPs and their host communities.
Gender will be mainstreamed and gender concerns will be further analyzed during the project&#x2019;s implementation period. Appropriate measures will be considered for gender equality and ensuring that women benefit. This will include: specifically targeting women for some of the activities (PLW-specific activities like TSFP for MAM PLW) and ensuring equal involvement of boys&#x2019; and girls&#x2019; participation in other activities (community mobilization sessions, screening, TSFP admission, OTP and SC referral linkage and case management, and capacity building supports). The distribution centers will be made more accessible to target beneficiaries among IDP and host communities to minimize the risk of GBV. Child protection is a core value of the project. All training activities will include a child protection sensitive topics.

Therefore, this emergency response project is planned to support IDP and their host communities on basic lifesaving nutrition and WaSH NFI needs that are not covered by the ongoing PIE response, Government and other keen partners.</narrative>
