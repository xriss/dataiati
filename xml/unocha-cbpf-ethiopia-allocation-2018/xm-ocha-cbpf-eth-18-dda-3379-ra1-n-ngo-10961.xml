  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">It is remembered that, due to ethnic and border related issues hundreds of thousands of Oromo Region, West Guji Zone communities were displaced due to the conflict with Gedio Zone, SNNPR. Following the influx of IDPs, MCMDO is operational in West Guji Zone Kercha and Hambela Wamena Woredas supporting with CMAM program from the funding source of EHF July allocation. The project will ended up on 31st January, 2019. As Humanitarian point of view, MCMDO strongly recommended to extend the project from February to July, 2019 with tangible justifications. The project will support and provide the life saving nutrition services for under five children and pregnant and lactating women. The targeted Woredas (IDPs) are highly vulnerable communities with who have limited access to nutrition services. The intervention is required to responds and supports the increased needs for early identification and treatment of acute malnutrition with tangible reasons Still the security situation is on and off, Due to the initial conflict the community missed completely the 2018 harvest season production and they are dependant for basic needs especially daily food consumption, The returnee IDPs from Gedeo Zone are still in their Kebele collective centers and security threat restricted community movement for in search of basic needs and aggravating the food insecurity situation in different angles, the Woreda officials are quite new for Emergency nutrition response. Due to this it needs close support to cascade the CMAM program to the health post level to strengthen the OTP role out strategy and life saving intervention, and high number of SAM and MAM admission in the Woredas.  MCMDO is strengthening the screening program by using MHN and CMAM team to have routine active case finding especially the Government staff not reach and referral linkage at all levels. MCMDO is also created coordination and collaboration with partners to have referral linkage from Health center to Hospital and from Hospital to Health center.  As the Woreda Health Workers are quite new to the response of CMAM intervention MCMDO is currently focusing on close follow up and on job training to deliver quality nutrition services at all levels and gradually will focus on more of system strengthening and supportive supervision.
This project will provide immediate lifesaving assistance in response to food insecurity for IDP and host communities. The project will also link with other government routine health services and partner projects to prevent future relapses. Therefore, the project will create synergies for stronger complementary, integration and sustainability and strengthen CMAM services in the existing facility in a way that will safe guard against malnutrition for vulnerable groups in the future. The project will improve access for life saving critical basic services for highly vulnerable groups, specifically children under five children, Pregnant and Lactating Women.
