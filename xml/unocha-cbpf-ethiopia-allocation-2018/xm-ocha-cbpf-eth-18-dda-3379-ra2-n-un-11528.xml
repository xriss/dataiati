   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Strengthening the in-patient management of severe acute malnutrition in response to internally displaced persons  in, Kamashi zone (Benishangul Gumuz region) and Dawa zone (Somali region) Ethiopia</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">A recent conflict in Oromia region since mid- October 2018 has resulted into the displacement of approximately 250,000 persons from Benishangul Gumuz region in Kamashi zone and East and West Wollega  zones in Oromia region. Of these 42,000 IDPs are in Kamashi zone living either within host communities or in  collective sites, mainly in the government buildings and schools. There has been limited humanitarian response done so far due to insecurity and inaccessibility in a number of affected woredas. With limited resources for health, nutrition, water, and shelter, the most vulnerable populations children under five, pregnant and lactation women are high risk of acute malnutrition and other communicable diseases.

In Dawa zone (Somali region), inter-communal conflicts have forced hundreds of thousands of people to live in IDP camps. Consequently, the livelihood of the communities that depend mainly on their livestock has worsened, with malnutrition weakening the immunity and resistance of affected communities and thereby increasing the risk of communicable disease transmission such as the confirmed measles outbreak in the entire zone. In addition the long-term border conflict with Oromia region has further complicated the ability to provide humanitarian assistance. The nearest PFSA hub, Negele hub in Oromia region from where the zone had been receiving medical and nutrition supplies, has not been able to supply the zone due to the conflict. Also the Negele district hospital in Oromia region had been the referral hospital for most of the Dawa health centers but the access has been cut due to the conflict. The DTM 13 reports that there are approximately 311, 268 displaced persons of these, 266,560 in Dawa zone and 42,708 in Liban zone with majority displaced due to conflict.

Acute malnutrition remains a major public health concern especially for those that develop the severe acute malnutrition because of the associated high mortality. The situation may be worsened in the presence of disease outbreaks such as AWD, measles and diarrhea and severe pneumonia due to overcrowding. Although the risks of mortality are due to the immunological changes that occur in the affected individual, avoidable factors such as lack of skilled health care workers, lack of medicines for the treatment of medical complications can be resolved. There is a need to effectively equip the national, regional and zonal health bureaus and the health facilities to manage the IDPs&apos; health and nutrition situation in Kamashi and Dawa zones with . 

The project will support and strengthen the regional, zonal and woreda health bureaus&#x2019; capacity to manage cases of severe acute malnutrition and improve quality of care for children hospitalized for SAM with medical complications in the affected IDP areas. Furthermore, the project will support the preposition of supplies for the management of children with SAM in the two priority zones.</narrative>
