   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Inter-communal conflict in Oromia and the SNNP region of Ethiopia has led to internal displacement of an estimated one million people in the two zones in 2018. The government has currently taken steps to return the IDPs to their place of origin.  According to the report from IOM ( September 3, 2018) 5,917HHs/30,528 people have been returned from Gedeo zone to West Guji Zone and another 7,218 HH are soon expected to return to West Guji. Returnees from West Guji to Gedeo are estimated to be 1,661HHs/12,226 people and another 40,452 HHs are soon expected to return to Gedeo. This project has prioritized Bule Hora and Birbirssa Kejewa woredas in West Guji zone. The prioritization of the zone and woredas was made as a result of the high number of IDP returnee population in the zone. According to West Guji zone education office and Bule Hora EOC coordination office report (October, 25/2018), the total number of IDP returnee population in Bule Hora Woreda are 45,561 and Birbirssa Kejewa Woreda are also about 25,092. Approximately, nearly half of the IDP population would be the school age children and they need education opportunities of different forms. Besides, the return of the IDPs to their original zones of residence would place West-Guji in a higher priority. More than 800,000 out of a total estimate of one million IDPs have been returning to West-Guji Zone.  A large number of IDP returnee population are also coming back to the zone and the assumption is the number of students are significant in number. Since the circumstances have changed, re-prioritization of zone and the woredas are designed and adjusted for this purpose.  World Vision proposes to establish an Accelerated Learning Program (ALP) for primary school-aged children (aged 7-14) and an Accelerated School Readiness (ASR) program for pre-primary school aged children between 4-6 years old. This will allow the conflict induced IDP children to successfully transition into the next school year.
Capacity building training as well as psychosocial support trainings will be provided to the affected children and teachers. Capacity building trainings include a three-day EiE and conflict sensitive education (CSE) training for teachers, education stakeholders such as PTSA, KETB (Kebele Education Training Board), WEO (Woreda Education Office), Zone Education Office and REB (Regional Education Bureau) a seven days capacity building training on ALP methodology for primary school teachers and cluster center supervisors  a three day psychosocial support training for teachers and students a two day capacity building training on GBV (Gender-Based Violence) , gender responsive pedagogies, psychosocial support and prevention of SRGBV to teachers and finally, a three day ToT (training of trainers) training for 60 Master trainers will be provided. The purpose of ToT training for Master Trainers will be to equip trainees with knowhow and enable them to cascade down the trainings to the woreda and school/IDP site levels. The master trainers will also be involved in mentoring and close supervision with the implementation of ASR and ALP programs alongside WV staff. This activity is proposed by the regional education cluster and endorsed by government and partners. The trainees will be from REB, WEO, ZEO, and selected school teachers /school cluster center supervisors.The proposed education emergency response project will have an immediate, comprehensive, and long- term impact in the lives of the targeted IDP children. This project will target 8 IDP sites in their original community in the prioritized two woredas by constructing 10 education cluster proposed standard TLCs and the renovation of partially damaged schools for better teaching and learning processes. Each TLC center will be composed of two classrooms and a total 20 classrooms. About 10 of which will providing ALP (Accelerated Learning Program) and the other 10 will be providing ASR (Accelerated School Readiness) program,</narrative>
