  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Somali Region is one of the four major pastoral regions in Ethiopia located in the North Eastern and South Eastern part of the country. As a predominantly pastoralist community, the livelihood activities are dependent on the natural resource base, and are therefore vulnerable to covariate shocks such as a drought, which undermines crop farming, livestock production, and herding opportunities. As part of humanitarian agencies, Islamic Relief (IR) is operating in Somali Regional state and take part in the implementation of nutrition projects that geared towards saving the lives of the children and mothers. 

Somali Region is one of the four major pastoral regions which is located in the North Eastern and South Eastern part of Ethiopia. The region is predominantly pastoral community who depend on natural resource to earn their livelihood activities, and therefore the people vulnerable to covariate shocks such as a drought, which undermines crop farming, livestock production and herding opportunities. Being one of the international humanitarian agencies, Islamic Relief (IR) is operating in Somali Regional state and take part in various emergency projects such as WASH, nutrition, livelihoods, protection and education in emergencies projects that geared towards saving the lives of the children and mothers. 
Accordingly, for more than 14 years, IR has been operating in Somali regional state by focusing on three zones (Sitti, Afder and Liban). In the course of implementing emergency projects in the three zones of the region, IR has been addressing nutritional needs of the people who are susceptible to food insecurity. In response to the call from the 2018 EHF Reserve Allocation, the organization has planned to recommence the emergency nutrition project which is ongoing in Gorobekekisa and Guradamole  woredas of Liban Zone and it is about to end after October 2018. This project addresses the needs of both host communities and IDPs residing in seven temporary shelters located in the two target woredas. Majority of the IDPs have been displaced due to the conflict that took place in bordering areas of Somali and Oromia Regional states. As the conflict has to stopped, the number displaced people is increasing from time to time and the recent data released by DTM round 11 showed that there are about 4,393 IDPs in both Woredas. Realizing that the host communities in the areas are also affected by the conflict, the project will also address the need of the local people. As per ENCU&#x2019;s classification, the two woredas fall under priority 1 hotspot areas and partners for emergency humanitarian response. 
The two target woredas (Goro-baqaqasa and Guradhamole) are located in the remotest part of Liban zone administration of Somali Regional State (SRS). The people of these two woredas are typically pastoralists, while few kebeles around the river bank practice agro-pastoralism. Gorobekekisa and Guradamole Woredas are among those Woredas of Somali Region that were affected with a slow onset of food security crisis since 2016. The humanitarian situation in these two Woredas has been exacerbating due to the impact consecutive droughts and lack of recovery for the last two years.</narrative>
