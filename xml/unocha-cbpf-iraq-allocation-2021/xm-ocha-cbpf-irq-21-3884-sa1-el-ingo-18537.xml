   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Improvement of basic needs fulfilment for acutely vulnerable communities through immediate income and enterprises financial support in Ninewa, Anbar and Kirkuk</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Based on PIN, CCR, SSDF and WEO experience in Emergency Livelihood in out-of-camp settings and on the rapid assessment developed in May 2021, the project aims at improving the fulfilment of basic needs for acutely vulnerable returnees and out of camp IDPs communities, in order to reduce the reliance on negative coping mechanisms increased during the current Covid19 economic crisis. This will be achieved through emergency livelihood support and access to income sources. 

As such, both immediate responses and long term solutions will be implemented, notably by cash for work (CfW) schemes to improve community critical infrastructures and financial and mentorship support to small businesses. Through an user-centered approach, the communities themselves will select the community projects to be rehabilitated or improved and financial support to small enterprises will be provided in cash, against in-kind, in order to put the participants in the condition of choosing themselves the kind of goods and tools needed. The type of business to be supported will be chosen through a market assessment while the mentorship curricula will be defined after a beneficiaries capacity assessment. 

These services will be combined with referral support, allowing the target communities to access a wide range of services provided by non-HRP, durable solutions and development actors, guaranteeing that the recipients, and especially returnees and out of camp IDPs, can sustain their wellbeing beyond the immediate support. Both beneficiaries of Asset replacement and CFW will receive referral support.

The total direct beneficiaries will be 351 individuals.

The target locations here below have been selected as they are among those with the highest inter-cluster assistance gap for 2020 (HRP Gap Analysis update on March 2021) and hosting the highest % of returnees and IDPs, many of them in hard-to-reach locations and in high severity conditions:
- Falluja (Anbar): CCR 
- Telafar (Ninewa): PIN and WEO
- Hawija (Kirkuk): SSDF and PIN 
The structure of one international and one local NGO per each governorate has been created in order to ensure on-the-ground coordination, monitoring and coherence in the approach. Also the 3 well-structured local NGOs will further support PIN and CCR through their field connections with local authority and security forces. The partners current presence in the target governorates will ensure coordination, not only with emergency actors, but specially with durable solutions and development actors (coordination with the Area Based Coordination - ABC - actors will be ensured). 

Through a gender mainstreaming approach, the activities designed will be able to improve women participation to the economic life of the community, while at the same time respecting the local social norms. Priority will be then given to female-headed HHs, households with people with disabilities, households with children, GBV cases, as according to the HRP, as they are those most at risk of relying on negative coping strategy and of protection violations. At least 40% of the beneficiaries will be women.

Capacity development of local partner will also be at the core of the project. By dedicating specific human and material resources to the capacity building of SSDF and WEO, the consortium will help increasing local capacity to respond to future livelihood-related matters and emergencies, ensuring that humanitarian assistance is increasingly based on local resources and capacities, and less on less on international actors. The attention to localization is reflected also on the budget division, where local NGOs will manage 38% of the total budget.

All activities will be implemented respecting COVID-19 precautionary measures. Also on protection, the CfW beneficiaries will be provided with training on safety on the job, first aid and Explosive Remnants of War (ERW) risk (still present in the target locations)</narrative>
