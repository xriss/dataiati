   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Multi-purpose cash assistance in Sinjar, Ninewa governorate and medical waste management in Dibis, Kirkuk for the most vulnerable out-of-camps populations.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Four years after victory over ISIS, humanitarian situation in Iraq remains complex. According to 2021 HRP, 4,1 million people require some form of humanitarian assistance, 2.4 million have acute humanitarian needs. IHF 1st Reserve Allocation strategy identified need gaps and underserved locations. In response, Polish Humanitarian Action (PAH) and Pekawa Organization (Pekawa) created a partnership to apply for allocated funds to fulfil unmet needs in Sinjar and Dibis districts. The partners will provide multipurpose cash assistance for IDPs and host community living in informal settlements on Mount Sinjar. Sinjar has suffered greatly during the war and still remains one of the most underserved locations in Iraq. Majority of IDPs and returnees live in tents, there is no infrastructure necessary for safe and dignified life. Additionally, people who have returned to Sinjar often face eviction threats as homeowners and landlords reclaim their property and business owners and local government reclaim private and public spaces. 
Based on SEVAT conducted in November and December 2021, partners will provide MPCA to 749 out-of-camp households in the informal settlements on Mt Sinjar. MPCA will be unrestricted in use, could be spent according to the wishes of a recipient. PAH and Pekawa are currently implementing a MPCA/Shelter project in Sinjar Mountain and current assessment recognized a significant gap in aid. The proposed project would be covering the remaining gap that cannot be covered from the current Partner&#x2019;s funding. One transfer will be 445,000 IQD/month/HH (5 000 IQD for the transportation fee). The frequency and value of cash assistance will be determined by the CWG guidelines and will depend on category assigned by the SEVAT (R2 - extremely vulnerable, R4 - catastrophically vulnerable). Partners will put great emphasis on proper communication about the selection criteria and project objectives to make sure they are clear to the targeted population. Cash will be distributed through financial service provider that PAH has already selected and has a framework agreement signed with. As a part of the capacity building of the local partner, PAH will support Pekawa in the tender procedure to select and sign a framework agreement with a Financial Service Provider for Pekawa. Additionally, partners will target Mt Sinjar population for their shelter reconstruction grants to support voluntary returns of the informal settlements population.
As part of the project, PAH will provide capacity building support to Pekawa Organization in various topics related to MEAL and protection mainstreaming including MPCA programming. There will be a capacity assessment of the local partner conducted, a tailor-made capacity building plan will be developed.
Additionally, Pekawa will provide health services in Dibis in Kirkuk governorate. The medical waste collection will be done in 22 healthcare facilities across the entire district. Pekawa will assist in segregation at generation points, daily collection and using incinerator facility. Pekawa will also train DoH staff on use of incinerator and autoclave as well as medical waste segregation at health facilities. The project contributes to the sustainable rebuilding of the Iraqi healthcare system by supporting Ministry of Health and Department of Health and filling the gaps of the deteriorated healthcare services in Kirkuk which result in increased exposure of IDPs, returnees, and host communities residing near healthcare facilities, medical staff, and patients to various hazardous wastes.
The planned services will be implemented in line with CWG and Health Cluster standards. The partnership will highlight cross-cutting issues by paying special attention to female-led households. 
Partner&apos;s activities will be regularly monitored by specialized MEAL staff who will ensure feedback and complaint mechanism are in place and being used by residents under accountability to affected populations principles.</narrative>
