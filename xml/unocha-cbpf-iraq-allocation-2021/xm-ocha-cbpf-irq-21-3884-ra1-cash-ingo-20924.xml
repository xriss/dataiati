   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Based on the partners experience in MPCA in out-of-camp settings, in the Governorates and on the rapid assessment developed in December 2021, the project aims at improving the access to basic needs and the protection of livelihood means for vulnerable (out of camp IDPs, returnees and 5% of host community, to ensure do not harm approach is respected) HHs, through a timely, context appropriate and gender sensitive MPCA while strengthening referral pathways and the response capacity of local actors. 

Both immediate responses (MPCA) and long term solutions (referral to durable solutions/Non HRP partners and capacity building to local partners) will be implemented. The MPCA support will come together with information sharing on Covid19 vaccine and a training on Financial health encouragement. It will give sustainability to the project, providing the beneficiaries with new knowledge and improving their capacity of manage their own current and future income. 
Strong will be the focus on referral mechanisms (especially livelihood for extremely vulnerable beneficiaries &#x2013; R2 - and protection for catastrophically vulnerable beneficiaries &#x2013; R3), both internally on protection and externally through durable solutions actors and whether possible, public social protection coordination.

The total direct beneficiaries will be 630 households, from the returnees, IDPs out of camp and host communities.

The target locations are among those hosting the highest % of returnees and IDPs out of camp living in critical shelters and have been divided according to the partners presence and capacity, as follow:
- Hatra (Ninewa): PIN 
- Samarra (SAD): SSDF
- Baquba (Diyala): WEO

The partners past and current experience (please check the file attached) in MPCA and protection will ensure coordination, not only with emergency actors, but specially with durable solutions and development actors (coordination with the Area Based Coordination - ABC - actors will be ensured). 

Through a gender mainstreaming approach, the activities have been designed to ensure the safe participation of women and PwDs, while at the same time respecting the local social norms. Priority will be then given to female-headed HHs, households with people with disabilities, households with children, GBV cases, as according to the HRP, they are those most at risk of relying on negative coping strategy and of protection violations. At least 50% of the beneficiaries will be women and 10% will be PwDs.

Capacity development of local partners will also be at the core of the project. By dedicating specific human and material resources to the capacity building of SSDF and WEO, the consortium will help increasing local capacity to respond to future MPCA-related matters, ensuring that humanitarian assistance is increasingly based on local resources. The attention to localization is reflected also on the budget division, where local NGOs will manage around 43% of the budget.

The project will also benefit from the strong relation between the 3 partners that are currently running together 2 other projects (one of which include and MPCA component) &#x2013; please check the 3 past experiences attachments. Finally, the sound coordination with the Cash Working Group the partners have will surely ensure a quality implementation of the project. PIN and WEO also took active role in the last workshop the CWG held to define its strategy. What learnt there will be put in practice during the implementation.</narrative>
