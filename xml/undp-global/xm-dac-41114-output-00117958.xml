       <narrative xml:lang="EN">Primary Outcome 1 &#x2013; Increased understanding of (and commitment to) strategies for multi-country HIV work with KPs by major donors and development cooperation partners, with particular attention to Africa

The project has already achieved two significant policy advocacy successes at outcome level, as follows:
1.	In April 2020, Sweden made a decision to allocate $9.5 million USD over four years committed to fund new Sub-Saharan African regional work with LGBTI populations (signed April 2020) &#x2013; covering 6 countries 
2.	In February 2020, Netherlands: $6.5 million USD over six years committed (contingent on approval of the final proposal currently in development) to fund new Southern African sub-regional work with young key populations &#x2013; covering 4 countries (Angola, Mozambique, Zambia and Zimbabwe)
Primary outcome 2 &#x2013; Increased political commitment and improved technical strategies to address HIV among KPs in priority countries, which in turn will increase the number of countries achieving 90-90-90 targets for specific key populations, in addition to achieving those targets on a country-by-country basis, by 2020
ECOWAS/WAHO - The project has achieved one significant success related to primary outcome 2, with the finalization, endorsement and publication of the &#x201C;2020-2025 Regional Strategy for HIV, Tuberculosis, Hepatitis B&amp;C and Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights among Key Populations in the Economic Community of West African States&#x201D;. The strategy was developed by the West African Health Organization (WAHO), with support from UNDP, working with WHO, UNAIDS and other partners.
SADC - UNDP, jointly with UNAIDS and UNFPA, continues to support the SADC Secretariat to monitor progress in implementation of the regional KP strategy for HIV and SRHR through the annual meeting of the NAC Directors and development of annual reports for submission to the Ministers of Health. UNDP is also supporting the Secretariat to develop a fast-tracking strategy for domestication and implementation of the regional strategy in the sixteen SADC Member States.
o	Output 2.1.1 &#x2013;Two (2) meetings to share lessons, challenges and risk mitigation strategies for regional programming, with an emphasis on translation of regional work to country impact; and to network and build alliances that could bid together for evidence-informed regional progamming support: UNDP convened a highly useful regional workshop from 27-28 February 2020 in Johannesburg, South Africa. It brought together 25 stakeholders with experience as evaluators, programme managers or implementers of regional or multi-country key population programmes, whether supported by the Global Fund or others, including representatives from Global Fund regional projects, donors, regional and multi-country civil society and key population organisations and networks and academics. The workshop objectives were to:
1.	Identify key lessons, challenges and insights from previous regional and multi-country work related to key populations, with particular attention to work in Africa;
2.	Contribute to the development of advocacy and communication strategies that could increase support for such work among potential donors; and
3.	Generate recommendations for current and future managers and implementers of similar work, including an anticipated forthcoming Sida-funded UNDP-convened initiative intended to promote rights and inclusion of sexual and gender minorities in Sub-Saharan Africa. 
The workshop resulted in the development of Lessons Learned from Regional Programmes with key populations in Africa. The second workshop has been pushed to 2021.  
o	Output 2.1.2 &#x2013; Programme-country-focused advocacy strategy and workplan (with designated roles for UN orgs, regional bodies like SADC and WAHO, and CSOs) to support appropriate and effective country-level KP investments: Informal influencing networks have now been established among multiple actors (multiple former regional Global Fund PRs, Regional Economic Commissions, UN orgs, NGOs) involved in KP regional work in Africa, for ongoing lesson-learning and joint advocacy. 
o	Output 2.1.3 &#x2013; Generic tool/s for country-level advocacy to support evidence-informed (and human rights based) HIV and TB programming for key populations in Africa developed (and disseminated to country partners for eventual adaptation and use): Due to COVID-19, the proposed tools will be finalized and published in 2021, once the rest of the programming has been completed.
o	Output 2.1.4 &#x2013; Professionally produced communication material (regarding the importance of KP work) developed to back up focused advocacy with programme countries in Africa: Due to COVID-19, the proposed communication material (video and print) will be finalized and published in 2021, once the rest of the programming has been completed.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">Regionally, with support from Bill &amp; Melinda Gates&#x2019; Foundation, during the year, UNDP in Africa achieved significant progress towards the project outputs and outcomes. Due to the COVID-19 epidemic, some strategies have been adjusted, with certain activities accelerated and others delayed to 2021. However, UNDP convened a highly useful regional workshop from 27-28 February 2020 in Johannesburg, South Africa. It brought together 25 stakeholders with experience as evaluators, programme managers or implementers of regional or multi-country key population programmes, including representatives from Global Fund regional projects, donors, regional and multi-country civil society and key population organisations and networks and academics. An analytical report, lessons learned from regional programmes with key populations in Africa, was developed and disseminated as a result of this workshop. Based on that report and building upon UNDP&#x2019;s earlier work in Africa focused on removing barriers for key populations to access HIV and related health services, during the year, UNDP also utilised the BMGF funding to address the intersection of key population/HIV issues in Africa with COVID-19, in line with UNDP&#x2019;s role as a co-sponsor of UNAIDS and as the technical lead of the United Nations (UN) framework for the immediate social and economic response to COVID-19. Supplementary activities and outputs already delivered to date, beyond what was anticipated in the project proposal, include:
&#x2022;	Development and submission of a concept note to the Global Fund for supplementary regional funding to address the impact of COVID-19 on key populations. 
&#x2022;	Development of a Legal Scan Tool for COVID-19 to ensure that the laws, regulations and policies are compliant with international law obligations and in line with evidence- and rights based good practices.
&#x2022;	In partnership with AMSHeR, design and implementation of a key population survey on impact of COVID-19 itself and lockdown measures, including quarantine.
&#x2022;	Facilitation of dialogue between the UNDP Uganda Country Office and BMGF to support that country&#x2019;s COVID-19 response that has led to a grant signed between BMGF and UNDP Uganda to support the Office of the Prime Minister of Uganda in developing a control room to manage the national response to COVID-19.
Specifically, under the BMGF Project, in 2021 results achieved include:
Under Primary Outcome 1:
&#x2022;	Review of evaluations and grey literature documenting results and lessons conducted. Summary, public report on lessons learned developed and submitted. Supplementary PowerPoint summarizing project progress and key lessons from previous work developed and submitted.
&#x2022;	Internal donor-focused advocacy strategy for UNDP use developed. Currently, this is being used as an internal and flexible tool given the rapidly changing context related to COVID-19.
&#x2022;	Given the context of COVID-19, UNDP decided to not focus for the time being on generic tools, concentrating instead on specific funding proposals and advocacy targets. Major proposals were developed and submitted to Sweden and Netherlands for KP/HIV work, which were both successful as noted above. Advocacy re Global Fund COVID-19 funding took place but without success. Additional outputs/deliverables have included provision of strategic inputs and policy dialogue with other donor countries.
Under Primary Outcome 2:
&#x2022;	WAHO: The project has achieved one significant success related to primary outcome 2, with the finalization, endorsement and publication of the &#x201C;2020-2025 Regional Strategy for HIV, Tuberculosis, Hepatitis B&amp;C and Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights among Key Populations in the Economic Community of West African States&#x201D;. The strategy was developed by the West African Health Organization (WAHO), with support from UNDP, working with WHO, UNAIDS and other partners. In 2021, UNDP and partners focused on developing a scorecard, corresponding indicators, and operationalizing the plan.
&#x2022;	UNDP, jointly with UNAIDS and UNFPA, supported the SADC Secretariat to monitor progress in implementation of the regional KP strategy for HIV and SRHR through the annual meeting of the NAC Directors and development of annual reports for submission to the Ministers of Health. UNDP is also supporting the Secretariat to develop a fast-tracking strategy for domestication and implementation of the regional strategy in the sixteen SADC Member States. On 24 May 2021, UNDP hosted a virtual multi-country meeting of Parliamentarians and parliamentary researchers from the SADC region, in partnership with the SADC Parliamentary Forum. The meeting focused entirely on LGBTI and other key population issues, emphasizing opportunities for Parliamentarians to advocate for domestic resource investments, to provide oversight of existing government programmes (whether externally or domestically financed), and to continue to advance protective legislation and policies.
&#x2022;	East African Commission - while UNDP had not initially anticipated focused work with the East African Commission (EAC) and the East African Legislative Assembly (EALA), an opportunity arose in early 2021 which UNDP followed up. Draft regional legislation on sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR) was brought to the relevant EALA committee, and UNDP was invited with UNFPA to provide technical assistance on the draft bill. UNDP produced a detailed technical review, including attention to key populations and the intersection of HIV and SRHR issues. UNDP also participated in a series of consultations and further reviews as the Bill went through successive drafts. As of the end of the project period, EALA was planning on country-level consultations, and a final version of the Bill will likely be considered in September or October 2021.
&#x2022;	Intermediate outcome 2.1:
o	In 2021, Rather than hosting a single &#x2018;2nd meeting&#x2019;, UNDP decided to organize a three-part workshop series over the last month of the project period, focused on developing an advocacy agenda with and for Key Populations in Sub-Saharan Africa. The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the African Key Population Experts Group (AKPEG) co-sponsored the series of three online workshops in May and June 2021, to identify and refine the most important advocacy messages to assist international donors and the UN, with a view to strengthening key population programming and addressing related institutional and capacity issues in Sub-Saharan Africa. The first workshop took place on 19 May 2021, and focused on The Programming Continuum: Successes, gaps and areas for improvement. The second workshop took place on 26 May 2021 and focused on The Institutional Environment: Governance and accountability, the roles of different stakeholders. The third and final workshop took place on 2 June 2021 and looked at Building consensus around Key Advocacy Messages. In total, the workshops brought together 61 people, including officials from national HIV programmes and health ministries, key population activists, donor representatives, technical experts, regional organisation officials, and UN staff.
o	Informal influencing networks have now been established among multiple actors (multiple former regional Global Fund PRs, Regional Economic Commissions, UN orgs, NGOs) involved in KP regional work in Africa, for ongoing lesson-learning and joint advocacy.
o	As a result of the three online workshops, a set of key advocacy messages, with a view to strengthening key population programming and addressing related institutional and capacity issues in Sub-Saharan Africa, was developed. The advocacy messages include the following: Recognize and build on successes that have already been achieved; Continue to invest in key population-specific funding; Invest in management of key population responses; Understand the importance of diversity; Promote key population-led responses; Replicate, adapt and continue to improve &#x201C;key population forums&#x201D;; Ensure key population competence; Invest in key population leadership; Level the playing field by addressing structural barriers and social norms; Build synergies between work on gender and HIV and work on key populations; Use regional and multi-country programmes to support countries and to insure against sudden policy shifts at country level; and Make sure no harm is done. A Discussion Paper on Developing a renewed advocacy agenda with and for Key Populations in Sub-Saharan Africa was also finalized.</narrative>
