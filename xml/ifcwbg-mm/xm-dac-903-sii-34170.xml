   <narrative xml:lang="EN">1) Extending the reach of critical telecommunication services to the broader population. At the time the license process commenced, 1 out of 10 people in Myanmar had a wireless phone.   By engaging in this project, IFC will be assisting a key client to extend the reach of the telecommunication infrastructure and services. 2) Increased competition in the sector will reduce the cost of service to the consumer.   IFC expects that with increased competition in the market, tariffs will fall by about 40% over the next 5 years, making mobile communication more affordable to the masses.  The average cost of a SIM has already dropped from US$250 to US$1.5 in a matter of months. 3) Job creation:  As at end of December 2014, out of the total workforce of approximately 1,000, more than 87% are nationals. 4) Support of local companies / SMEs: In addition to improving the reliability of voice and data services, the Company plans to utilize a network of SMEs/local companies as distributors throughout the country 5) Rural connectivity: With over 70% of the population living in rural areas, mobile penetration has been much lower than the national average. The Company hopes to significantly improve coverage and penetration.</narrative>
