   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The overall aim of the culture programme has been to contribute to the overall priorities of the Danish Ghanaian development cooperation of poverty reduction and democratization in Ghana as well as the Ghanaian government priorities in the GSGDA mentioned above. This should be done through the development of a vibrant and inclusive culture sector with progressive artists and creative industries that have a strong socio-economic potential as well as opportunities for children and youth to express themselves through cultural activities. Further, the culture program aimed at strengthening the cultural ties and relations with Denmark, which are rooted in a joint history. 

More specifically:

1. Promote the arts and culture as a medium for free expressions, debates and reflections on human and social issues as an integrated part of an open and pluralistic society

2. Strengthen the capacities of key Ghanaian cultural operators and institutions that work within creative industries as well as formal- and informal arts education for children and youth

3. Stimulate children and youths creativity and self-confidence as well as school and career opportunities through active involvement in arts training and education projects

4. Develop selected creative industries such as music festivals and animation films to create new jobs and income opportunities in Ghana

5. Promote mutual understanding and co-operation between the people of Ghana and Denmark around art and cultural activities

The programme had two components: 

1) &#xBF;Ghana Denmark Culture fund&#xBF; for smaller projects &#xBF; either local projects or exchange projects with Denmark.

2) &#xBF;Partnership projects&#xBF; - larger projects between Danish and Ghanaian organisations, which were identified from the onset of the culture programme. These should have a have a local component, implemented by the local partner, and technical assistance component covering the input from the Danish partner.</narrative>
