   <narrative xml:lang="EN">For the period 2014-2018, the cooperation between Denmark and ICRC was guided by the document &quot;Startegic considerations with regard to Denmark&apos;s co-operation with the Internatonal Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) 2014-2018&quot;

These considerations built on ICRC&apos;s Institutional Strategy for 2015-2018, where the overall goal is to address the need and vulberabilities of the victims of crisis - principally those affected by armed conflicts and armed violence. Another key element is to uphold and demonstrate the value of ICRC&apos;s neutral, independent and impartial approach in accordance with ICRC&apos;s six success factors (relevance; access; acceptance and reputition; organisation and processes; human resources capacity and mobility; competitive positioning). At the same time, the strategic goals reflect that ICRC must be able to adapt to the many challenges of the fast-changing and often unpredictable humanitarian landscape. 

ICRC will be guided by five broad interconnected strategic orientations over the period 2015-2018. These strategic orientations are identified as:

1. Strengten the ICRC&apos;s capacity to protect through law, operations and policy
2. Enhance the ICRC&apos;s distinctive response to growing needs
3. Secure the widest possible support for ICRC action
4. Contribute to a more significant response of the International Red Cross ad Red Crescent Movement to large-scale emergencies
5. Adapt and strengthen organizational capacities to sustain growth and the continued relevance of ICRC action

The first three strategic orientations can be regarded as the primary objectives, whereas orientations four and five can be seen as supporting and facilitating these humanitarian priorities. Each of the strategic orientations will be accompanied by a number of indicators that will measure the extent to which they have been acheived, both quantitatively and qualitatively, by the end of 2018. 

Denmark&apos;s priority issues in relation to ICRC are protection of victims of conflicts, promotion of respect for International Humanitarian Law, coordination and cooperation within the Movement as well as with the UN-system and other actors as well as the issue of accountability. These priorities are in line with previous Danish priorities and the strategic goals idenitfied by ICRC in the strategy for 2015-2018.</narrative>
