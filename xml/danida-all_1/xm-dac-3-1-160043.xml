   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The overall aim of IDSN programmes is to make an effective contribution to the promotion and protection of the human rights of those affected by caste-based discrimination and to promote effective measures for its elimination. The objective of the current programme is to ensure that caste discrimination is increasingly a visible part of the international human rights agenda and mainstream topics; some multilateral agencies and governments have increased accountability and policy measures on caste discrimination; and the voices and issues of affected communities reach the public and policy makers. Direct target groups are officials of governments, UN and EU institutions, politicians, the media and the general public. The ultimate beneficiaries of the programme are Dalit communities in South Asia.
IDSN pursues work in three main programme areas: 1) United Nations, 2) European Union and 3) Communication and Networking. IDSN facilitates information on Caste, Business and Human Rights, which is addressed programmatically by some of its members. 
Activities include 1) submissions to and liaison with UN human rights mechanisms and agencies in cooperation with Dalit civil society groups; 2) lobbying EU officials and parliamentarians, providing input to legislation, policy documents and resolutions; 3) maintaining the IDSN website as a resource hub on caste-based discrimination, issuing a monthly newsletter, promoting the issue with international media and supporting agendas of Dalit civil society through high quality information products; 4) dissemination of information on the interrelation of caste, business and human rights. In addition, the activities include organisational development in terms of development of a new strategy, revision or organisational model and increase organisational sustainability.</narrative>
