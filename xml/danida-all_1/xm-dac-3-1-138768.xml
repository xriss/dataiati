   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Domestic violence - including sexual abuse - against women and children and HIV / AIDS is a &quot;tandem problem &quot; which constitutes a major problem for South Africa.

Thuthuzela clinics, affiliated the provincial hospitals, are open 24 hours a day and provide women with integrated, competent, humane and secure reception and treatment. Most rape victims do not report the rape to the police because of pressure from family and community, and fear of the treatment they may face. The project will ensure that women receive assistance to report the assaults to the police and subsequently get the perpetrator prosecuted. In continuation of this, the project will implement prevention activities in local communities in order to reduce violence against women and children.

The project is innovative as it is based on the needs of the women in situations where they have been victims of sexual violence. The aim of the clinics is to get the many different actors such as police, health care, legal system, prosecutor authority etc. to coordinate their work in the function of the women&#xBF;s needs. Violence against women and children is a problem throughout the SADC region. The objective is therefore to introduce the Thuthuzela model to 5 other countries in the region. The project is working to ensure that Thuthuzela clinics will gradually be funded by South Africa&apos;s national budget.

The goal of Phase 2 is to create 12 new clinics by the end of December 2009. This deadline has now been postponed to June 2012</narrative>
