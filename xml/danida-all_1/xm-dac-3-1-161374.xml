   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Restoration of Agricultural Livelihood in Northern Uganda</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2" xml:lang="EN">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">After 20 years of armed conflict, Northern Uganda is still vulnerable and underdeveloped compared to the rest of the country. The RALNUC2 programme contributes to the implementation of the Government of Uganda&apos;s Peace, Recovery and Development Plan for Northern Uganda (PRDP). The programme seeks to: 1) increase agricultural productivity and marketing for returning internally displaced persons; and 2) increase public service delivery in Northern Uganda by providing budget support for the PRDP. More specifically the programme supports internal displaced persons who have returned to their farm land after having lived in camps for internally displaced persons for many years.

Originally, the programme applied a &quot;voucher-for-work&quot; (vfw) model, where farmers first participate in agricultural training and afterwards they worked on labour intensive rural infrastructure projects. The vouchers they earned could be exchange for agricultural inputs at certified input dealers shop. The vfw was later changed to a &quot;cash-for-work&quot; (cfw) model. The programme further supports the construction of rural infrastructure and contributes to the promotion of private sector input market. The support also included budget support to the overall plan for the reconstruction of Northern Uganda (i.e. PRDP). 

The expected results are: 1) At least 18,000 farmers (of which at least 50 % are women) receive agricultural training for two seasons, improve their agricultural production and gain access to higher value markets; 2) Increased capacity of District Farmers Associations to provide sustainable advisory and other agricultural related services; and 3) Significant agricultural related rural infrastructure projects constructed through cash-for-work.</narrative>
