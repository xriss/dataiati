   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Bandim Health Project has conducted population based research in Guinea-Bissau since 1978. Previous research on health interventions in low-income countries, particularly those to improve child survival, was based on assumptions about effectiveness rather than on studies of the real life effect of the health interventions on overall morbidity and mortality. For that, it is necessary to follow a total population through a health and demographic surveillance system documenting the major life events. 
The interest in vaccinations was limited because it was believed that vaccines would only save the &#xBF;weak&#xBF; children from dying from one specific infection; if saved from dying from measles they would probably die of something else and vaccination programmes could therefore not be expected to have a large effect on overall child survival. 
Over the years the Bandim Health Project has followed an urban population of around 100,000 and a similar rural population is followed in the interior through a national cluster sample of villages which are visited every 6 months. Using this demographic basis the project has educated a number of Guinean master and PhD studies as well as being the basis for strengthening the Danish resource basis in international health through a number of PhD projects. A series of master and PhD training projects was carried out, related to vaccinations, malaria treatment, cholera treatment, HIV and TB control, and maternal mortality.</narrative>
