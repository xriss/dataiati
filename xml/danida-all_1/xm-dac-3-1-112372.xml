   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Since 2004 support has been provided to the African Commission on Human and Peoples&apos; Rights and its Working Group on Indigenous Populations/Communities through the International Work Group on Indigenous Affairs. Since its establishment in 2001, it has undertaken several promotion activities that have brought the issue of indigenous peoples to the forefront of the Commission&apos;s agenda. As part of its mandate, the Working Group has prepared several important reports and documents on the rights of indigenous peoples. Moreover, the Working Group has undertaken 14 promotion, research and information visits to the following countries: Burundi (2005), Botswana (2005), Namibia (2005), Libya (2005), Republic of Congo (2005 and 2010), Niger (2006), Uganda (2006), Gabon (2007), Rwanda (2008), Democratic Republic of Congo (2009), Kenya (2010), Central African Republic (2007 and 2012) and Tanzania (2013). Since its establishment, the Working Group has also organised a number of sensitisation seminars: Cameroon (2006), Ethiopia (2008) and Congo (2011). These seminars serve to raise awareness about the rights of indigenous peoples and mobilise states and other stakeholders in protecting these rights.
For two years now, the Centre for Human Rights of the University of Pretoria, in collaboration with the Working Group and IWGIA, has been offering an intensive course on the rights of indigenous peoples in Africa, which is the first course of its kind in Africa. This is one of the strategies adopted by the Working Group to establish good partnership relations with higher learning institutions in order to encourage them to integrate the issue of indigenous peoples into their curricula.</narrative>
