   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Trade Development Support Program (TDSP), with fund support of about US$12.6 million, was financed from the proceeds of the Multi-donor Trust Fund in Trade Related Assistance in Cambodia (MDTF TRAC) in order to improve trade programs in Cambodia and, significantly, increase government&#xBF;s ownership in the formulation and implementation of trade policy. TDSP is one of the programs executed by the Ministry of Commerce and implemented by several line ministries, using the strategic frameworks and building blocks provided in the Trade Sector Wide Approach (SWAp) Roadmaps.
This First Quarter 2013 Report of the Trade Development Support Program (TDSP) provides the summary of the key initiatives and activities carried out under each program component and projects being carried out by the implementing agencies towards the achievements of the Project Development Objectives and the Trade SWAp.

DEVELOPMENT OBJECTIVES
TDSP&#xBF;s development objective is to increase RGC&#xBF;s efficiency in formulating and implementing effective trade policies. This is expected to lead to transparent and effective trade-related transactions, export competitiveness, and poverty reduction. The TDSP&#xBF;s focus is on establishing an enabling environment that reduces the risk to other sector - and product-specific trade promotion and development activities.
The Program contributes to two higher level objectives: (i) faster export growth and (ii) improved governance to enable private sector development. These two related objectives are in line with the NSDP and the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) of the World Bank.</narrative>
