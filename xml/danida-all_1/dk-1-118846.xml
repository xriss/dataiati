   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Capital city Dhaka is densely populated with approximately 14 million inhabitants. Dhaka is one of the fastest growing cities in the world and the requirement for water is therefore increasing. Safe drinking water is considered to be a precondition improvement of public health, which is essential for reduction of poverty and economic growth. 

The main water source for the city was ground water. However, the result of the high demands caused the ground water levels to decline between 1 and 2 meters per year, which is a serious environmental concern.

When the Government of Bangladesh prepared development plans for the water sector it was realised that surface water sources has be utilised in order to meet the demands even though costs of treating surface water are high. 
Subsequently, Dhaka Water Supply and Sewerage Authority (DWASA) requested Danida Business Finance to provide funding for Saidabad Water Project, Phase II. The objective of the project was to increase the capacity with 225.000 m3 per day serving 1 million people.

The construction contract was awarded to MT H&#xF8;jgaard A/S and the supervision contract to Grontmij A/S.</narrative>
