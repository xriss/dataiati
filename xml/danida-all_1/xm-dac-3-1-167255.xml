   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Health Sector Program Support to Tanzania, Phase IV, includes three components: 

(1) Health Tanzania Mainland
(2) Health Zanzibar
(3) HIV/AIDS. 

In practice, these are 3 various sectors, since Mainland and Zanzibar each have their own government, their own Ministry of Health and separate health strategies. The responsibility for coordination of the multi-sectoral HIV/AIDS work rests with Tanzania Commission for AIDS. Each of the components 1 and 3 provides 3 modalities: 

(a) Sector budget support/basket fund arrangements.
(b) Earmarked capacity-building. 
(c) NGO/Private sector cooperation. 

The nature and scope of the modalities are, however, different in the individual components as harmonization, alignment and sector cooperation is particularly well developed in component 1, less developed in component 3, and less robust in component 2.The overall objective for all three components is to contribute to a long-term improvement of the general health and well-being of all Tanzanians with special emphasis on women, children and vulnerable groups. 

This is fully in line with Tanzania&apos;s poverty reduction strategies for the mainland (MKUKUTA) and for Zanzibar (MKUZA), both of the governments&apos; health strategies and the MDG 2015 goals. Many years of involvement in the health sector, both in the Mainland and at Zanzibar have shown positive results in terms of reduced child mortality, reduction of infectious diseases (malaria) and better planning and cooperation on support to primary health care. There is still a need for both financial and technical support to further improve on health care, reduce inequalities and create basis for sustainable management and prioritization. 

The HIV/AIDS response is an engagement which focuses on support of the non-medical efforts at the local level through prevention and mitigation, and capacity building for strategic and long-term coordination of HIV efforts primarily through the Local Government structures.</narrative>
