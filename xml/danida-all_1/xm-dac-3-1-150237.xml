   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The conflict years devastated Kosovo&apos;s horticultural production and Kosovo is now importing a major part of its fruits and vegetable. The overall objective of the support is therefore to promote sustainable employment and income generation via three components: (1) development of the horticulture sector (2008-2012), (2) improvement of agricultural technical schools (2008-2014) and (3) improvement of access to credit in rural areas (2008-2014). The first component, which was completed in 2012, focused on the horticultural sector with emphasis on improved productivity including increased use of green houses, marketing and improved techniques. Furthermore improvement of the framework conditions were addressed. The activity was implemented by Switzerland as a delegated partner for Denmark. 

The second component focused on the modernisation of the technical-professional schools within agriculture and food processing. The earlier teaching approach and materials were outdated and the schools unable to deliver candidates with qualifications that fully matched the needs of the labor market. Four schools were selected with a view to improve the physical conditions, upgrade laboratory equipment, establishment of greenhouses for educational use, modernisation of teaching material, training of teachers, closer linkage with the labor market (e.g. through internships) as well as improving the schools&apos; capacity for self-governance. The component is implemented by Kosovo&apos;s Ministry of Education with support from among others two long-term Danida advisors. Delays due to public procurement.

The third component focuses on making loan capital available for farmers and rural entrepreneurs via the European Fund for Southeast Europe (EFSE). Lack of access to capital is a significant impediment for growth and employment in rural areas. Support is also given to EFSE&apos;s Development Facility which works with capacity building of banks and micro credit institutions.</narrative>
