   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Reconstruction of the Takoradi-Agona road and improved axle load control</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2" xml:lang="EN">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">From 2000-2002 Danida renovated Takoradi-Agona road, which is a main road stretch of central importance for business development around the port of Takoradi and trade with neighboring countries. The road was projected for 15 years of life, but had major damages after only five years, presumably due to excessive load from heavy vehicles.

The project consist of two components:

Component A
Support for the implementation of an improved control of overloaded trucks. Improvement and monitoring of controls on overloaded trucks will be implemented in close cooperation with all relevant development partners. Both the World Bank and the European Commission is planning to provide support for improving the control of overloaded trucks.

Component B
Renewed renovation of the road was done by the Ghanaian authorities and monitored by the Danish Embassy in Accra with the support of an external monitoring consultant. The project will be co-financed by the Ghanaian authorities. The Danish budget is 130 million and Ghana contributes with 50 million DKK</narrative>
