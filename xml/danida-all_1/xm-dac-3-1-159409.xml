   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The programme&apos;s overall goal is &quot;Greater sustainability in economic and social development and poverty alleviation in Vietnam through increased capacity of the country to adapt to climate change and increase mitigation efforts&#xBF;.

The programme has two components: one component supports the National Climate Change Programme, including the preparation of accurate climate scenarios, action plans for vulnerable areas and sectors, and the implementation of concrete adaptation activities, such as flood control and intrusion of saline water in agriculture. The Danish support is provided both centrally and in two provinces that are already affected of climate change.

The second component supports the National Energy Efficiency Programme, which aims to reduce energy consumption in industries, buildings and transport. The Danish support focuses on building a state accreditation for energy auditors and managers, as well as the identification and implementation of specific energy saving measures in industries and buildings.

A no-cost extension agreement of the programme for two years was signed in October 2013. The extension will align the programme to the full period of the National Programmes for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency until end of December 2015.</narrative>
