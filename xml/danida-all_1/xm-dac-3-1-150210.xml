   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In 2011, Danida committed DKK 160 million in support of regional economic integration in the East African Community (EAC). The purpose of the programme is to support implementation of outstanding elements of the Customs Union Protocol agreed in 2005 and contribute to implementation of the Common Market Protocol agreed in 2010. 

The primary areas of focus are on establishment of one stop border posts along the main corridors; harmonisation of standards; and establishment of common administrative systems and regulations. In addition, support is provided for civil society and private sector organisations to engage thme more in the process of regional economic integration.

The programme has the following components:
(1) Support for the EAC Partnership Fund;
(2) Support for trade facilitation, in particular reduction in transpiort times through Trade Mark East Africa (TMEA); 
(3) Support for increased business across borders in the EAC.

In addition, the programme includes funds for studies and smaller projects requested by the EAC Secretariat, as well as monitoring (a long term advisor) and reviews.</narrative>
