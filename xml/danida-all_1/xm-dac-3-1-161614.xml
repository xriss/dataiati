   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The overall aim of the project is to strengthen South Africa&apos;s technical skills in renewable energy by promoting development of a sustainable wind energy sector. The project&apos;s immediate objective is, through the support of a technical capacity development cooperation between a number of central suppliers of renewable energy sources in Denmark and South Africa, to contribute to the building of knowledge and technical skills related to renewable wind energy in ministries, technical education, research institutions, private sector organizations and private BEE ( Black Economic Empowerment ) project developers in South Africa.

The starting point of the project is development of higher technical skills in South Africa to identify and exploit the country&apos;s wind resources. This will be done through technical cooperation between Danish (Ris&#xF8; DTU) and South African institutions on the national renewable energy resource planning program, which is co-funded by UNDP.

The project will involve the construction of a number of national resource centers for wind energy : SANERI as nationally coordinated education and research coordination center for wind energy (wind spoke), University of Cape Town as a national resource center for mesoscale planning (climatological wind resource mapping), CSIR Stellenbosch as a national resource center for precision wind measurements, CSIR Pretoria as a center for micro-scale wind resource planning and teaching of the private business community and the education system in the use of wind data, and DME SAWEP as a center for national wind resource planning. A number of students will be assigned to the project, and UCT and CSIR will, when the project is finished as national resource centers, further educate students in wind resource planning and utilization. All partners in the project has approved the project purpose and description (project document).

The technical focal point of the project is development of a wind resource atlas.</narrative>
