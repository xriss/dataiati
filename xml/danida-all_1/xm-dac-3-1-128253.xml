   <narrative xml:lang="EN">WFP is UN&apos;s largest humanitarian organization. Its mission is to save lives and end hunger. In 2020, WFP distributed food to 114 million people and operated in 88 countries. WFP provided food assistance to 18 level 3 and level 2 crisis in 2020, which makes up 2/3 of WFP&#x2019;s operational interventions. WFP&#x2019;s food and nutrition assistance, whether in-kind or in-cash, plays a critical role in situations where food security is directly threatened by extreme loss of assets and livelihoods, where food systems are broken by conflict and where food gaps pose risks for increased malnutrition and mortality. WFP&#x2019;s food assistance is also a lifeline for populations on the move and for those excluded from traditional social protection systems, including refugees, migrants and internally displaced people.

Climate change creates a greater risk of hunger and breakdown of food systems. WFP works to make vulnerable people more climate resilient and food secure. WFP also works with forecast-based early action, relying on weather and other forecasts to trigger funding for predetermined action ahead of shock before it turns into disaster. 

Cash-based transfers make up 37% of WFP&#x2019;s food assistance, which makes it the humanitarian organization providing most cash-based support. In 2020, WFP received 8.4 billion USD in voluntary contributions from donors. The flexible and predictable funding provided by the Nordic donor countries, is valued by WFP as it strengthens WFP&#x2019;s ability to initiate operations in acute crisis. Denmark is the 17th biggest donor to WFP and the sixth biggest donor of flexible funding. Denmark and WFP have a strategic partnership agreement from 2020-2022. Furthermore, Denmark is member of WFP&#x2019;s executive board from 2020-2022. 

WFP has experienced extraordinary economic growth in the past five years, with an increase from 5.9 billion USD in 2016 to 8.4 billion USD in 2020. In 2020, Denmark contributed with 347 million USD, which includes 203 million USD in un-earm</narrative>
