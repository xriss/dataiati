  <description type="2" xml:lang="EN">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The aim of the budget support is to contribute to further poverty reduction. The percentage of the population living under the poverty line decreased from 51.7 % in 1991 to 28.5 % in 2006. However, due to population growth, the absolute number of destitute (living for less than 1 USD per day) has not decreased considerably. In order to enhance predictability, the idea is to initiate multiannual budget support agreements as opposed to one-year agreements in terms of goals &#xBF; and results orientation. An annual assessment of the progress will continue to take place. However, unlike before, the indicators indicating the achievement of objectives will remain the same indicators for three years at a time. Thus, the future system will include both indicators based on the achievement of concrete goals, and more long-term indicators showing results in terms of the development effect within the specific area. The three-year framework agreements will include crosscutting issues such as financial management, increased decentralisation, enhanced public management, prioritisation of the equality issue, enhanced environmental management etc. Indicators concerning selected sector specific conditions are expected to be agreed upon in order to ensure that serious challenges within a sector will receive increased attention. International experience suggests that keeping the number of indicators relatively low, is beneficial. The indicators that are to form the foundation for the annual assessment of whether to release full or partial disbursement, will all revolve around issues concerning the degree to which the government itself determines the pace of the reform process. The dialogue on budget support, will also provide an arena for dialogue concerning the country&#xBF;s political economic priorities, its sector policy, results in poverty reduction and reforms within the public sector.</narrative>
