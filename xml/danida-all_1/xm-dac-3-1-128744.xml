   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The fourth phase of sectoral programme support aims to strengthen the general efforts of the Mozambican Government to improve the health of the population and specifically to support intersectoral HIV/AIDS efforts. The national development goals that are directly supported by Danish efforts include an expansion of access to healthcare, a reduction in maternal and child mortality, as well as a reduction in the prevalence of HIV/AIDS and deaths from malaria and tuberculosis. Part of the Danish assistance is provided through joint funds to the National HIV/AIDS Council and the Ministry of Health. The programme foresees that this part will gradually increase over the programme&#x2019;s life cycle as financial and administrative management improves in the two beneficiary institutions. In addition, support will be given to capacity building in the National HIV/AIDS Council, as well as the Ministry of Health. This will take place both centrally in Maputo and in the provinces. Support for capacity building will focus on the following areas depending on needs: personnel management, planning and monitoring, financial management, integration of HIV/AIDS and operational research. Five internationally recruited advisors are affiliated with the program. The programme has two components: support for the implementation of the national health strategy and the national HIV/AIDS strategy.</narrative>
