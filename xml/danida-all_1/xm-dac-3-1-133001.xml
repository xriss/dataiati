   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Doha Development Agenda Global Trust Fund (DDAGTF) was established in 2002 to finance the implementation of the WTO Training Activities. The WTO technical assistance program consists of a mixture of short and medium-term training and capacity building activities such as seminars, symposia and conferences which focus on WTO rules and regulations. Examples of topics covered are dispute settlements, trade and environment, non-agricultural market access rules (NAMA), regional trade agreements, sanitary and phytosanitary measures (SPS), technical barriers to trade (TBT), trade-related intellectual property rights (TRIPS), trade in services and trade negotiations. The bulk of the training events consist of a few days&#xBF; training in Geneva, regionally or country-wise; but there are also longer courses of up to 3 months&#xBF; duration. As all training is provided free of charge for the participants, the expenditure is to a large extent travel costs, hotel, per diem etc. for the participants. Denmark has supported DDAGTF since the beginning and has provided DKK 2-3 million per year. The current commitment of DKK 9 million is disbursed as a three-year grant 2013-15 of DKK 3 million annually. The STDF was initiated at the Doha Ministerial Conference in November 2001 by five key multilateral organizations; the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE), the World Bank, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Trade Organization (WTO). The STDF is a global partnership that supports developing countries in building their capacity to implement international sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) standards, guidelines and recommendations as a means to improve their human, animal and plant health status and ability to gain or maintain access to markets. In 2013 the External Grant Committee approved a three-year commitment, allocating DKK 3 million per year from 2013 to 2015.</narrative>
