   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The establishment of a branch of the Misr Public Library (MPL) in a poor neighbourhood in Cairo is supported with reference to the Danish-Arabic Partnership Programme&#xBF;s objective to promote democratic development, increase the access to information as well as promoting exchange of experience and dialogue between the Arabic and the Western world. The project comprise the physical construction of the library branch, the procurement of materials and the operation of the library the first three years along with training of librarians.
The project is based upon a government agreement signed by Egypt and Denmark and ratified by the Egyptian parliament in 2007.

A project steering committee with representatives from all involved parties was subsequently appointed. As a part of the project the Danish Royal School of Library and Information Science implemented courses for librarians. An independent consultant followed the project&#xBF;s implementation from the start.</narrative>
