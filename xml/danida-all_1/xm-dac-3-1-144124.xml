  </title>
  <description type="2" xml:lang="EN">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Support shall be provided for the implementation of a public sector reform, the current phase of which runs from 2001 to 2011, as well as for the continued construction and development of Mozambique&apos;s national statistics. The funds are expected to be channelled through two joint funds, with DKK 51 million for the public sector reform and DKK 35 million for statistics, respectively. This is considered a continuation of ongoing aid to the two areas.

In addition, funds have been allocated for the establishment of an independent investigation and research institute amounting to DKK 5.0 million and DKK 4.5 million for technical studies and analyses, reviews, performance audits and evaluation, as well as a small pool of unallocated funds, which are expected to be used for actions that are outside the public sector&apos;s remit but which supports the reform of the public sector or statistics.

The long-term aim of the project is to increase and streamline public sector services and provide a credible statistical basis for decision-making. 

The immediate aim of the project is to support the development of effective public institutions with competent and motivated employees providing increased and better services to the population and the private sector, as well as to improve the statistical basis for the overall planning and service provision to society.</narrative>
