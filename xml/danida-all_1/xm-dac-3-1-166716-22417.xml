   <narrative xml:lang="EN">DanChurchAid will contribute to the fulfilment of the fundamental human rights of the world&#xBF;s poorest and most marginalised people. Partnership is a founding principle of DCA, not just a way of working but fundamental to our values and identity. Our emphasis on working in partnerships is our most important comparative advantage to make the changes we wish to see in the world. We want to strengthen partners to become stronger civil society actors in their own contexts. The following five global goals outline the thematic focus where DCA will work: the right to participate for democratic, inclusive and accountable governance; the right to food through better access to sustainable livelihood activities; the right to basic health services with particular focus on the fight against HIV and AIDS; the right to a life in dignity and thus the right to humanitarian assistance and protection; the right to protection against the negative effects of landmines, cluster munitions and other explosive remnants of war. DCA&#xB4;s international engagement is based on strategic and sustainable support in 11 focus countries, and some additional regional engagement. We have made a conscious choice to harness our significant resources behind local partners in a limited number of program types and focus countries. A focus country is where a DCA Regional Office is located and is the center of DCA&#xBF;s engagement in the region. This focus is maintained to ensure that long-term support is maintained within the country to facilitate sustainable institutional and social changes.
DCA is committed to ensure that human rights standards and principles, including gender equality, are an integral part of all its efforts. DCA supports partners that facilitate the empowerment of poor women and men to know and act upon their rights; and also partners that through advocacy and/or capacity-building ensure that governments and other actors live up to their obligations and responsibilities to the poor.</narrative>
