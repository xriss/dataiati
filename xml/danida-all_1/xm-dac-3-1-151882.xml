   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The programme will run from 2008-2011 with an allocated budget of DKK 75 million. The purpose of this programme is to promote good governance, democracy and human rights in Tanzania. The programme is based around the following three components: a) Democratisation and domestic accountability, b) Human rights and access to justice, c) Public sector management.

The first component is supported through various channels. Firstly, Denmark will help finance a programme developed by UNDP, which aims at strengthening Tanzania&apos;s democratization process. The goal of this project is to enhance the capacity of democratic institutions, including Parliament, the Election Management Bodies and the political parties. Secondly, support is provided to the Research &amp; Education For Democracy In Tanzania (REDET) programme at the University of Dar es Salaam, which provides research and education on democratic politics and good governance. Thirdly, the media will be supported through a Media Fund and through the Media Council of Tanzania. The key objective of these organizations is to strengthen investigative journalism and improve the freedom of the press.

Support to the second component will partly be channelled through a basket fund which financially assists the Government&apos;s Legal Sector Reform Programme. Moreover, Denmark will collaborate with two NGOs (NOLA and WLAC) who provide legal aid to marginalized groups on mainland Tanzania. Denmark will also continue to support the Zanzibar Legal Service Centre, which promotes human rights and provides legal aid to the people of Zanzibar.

The third component is targeted the Public Financial Management Reform Programme, which improves public financial management structures and processes, including budgeting, expenditure management, debt management, fiscal forecasting and auditing processes. Thus this component strengthens the foundation of other support programmes, especially general budget support.</narrative>
