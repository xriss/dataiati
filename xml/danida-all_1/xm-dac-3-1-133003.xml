   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Enhanced Integrated Framework for Trade-Related Technical Assistance to the Least Developed Countries (Enhanced Integrated Framework, EIF) is a collaboration between the 49 least developed countries, some twenty donors and eight multilateral actors in trade and development: World Bank, UNDP, the World Trade Organization (WTO ), the UN Conference on Trade and development (UNCTAD), the IMF, the International Trade Centre (ITC), UNIDO and UNOPS. The partnership was established in 1997 as part of the WTO action plan to ensure better participation of the least developed countries (LDCs) into the multilateral trading system. The aim is to promote the integration of trade policy in developing countries&apos; national development strategies and to contribute to a coordinated provision of trade-related technical assistance to LDCs. Cooperation is built around a first phase consisting of 1. Identification and strengthening of national unity, to ensure that trade is integrated in all relevant national development strategies and plans and 2. An analysis (Diagnostic Trade Integration Study) of the country&apos;s barriers and untapped potential for increased international trade. The study includes recommendations of concrete actions in a so-called Action Matrix. In the second phase (Tier 2) will be implemented specific projects and activities that have been identified and prioritized in the first phase.</narrative>
