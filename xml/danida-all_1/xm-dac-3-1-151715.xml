   <narrative xml:lang="EN">B2B: Main Project between Biokube A/S nd Bioland Ghana Ltd assembling distribution marketing , installation of Biokube waste water treatment facility. The original objective were expected to be carried out under three phases

1.	To set-up a joint venture Company to establish a waste water treatment production facility
2.	Training of local company&#xBF;s ( Bioland) staff in relation to installation, servicing, maintenance Biokube products and well as marketing and sales training
3.	Testing of single-house wastewater treatment unit and preparation of production facilities for this as well as testing another product to combat operational problems in overload waste water treatment plants
Due to various challenges in business environment as well as inability of the partners to strengthen the partnership financially, the partners quest to set up the production plant between 2010 and 2013 did not materialize however during this period the partners succeeded in promoting the product to potential customers which resulted in signing three major contacts. Consequently, the partners revised the project objective to focus on transfer of know-how in installation, servicing and maintenance on commercial projects secured. Additionally, training will be provided in marketing and sales. This consequently resulted in reduction of budget to approximately DKK1.7 million.</narrative>
