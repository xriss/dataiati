   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Social Sector Programme Support represents Danish support to Health and Education of Bhutan. It follows the support to the health sector of 1990 and education of 2003. The overall objective is poverty reduction from 23% to 15%. Component 1 (107m, 76 %) is sector budget support to the social sectors assisting the Bhutanese government in the implementation of its health and education initiatives. The funds being fungible are subject to national planning, budgeting, implementation, monitoring and evaluation process. Sector budget support has been provided under a number of assumptions, including the continued high priority to the social sectors (over 20 % of public current expenditure), and that through decentralization will reach out to the most remote areas with basic services and ensuring equal access to health and training facilities. Equal access to education is promoted by the guarantee of 10 years of free education in Bhutan&apos;s constitution. Component 2 (15m) consists of support for technical training. This is seen as an important area due to a number of challenges expected to play a significant role in the future: increased unemployment, an increasing number of young people with limited skills and a private sector with limited vocational skills. The primary focus of the component has been the development and quality assurance of the technical education in order to increase young people&apos;s job prospects. Component 3 (18m DKK) provides a supporting role to the program with funds for technical assistance, the share of program administration and cost of audits and other studies. Of these, 3.8 million reallocated to Component 1 (SBS) in support of the reconstruction of schools and hospital facilities destroyed by 2009 and 2011 earthquakes.</narrative>
