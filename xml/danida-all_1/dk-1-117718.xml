  <description type="1" xml:lang="EN">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In 2005 Uganda hosted more than 220,000 refugees, of which 170,000 were from Sudan. The refugees were primarily located in the Northern and North-Western border between Uganda and Sudan. 

The Danish Support to Refugee Hosting Areas (DS-DAR) commenced in 2006 and contributed to the implementation of Uganda government&#xBF;s development strategy for refugee hosting areas. The overall goal was to improve the standard of living of the host communities. The Office of the Prime Minister established a secretariat (DAR Secretariat) which was responsible for implementing the strategy. The Danish assistance was threefold: 1) Institutional support to the DAR secretariat; 2) improving the agricultural livelihoods (assets, capacities and activities) of the target population, particularly refugees and host communities; and 3) supporting Danish NGO projects within the areas of food security, disaster management and risk reduction capacity, democracy, education, health and repatriation. These activities were implemented by Danish Red Cross, Danish Refugee Council and Danish Association for International Development Cooperation (Mellemfolkeligt Samvirke).</narrative>
