   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Uongozi School project was founded in 1998 and is run by the East African Uongozi Institute (EAFUI). EAFUI is owned jointly by the University of Dar es Salaam, Makerere University (Uganda), and University of Nairobi. The main goal of the institute is to foster civic and intellectual leadership qualities in young people, and to promote policy making processes informed by African as well as global perspectives. The participants receive a combination of training on problem-solving techniques, critical thinking and the values of team work, whilst participating in current theoretical debate within academic disciplines as well as covering current national and regional issues. EAFUI&apos;s goal is to create a well-informed, dynamic, imaginative and innovative breed of leaders in the East African region, who will be able to face the challenges of the 21st century and promote democratic governance and self-reliant development. The Uongozi School project takes place every summer for six weeks and can be followed by a three month internship in relevant institutions in the East African Region, for example Parliament, state departments, journalistic organisations, NGOs, research institutes, etc. As of the start of phase 5, EAFUI has now trained up to 542 students since it began in 1998, and of these 268 have been female and 274 male. The selection of participants has remained gender sensitive throughout each yearly programme. The objective remains to foster a breed of dynamic and broad-minded young leaders in East Africa.</narrative>
