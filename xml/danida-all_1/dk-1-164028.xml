   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Following the agreement with the Yemeni government in 2004 regarding the Yemeni-Danish
Partnership Programme as part of the Danish &quot;Partnership for Progress and Reform&quot;, TAO wasestablished to assist the Steering Committee in the development, implementation and monitoring of the five thematic programme areas: democratisation, local democracy, human rights, women&apos;s rights and free media.
The overall goal of the Yemeni-Danish Partnership Programme during the project period 2009-2010 is to continue its support to the process of reform in Yemen and to strengthen the Danish-Yemeni dialogue and mutual understanding. In conjunction to the above, the activity of TAO in the development, implementation and monitoring of the sub-programmes is the following:
assisting local partners in their cooperation with Danish partners, ensuring sound communication between Danish and Yemeni partners and organisations and coordination with
other donors involved in the same thematic areas as the Yemeni-Danish Partnership
Programmes.

In 2009, due to the deteriorating security situation, the cooperation with Yemen was restructured. The Danish head of the advisory office was recalled in October 2009, but a local presence is maintained by a programme officer with an extensive network.</narrative>
