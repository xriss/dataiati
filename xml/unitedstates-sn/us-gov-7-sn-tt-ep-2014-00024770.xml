   <narrative xml:lang="EN">To save lives, alleviate suffering, and minimize the economic costs of conflict, disasters and displacement. Humanitarian assistance is provided on the basis of need according to principles of universality, impartiality and human dignity. It is often organized by sectors, but requires an integrated, coordinated and/or multi-sectoral approach to be most effective. Emergency operations will foster the transition from relief, through recovery, to development, but they cannot and will not replace the development investments necessary to reduce chronic poverty or establish just social services.</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">Senegal is one of the key partners of the United States on the African continent, and has an unbroken history of peaceful political transition since independence in 1960. The country has made marked progress in key health indicators and in ensuring access to education, but economic growth has lagged. A growing population of young people is demanding meaningful employment opportunities, education, and high quality social services. The Government of Senegal (GOS) understands that failure to satisfy these demands could lead to instability and emigration. U.S. assistance seeks to support the delivery of high quality health services, improve the quality of and access to basic education, increase agricultural productivity to accelerate economic growth, strengthen democratic governance, and provide training to the Senegalese armed forces. The regionally funded Trade Africa activity, a partnership between the United States and sub-Saharan Africa to increase internal and regional trade within Africa, is expanding trade and economic ties between Senegal and its neighbors and helping Senegal to reap the benefits of the African Growth and Opportunity Act. Senegal will also benefit from regionally funded Power Africa activities as the high cost and inadequate supply of power is a major constraint to growth.</narrative>
