   <narrative xml:lang="EN">FGG CCC ToC 2: Improved Trade and Investment</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">CCC will push for trade agreements to ensure that ILO Conventions on employment relationships, wages, gender specific labour issues, freedom of association etc. are improved, adopted and respected thus improving working conditions in garment/sportswear supply chains. This will impact governments in the south and north as well as major brands affected by such agreements. It will provide southern partners with knowledge and improved capacity for lobbying for the implementation of labour clauses in trade agreements, accessing and enlarging the space and influence to negotiate the inclusion of such standards as well as involvement in the consequences of agreements (and non-compliance of) on garment workers. Discrimination and unequal pay are rife within the industry. CCC works with many women&apos;s groups and specifically supports capacity building of female worker representatives/organisers. We will ensure that gender specific issues are highlighted in discussions of labour clauses. CCC has good relations with many Dutch embassies/consulates as well as access to Dutch members in the European Parliament. These may be called upon to support our partners in producing countries as well as in regional/global lobby efforts in this dossier. CCC will undertake an initial mapping of opportunities for leverage, potential allies and short/long term objectives on specific agreements/countries to gather areas of concern for partners in producing countries and capacity needs and identify at least two key areas of work for following years. A mapping will also look at regional economic forums such as ASEAN, APEC &amp; regional/bilateral trade agreements in the context of CCC&apos;s Global Strategic Framework (e.g. living wages, OSH, freedom of association) and ensure agreements do not erode labour rights progress. CCC will lobby and demand that investor protection clauses do not undermine existing worker protections. Pursuing public procurement practices that supports improvements. Plans for future lobby of OECD governments to support labour positive reforms. CCC will participate and lobby at relevant events (UN, ILO, OECD) and Multi-stakeholder initiatives (MSIs) where effective. CCC will incorporate in a smart way other CCC work and lobby efforts to ensure our capacity building and lobby work is coherent and globally balanced with partner input. We will develop new partnerships to investigate opportunities for and obstacles to such work. We will form an international expert group in relation to trade agreements to develop a unified Network strategy. CCC will support workers&#x2019; understanding of power relations in global supply chains through effectively sharing information. CCC will be sharing information within the CCC &amp; larger network on mechanisms/impact of GSP provisions, and consulting with other organisations to determine appropriate opportunities. We collaborate with global network(s) of pro-labour lawyers to build coordinated campaigns around legal demands for remedy, prevention, protection &amp; corporate accountability and explore possibilities for legal action. At the national level, (support efforts to) CCC forms coalitions among different trade unions, other forms of worker organisations and NGOs to develop demands and strategies for pressuring governments.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">CCC invited members of EP to visit Sri Lanka to directly hear from partners, in prep for GSP renewal and the Sri Lankan Minister of Labour gave the commitment to share 50 percent of the GSP benefits to the workers. The promise of the minister will need to be monitored in 2018 for fulfillment (1) CCC lobbied the European Union to start a trade investigation under the GSP &apos;Everything but Arms&apos; scheme &#x2013; which allows Bangladesh preferential access to the EU market. SKC actively involved in this lobby work, including organizing a twitter-storm at EP members to support the call for a trade investigation on Bangladesh. The EU did not launch a trade investigation yet, but it remains on the radar of the policymakers. Several MEPs are pushing for stronger actions, although the EC has resisted so far to take non-symbolic measures. The EC acknowledges Bangladesh violates terms, and has condemned Bangladesh, but without changing the trade status so far. (1) CCC lobbied the European Union to urge the government of Bangladesh to improve the labour situation before the annual review of the Sustainability Compact between Bangladesh, the European Union and the International Labour Organization (ILO). When the review took place, Bangladesh&apos; lack of progress remained without repercussions. CCC is urging the European Commission to stop extending deadlines and act upon its warnings to the Bangladesh government. As in the GSP result, the Commission sends threatening letters and condemnations, but stops short of taking punitive measures. (1) CCC joined the GSP Reform Platform, a coalition to work on GSP Midterm Review to make sure input from trade unions and labor rights activists is heard in the process. CCC put the transparency of the progress of countries on the agenda, clarified the role that CSOs have to play in the GSP countries in the review, and developed views on what the consequences should be if countries do not make enough progress.

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">CCC and partners continued to give input and strategize on GSP/GSP+ obligations. In September CCC organised a two days consultation meeting in Nepal, in which 21 unions and NGOs from Pakistan, Bangladesh, Cambodia, Nepal, Myanmar and Sri Lanka came together to learn and mutually develop capacities from GSP/GSP + action experiences, and develop strategies to lobby the EU and governments. A joint statement was worked out as a result of this meeting which will be used in the following year after sign-off by the unions and NGOs. The EU&#x2019;s GSP/GSP+ (Generalised Scheme of Preferences) reduces or fully removes import duties from products coming into the EU market from LLMICs that implement international conventions related to human rights, labour rights, protection of the environment and good governance. Countries where such rights and practices are being violated are liable to lose their GSP/GSP+ status, something which offers lobbying opportunities against such violations and has the potential to advance human and labour rights, as well as promote civic space. [20] CCC member organisation in Pakistan organised a lobby and advocacy conference in Islamabad to pressure their government on the GSP+ commitments which also strengthened other NGOs and Unions understanding on the GSP+ requirements and the way to use this for promotion of labour and human rights in Pakistan. This is a follow-up conference organised by CCC member at the country level after the CCC meeting in Nepal on GSP. CCC inputs on GSP enabled the member to organise this meeting. [1]</narrative>
