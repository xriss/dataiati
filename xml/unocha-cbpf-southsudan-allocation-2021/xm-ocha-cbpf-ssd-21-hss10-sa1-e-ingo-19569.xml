   <narrative xml:lang="EN">ENVELOPE 1: Improve access to quality education for vulnerable food insecure and flood affected populations in Ulang County , Upper Nile State, South Sudan.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">South Sudan has experienced many shocks that has left millions of people in dire need of humanitarian assistance. According to OCHA humanitarian snapshot May 2021, around 8.3 million people are in need and vulnerable. 7.2 million people are highly food insecure and thus needing humanitarian assistance (OCHA Humanitarian Snapshot may 2021). Ulang County was among the counties that were highly affected by the floods that destroyed school infrastructure and WASH facilities in schools and also schools were affected by closure due to COVID 19 pandemic. The county has high number of untrained volunteer teachers who are not paid salary by government. The schools are also in dire need of teaching and learning materials.

This project will address these critical issues by ensuring that flood affected highly insecure populations in Ulang County have access to education services through safe opening of learning institutions.  This will be achieved by ensuring that 500 children and youth (B=300, G=200)  have equitable access to education services by construction of 2 TLS (4 classrooms in Rirnyang and Nyerkueth primary  schools) and rehabilitation of 6 classrooms (in  Gawagn  primary school and Ulang Secondary School), improving the WASH situation in schools by construction of 12 blocks (12 stances) of emergency latrines in Ulang Secondary School, Rirnyang Primary School, Nyerkueth, Yomding, Goweng/Kewer, Doma, and Buong primary schools including hand washing facilities that will curb the spread of COVID 19. School supplies to the schools that will be supported by this project will be distributed as well as training teachers and PTAs and paying teacher incentives. This will ensure that learners go back to school and get the basic education. 14 schools (12 primary schools, 1 secondary school and 1 ALP) will be targeted in payams of Doma, Kormout, Ulang and Yomding.  
A total of 7987 children will be targeted to access the 14 schools. to have access to quality education services. All the programming will put in place accountability to affected populations mechanisms and feedback complaints mechanisms to ensure that the ADRA is accountable to the affected populations by formation and trainings of PTAs who will be the link between ADRA and the community during the project implementation. 
The project will target 8345 beneficiaries  (232 Men 126 Women 4836 Boys and 3151 Girls) vulnerable and affected populations in Ulang County.</narrative>
