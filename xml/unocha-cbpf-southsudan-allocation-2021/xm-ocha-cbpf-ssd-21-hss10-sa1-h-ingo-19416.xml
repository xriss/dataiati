   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Envelope 1, Envelope 2, Improve access to quality health and MHPSS services for populations in need in Bor South, Twic East, and Duk counties</narrative>

  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project aims to strengthen the capacity of the public health system in delivering quality primary health care, with integrated SGBV, and MHPSS services. In close collaboration with the County Health Departments (CHDs) and State Ministry of Health (SMoH), MdM will support 13 health facilities across Bor South, Duk, and Twic East counties by providing regular supervision, monitoring, and training to the health and MHPSS/GBV personnel and supplying the necessary drugs, equipment, and materials. Through partnership with Sudan Medical Care (SMC), an experienced local NGO in the implementation area, and SMoH/CHD, critical health facilities have been chosen based on needs and selection criteria including unsupported health facilities in at-risk or left-out communities. Vulnerable populations, including IDPs and remote, hard-to-reach communities, will be supported through mobile medical units (MMUs) in Bor South and Duk counties. MHPSS and SGBV services will be integrated through counselling services at PHCC and hospital level in all three counties with awareness-raising and referral activities at community level, complemented by a remote MHPSS hotline.
 
The approach to the intervention is focused on integration of activities between MHPSS, SGBV, Health, and Nutrition with development, implementation, and strengthening of referral pathways. The community level engagement, as well as the collaboration of CHDs, embeds the project into local structures to contribute to durable results and impact. The intervention design provides an inclusive, accessible, and holistic approach to healthcare, with a priority on linkages to other sectors and on the ground coordination with relevant stakeholders.

This project is covering two envelopes. Bor South, Duk, and Twic East have been identified as IPC-level 4 counties and this project is designed to support the most vulnerable people being impacted by the food insecurity situation. For Envelope 1, recent needs assessments have identified the crucial areas to strengthen the health and MHPSS support to people in need of assistance. Bor South county also hosts one ex-PoC IDP settlement, which has been lacking quality health services over the last year. Following a needs assessment, this project will cover the Bor ex-PoC site with integrated health and MHPSS services under Envelope 2.

The breakdown of targeted beneficiaries per location is as following:
- Bor South county: 34.433 people (17.560 women, 16.872 men)
- Twic East county: 10.176 people (5.190 women, 4.986 men)
- Duk county: 14.939 people (7.619 women, 7.320 men)

During the project implementation, MdM and local partner SMC will closely coordinate with the local authorities to assure that the health needs are covered. Monthly coordination meetings well be held between MdM and CHD in each location to discuss progress of the project, challenges to implement activities, and new needs. Also, MdM commits to participate in coordination meetings with SMoH at least once in two months to discuss the project at state level. MdM participates in each Health Cluster meeting at national level where updates on priority counties (including Bor South, Duk, and Twic East) are discussed. 3Ws will be submitted to the Health Cluster on a monthly basis to report on the project&apos;s results. MdM also attends all state Health and Inter-Cluster meetings held by WHO and OCHA to update partners on the ongoing activities and challenges. The RRC Commissioner will be informed about the kick-off of the project and shall receive copies of the periodical produced reports</narrative>
