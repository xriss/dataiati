   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Envelop 2: Provision of comprehensive case management and mental health psychosocial support services for UASC and OVC affected by Humanitarian crisis in Juba and Mangalla, CES- South Sudan.</narrative>

  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In response to the continued growing humanitarian crisis in South Sudan, Confident Children out of Conflict (CCOC) is proposing the following interventions to expand lifesaving Child protection response services to vulnerable populations in Juba ex Poc 1, Juba ex Poc 3 and Mangalla IDP camps -Central Equatorial State. The complexity of the operating environment requires multifaceted approaches that are tailored to each location including: Family Tracing and Reunification (FTR), Community Based Psychosocial Support (CBPSS), Mental Health Psychosocial Support (MHPSS) and maintaining a functional interim care Centre (ICC) for Unaccompanied And Separated Children (UASC) and Other Vulnerable Children (OVC) in need of Protection response services in Central Equatoria State. The proposed one year child protection intervention is designed to: Increase UASC, Foster families and community&#x2019;s access to life saving child protection services i.e. FTR, case management, MHPSS services through Child Friendly Space (CFS) including CBPSS. Integrate protection monitoring and mainstreaming into the Child Protection interventions to improve the overall context analysis and integration of protection principles in the intervention that will be scaled up to respond to the identified needs. Enhance understanding and analysis among staff and communities and other actors on the child protection context and needs. CCOC will utilize and increase on the existing internal response capacity to staff and be able to provide timely, effective and efficient Child protection services during the one year response in Central Equatorial State. This will offer an opportunity to provide much needed services in Mangalla IDPs camp, Juba ex Poc 1 and ex Poc 3 with limited child protection services. The child protection intervention has been specifically designed to be integrated within CCOC&#x2019;s existing child protection program in Juba City, which are aimed at strengthening community based protection mechanisms (CBPM) and facilitate access to information and appropriate services. Through establishing Community Protection Committees (CPC) will provide a platform to form Community Based Child Protection Mechanisms (CBCPMs) and Child Rights clubs (CRC&#x2019;s) to facilitate the identification of and response to child protection concerns, the development of community based mitigation plans, prevention messaging (e.g. on forced recruitment, early marriages etc.) and child protection surveillance mechanisms. In addition, the CBCPMs will identify and refer vulnerable children in need of individual support. 
Operate three community based safe healing and PSS spaces for children that facilitate their recovery, restore a sense of normalcy, and promote their cognitive, physical, social and emotional development and provide parenting support. The project will engage youth to provide peer support, recreational activities and referral to other multisector support services as an entry point to develop future intervention with Children Associated with Armed Forces and Groups (CAAFAG) and school dropouts. This proposed child protection project will continue to strengthen the resilience of Children, caregivers and their families. CCOC&#x2019;s own experience testifies to post-traumatic distress occurring in high numbers in crisis-affected children who need to be assisted to use and rely on adequate coping mechanisms, which include developing self-confidence and expression of emotions. An integrated approach to ensure broad community support for psychosocial support to both children and their caregivers is critical to ensure children are adequately cared for. 8,500 beneficiaries from the IDP camps in Juba- Central Equatoria are targeted with 2,833 in Juba ex Poc1, 2,834 in Mangalla IDP camp and 2,833 in Juba ex Poc 3. CCOC&#x2019;s ongoing work through child friendly spaces will continue but this project will ensure they are more deeply rooted and owned by the IDPs.</narrative>
