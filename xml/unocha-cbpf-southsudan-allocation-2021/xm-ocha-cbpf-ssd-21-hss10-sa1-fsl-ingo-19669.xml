   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Envelop 1: Emergency Livelihoods Protection and Cropping support for vulnerable households in Aweil South , Panyijiar, Mayom and Abiemnhom Counties of South Sudan.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The proposed intervention seeks to improve the food and nutrition situation of people in need and high food insecurity (IPC 3 and worse) in Aweil South County of Northern Bahr el Ghazal as well as in Panyijiar, Mayom and Abiemnhom Counties of the larger Unity State. WHH will target 21,741 vulnerable households (comprised of 130,443 individuals) in 4 counties for support in vegetable production. One member per household will be trained in agronomic practices, i.e. 21,741 persons. Harvest will however benefit all 130,443 household members including 19,723 men, 21,237 women, 46,398 boys, 43,085 girls. Since women are engaged in food preparation at household level, they are primarily targeted for vegetable production to ensure the produces are also used for household diets. In addition to that 8,000 vulnerable households (comprised of 48,000 individuals) will be supported with fishing kits to improve access to diversified foods. 8,000 persons (mostly men 1 pers./HH) will be trained in improved fishing practices, but the catch will benefit all 48,000 household members including 7,258 men, 7,814 women, 17,074 boys, 15,854 girls. Depending on the location and the vulnerability of the selected households/household members an at least partial overlap in the target group for vegetable production and fishing activities is planned and anticipated to increase dietary diversity. All targeted households will benefit from the mass sensitization campaigns, it is expected that at least 1-3 household members pick up the kits during the distributions and that they will share messages with the other household members. 
The communities in the 4 counties are in need of rapid assistance that will support them in quick recovery of their livelihoods after the economic crisis in 2020 and flooding in some of the areas which has lead to major income losses, depletion of assets and destruction of harvests. With the proposed project WHH and partner RCDI aim to contribute to improved food security through improved access to complementary foods (vegetables, fish). Increased food diversity combined with gender-sensitive nutrition sensitization aims at diversification of people&#x2019;s diets, particular of women and children under 5 years and hence contribute to reduced morbidity and mortality in the affected areas. WHH and partner RCDI will conduct mass sensitizations on improved nutrition practices, infants and young children feeding (IYCF), nutrition needs of women (particular pregnant and lactating women), gender issues, and basic hygiene. Income losses will be addressed in the project through enabling the beneficiaries to sell small surpluses on local markets. Hence by the end of the project food and nutrition security of the targeted individuals has improved. Selected beneficiaries will also be trained in improved fishing practices, fish preservation, and agronomy practices including vegetable production and post-harvest management which will allow them access to foods over a longer period of time at household level. Additionally, WHH and RCDI will support existing referral pathways and case management systems of protection and nutrition partners working in the areas by provision of unconditional cash support to affected people so they are able to pay for transport to access services. Furthermore, protection needs of vulnerable individuals accessing services will be addressed through the construction of temporary shelter as waiting areas in 20 distribution centers which are often used for mass distributions (e.g. under WFP-funded food distributions, FAO-funded distributions). 
WHH will partner with the national NGO, RCDI under this project who have operational bases in Mayom and Abiemnhom to support localization of emergency responses. WHH is the lead partner and implements FSL activities in Aweil South and Panijiar (static response) whereas RCDI will implement FSL activities in Mayom and Abiemnhom (static response) with technical back-stopping from WHH.</narrative>
