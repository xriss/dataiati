   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Envelope 2: Provision of SNFI and WASH services to the most vulnerable population in Bentiu IDP Camp</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Concern will provide SNFI and WASH assistance in Bentiu IDP camp, Rubkona County, Unity State. The activities are in line with the SSHF allocation strategy and are based on the needs identified in Humanitarian Needs Overview (HNO) -2021 and a rapid assessment conducted by Concern on June 15-16, 2021. The activities are also informed by Concern&#x2019;s contextual understanding and monitoring of on-going programs where we implement multi-sector humanitarian programs including SNFI and WASH interventions in close coordination with cluster, camp management, humanitarian partners and local stakeholders. 

Concern is the State focal point for SNFI cluster in Unity State, manages the SNFI re-enforcement needs in the entire Bentiu IDP site hosting about 95,000 people and WASH service providers in Sector-5 of the IDP camp serving about 25,000 people with safe water and sanitation services. Due to the overall complex humanitarian situation, 1.6 million people remain internally displaced in South Sudan. The Bentiu IDP camp continues to host highest number of IDPs with continued needs for SNFI re-enforcement and WASH services. Due to the overall improved security situation, the POC is transitioned to an IDP site however large scale movement out of camp is not expected due to the current complex dynamics including fear of revenge killing, inter-communal conflicts, limited livelihood source and poor access to basic services outside the camp.

The SNFI sector interventions aims at improving the living conditions and protecting dignity of the people who are living in the camp by upgrading the shelter through locally available materials and promoting community ownership in their shelter repairs and improvements. In close consultation with the Camp High Committee (CHC), Camp management, protection partners and local authorities, a total of 37,728 (18,175 male and 19,553 female) people will benefit from shelter upgrade under this grant. The beneficiaries will be provided with a voucher to redeem for grass mats from locally identified women groups who are engaged in production of grass mats within IDP site. Concern will train and provide technical oversight to the beneficiaries on installation of grass mats to improve existing shelters. In addition, together with protection partners, Concern will identify and select vulnerable beneficiaries for NFI replacement and intend to assist 3,132 beneficiaries (1,509 male and 1,623 female), mainly People with Special Needs (PSNs) with in-kind NFIs based on assessed priority needs. 

The WASH sector interventions will continue the provision of adequate safe water for domestic use, access to sanitation and hygiene promotion to 25,011 people (12,049 male and 12,962 female)in Sector-5 of IDP camp. The interventions will contribute to WASH cluster transition strategy of increased community engagement and ownership of WASH management in protracted sites. The project will continue to leverage and capitalize on the positive gains made from Concern&#x2019;s previous and on-going efforts towards community engagement and roll out of WASH cluster transition strategy. 

The project intend to reach 56,486 beneficiaries (27,712 male and 29,274 female), It is estimated that 25% of sector 5 beneficiaries will also receive SNFI therefore 75% of WASH beneficiaries are counted for total target of the project. Similarly the PSNs receiving NFIs are not counted as the same will also receive support in term of shelter upgrade. Concern will mainstreams community engagement and cross cutting issues such as protection, accountability and Gender Based Violence (GBV) throughout the project cycle. The target Households (HH) will receive coordinated and integrated services to maximize the overall outcomes of this activity. The interventions will complement the activities of other partners working in Bentiu and will be integrated with Concern on-going humanitarian response including Food Security and Nutrition services in Bentiu IDP Site.</narrative>
