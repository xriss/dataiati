   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Provision of education and child protection services in the PoCs of Bentiu and Malakal</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The projects seek to support a total of 25,250 (6374 women, 6376 men, 7100 boys amp 5400 girls) internally displaced people in Makala and Bentiu PoC through an integrated education and child protection approach. A total of 15,200 people in Malakal and 10,050 people in Bentiu PoCs will benefit from this intervention. The project will promote access to quality, protective and inclusive education to 8,500 children (3,400 G 5,100 B) aged 3 to 18 in Malakal PoCs while also guarantying child protection services both to children in and out of school in the PoCs of Bentiu and Malakal. It is expected 8,250 children (4,125 G and 4,125 B) will directly benefit from protection services including 4500 children benefiting at the same time from both protection and education services.  Furthermore, through a community-based approach 12,750 adults (6,374 W 6,376 M) will be engaged in the project to guarantee an enhancement in the overall protective environment of the PoCs. 

To achieve it&apos;s objective, the project will seek to enhance and increase school infrastructure in the Malakal PoCs through the construction and rehabilitation of school infrastructure. To guarantee safe and protective access and reduce the threats of GBV and COVID-19 spread, the project will also construct and rehabilitate WASH facilities of the school including latrines and handwashing stations. Furthermore, the project will seek to incentivized enrollment and reduce school dropout followed by COVID-19 through back to school and back to teach campaigns in the four targeted PoCs. 
Secondly, the project seeks to improve the quality of educational services provided in the PoCs through two sets of activities. One set of activities aiming at the increasing of pedagogical and managerial skills of teachers and administrative school staff through the provision of training for 120 teachers (95 men and 25 women) on new learning methodologies, life-skills and Psychosocial support (PSS), school management training particularly focused at the development of COVID-19 and PSEA protocols tailored to every school context and the distribution of scholastic material to learners. The other set of activities aims at strengthening the protective environment of children in the schools and includes the establishment and strengthening of child clubs and school committees composed of parents, teachers and community leaders to guarantee community ownership of the project. 

To holistically respond to children&apos;s needs in the PoCs the education component is complemented by a child protection component aims at further strengthening the protective environment of the schools to the establishment of protection help desks with active GBV referral pathways and the conduction of safety audits in all supported schools. Additionally, a strong focus will be put in establishing child friendly mechanisms to guarantee beneficiaries including children are able to voice their concerns in an appropriate manner. Finally, the child protection component will support directly 8,250 most vulnerable children (4,125 girls and 4,125 boys), particularly children having suffered the major consequences of school closure and COVID-19 economic impact, such as children having engaged in child labor, force marriage, UASC, children living on the streets and/or having drop out of school through the provision of individualized case management services including FTR and referral services. PSS will be guaranteed for all children in four CFS fully rehabilitated and equipped and community will be sensitized to the main child protection concerns occurring in the PoCs. It is expected that through the conduction of these activities, the overall general environment of children living in the PoCS of Bentiu and Malakal will be improved in a sustainable way while promoting a safe return of school.</narrative>
