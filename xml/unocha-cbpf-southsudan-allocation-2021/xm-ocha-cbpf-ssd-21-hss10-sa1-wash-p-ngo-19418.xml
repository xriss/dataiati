  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Community Action Organization (CAO) proposes an integrated multi-sectoral response in the Payams of Wau, Pagil, Pajiek, Ayod, Kuachdeng, and Mogok in Ayod County &#x2013; Jonglei State, to address the needs of the most vulnerable, through the provision of services in the thematic areas of WASH, Food Security and GBV for integrated outcomes targeting mainly women and girls, and communities exhibiting high levels of food insecurity (IPC 4amp5), malnutrition and protection issues. The integrated package proposed by CAO will tackle underlying issues that undermine efforts to reduce morbidity and mortality, exhibited in the county over a protracted period. 

In county insecurity in Ayod tends to drive population settlement in areas deemed safe, often lacking basic services hence compromising living standards. However, the majority of these locations such as Jiech and Gorwai are low lying environs susceptible to massive flooding as witnessed over the last couple of months. Flood induced displacements are driving populations to new locations with barely any infrastructure and services. The most recent IRNA report estimates 5,230 households as displaced and settled along the shoreline of Canal River - Goak, Nyarauibol, Paguong, Chuilbuong villages (2 hours walk from Ayod Town). Severe WASH needs are prevalent and GBV risks have emerged, coupled with food insecurity and malnutrition. 

This project will reach 44,380 vulnerable beneficiaries including IDPs &#x2013; 31,380, Returnees &#x2013; 3,994, Host community &#x2013; 9,006 within Ayod county (returnees amp IDPs arriving) in the locations of Goak, Nyarauibol, Paguong, Chuilbuong to avert a full-blown humanitarian crisis through integrated WASH response, prevention of Gender-Based Violence and food security, livelihoods assistance. 

In the thematic areas of WASH Provision of access to safe water sources to targeted population Provision of sanitation facilities appropriate to gender and culture, and increased access to WASH Non-Food Items (NFI) and MHM kits. Hygiene promotion integrated with protection messaging, including menstrual health management. Safety Audits for women and girls will be done to ensure location, design activities maximize safety. GBV prevention by addressing root causes of violence, improving prevention and protection services. The project will set up one Women and Girls Friendly Space (WGFS) in Ayod town to provide services, information, and activities that promote healing, well-being, and empowerment. GBV referral systems will be established to link GBV survivors to available response services and support including World Bank-supported Ayod PHCC and MOH referral structures. EMAP and GBV survivor&#x2019;s rights protection will be provided. FSL: Vulnerable women, girls, and GBV survivors will be provided with crops, vegetables, and fishing kits (Assets), enrolled into farming and fisherfolk groups, and trained through setting up demonstration plots and cooking demonstrations to increase project upscaling and replicability for a sustained effort for multi-sectoral GBV response package. 

All programming will be responsive to the adopted COVID-19 infection prevention and control protocols. This includes adhering to a &#x201C;Do No Harm&quot; approach, alignment with the National COVID-19 Response Plan on Infection Protection and Control, Risk Communication and Community Engagement, Case Care Management, community surveillance, and coordination with the WASH cluster for hygiene kits to support promoted behaviors</narrative>
