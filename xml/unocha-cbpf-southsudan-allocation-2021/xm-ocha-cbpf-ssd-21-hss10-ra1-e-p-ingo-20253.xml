The other set of activities aims at strengthening the protective environment of children in the schools and includes the establishment and strengthening of child clubs and school committees composed of parents, teachers and community leaders to guarantee community ownership of the project. 

In Leer, the project will focus to holistically respond to flood displaced people protection need through comprehensive GBV and CP case management at WGFS/CFS complemented by community based GBV and CP risk mitigation and prevention measures in Leer town and Kai-ga. Additionally, a strong focus will be put in establishing women amp child friendly mechanisms to guarantee beneficiaries including children are able to voice their concerns in an appropriate manner.
