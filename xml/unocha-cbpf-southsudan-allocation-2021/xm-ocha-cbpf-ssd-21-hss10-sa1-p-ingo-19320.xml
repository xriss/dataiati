   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project takes into consideration the Gender dimensions of conflicts and natural disasters, including heightened Gender Based Violence risks for women and girls. It responds to the immediate and long-term consequence by providing crucial Gender Based Violence services to the most vulnerable populations (women, men, girls and boys) in conflict affected areas, while also strengthening community-based structures for GBV response, prevention and mitigation. The affected populations are in the center of the intervention and participatory methods will be adopted throughout the project cycle management phases to ensure ownership and sustainability of project results. 
The main objective of this project is to ensure the timely and safe provision of Gender Based Violence Prevention and response services to 1000 Men, 4050 women, 400 boys and 2050 girls IDPs, returnees, and host communities in Twic East and Mayom.  2 Women and Girls Friendly Spaces in Twic Eact, and Mayom will be operationalized  to support 2700 Women and 1300 girls. These spaces will be an important entry point for survivors to access life saving services such as case management and psychosocial support. Because Gender Based Violence results in harmful physical, emotional and social consequences that often require information and care from multiple service providers, this project will strengthen case management services for Gender Based Violence survivors. Case management will be the primary entry point for survivors to receive support, care and referral to services such as Health care and legal. In coordination with GBV Sub Cluster and other GBV partners on the ground, CARE will ensure that referral pathways for GBV services are strengthened and functional. 60 men, 750 women, 120 boys and 650 girls will benefit from psychosocial support services to enhance their wellbeing. Skills building activities will be provided in the women and girls safe spaces: apart from women and girls improving their psychological wellbeing through these activities, they are able to improve their economic condition, through selling the products made at the WGFS. COVID-19 prevention messaging, which includes safe hand hygiene practices and social distancing, will be integrated into GBV prevention messages and delivered through targeted sensitizations, with specific sessions targeting Boys and Men  to transform norms that promote violence against women and girls. 
As part of this project&#x2019;s sustainability strategy, Community outreach activities will be done through the community structures with support from CARE and Partner staff coalition for Humanity. 2 (1 in each site) Community protection mechanisms will be strengthened through training and monthly meetings, to identify the emerging GBV issues, conduct protection risk assessment and put in place a mitigation plan. They will also be mobilized to disseminate information on referrals and improve the access to services.
 In close collaboration with the Gender Based Violence Sub Cluster, The project will provide access to critical risk mitigation items such as dignity kits to vulnerable women and girls to enhance hygiene, dignity and safety. 4 participatory safety audits will be conducted in coordination with the GBV sub cluster. Findings will be disseminated and action plans developed jointly to enhance safety across all sectors including Water Sanitation and Hygiene Actors, Livelihood, Camp Coordination and Camp Management and Health.
The project is implemented by CARE and partner, Coalition for Humanity. leveraging on their experience of the context, the partnership will strengthen the relevance and appropriateness of the response, including in areas such as community engagement and identifying the resources already available in the communities. Coalition for humanity will oversee the implementation of GBV prevention activities in Mayom including EMAP and engaging communities and local structures to transform harmful norms.</narrative>
