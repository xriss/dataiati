The provision of services for survivors will be in line with the gender based violence sub-cluster standard operating procedures (GBV SC SOPs) with particular focus on guiding principles, survivor centred approaches and referral pathways. The utilization of the WGFs will be in line with the South Sudan WGFs guidelines to ensure women and girls are protected, empowered, feel emotionally safe and comfortable to express themselves.
Steward Women will ensure that all our activities take a &#x201C;Do No Harm and conflict sensitive approach&#x201D;. Steward Women has been implementing protection and livelihood programmes in South Sudan since 2012 in Eastern Equatoria, Unity State, Central Equatoria State, Lakes State and Jonglei State. When coming up with this intervention plan, we consulted with Jonglei State GBV Working Group and Health Link all with presence in Bor South and close collaborators of Steward Women. Steward Women also participated in the June 2021 Safety Audit in Bor South which has informed the design of this intervention. We shall use our 9 years GBV programming experience to implement this project and document lessons learned. 
Steward Women brings a unique strategic partnership and exclusive strength and capacity as a women&#x2019;s organization to implement this project. In this SA1 project, she will particularly focus her interventions to benefit women and girls. Steward Women is the current chair of the rule of law technical reference group of the national GBV SC and has presence in Bor South. Steward Women offices in Bor are located in the compound of Jonglei State Women Association. Steward Women will work hand in hand with already existing GBV implementing partners in Bor South County especially UNHCR, NRC, Health Link, CARE, HDC etc to achieve the project goals. At the start of the project, Steward Women will hold consultative meetings with these agencies to provide training for our case workers. Steward Women will establish her program in collaboration with existing services such as placing community paralegals in the 1 WGFs at the IDP site to provide daily legal advise, counselling and education at the centres.</narrative>
