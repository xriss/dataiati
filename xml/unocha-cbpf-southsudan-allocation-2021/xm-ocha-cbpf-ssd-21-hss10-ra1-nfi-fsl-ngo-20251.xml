   <narrative xml:lang="EN">EMERGENCY RESPONSE TO FOOD SECURITY AND SHELTER FOR FLOOD AFFECTED POPULATIONS IN LEER AND GUIT COUNTY, UNITY STATE, SOUTH SUDAN</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The torrential rains across South Sudan have repeatedly devastated several parts of the country in the year 2020 and in 2021, rainfall continues to cause floods.  The displacement by flooding has impacted more than 146,000 people in Unity State alone. According to the Inter-Agency Flood Assessment Report, Leer County, Unity State, 18th &#x2013; 21st August 2021, some of the displaced populations from Mayendit county moved to Leer County. This is despite the fact that in Leer County a total of 6,944 households and 41,664 individuals have also been affected by floods. Most houses are submerged in water, and livelihoods swept away. Households are now seeking refuge under trees and institutions with limited access to shelter, cooking sets and blankets. On 12th July one rape case was reported in Pilieny Payam. Cases of rape, sexual harassment and abuse are common during rainy season because perpetrators have been reported to take advantage of the women and girls who wake up very early to take their water buckets at the water points so as to avoid longer hours of queueing. This reserve allocation project will target people who have been impacted by flooding in the two counties of Leer and Guit of Unity State. Leer and Guit are among the hardest hit with an estimated 35,000 people targeted for this response. 
The project will provide the most vulnerable households with shelter and nonfood items as well as emergency food and livelihood. The number of people targeted by the project in the two locations are as follows:
The project will reach a total of 35,000 beneficiaries 
6166 Women, 5766 Men ,11534 Girls, 11534 boys the population is distributed by county as follows 
Leer -Shelter NFIs 28,000 individuals 
5000 Women 
4600 Men 
9200 Girls 
9200 boys 

FSL -Guit 7000 individuals 
1166 Women 
1166 Men 
2334 Girls 
2334 boys 

The project will conduct the following activities: 

1.	Prior to all activities, needs validation survey and FGDs will be conducted to reverify the needs, and the project will be introduced to the local authorities and the communities at Payam level
2.	Coalition for Humanity will also conduct GBV risk and safety audits as a cross cutting activity to ensure the safety of women and girls during distribution of Shelter NFI/FSL items before and after distribution as part of accountability to affected persons. 
3.	CH will identify, verify and distribute Shelter/ Non-food Items to 28,000 individuals in Leer County
4.	CH will identify, verify and distribute vegetable seeds and fishing kits to 1,167 households (7000 individuals) in Guit County
5.	Coalition for Humanity will conduct a post distribution monitoring survey to validate impact, identify new gaps to be addressed as well as collect feedback and complaints 
Therefore, this project is linked to the reserve allocation strategy and falls within the three overarching 2021 Humanitarian Response Plan objectives, which include:
1. Reduce morbidity and mortality, protection threats and incidents for the most vulnerable populations in severity levels 4 and 5
2. Ensure safe, equitable and dignified access to critical cross-sectoral basic services to enable populations meet their basic needs in locations of severity levels 4 and 5
3. Enable vulnerable people to recover from crisis, seek solutions to displacement in respect of their rights, and build resilience to shocks and stresses

The SNFI and FSL activities will be mainstreamed with GBV, Protection and HLP. The project beneficiaries will be engaged through focus group discussions, Key informant interviews to identify protection/GBV concerns. The Accountability to the affected population(AAP) and GBV risks analysis will help bring out key issues that will be addressed during the project implementation. IDPs and host communities will be sensitize during project activities on Housing, land and Property rights including on land issues for demonstration plots and co</narrative>
