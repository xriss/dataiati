   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project includes Protection/HLP in former Juba POCs 1 amp3, Mangala IDPs site in Juba County, Bentiu/Rubkona IDP site and  the Food security and livelihood component will be implemented in Mayendit County.

Following the transitioning of protection of civilians sites (POCS) to internal displacement camps in late 2020, a lot of things have changed. There has been focus shift from providing support inside the former POCS to possible areas of return hence leaving gaps in most of the areas. The movement of people as a result of the peace agreement has made planning hard as people prefer having presence inside the camp and outside for those who come from the proximity of the former POCS. A recent assessment conducted by Coalition for Humanity herein attached (through focus group discussions with women in both POC camp 3 in Juba and in Bentiu) revealed a lot of service gaps and especially how women, children, sick and elderly are suffering from range of protection service gaps. Housing, land and property rights among the internally displaced have recently spiked causing insecurities among women and youth. Some of the incidences related to HLP and other general protection concerns resulting in death and destruction of properties of the IDPS. Protection/GBV cases of sexual harassments have been reported when women fetch water and firewood in all the three locations of former POC 1,3, Mangala and Bentiu former POC . The IDPs in Mangala have severally clashed with hosts over land issues that require urgent advocacy and awareness on peaceful coexistence and resource sharing. 3 cases of killings occurred outside the POC, it&#x2019;s not clear if it was revenge killing.
This integrated Protection/HLP project will support 11,346 individuals (3000 per location in Bentiu (Sector 1, 2, 3 and 4) and Juba former POCs (CAMP 1 amp 3) and Mangala with lifesaving HLP and protection services. 
This project is designed to provide complementarity and coordinate with other partners in order to deliver maximum benefits in terms of protection/HLP services to internally displaced persons in the three locations.

In the Integrated Protection/Housing, land and property component, Coalition for Humanity will focus on the following activities, among others:
1. Protection monitoring, assessments and analysis of protection and human rights violations to inform response and advocacy
2, Community awareness through outreach activities, particularly on HLP issues for IDPS intending to return to original homes including providing women and other vulnerable members with pro bono lawyers to support/provide legal services as required.
3. HLP programming in terms of supporting women, boys, men and girls through pro bono legal services and advice.
4. Strengthening community based structures and networks through outreach activities, training and building capacity of local leaders to enhance and tackle GBV issues and other protection concerns

Coalition of Humanity will built the capacity of block leaders, and representatives of men, women and youth to maintain sanitation in POCs by sharing latrine cleaning responsibilities and managing garbage collection as an exit strategy and means of ensuring project sustainability.

The Food security and livelihood component will support hosts, returnees and IDPs in Mayendit county with lifesaving vegetable, fishing and crops kits during the project for period of 7 months.
In this response  3,454 HHs will  benefit  from lifesaving inputs. Key deliverables will include
1.Distributions of vegetable, crops and fishing kits to 3,454 HHs
2. Training of 340 beneficiaries on Fishing - handling, preservation
3. Training of beneficiaries on crop production and post-harvest management
4. GBV Risk Assessment Safety audits and Risk analysis to identify suitable distribution points and refer GBV case
