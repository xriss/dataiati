To reverse the they level of food insecurity situation and avert total collapse the livelihood of the most vulnerable persons in the Counties, CAFAD proposes dry season response respectively to support a total of 22,457 Households (9431 men, 12575 women, 225 boy and 226 girl headed households) with fast maturing, nutritious and quality vegetable seeds, farming tools and fishing equipment. This is expected to benefit 134742 persons (56,586 men, 75,450 women, 1350 boys and 1356 girls) estimating that each of the target household has 6 household members. CAFAD will also strive to ensure that the project reached minimum of 4434 (739 Households) persons living with disability (PLWD), TB and HIV/AIDs supported through capacity building and livelihood support. Of the 1120 persons to be trained on vegetable production and fisheries, CAFAD will ensure atleast 3% are PLWD (33) and atleast 706 PLWD receive the fishing and vegetable kits.
CAFAD plans to distribute fishing gear, quality vegetable seeds and farming tools (maloda and sickle) to vulnerable  women, girl, boy and men headed households on time at peak of lean season in a timely manner help close the cereal gap that nationally stands at 482,500 MT and 5MT at Canal/Pigi County level. Each beneficiary is expected to receive a combination of vegetable kit (Okra, onion, watermelon, amaranthus, eggplant, Tomato, collard and pumpkin seeds), farming tools (maloda and gunny bag) and a fishing kit (Monofilament, box of hooks and a pair of twine for making fishing net)
CAFAD will liaise with UNFAO for the timely release of the above inputs and transport them (within a week upon notification as per FAO procedures in relation to release orders) from Bor/Juba warehouses for further shipment to the distribution points. 
For the purpose of project inception, CAFAD shall mobilize and sensitize the communities at County, Boma and payam level through their representatives women leaders, youth, payam administrators, commissioners and RRC to determine identification and beneficiary selection. Consultative meetings shall be carried out during inception, implementation and exit points of the project and reports submitted to relevant stakeholders. 
In collaboration with local authorities (Relief and Rehabilitation Commission, payam administrators, boma heads) OCHA, FAO and other stakeholders CAFAD will identify and register the most vulnerable households in OCHA approved payams in Canal/Pigi, Fangak and Nyirol Counties in a format to be agreed between CAFAD and the local authorities and submitted to FSL secretariat and FAO for approval. 
During distribution, CAFAD shall provide technical information and guidance to the beneficiaries on best use of agriculture and fishing kits being distributed. This will cover handling of inputs provided with support of visual aids and captions with instructions. Good agronomic practices, seed production and preservation techniques, post-harvest processing and store management, family nutrition with special emphasis on food preparation, processing amp utilization will be covered in the trainings.
