  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project will enable the Nyein (Shalom) Foundation to set-up a Rapid Response Mechanism to meet the humanitarian needs of people newly displaced due to conflict or natural disaster. These pre-positioned capabilities and resources will also enable Nyein Foundation to address gaps in the on-going humanitarian needs of existing Internally Displaced People (IDP) and Local Integration plan in Kachin across many sectors, namely WASH, Shelter and NFIs. Nyein Foundation is member of Joint Strategy Team (JST) implementing partner in government controlled areas since the beginning of 2011 responding to immediate needs of IDPs.According to the Shelter/NFI/CCCM November 2018 figure Household-20738 and Population 106113 reached internally displaced in Kachin and Shan states after armed conflict between the Myanmar Armed Forces and the Kachin Independence Army (KIA) re-ignited in June 2011.Since 11 April 2018, Kachin State has witnessed a spike in the crisis with Tatmadaw military offensives involving heavy artillery and airstrikes. The situation is seriously affecting local civilian populations, causing civilian casualties, detainment, entrapment and new displacement in many townships in Kachin State. As per the 29 May 2018 update over 8,907 civilians (4,185 male, 4,722 female) have been newly displaced. Project activities will prioritize the needs of particularly vulnerable and marginalized people and promote gender equality.The majority of IDPs have been hosted in the religious facilities such as churches and monasteries in camp settings while some are being hosted by communities. In Kachin State, the majority of IDPs are Baptist and Roman Catholic Christian. Since the beginning of the resumed war in 2011, humanitarian assistance provided by two main Christian religious faith-based organizations namely KBC and KMSS. KBC provides humanitarian assistance to its Baptist Christian IDPs while KMSS provides to Catholic Christian. Other Christian Denominations member and Buddhist IDPs are unwilling or reluctant to stay in camps those are coordinated and managed by two main faith-based organizations. Since Nyein is non faith-based organization, it become the most appropriate organization to take the responsibility as camp coordination and management agency for those small Christian denomination member and Bhudhist IDPs. And Nyein has been one of the key actors in the response to this emergency since 2012.According to a needs assessment which was conducted in late 2018 in Nyein targeted camps, 95% of standard shelters and 2% of under-standard emergency shelters have been covered in the camps. 3% of IDPs households are still in need of shelter, as some IDPs are still sharing shelters with 8 to 10 family members, whereas one unit of shelter is designed for 5 persons. In addition, many shelters that have been constructed by humanitarian partners since between 2011 and 2013 have reached the end of their life span as they were intended to last two or three years. Therefore, some shelters built in the early phrase are now in urgent need of repair, replacement and maintenance. There is still no grantee for the safe and dignified return of IDPs to the place of origin, so it is important for maintaining minimum standards and quality of life during displacement.In Bhamo Area, the committee or leaders of the Church and Monastery only allow the IDPs stay in their compound up to the end of 2018. So, IDPs are trying to buy low cost land plot in the area as local integration. In that situation, as a camp coordination and camp management agency, Nyein need to provide proper single unit shelter (Kitchen attach&#xE9;) and WASH Facility for those IDPs planning for local integration. This project aims to continue providing shelter assistance to IDPs to address urgent shelter gaps, including construction of new shelter units and providing WASH. Please kindly see it further information in project proposal word file as attachment.</narrative>
