   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Provision of inclusive and protective education opportunities for post primary vulnerable adolescents in central and north Rakhine State</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Based on the analysis of the current situation, this project is to be conducted in partnership between the Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC) and Myittar Resource Foundation (MRF) with the goal of contributing towards facilitating access to education opportunities, protection and increased safety of crises-affected girls and boys, across central and north Rakhine State. These areas are currently affected by prolonged displacement, limited provision and access to basic services, and lack  adequate education interventions especially for post-primary school age children.

The overarching objective of the intervention is to contribute towards enhancing education in emergency interventions and facilitating access to protective and formalized education opportunities by increasing the response and technical capacity of front-line workers and ensure the quality of interventions.

In order to achieve the expected objective, NRC and MRF will work in synergy and coordination with clear and defined roles. Specifically, NRC will be responsible for supporting the technical aspect of the project, by enhancing specific skills and competences among MRF&#x2019;s staff mainly related to evaluation of learning outcomes, monitoring and evaluation of NFE activities, psychosocial support interventions, protection-related actions, and providing full support and guidelines to MRF for the provision of quality, safe and protective learning opportunities. In addition, NRC will provide life skills activities and teachers training in nRS together with MRF. On the other hand, MRF will be responsible for the implementation of designed activities following specific quality standards and increasing access to education opportunities focused on non-formal education, which integrate Psychosocial Support and life skills activities, as a bridging strategy toward more formalized education pathway, together with transversal initiatives, such as awareness and advocacy activities, aimed at volunteer teachers, village education committee members, community members and parents.
Furthermore, by implementing tailored education opportunities, it will be possible to acquire knowledge and understanding of critical protection needs, as well as mitigating the impact and effects of the crisis among all affected individuals. Target beneficiaries will include vulnerable women, men, girls and boys.
The identification of the beneficiaries will be guided by vulnerability criteria established prior the intervention and shared among the two organizations. A vulnerability score system will be defined and agreed prior the implementation period with the goal of ensuring the involvement and prioritization of post primary school age children most in need.
Disabilities, minorities, age and gender are mainstreamed in both organizations&apos; programmes and activities, and will be taken into consideration throughout this proposed intervention.
Finally, NRC and MRF&#x2019;s consortium will support the education sector by providing teachers an incentive for educational personnel inside camps through an International NGO with the purpose of reducing the gap between the new salary scale defined by the Ministry of Education and the current incentive provided to volunteer teachers inside camps by INGOs.</narrative>
