   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Reconstruction, renovation and re-roofing of temporary shelters for IDPs in the Maw Ti Ngar and Thet Kae Pyin displacement sites of Central Rakhine</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">According to the 2019 HRP, 128,141 IDPs are still confined in 23 camps and other displacement sites since inter-communal conflict and violence in central Rakhine in 2012. There are 51% of women, 53% of children, and 4% of elderly individuals. In total, women and children make up 78% of this population. Movement restrictions and lack of appropriate access to healthcare, livelihoods and education have created deplorable living conditions over the past six years. Temporary shelters with a short life span have significantly deteriorated, and there is an ongoing need for maintenance, repair, and reconstruction to appropriate standards. External support for this is critical, as IDPs face restrictions on working and travelling which impedes them from accessing building and repair material. 

Specific needs with regards to this have been identified in the Sittwe Maw Ti Ngar (MTN) and Thet Kae Pyin (TKP) displacement sites. Christian Aid (CA) and Myittar Resource Foundation (MRF) received through the Shelter/NFI Rakhine cluster a summary of the needs assessment conducted by the Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC), who are the CMC and Shelter/NFI lead agency in both camps. This assessment was complemented by a rapid need assessment on 19 November conducted by CA in MTN and TKP. Both assessments found critical needs around the reconstruction and renovation of 11 shelters, as well as the re-roofing of 45% of MTN shelters and 75% of the TKP shelter, and the fire-proofing of kitchen spaces. CAs assessment was able to identify the vulnerable individuals living in the targeted households for shelter reconstruction and renovation. 

In view of the deteriorating conditions of shelters in TKP and MTN, and the protracted nature of this humanitarian crisis, CA in partnership with Myittar Resource Foundation (MRF) proposes to address the immediate needs around shelter reconstruction and renovation for vulnerable IDP households in MTN and TKP displacement sites, Sittwe. The proposed intervention will support 1,768 individuals in 319 households within the timeframe of 6 months to live in more dignified and safer conditions, notably reducing health and hazard risks with regards to fire and the upcoming winter. The project will reconstruct (9) and renovate (2) 11 long house shelters for 88 households. The 9 shelters will be reconstructed to the 2018 design standards. The intervention will also provide the re-roofing for 30 shelters covering 231 households, and the relining of the kitchens for the fire safety of these same 30 shelters. 

This project builds on the CA-MRF partnership which has been strategically developed over the past two years under the Irish Aid Humanitarian Program Plan we have been implementing in Rakhine. The Humanitarian Programme Plan  (HPP) is now entering its second phase for three years (2019-2021) and we are working with MRF to carry out conflict sensitive interventions in camps and communities in Rakhine, with a focus on GBV. This partnership needs to be seen in the large of context of CA&#x2019;s response and engagement in Rakhine covering the full spectrum of humanitarian issues from shelter/NFIs, WASH, protection (GBV, rights of IDPs, Safeguarding) to accountability to IDPs and full compliance with CHS commitments. It is important to highlight that the CA MRF partnership is also one of the pilot cases we are carrying out under our localization research project with ECHO, &apos;Accelerating localization through partnerships&apos;.</narrative>
