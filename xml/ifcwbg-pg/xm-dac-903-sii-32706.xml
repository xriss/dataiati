   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Established in 1957 as a branch of the National Bank of Australasia (NAB) and incorporated as Bank of South Pacific (BSP), a wholly owned subsidiary of NAB, in 1974. In 1993, National Investment Holdings Limited, a nationally-owned corporation, acquired NABs 87% shareholding, and the 13% that was at that stage held in public hands. In April 2002 BSP purchased the state-owned Papua New Guinea Banking Corporation Limited under the State&apos;&apos;s privatization program. BSP was listed on the Port Moresby stock exchange in 2003.  BSP is Papua New Guineas (PNG) largest retail and commercial bank with assets of USD6.7 billion (as of June 30, 2012), with a dominant market position in PNG with approximately 50% of loans and deposits.   The proposed project is expected to: (i) provide US Dollar medium/long term funding to BSP, the largest and only indigenous bank in PNG, to catalyze private sector growth, and (ii) expand access to finance for PNG based businesses which are central to the development of PNG economy.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">IFC&apos;&apos;s role is expected to encompass the following: (i)	providing the Bank with a long-term USD loan, enabling it to expand its USD lending program to serve increasing USD demand from PNG clients with USD receivables but a limited access to USD funding;  (ii) demonstrating confidence in and support for the largest and only indigenous bank in PNG implementing its long-term strategic goals of regional and increasing access to finance for local businesses which are drivers of future economic growth and employment creation; (iii) IFC&apos;&apos;s long-term loan will also help the Bank reducing maturity mismatch as majority of BSP&apos;&apos;s deposit base are short-term; and (iv) mobilize the syndication fund to provide much needed long-term liquidity support to BSP, helping the leading bank to maintain long-term financial sustainability given very limited available capital in the market.  The Project is expected to measure the following development impact: (i) at least 412,000 loans disbursed by the Bank during the life of Project from a baseline of 51,864 loans disbursed during 2012; and (ii) the USD volume of outstanding loans reaches USD4,450 million by the end of 2020 (10% average annual growth) from a baseline of USD2,345 million as of December 31, 2012.</narrative>
