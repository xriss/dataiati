   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Sudokkho aims to stimulate private sector investment in training for poor people. Sudokkho targets two sectors with high growth potential and ability to absorb large numbers of poor people in skilled and semi-skilled jobs: &#x2022; RMG (Readymade Garments), &#x2022; Construction (of houses and buildings) including selected input supply sectors. Sudokkho aims to ensure employment of 100,000 poor people, including women and disadvantaged populations, after successful completion of training through its partnerships with privately owned training service providers (PTPs) and industry-based training (IBT) initiatives.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Working with the private sector, the programme will support the development of a skills-training market and incentivise market players to invest in on-the-job and off-the-job skills training. Four core principles are crucial in building a mutually beneficial relationship between private training providers and employers: [a] Fair and open competition between prospective recipients of funds, [b] Targeting of those currently excluded from government training institutes, [c] Payment for training providers based on employment outcomes, [d] A Market Development Approach, with a focus on market-based solutions.</narrative>
