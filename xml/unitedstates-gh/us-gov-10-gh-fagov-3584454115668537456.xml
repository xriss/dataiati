    <narrative xml:lang="EN">The U.S. government provides significant assistance to accelerate Ghana&apos;s transition towards an established lower middle-income country status. U.S. assistance supports Ghana&apos;s efforts to solidify its position as a leader in a region unfortunately known for civil strife, poor governance and economic stagnation. U.S. assistance to Ghana is supported through a number of presidential initiatives and foreign assistance priorities, including Feed the Future (FTF), the Global Health Initiative, and Power Africa, as well as through support from the regional Trade Africa program. To support Ghana to achieve its development goals, U.S. assistance will promote good governance; improve health care; strengthen the basic education system; expand agricultural production; increase access to power; and enhance the capacity of the Ghanaian armed forces.</narrative>
