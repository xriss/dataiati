   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In the immediate aftermath of Hurricane Matthew, more than 800 have died, thousands are homeless and at-risk of exposure and disease. The Consortium proposes to conduct rapid, multi-sectoral assessments and provide food, shelter and non-food items (NFIs) in the coastal communes of Southern Haiti (Sud Departmente).

Through the &#x2018;assess and assist&#x2019; model the Consortium proposes to target 2,000 households (HHs) (10,000 people) over a two-week period, dispersed among nine communes. Each HH will receive a modest food ration and/or NFIs, such as sleeping mats, tarps, hygiene items and water filters, as deemed appropriate. Since many of the targeted HHs are sheltering in church properties and schools, the Consortium will rely on local authorities, churches and identified community leaders for assistance in beneficiary selection.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Since Hurricane Matthew hit Haiti earlier this week, Consortium field teams have begun conducting rapid assessments in the Sud Department. Initial reports indicate damaged and collapsed homes, surging rivers, washed-out bridges, and thousands of displaced families. Furthermore, in the rural areas, markets are short on food and essential supplies and, with damaged infrastructure, may not be resupplied for some time. 

The Consortium has already begun distributing food and NFI items from prepositioned disaster response stocks and local purchases. Procurement of NFI items such as sleeping mats, kitchen sets, and tarps, as well as water filters and additional hygiene kit supplies, is underway. 

In the proposed two-week response, the Consortium will seek to provide food and essential items to 2,000 households (10,000 people) in the targeted communes while simultaneously undertaking assessments. The most vulnerable households across nine communes will be targeted. This approach balances the humanitarian imperative to provide immediate assistance with the need to assess damage and develop a response strategy.
HHs are equipped to return home.
