   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Hurricane Matthew Emergency Response (HURMER)</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Since Hurricane Matthew hit Haiti, WC field teams has conducted rapid assessments in the Southeast and South of the country. Initial reports indicated damaged and collapsed homes, surging rivers, washed-out bridges, and thousands of displaced families. Furthermore, in the rural areas, markets are short on food and essential supplies and, with damaged infrastructure, may not be resupplied for some time. Wherever possible, WC will support households with cash transfers, however this is expected to be only a small portion of the response.

WC has distributed hygiene kits in evacuation shelters from our prepositioned disaster response stocks. Procurement and distribution of sleeping mats, tarps, food rations, water filters and additional hygiene kit supplies is underway. 
WC will continue assessment activities in the Southeast and South and provide food and essential items (or cash where possible) to 500 households (2,500 people) in the targeted communes. Each household will receive a one-week food ration, two sleeping mats, a tarp, a hygiene kit and a water filters. Since many of the targeted households are sheltering in church properties and schools, WC will partner with the churches and identified community leaders for beneficiary selection and post-distribution monitoring. This approach balances the humanitarian imperative to provide immediate assistance with the need to assess damage and develop a response strategy.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project will provide for both assessment and assistance for areas of Haiti directly affected by Hurricane Matthew. Communities in the Southeast and Northwest will be surveyed to identify and prioritize needs. The project will directly target 500 HH (2,500 people) identified as most in need of assistance as indicated in the assessment and in cooperation with community leaders. Since most of these communities are rural, livelihoods have been disrupted through loss of crops and livestock, and potential for self-recovery is limited. 
1. 500 HHs have immediate needs met.
1. HHs receive food and NFIs.
1.1. Procurement of supplies
1.2 Distribution of kits</narrative>
