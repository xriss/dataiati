  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The SWISH program responds to the Chadian government&#x2019;s request for agencies to plan their interventions in rural villages to support the many internally displaced persons (IDP) returnees, who are moving back to their home lands or have already returned. However, current capacity to implement is limited, and continued support from the international community is required to fill this gap.

Drought is the most serious natural hazard facing Eastern Chad in terms of severity and frequency of occurrence. The arid and semi-arid lands face frequent water deficiencies, failing to meet the amount needed by pastoralists and agro-pastoralists for basic water requirements. Consequently, they suffer huge losses of their livelihoods, leading to chronic hunger, diseases, conflicts, and internal displacements. Women and children, the most affected, walk long distances in search of water.

SWISH means to reintroduce sand dams to the region through a carefully designed pilot in partnership with Sahelian Solutions Foundation (SASOL), involving two communities with sites that have been identified as highly suitable for sand dams. This project will focus on the engagement of the community through all phases, from design through evaluation. Since World Concern is committed to long-term programming in these two locations, opportunity for monitoring sustainability will continue after the end of the pilot.

The SWISH program is also in line with the Sahel humanitarian response plan, addressing two of the top priorities, specifically water supply and hygiene. Sand dams provide increased access to potable water and reduced risk from droughts and floods for target communities.</narrative>

Sand dams will be accessed through infiltration galleries, allowing communities to draw filtered water for consumption, household gardening and possibly some crop irrigation.</narrative>
