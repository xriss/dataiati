   <narrative xml:lang="EN">World Concern Bangladesh started this rural micro and small business development program in FY 2000 in response to the needs of rural people as expressed by many indigenous Christian organizations. Particularly, this program works in close cooperation with four small Christian organiztions, though program&apos;s beneficiaries include poor and marginalized people regardless of their religion, race, color, caste and creed. These Christian organizations are mainly involved in the ministry with very limited funding and with no funding for socio-economic development programs. The people of their working areas are very poor and they often need to be helped with some means for livelihood. This program is very promising for holistic development as World Concern helps the members to provide training and credit for their small and micro entrepreneurs to become socially and economically self-reliant while those Christian organizations works towards their spiritual development.
