   <narrative xml:lang="EN">World Concern Bangladesh started this rural micro and small business development program in FY 2000 in response to the needs of rural people as expressed by many indigenous Christian organizations. Particularly, this program works in close cooperation with four small Christian organizations, though program&apos;s beneficiaries include poor and marginalized people regardless of their religion, race, color, caste and creed. These Christian organizations are mainly involved in the ministry with very limited funding and with no funding for socio-economic development programs. The people of their working areas are very poor and they often need to be helped with some means for livelihood. This program is very promising for holistic development as World Concern helps the members to provide training and credit for their small and micro entrepreneurs to become socially and economically self-reliant while those Christian organizations works towards their spiritual development. 
Women Empowerment for Self-Reliant program is working on group approach.  Women face many social obstacles; more over they have very little access in financial institutions. But women can keep contribution in the society and country as well. The loan program helps them to come out from the bondage of the society and helps them to live in the society with dignity. The goal is that the beneficiaries will become empowered, free from exploitation and self-reliant through Women Empowerment for Self-reliant program for socio-economic transformation.
This project will train and support poor and marginal farmers to cultivate quick growing fish in their fallen ponds for increased family nutrition and income. It also aims to help small entrepreneurs to expand their businesses and create employment opportunities for the local poor and unemployed. This program is very promising for holistic development as World Concern helps the people to build up capacity by providing training and credit for their fish cultivation and small entrepreneurs to become socially and economically self-reliant.</narrative>
