   <narrative xml:lang="EN">World Concern has been working in Eastern Chad over the last 7 years, initially supporting refugees and internally displaced persons (IDPs) after the Darfur crisis. In recent years, an extended period of peace has allowed IDPs to return to their homes, and many of the camps or displacement sites have closed or become new settlements. Many IDPs are estimated to have already returned, many of whom are without any support. While returning is a sign that stability is increasing in the region, the return is increasing vulnerability for households. During the flight from conflict and the time of displacement, agricultural implements were lost or traded and households have had no means to purchase replacements. Families return without seed stocks, livestock or cash with which to start over. The returnees are resettling villages with little or no infrastructure, markets, financial services, and often water supply. Without a basic level of startup support, returnee households are vulnerable to the slightest shock. Unfortunately, shocks are inevitable in a harsh climate such as Chad&#x2019;s.

BREC will increase food security through improved yields, increased agricultural production and increased natural resource management, including increased household economic stability through livelihood diversity and access to capital.</narrative>
