   <narrative xml:lang="SV">Det gemensamma programmet &#xE4;r utformat f&#xF6;r att bidra till f&#xF6;ljande tv&#xE5; &#xF6;msesidigt st&#xF6;djande resultat. Resultat 1: Riktade initiativ och nationell kapacitet bidrar mer effektivt till konfliktf&#xF6;rebyggande och uppr&#xE4;tth&#xE5;llande av fred. Resultat 2: FN:s landgrupper har strategier och program som blir alltmer konfliktk&#xE4;nsliga och leder partnerskap f&#xF6;r att uppr&#xE4;tth&#xE5;lla fred.

Detta &#xE4;r den andra fasen av ett p&#xE5;g&#xE5;ende integrerat globalt st&#xF6;d till UNDP om fredsbyggande.
Det planerade st&#xF6;det kommer att l&#xF6;pa under tre &#xE5;r mellan 2022 och 2024 och kommer att anv&#xE4;nda strukturen f&#xF6;r tematiska finansieringsf&#xF6;nster, efter den f&#xF6;rsta fasen 2020&#x2013;2021 med en liknande struktur. Detta kommer d&#xE5; att inneb&#xE4;ra ett skr&#xE4;ddarsytt avtal f&#xF6;r finansieringsf&#xF6;nstren, och inte Sida-UNDP:s juridiska mall. Effektiviteten av denna struktur kommer dock att bed&#xF6;mas under denna bed&#xF6;mning. Merparten av medlen kommer att ligga inom och anv&#xE4;ndas av UNDP. F&#xF6;r programmet f&#xF6;r freds- och utvecklingsr&#xE5;dgivare (PDA) &#xE4;r det ett gemensamt program mellan UNDP och DPPA (FN: s avdelning f&#xF6;r fredsbyggande och politiska fr&#xE5;gor), s&#xE5; en del av dessa medel kommer att anv&#xE4;ndas av DPPA.</narrative>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The joint programme is designed to contribute to the following two mutually supportive outcomes. Outcome 1: Targeted initiatives and national capacities are more effectively contributing to conflict prevention and sustaining peace. Outcome 2: UN Country Teams have strategies and programmes that are increasingly conflict sensitive and are leading partnerships on sustaining peace.

This is the second phase of an ongoing integrated global support to UNDP on peacebuilding.
The intended support will run for three years between 2022-2024 and will use the Thematic Funding windows structure, following the first phase in 2020-2021 with a similar structure. This will then involve a tailored agreement for the funding windows, and not the Sida-UNDP legal template. However, the effectiveness of that structure will be assessed during this appraisal. The majority of the funds will remain within and be used by UNDP. For the programme on Peace and Development Advisors (PDA), it is a joint programme between UNDP and DPPA (UN Department for Peacebuilding and Political Affairs), so some of those funds will be used by DPPA.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Within the context of UNDP&apos;s Strategic Plan 2022-2025 the proposed collaboration between Sida and UNDP will be particularly central to the building resilience direction of change (the other two are Structural Transformation and Leaving no one behind): strengthening systems to respond to different risks, ranging from crisis and conflict to natural disasters, health or economic shocks, and the signature solutions on Resilience, Governance and Environment (the other three are Poverty, Energy and Gender equality).

To contribute towards this, the three substantive focus areas of the proposed Sida-UNDP collaboration are: Building national capacities for conflict prevention with DPPA, Strengthening the rule of law, human rights, justice and security and Preventing conflict, sustaining peace and climate security. Supporting countries to build resilience entails strengthening capacities to anticipate, prevent, respond to, and recover from the impacts of crises and shocks, towards which the proposed areas will contribute.

The fourth area of the proposed collaboration on core capacities, is a complement and enabler to the substantive areas in this proposal as well as to UNDPs overall work in crisis and fragility.

Since this is an integrated global support to peacebuilding within UNDP, including several different components, the theory of change and main objectives are listed below per component;

For the JP on PDAs;

Theory of change: When efforts to prevent conflict and sustain peace are analysis-based, robust, inclusive, and nationally-led, and when these are supported to an appropriate extent by coherent international strategies and programmes, Member States are better equipped to mitigate the risks of conflict and fragility, and to pursue their development priorities.

Objectives:
Based on this overall theory of change, the Joint programme is designed to contribute to the following two mutually supportive outcomes.
Outcome 1: Targeted initiatives and national capacities are more effectively contributing to conflict prevention and sustaining peace.
Outcome 2: UN Country Teams have strategies and programmes that are increasingly conflict sensitive and are leading partnerships on sustaining peace.

For the subwindow on conflict prevention, climate-security and the global project on conflict prevention, peacebuilding and responsive institutions;

UNDPs Prevention Offer (2022-2025) is a corporate effort to articulate UNDPs prevention and peacebuilding with the ambition to promote a strong development lens that calls for acting early and at scale in conflict and crisis prevention and peacebuilding. Its objectives are threefold, to: (i) stabilize and protect hard-won development gains; (ii) mitigate risks of relapse or recurrence; and (iii) build institutional and community resilience to sustain peaceful development pathways. The Prevention Offer identifies three critical pathways as to how these objectives would be achieved: analysis and analytics for evidence-based action, resources for peacebuilding (human, financial, advocacy, space, partnerships and beyond), and predictable and sustained technical support.

The Swedish contribution to the sub-window on Conflict Prevention and Sustaining Peace will enable delivery of the prevention and sustaining peace ambition at two levels:
1. Country-facing flexible thematic funding in support of UNDPs corporate strategies as well as country office initiatives; and
2. The policy-oriented CPPRI global project (and its integrated portfolio of peacebuilding, prevention, PVE, institutions in fragile and conflict settings and climate security). This component facilitates global policy, advocacy, guidance, regional support and human resource accompaniment to UNDPs conflict prevention and sustaining peace agenda.

GP on Rule of Law and Human Rights;

The Theory of Change
The programmes theory of change is designed on the basis of a core assumption, affirmed in Agenda 2030 and SDG 16, that rule of law, justice, security and human rights are interlinked and mutually reinforcing concepts that, when strengthened together, enable more peaceful, just and inclusive societies.

Therefore, the Global Programme adopts a multi-disciplinary systems approach to addressing structural inequality and discrimination, to complement strengthening institutional rule of law and human rights capacity. This approach places people at the centre of all efforts and is grounded in the following theory of change statement:

If all people in their diversity, and especially the excluded, marginalized and those furthest behind, are empowered to have agency to articulate and advocate for their security, justice, and human rights needs, access remedies and redress, and effectively participate in decision-making processes;

and if human rights defenders can effectively challenge and address exclusion and discrimination to influence laws, policies and practices with and on behalf of the excluded, marginalized and those furthest behind;
and if duty-bearers and power-holders develop the political will, resources and capacities to respond to the human rights, justice and security needs and demands of all people, and especially the excluded, marginalized and those furthest behind, and are held accountable for their actions,

and if human rights, justice and security systems are inclusive and responsive to peoples needs and work to inspire peoples trust and confidence;

and if international and regional actors support these national and sub-national processes by advocating for human rights and people-centred justice and security, safeguarding civic space, and ensuring accountability, based on respect for human rights and the rule of law;

then power relations between people, and especially the excluded, marginalized and those furthest behind, on the one hand and duty-bearers and power-holders on the other are likelier to be fairer, more inclusive, sustainable and legitimatesupporting a strengthened, inclusive, and rights-based social contract,

which will contribute to sustainable development, stability and security in the long-term, because the ability of people, and especially the excluded, marginalized and those furthest behind, to claim their human rights and access basic security and justice within a context of inclusive governance, open civic space and respect for human rights and the rule of law, increases a sense of stability and security within communities, increases trust between the state and its people, and reduces the potential for violence.

Programme Outcome 1: Inclusive, people-centred systems that provide quality justice and security services and uphold and protect human rights are trusted and accessible, especially in contexts affected by crisis, conflict or fragility.

Programme Outcome 2: Regional and global policy on rule of law, justice, security and human rights is evidence-based, affirms a development perspective and informs high-quality programming.

Crisis Bureau core capacities:

The objective of these positions is to continue to allow the Crisis Bureau to provide Country Offices in crisis settings with strategic, integrated and coherent support, undertake strategic advocacy for UNDPs agenda in crisis and fragility, develop new and nurturing existing partnerships for the Crisis Bureau and promote UNDPs role in crisis response and recovery and its thought leadership in resilience, stabilization, migration and conflict prevention.

This remains as relevant today if not more given the COVID-19 crisis has severe impact on peace and development. Fragile and conflict settings continue to remain the most at risk and the 2030 Agenda will not deliver on its targets without a significant increase in investments to address fragility and crisis, and build capacities to anticipate and respond to global threats. At the same time the socio-economic impact on donor countries had a significant negative impact on the overall donor landscape and this risk resulting in lower allocations to fragile and crisis contexts. Enhanced efforts to nurture and expand partnerships is therefore essential.</narrative>
