   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The strategic framework objectives for the network are;

For systematic change (strategic goal 1)

- Increased adoption and implementation of comprehensive legal, policy and regulatory frameworks for addressing SEC including its new forms (online):

ECPAT will; analyse national legal frameworks on SEC and promote correct terminology in laws, policies and media; improve the capacity of legal professionals and engage citizens in demanding better laws and policies.

- Increased capacity of law enforcement, courts and accompanying lawyers for the investigation, prosecution, and prevention of SEC:

ECPAT will research effective systems and responses for law enforcement and promote what works; and facilitate multi-country collaboration, especially between countries of origin of perpetration and countries were children experience exploitation.   

- Increased private sector regulation, financial commitment, and action for child protection:

ECPAT will promote the implementation of codes of conduct for self -regulation as well as for meeting mandates by governments and regulatory bodies; build the capacity of relevant sectors to prevent and respond; and build the capacity of the media to use appropriate terminology

- Increased access to quality, child-friendly and effective protection, response and support systems and services for at-risk children and children who have experienced the sexual exploitation of children:

ECPAT will conduct innovative research, amplify existing research, and on the ground successes to inform training programs and child safeguarding standards for welfare and front-line staff; manage evidence based model programs to be handed over to national governments. People who experienced sexual exploitation when they were children will be consulted to help define response and support services.



For social change (strategic goal 2)

- Greater awareness, help-seeking and freedom from stigma and shame around the sexual exploitation of children among children, survivors, caregivers, and vulnerable communities, through use of preventative education and public information:

ECPAT will advocate and support the design and implementation of evidence-based education and training for children, caregivers and vulnerable communities, including age-appropriate sex and sexuality education; promote help seeking among children and vulnerable communities and engage with survivors to promote preventative measures. ECPAT will also collaborate with the governments to address the push factors such as economic disparities, address the demand side of SEC by advocating for offender interventions and rehabilitation and promote the establishment of reporting mechanism for victims, such as hotlines and help lines

- Greater public visibility and awareness of the problem, through the collection and promotion of disaggregated and representative data at the national level: 

ECPAT will design practical research methodologies and measurement tools, support countries to replicate studies and research projects and help facilitate better quality research through ethical guidelines. ECPAT will also engage in existing large scale research initiative to ensure SEC indicator are integrated.

For each of these objectives a number of indicators have been developed. ECPAT will establish a baseline and develop national action plans which reflect both the national context and current priorities.



Specific secretariat objectives have been developed for advocating governments and engage with the private sector, including for financial commitments, promotion of preventative and responsive measures and for collecting disaggregated and representative data about SEC.

These objectives are:

- Advocate for increased actions by governments leading to the adoption and implementation of legal and policy frameworks. The secretariat will develop common advocacy asks and position papers and promote international legal standard. This will build on the knowledge and expertise on SEC within the organisation

- Advocate for increased political and financial commitments by governments for strengthened law enforcement and better access to justice systems. The secretariat will tap into ongoing advocacy and campaigns, undertake research into and promote effective systems and responses for law enforcement as well as facilitate multicounty collaboration, especially to address increased vulnerability of children through socio-economic disparities.

- Engage with private sector leading to more concrete actions to improve child protection. The secretariat will advocate for binding human rights standards for targeted sector industries to include childrens right and child protection measures, including in on-line gaming. Codes of conduct will be promoted and implemented (through the Code) in the travel and tourism industries. Both mandates set by governments and self-regulatory bodies will be advocated for.

- Promote increased access to adequate response and support systems for at-risk children and victims of SEC. The secretariat will build technical expertise of the network by collecting on the ground success to inform best practice programs and initiatives and conduct innovative research. They will play a key role in knowledge leadership, facilitation, and coordination.

- Promote and support the use of preventative education initiatives that stop all types of SEC, leading to greater awareness among children and parents and caregivers. The secretariat will advocate for and support the design and implementation of evidence based preventable education and training program children, adults and vulnerable communities.

- Advocate for state responsibility towards regularly collecting and making public, disaggregated and representative data about SEC. The secretariat will design practical research methodologies and measurement tools for understanding the modus of operand of offenders and the changing trends of SEC, and support members to take on and replicating models developed or tested by the secretariat.

The secretariat will also develop Global Progress Indicators, to track the state of SEC against pre-identified parameters. This will enable more effective national and global advocacy and call for better access to quality data.</narrative>
