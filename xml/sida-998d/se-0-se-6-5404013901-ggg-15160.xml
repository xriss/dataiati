    <narrative xml:lang="EN">General question: Results related to the intended outcome 2016Question: Summarise results related to the intended outcome (this information will be sent to Open Aid)Answer: ICJ developed a new strategic and operational plan for the period 2016-2020 which means that the formulation of the previous four strategic goals have been slightly redefined to capture a change rather than state the end goal. The new plan also includes a fifth strategic goal - increased domestic implementation of and compliance with international and regional human rights laws and standards. This is not new work for ICJ but rather a different and more visible way to show the extensive work done to ensure domestic implementation of international human rights law. However, there have been some challenges for ICJ in reporting in accordance with this goal and ICJ is still to decide how they want to report in the future.

ICJ has delivered results in all goal areas and at all levels - international, regional and national. Below is a short overview of activities per goal area. The annual progress report includes a number of concrete examples or results per goal area.

1) Throughout the year, ICJ has contributed to strengthen the independence of the judiciary,
including the need to observe appropriate mechanisms for the selection, appointment, promotion, transfer, and discipline of judges and prosecutors in line with international norms and standards. ICJ has also intervened to protect individual judges, prosecutors, and lawyers against interference, intimidation and attacks and to ensure their security. In 2016, there was a worrying global trend of the increased use of the judicial system to harass and persecute lawyers, for
example in Azerbaijan, Egypt, Guatemala, Turkey and Thailand among other
countries. In 2016, there were at least 985 judges and lawyers trained on the independence
of the judiciary in 27 seminars and workshops. There were 50 advocacy interventions on the independence of judges and lawyers.

2) Access to justice for all

Throughout the year, ICJ urged governments around the world to take coordinated action to protect the human rights of migrants and refugees, which was the focus of this year&#x2019;s annual Geneva Forum of Judges and Lawyers. ICJ also continued its focus on the impact of the operations of business enterprises on human rights, including in rural communities and among indigenous peoples. In many countries human rights defenders continued to face harassment and
persecution, often for the exercise of internationally protected rights, such as freedoms of expression, association, and assembly. ICJ monitored and reported on violations of guarantees of due process of law or fair trial rights. ICJ also called for reform of laws and the end to the practise of the trial of civilians before military courts. ICJ continued its work in the area of women&#x2019;s access to justice and on human rights protections arising from sexual orientation and gender identity. During 2016, there were at least 1110 lawyers, HRDs, judges and prosecutors trained on access to justice in 23 seminars and workshops. There were 22 legal interventions and 85 advocacy interventions on access to justice. 

3) ICJ works to combat impunity and make the truth known by ensuring those responsible for gross human rights violations, serious violations of international humanitarian law and crimes under international law are brought to justice. Accountability also acts as a deterrent to prevent further human rights violations through guarantees of non-repetition, thus also linked to the right of
victims to reparation. Throughout the year, ICJ supported legal cases against perpetrators and provided expert opinions in cases of gross human rights violations, such as torture and ill-treatment, sexual violence, extrajudicial executions and enforced disappearances. ICJ also worked to empower communities and individuals to demand truth, justice and reparation.
During 2016, 574 judges, lawyers, and HRDs were trained on issues related to
accountability in 22 seminars and workshops. There were 49 legal interventions

4) International human rights instruments and mechanisms are protected and made more effective

ICJ engaged with international and regional human rights systems and mechanisms to further their effectiveness, as well as to guard against attacks aimed at diminishing the scope and effectiveness of their mandates. ICJ sought to strengthen the institutions of the UN Treaty Bodies, including the individual complaints procedures, and the UN Human Rights Council and its
Special Procedures and Universal Periodic Review. In partnership with other civil society organisations, ICJ carried out advocacy to ensure that emerging systems in the League of Arab States (LAS) and ASEAN regions for the monitoring and protection of human rights be transformed into robust and effective systems and that the longer-established systems in Europe, Africa and the Americas are not undermined. At the international level ICJ engaged with the different processes to strengthen normative and operational frameworks to prevent human rights
violations and abuses, including by businesses, and to ensure effective remedies and reparation for victims. During 2016, 110 judges, lawyers and HRDs were trained on international and regional mechanisms in 5 seminars and workshops. ICJ has worked towards the establishment of an international legally binding instrument to address business and human rights. ICJ has also worked together with a child rights organisation on a guide with focus on state obligations with regard to the impact of the business sector on childrens rights. 

5) Increased domestic implementation of and compliance with international and regional human rights laws and standards are achieved

The ICJ has worked with domestic actors in order to enhance national advocacy on ensuring international human rights law is fully reflected in domestic law, policies and practises. This has been done through knowledge exchange and networking, country-level initiatives, support for HRDs and through advocacy and litigation. During the year, the ICJ made practical interventions on institutional reforms, policies and other measures where States&#x2019; human rights obligations have either not been implemented into law and/or have not been complied with in practise. In 2016, there were a total of 225 lawyers trained on domestic implementation of regional and international human rights standards in 8 seminars and workshops.</narrative>
