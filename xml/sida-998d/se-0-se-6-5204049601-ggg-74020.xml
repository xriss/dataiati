    <narrative xml:lang="SV">&#xD6;vergripande fr&#xE5;ga: Resultat kopplat till avsedd effekt 2015Fr&#xE5;ga: Sammanfatta resultat relaterade till avsedd effekt (denna information kommer att skickas till Open Aid).Svar: 2015 was an important year for UNISDR with the adoption of the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030 at the Third UN World Conference on Disaster Risk Reduction (WCDRR) in March 2015. Furthermore, UNISDR contributed to the work of the Inter-Agency Expert Group on SDG Indicators, and submitted proposals for the indicators that promote the alignment between the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Sendai Framework. The fourth edition of the Global Assessment Report on DRR (GAR15) was launched by the UN Secretary General in March 2015, that presents the results in a unique global risk modelling effort, the only fully probabilistic risk assessment in existence. 

Three high-level multi-stakeholder partnership dialogues took place on: Mobilizing Women&#x2019;s Leadership for DRR; Risk Sensitive Investments: Public-Private Partnerships; and Inclusive Disaster Risk Management &#x2013; Governments, Communities and Groups Acting Together. UNISDR developed substantive elements for each dialogue, including preparation of issue briefs, supporting speakers and managing the organizing teams. 

In the fourth and final cycle of review, 2013-2015, 110 countries reported on national progress in implementing the HFA. These reviews facilitated the exchange of good practices and mutual learning, and the findings and recommendations have been presented to governments for consideration in policy development.  Furthermore, UNISDR&#x2019;s Regional Platforms for DRR, played a key role in promoting DRR for climate change adaptation. For instance: 

During the year, UNISDR&#x2019;s office in Northeast Asia assembled a total of 35 events and workshops. Over 1,200 government officials from national and local levels from 37 countries were trained, contributing to a growing network of leaders and key actors on the frontlines of resilience building. The office developed a &#x201C;Make your business disaster and climate resilient&#x201D; tool and used it to train 222 businesses and organisations in seven countries. Furthermore, the Pacific Regional Disaster Resilience Meeting was held in Fiji in October, and continued to be the pre-eminent DRR gathering for stakeholders. 

The Regional office for the Americas built on existing partnerships with leading institutions in the Latin America and the Caribbean region to engage relevant groups on implementing the Sendai Framework&#x2019;s outcomes and priorities. In Brazil, the number of local governments that joined the campaign increased by more than 100% between 2014-15, from 324 to 691 cities. The Regional office also led two inter-agency DRR assessments in Uruguay and Panama as part of the implementation of the UN Plan of Action on DRR for Resilience as a pilot. By the end of 2015, 27 countries in the Americas had developed loss and damage databases to estimate the economic costs and impacts of disasters, to develop predictive models of future economic losses. 

The Regional office for Africa is responsible for DRR coordination in 44 countries. They convened frequent meetings during the preparatory process and negotiations to ensure high level of representation and &#x201C;one voice&#x201D; for Africa in Sendai. This contributed directly to shaping the Sendai Framework. Prior to the World Conference, the Regional Office enhanced a self-assessment by Member States and their DRR status. 33 of the countries submitted biennial national progress reports on the implementation of the HFA, which is the highest level achieved across the five reporting cycles in over a decade. 

The Regional Office for Arab States reached an important milestone with the &#x201C;Arab Region Meeting for the Implementation of the Sendai Framework for DRR&#x201D; which was held in Cairo in November 2015. The meeting assembled 125 DRR experts from 14 Arab countries, representing governments, cities, civil society, academic institutions, regional technical organisations and international partners. Key outcomes included improved understanding of the Sendai Framework and how it relates to regional commitments and priorities on DRR, and an agreement to review the Arab Strategy for DRR to align it with the targets and priorities of Sendai Framework. As the final cycle of the HFA reporting closed, 15 out of 22 Arab countries had completed their reporting, which is the highest number for the region yet. 

In 2015, the UNISDR Regional Office for Europe focused on maintaining the active contribution of the European countries to the World Conference and the Sendai Framework. After the adoption of the Framework in March, the Office began to work on its implementation in Europe through several processes, notably the &#x201C;European Forum for DRR&#x201D;. The Regional Office continue to support Europe&#x2019;s 26 national platforms for DRR, organising six national platform meetings and reviews for alignment with the Sendai Framework. 

In contribution to the programme on Risk Informed Public Policy and Investment, UNISDR and partners developed and updated national disaster loss databases in over 90 countries, as a basis for risk informed decision-making and investment, and for achieving the first four of the seven Sendai Framework targets. Additionally, to provide an independent and neutral assessment of the economics of risk, UNISDR also produced summary probabilistic risk profiles for every country in the world. The profiles are complemented with a web-based, open-data, open source visual Risk Data Platform, which provides interactive access to hazard, exposure and risk maps globally. 

Evidence demonstrates that fast economic growth combined with rapid population expansion in urban areas, regularly concentrates risk in hazard-exposed locations, increasing disaster vulnerability and exposure. UNISDR&#x2019;s Global Education Training Institute (GETI) established a team of experts through 27 workshops on Urban Risk Reduction Capacity Development for Making Cities Resilient, which in 2015 trained over 1,200 local government participants from 37 countries. UNISDR&#x2019;s Making Cities Resilient Campaign has been the primary tool for awareness and capacity building. Cities joining the campaign became part of a global alliance of local governments committed to and investing in building resilience. By the end of 2015, the campaign included 3,098 cities (658 new cities during the year) and municipalities globally, covering over 700 million people from 119 countries. 

UNISDR focused on mainstreaming gender aspects in planning and implementing DRR policies. In the lead up to the World Conference, UNISDR supported stakeholder consultations, partner dialogues and the development of background papers and briefs that promoted and highlighted women&#x2019;s leadership and the role of gender equality in building resilience. Thus, the Sendai framework became a turning point by recognizing women&#x2019;s role in risk reduction efforts. UNISDR further supported efforts to ensure that the proposed set of indicators and targets to monitor implementations are gender-sensitive. 


In terms of advocacy and communication, UNISDR&#x2019;s website traffic exceeded 500,000 unique visitors for the first time, due to events mentioned above drove content development and social media output, including the publication of 208 stories and 40 press releases. UNISDR&#x2019;s result-based management system followed a result-oriented programme planning, monitoring and evaluation approach that comprised an integrated package of tools for analysing and solving planning problems and for designing and managing their solutions.</narrative>
