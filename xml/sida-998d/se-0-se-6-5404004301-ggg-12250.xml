    <narrative xml:lang="EN">General question: Results related to the intended outcome 2014Question: Summarise results related to the intended outcome (this information will be sent to Open Aid)Answer: Aim 1: Develop and advocate national/regional policy solutions to address ABR challenges

ReAct has been actively involved both at national and global levels, and directly offered expertise to shape recommendations to combat antibiotic resistance and ensure access to affordable antibiotics. A concrete result has been the development of a National Action Plan on AMR in Ghana, which ReAct supported. In parallel with assisting this policy development process in Ghana, an outcome of another ReAct-led process to identify champions in the region was the formation of a ReAct Africa node, in May 2014. In 2014, ReAct Latin America were invited to participate in a regional conference on public health, with more than 1200 participants from 20 countries, and introduced ABR as an urgent threat. This started a process that lead to El Salvador taking the lead in the region, in the creation of National Action Plans on ABR.

Aim 2: Increase visibility of ABR in the global health dialogue together with global and local stakeholders

ReAct has acted as a catalyst, urging global and local stakeholders to recognize the magnitude of this public health threat. ReAct has also highlighted the consequences ABR can have beyond the health sector including development issues and the need for a holistic solution. Examples of concrete results are: in 2012, ReAct responded to a request from the WHO secretariat on AMR, to deliver a stakeholder analysis on actors in the field, in 2013, ReAct was commissioned by the WHO/Alliance for Health Policy and Systems Research to produce case studies on innovations tackling ABR, and in June 2015, and in June 2015, ReAct participated in the first UN Briefing on &#x2018;&#x2019;Antimicrobial Resistance: An Emerging Global Threat&#x2019;&#x2019;. In addition, ReAct has given input to other high-level meetings at the WHO, European Union, and the UN.

Aim 3: Gather and disseminate evidence and best practices for managing ABR 

A toolbox facilitating action on antibiotic resistance was launched in 2014. This became a core resource for ReAct&#x2019;s work on policy implementation, as well as the organization&#x2019;s everyday work. ReAct also supported the AMR team at WHO with the development of a strategy for a surveillance system. On a regional level, ReAct measured carriage of resistance in newborn children in Ecuadorian hospitals, which was used as an advocacy tool, demonstrating the need for a national policy, and improvements in infection control. On the dissemination on evidence, ReAct has coordinated and co-authored a Lancet Infectious Diseases Commission on Antibiotic Resistance, edited and co-authored a report on new business models for antibiotic innovation, among many other publications.

Aim 4: Identify, develop and seed innovative solution approaches for R&amp;D and for rational use, affordability and equitable access to antibiotics

ReAct has played an important role in ongoing policy initiatives for the development of new antibiotics and has advised policymakers on the complex and interrelated challenges of innovation, access and conservation. Coming out of the World Health Assembly in May 2013, WHO had been charged with organizing a regional consultative process to solicit ideas on how to pilot models of innovation through demonstration projects. ReAct submitted three different proposals, two of which made it to this global evaluation round. In addition, ReAct has been a strong driver in making sure any new model for antibiotic development must include strong provisions to secure rational use and global access to new antibiotics.

Aim 5: Develop training and education on ABR
Activities in this field have ranged from local projects in ReAct nodes that engaged school children, to the education of infectious disease doctors in Timor Leste. In Thailand, ReAct supported the existing Antibiotic Smart Use Project, which aims to reduce unnecessary consumption of antibiotics in hospitals and in the community. ReAct also worked to introduce the Smart Use project in Indonesia. In Ecuador, three major training courses for almost 500 people including health care personnel were organized. In addition, numerous smaller events and workshops have been organized, with a focus on working with &#x2018;champion&#x2019; communities to develop and seed alternative ways of dealing with ABR, particularly for children, youth and women.

Aim 6: Develop of networks and strengthen overall coordination and fundraising

In the period of 2011-2015, ReAct has worked to further develop its network and to facilitate collaboration, both within the organization and with external partners around the world. Since 2013, ReAct has has worked to reduce its reliance on its founder, improve monitoring and evaluation and increase fundraising capabilities. During this period, co-funding and direct funding has been sought and received from many different funders. 

RESULTS CSO PROJECT
The project provided valuable insights into how countries can engage communities when developing and implementing national action plans to manage antibiotic resistance, which was the long-term aim of the project.This three year project has strived to extend community-based health promotion and education networks to reach parents, children and youth, and to foster positive health behaviour including ABR management.

Key achievements:
Ecuador: The Child to Child Foundation (CCF) in Ecuador has successfully trained teachers and trainers in a number of schools, and have provided knowledge, skills and tools for health promotion including topics of antibiotic use and ABR. In turn, several teachers and schools have participated in the development of training materials and introduced health topics, the microbial world and ABR in the pedagogical activities. Also, the school children have been educated and participated in many activities to develop information products and promote awareness on the issues. 

Nicaragua: Teachers in eight schools were trained in concepts of ABR and antibiotic use and on how to include these issues in their teaching. Subsequent activities were carried out with school children and their parents. The end of project survey indicated increased knowledge of the teachers and children on several topics related to the focus of the project, including the microbial world, antibiotic misuse and ABR. In addition, representatives from the health and education sector as well as local authorities were trained on concepts of antibiotics and ABR and now have a broader understanding of the related problems and consequences.

Indonesia: YOP successfully integrated the issues of appropriate antibiotic use and ABR into their agenda and carried out a multitude of successful interventions. YOP has firmly established itself as one of the leading organizations working with ABR in Indonesia, and their work has positioned them by target stakeholders as the reference source for health promotion interventions on antibiotics and ABR in the country. Furthermore, the organization is actively engaged in the policy making process as members of the &#x201C;Committee on Management of Antimicrobial Resistance&#x201D; (KPRA) that has been established by the Indonesian MOH.

Thailand: A major outcome of the project was the formation of two local networks where key stakeholders were trained on antibiotic use and ABR using the train the trainer methodology. At the end of the project, the networks could independently develop and organize a variety of activities to educate people in the community. The coordinating CSOs adapted and produced a number of educational materials for training and support of involved local networks. 

Malaysia: Through community outreach projects and training of trainers workshops, the CSO-project has helped to to educate communities and local government officials about responsible use of antibiotics and antibiotic resistance. Furthermore, the project involved healthcare professionals, including pharmacy and medical students to raise awareness for ABR and to promote appropriate use of antibiotics.

Ghana: Through a study, the CSO project mapped gaps in knowledge and awareness and subsequently developed a training of trainers framework for community outreach. By involving local leaders throughout the process, the CSO project was able to generate broad support within communities. The KAPB study was also used as part of the initial situation analysis that was conducted in preparation for the development of a national AMR policy in Ghana</narrative>
