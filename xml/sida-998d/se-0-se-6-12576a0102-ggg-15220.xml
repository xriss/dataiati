   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Sida supports the&#xA0;United Network of Young Peacebuilders (UNOY)&#xA0;through core funding that will enable the network to strengthen its mission to unite youth organisations&#xA0;working to build peace across the world. By furthering the regionalization of the network, enhancing collaboration, ownership and gender sensitivity and by strengthening the network&apos;s International Secretariat, UNOY will be able to go beyond short-term, project-based activities and scale up all four action areas in support of its Strategic Plan for 2016-2020:&#xA0;Strengthening organisations as mobilisers of&#xA0;young peacebuilders; Developing young people&apos;s capacities for conflict transformation; Building&#xA0;a global network with a shared feeling of ownership; Raising youth voices through advocacy.
UNOY Peacebuilders key purpose is to support and empower its members by enabling them to truly boost the power of peace. Members of the network can benefit from trainings and on-line workshops, but also assist other members through cross-learning experiences and peer-to-peer support. 
Members of the network have access to common tools such as a hands-on guide on monitoring, evaluation and learning and a UNSCR 2250 Toolkit for Youth and practical guide. To strengthen individual capacities, UNOY Peacebuilders offer Training of Trainers to develop skills in leading conflict transformation through 8 week-long online training prior to an onsite training and multiplier activities at local level. As advocacy is central to peacebuilding in shaping policy and practice, young people are also trained to become stronger advocates. Out of the young people trained in 2015, 83% later indicated that they applied their acquired skills in their work. Milestones in UNOYs Advocacy work includes the members contributions to the adoption of the August 2015 Amman Declaration on Youth, Peace, and Security; the adoption of UNSCRs 2250 and 2419 and the UNSC Open Debate on YPS in April 2018. At a regional level, UNOY members among others contributed to the November 2017 adoption of the Abidjan Declaration and the Youth Agenda of AU-EU Youth Plug-In Initiative.
In an effort to build a stronger global network, UNOY Peacebuilders has focused more and more on decentralization through a new regional structure within the network. Members also meet on a yearly basis at the annual Young Peacebuilders Forum, created to provide a dynamic environment for young peacebuilders to interact and undertake informal learning that has direct impact on their work on the ground.
Sidas support to UNOY Peacebuilders aims at encouraging a broader sense of ownership among its members, strengthening the network to act as an interlocutor between grassroots organisations and the international peacebuilding community, and channeling local youth-led peacebuilding to the regional and global levels.
Sida also foresees that support to UNOY Peacebuilders will&#xA0;further assist global efforts to&#xA0;carry the recommendations of the Progress Study on Youth, Peace and Security and Security Council Resolutions 2250 and 2419 forward.</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">The report is well-structured and informative, providing a comprehensive picture of development over the year (Sidas assessment, Dox: 029513/21). The report also includes reflections on challenges due to restrictions during the COVID-19 pandemic and a network report presenting areas of focus and achievements in the six different regions. Apart from the annual review meeting held on 16 December 2021, several catch-up meetings were held both during 2020 and 2021. Sida was also this year invited to take part in the yearly meeting (digitally) with the International Steering Group and Regional Coordinators on 8  10 October 2021 during which developments in the six regions covered by the network were presented in more detail.

Summary of results
During 2020, members of the network included 106 youth-led grassroot organisations operating in 63 countries at national, local and regional levels. More than 12 million young people interacted with UNOY members and UNOY estimates that more than 22 million interacted indirectly, reaching a total of 34 million young people worldwide during 2020. A large contributing factor to the increase in engagement has to do with the many digital activities that were provided as a result of the movement restrictions during the COVID-19 pandemic. An increased use of traditional and social media, among others in Cameroon and Pakistan was also noted.

Under each of the three outcome areas focused on during 2020, UNOY reports several results.

1. Empowering youth leaders and organisations
UNOY directly empowered 1,156 young peacebuilders with skills and knowledge to transform conflicts, promote peace, and support civic engagement. This includes sustaining a pool of trainers and the provision of on-line resources, such as Youth4Peace Training Toolkit and 2250: A Youth Toolkit. During 2020, specific training was also provided on financial sustainability. The Youth360 methodology was launched, in collaboration with Search for Common Ground, that aims to resource youth. This improved UNOY member organizations financial sustainability and advocated for meaningful youth participation on global, regional and local platforms. Twelve grants proposals were developed and a total of 33 small grants provided to members through different funders, mostly in Asia. UNOYs internal re-granting mechanism, supported by Sida, led to three grants aimed at youth-led projects on peaceful responses and community resilience to the consequences of COVID-19.

2. Young people as partners for peace
UNOY finalized the regionalisation of its network structure with six Regional Coordinators. This inspired members participation in UNOYs governance elections and strategic planning consultations, as well as an increase in member-led initiatives in different regions with 84% of members participating in at least one regional meeting during 2020. Member-led working groups were also run on gender, membership and fundraising. Two years after the Young Peacebuilders Forum in Bogota, 70% of participants indicate that they have become part of a larger network of youth activists.

3. Challenging the barriers against youth inclusion
Under outcome three, UNOYs efforts to address the structural barriers that prevent youth inclusion led to significant steps in terms of global, regional and national implementation of 2250. UNOY Peacebuilders directly fed in to the third UN Security Council Resolution on YPS (2535), including important recommendations from members on access to funding and the need to protect civic space for young peacebuilders. UNOY members also participated in one Open Debate and two Arria-Formula meetings on YPS held by the UN Security Council. Several YPS frameworks were contributed to, including for AU, the MENA Coalition, Finlands National Action Plan, the Canadian YPS Coalition, the Yemen YPS pact, the Nigerian coalition on YPS, the US YPS Coalition and the Dutch at Heart strategy. UNOY also released the first YPS journal developed by the new Youth Researchers Network and members participated in developing guidelines on youth-inclusive peace processes. UNOY continues to co-chair the Global Coalition on YPS, the APINY TWG-YPS and GPPACs YPS working group.  

Section 2 of the Annual Review report gives highlights of the members work. The most common thematic areas include peace education; civic action and community building; gender equality; and participation in peace processes and/or reconciliation initiatives. Out of all network members, 85% work on a voluntary basis. Apart from challenges in raising funds for youth-led peacebuilding, members also see representation and support from local decision-making as limiting their engagement. Specific focus during the year was also on protection of civic space, with 30% of members reporting intimidation and threats of violence as a result of their peacebuilding work.

Strategic plan 2020 - 2025

While originally planned to take place during a General Assembly meeting with all members present, the COVID-19 restrictions led to an on-line consultative process that reflected on progress towards the YPS-agenda, continued challenges and how the network could take these on through the new strategic plan. UNOY members agreed to focus on removing five structural barriers to meaningful youth participation in peace and security: threats to civic space for young peacebuilders; under-resourcing of their efforts; lack of meaningful youth participation; unequal engagement of youth as partners; and disregard of creative youth approaches. As a result, five new goals were identified:

We are protected; We are resourced; We are meaningful participants; We are equal partners; We are creative changemakers.

Financial/audit reports
In 2020, UNOY spent a greater part of the planned costs while programming and budgeting were impacted by the COVID-19 restrictions. This for instance meant that the costs for the scheduled General Assembly were not used as on-line consultations instead were held. Structural grants (unearmarked funding) amounted to 412 115 EURO which is 72 % of the total income for 2020. Unrestricted funding comprise funding from Sida of 345 302 EURO, from the Council of Europe (16 811 EURO) and EC Erasmus (50 000 EURO). Earmarked project funding amount to 153 570 EURO. The funding allocated from Sida hence comprises 61 % of the total funding compared to 54 % in 2019.

The audit report states that the financial statements give a true and fair view. Audit recommendations include ensuring that changes made by the board to change signatories to the on-line banking should be documented and four-eye principle should be implemented for reserve transfers. UNOY is also recommended to check to what extent existing internal controls with regards to sanctions legislations already are in place, and whether additional measures are needed. The auditors further recommend to investigate whether an obligatory branch pension regulation is applicable as UNOY currently does not use pension regulations.

In addition to the financial and audit reports, UNOY submitted an updated action plan on the review of internal control commissioned by Sida in May 2019.</narrative>
