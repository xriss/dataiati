  </description>
  <description akvo:type="5" type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Primary school completion rates and student performance in Uganda are drastically low despite recent Government policies improvements. This programme seeks to improve quality of education and strengthen and expand child, parental, and community participation in school matters in four districts in Uganda through advocacy and the ongoing engagement of children, parents, and other stakeholders.</narrative>
  </description>
  <description akvo:type="6" type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Ugandan Government adopted the policy of Universal Primary Education in 1997. Consequently, since 1996, primary school enrollment increased from 3 million to 14 million pupils. However, many issues remain, with half of students enrolled in primary school repeating grades or dropping out due to poverty (low household income level), inadequate support from parents, poor learning environment at schools, forced child marriage, and inhibiting cultural attitudes concerning the role of girls. In addition, learning outcomes are still poor: school completion rates stand at 71% at the end of primary school and 40% in at the end of secondary school, and the 2010 national assessment revealed that 98% of primary grade 3 children could not read or understand primary level 2 texts, and 80% could not solve at least two primary 2 level sums. Learning conditions are also poor: teacher absenteeism is common, 14% of schools have no standard classrooms and class sizes often surpass 100 children.</narrative>

  <description akvo:type="10" type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The programme seeks to increase stakeholders&#x2019; participation in school governance processes by building the capacity of parental and community groups, strengthening partnerships between governments and stakeholders, easing their access to information, and creating an easily replicable, low cost model for participation. This will reduce the gaps in information between stakeholders and schools, increase the efficiency and effectiveness of primary education, and contribute to an attitude of ownership resulting in sustained and meaningful citizen participation at local and national levels. 
Political and institutional sustainability
The programme will strengthen partnerships with District education offices that are mandated to monitor education standards. It is anticipated that, by supporting the strengthening of government mandated education governance bodies, the government will continue to fulfil their role after project completion.
At a policy level, the best practices and lessons learnt during the project implementation, will be documented and used for evidence-based policy advocacy, i.e. feeding into the Education Policy Sector Review.  The project will enable existing structures to have a greater voice and impact on school governance. 
Social and environmental sustainability: One way to ensure social sustainability is to increase community involvement. Community members will be actively involved in the process of interventions through planning, implementation, and evaluation. In this, they are expected to acquire skills and knowledge that will later enable them to take over the project.  Thus, sustainability of the programme will depend on the self-reliance of targeted communities.
Secondly, the impact of media activities, such as radio broadcasts, will have a significant impact on increasing awareness of issues affecting participation and access to quality education especially by the vulnerable children, as well as challenging mandated institutions to increase their commitment to quality service delivery.
Environmental sustainability will be enhanced through the inclusion of environmental awareness issues in dialogue meetings between community members, teachers, and district authorities. At the school level, the SMC action plans will ensure that schools plan to take a low-impact approach on the environment and are aware of issues related to environmental degradation such as charcoal burning and deforestation. 
Financial sustainability
The programme is designed to require minimal subsidies and to mobilise government, school, community and individual resources for the activities of the project. Participation in education governance need not be expensive, which is taken into account in the model. In addition, support for capacity building and service delivery will be carefully monitored during model development.
Exit strategy
Preparations for phase-out will be included starting at project implementation with an assessment of the capacity of various groups to become self-sustaining to identify and address existing gaps.  A separate phase-out plan will be developed and implemented in Luweero since Plan will phase out from the district completely by the end of FY15. The committees will periodically conduct informal conversations with participating and non-participating families to monitor the progress of the phase out plan and will provide feedback and reminders on observations and impressions. The districts will be supported to scale up the PSGC activities to other schools in the districts. We will have exit meetings in all targeted communities and will support the communities&#x2019; gradual ownership of programme actions.</narrative>

  <description akvo:type="7" type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This is the third phase of the Participatory School Governance for Children (PSGC) programme started in 2009. The programme has been implemented in 50 primary schools in Tororo and Luweero districts and will be expanded to 40 new schools in Lira and Kamuli districts in this programme phase.
This phase of the programme will focus on addressing issues of low primary school completion rates and the poor quality of primary education by increasing the interest and participation of children, parents, and communities in school governance activities. The current national school governance system described in Ugandan education policy emphasizes community participation in school governance but has little emphasis to the role of the learners. In addition, the Parent-Teacher Associations (PTAs) and School Management Committees entrusted with overseeing education services on behalf of the government and local communities are in most cases weak and dysfunctional. Consequently, the school headmasters often remain the primary decision makers without the involvement of children, families, and the community. These issues will be addressed through awareness-raising and increasing the active involvement of students, parents and communities in children&#x2019;s primary education.
One aspect of the programme involves using mobile technology to improve communications, information sharing and governance between key participants in school governance. This will be done by holding training sessions in 50 project schools and providing two mobile phones (one for the girls and the other for the boys) per school. The mobile phones will be used by students to provide timely feedback on school governance issues; using a short code already provided by the service provider, stakeholders will be able to send and receive messages that will be analyzed and responded to by the respective stakeholders for action. The messages will then be used as evidence to advocate for implementation of policy changes and to negotiate with the government to adopt SMS platforms. 
Other challenges addressed in this phase of the project include:
&#x2022;	Inadequate coordination between the government and NGOs for the implementation of the project. This will be addressed through awareness raising and district-level coordination meetings between NGOs and government actors.
&#x2022;	Limited understanding of the concept of participation, especially of boys and girls, and parents, which can be seen in the reluctance of district leaders and education department officials, limiting their full participation, support and ownership in project activities. This will be addressed through various awareness-raising activities, trainings and ongoing engagements.  
&#x2022;	In both districts, political leaders have had interest in the programme and are forcing government education departments to scale up the project at a pace which may be too haphazard for some schools. While this is a good indicator that politicians are now appreciating the project, there is a fear that full-scale implementation without proper training of teachers and guiding documents in place may actually dilute an otherwise good project. However, this programme plans to continue awareness raising, capacity building and best-practices dissemination activities in a bid to reduce the knowledge gap on child participation among the key stakeholders.
&#x2022;	Knowledge generation and sharing of lessons has not been emphasized. Proper documentation on the benefits/successes of the participatory governance programme and instructions on how to start the programme in a given school have not yet been developed, which make replication of the model difficult. This is majorly due to the absence of an efficient and robust monitoring and evaluation system that collects data, generates reports and shares them with different stakeholders. This is an area that will be addressed by the Project team together with the Monitoring, Evaluation and Research Management team in this programme period.
In addition, the District Education Office&#x2014;which is responsible for monitoring education standards at the local government level&#x2014;will be strengthened in monitoring school performance and in engaging in the feedback process with students and parents. At the national level, the programme seeks to increase the engagement of civil society organisations in education processes and to encourage policy dialogues, debates and other sessions to build a body of evidence for proper policy implementation.</narrative>
