   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Advocacy at national and regional levels will be a key to ensuring sustainability. This involves engaging state and departmental bodies such as the Ministries of Health and Education and the Department of Health Services on issues of childhood care and development. In addition, strengthening state policies related to social services is a priority. A main goal is ensuring that the Bill of Comprehensive Early Childhood Development is adopted.

Another key issue for ensuring sustainability involves strengthening the capacities of state and local authorities for the development and implementation of policies and programs that ensure the rights of young children. Standards will be created that apply to programs at all levels, favouring early childhood programs that:

&#x2022;	Are aligned with regional and international rights frameworks;
&#x2022;	Are universal, equitable, inclusive, non-discriminatory, gender-sensitive and conducive to protection and development starting from the prenatal stage;
&#x2022;	Include provisions and resources for the effective realization of rights consistent with cultural contexts; and
&#x2022;	Include provisions and strategies to ensure cross-sector implementation.

Leveraging state responsibility is a vital part of ensuring the sustainability of programme actions, and a key project action involves promoting investments in this area, which plays an important role in the country&#x2019;s future economic and social development.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Around 40% of the population in Bolivia is under 15 years of age. Around half of the people in the country live under the poverty line and infant mortality rates are the highest in the region (50 deaths out of every 1,000 live births). This is the result of adverse growing conditions and poor nutrition beginning at the pre-natal stage, even before pregnancy. Chronic malnutrition affects 17% of children under 24 months and the number climbs to 30% in rural areas- Only 42% of children under 2 years old have an adequate psychosocial development, with the percentage being even lower among girls (38%). These early childhood deficiencies result in future learning problems due to issues with physical and social development of children growing up in unprotected environments. In addition, public awareness of the importance of early childhood development is still low, and enrolment in early education programs is only 63%.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In Bolivia, 37% of young children are not enrolled in early education programs and 30% of children under age 2 in rural areas suffer from malnutrition. This project promotes early childhood development and protection in 15 rural municipalities through parental training, early learning centre support, municipal service integration and advocating the Bolivian government for child-friendly policies.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project, titled &#x201C;Integrated Early Childhood Development and Protection in the Family and Community (PRODIPI-FC)&#x201D;, seeks to advance a holistic vision of childhood health and development that begins before birth. The first stage of the project began in 2009 and was implemented in 11 municipalities in Bolivia; in this third stage of the project (2015-2017), implementation will be expanded to 15 municipalities and will focus on gender equality and sustainability of project actions, with respect to cultural diversity and redefining parenting patterns. 

This project promotes an integrated, cross sectorial and holistic approach to early childhood development and supports the Bolivian government in the formulation and implementation of public policies that aim to fulfil the rights of young girls and boys. In communities, established ECCD centres provide girls and boys with quality and gender-sensitive early education and care and support smooth transition to primary school. Parenting sessions aim to provide mothers and fathers with the necessary skills to support the development of their children in a protective and stimulating environment. A special focus of the project is on advancing gender equality by promoting shared parenthood and equal treatment of girls and boys. Another important focus is to strengthen child protection in early childhood.

The project targets vulnerable girls and boys, with special attention given to disabled children, their mothers and fathers, as well as caretakers, teachers and public education, health and judicial staff at national, departmental and local level.

This project has the following focuses:
&#x2022;	Work in partnership with the state to implement a set of actions that ensure the non-discriminative protection and development of girls and boys under eight years at community and municipal management levels.
&#x2022;	Improve the care and protection with gender equality approach of young children by strengthening the skills of educators and civil servants in the education and health sectors and by building partnerships between them and families/communities.
&#x2022;	Promote empowerment and capacity building of parents and public servants on issues related to child protection and gender. Raise awareness of the issues of violence against children, their right to protection and non-discrimination, and the ways their rights can be enforced.
&#x2022;	Identify gaps in local and national legislation and implementation. Utilize standardized tools and indicators to influence governmental leaders on the importance of investing in early childhood care and development. Ensure that the Bill of Comprehensive Early Childhood Development is adopted.
&#x2022;	Using communications technology to support local, interagency management and monitoring of child development and protection systems.
&#x2022;	Collect, analyse, and communicate the experiences of project interventions in the numerous municipalities in order to influence public policies that favour the protection and development of young children.
&#x2022;	Improve actions related to protection will aim to prevent the abuse, negligence and violence affecting the children in Early Childhood in all possible Project scenarios, in a coordinated effort with other sectors and with a multidisciplinary and multi-sectoral approach.</narrative>
