   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Pakistan&#x2019;s economy has lost growth momentum since last 3 years; it is averaging around 2.6% as against 5.3% (last 8 years). Independent estimates suggest that poverty rate may have increased to an astonishing 43% of the total population estimated at 177.1 million in 2011. Pakistan is undergoing a dramatic demographic transition with approximately 66% of the total population below the age of twenty nine . The constitution of Pakistan gives equal rights to both men and women but in practice women are more confined to the family and household activities, comprising unpaid household work and farm and off-farm activities. The main hurdles to women&#x2019;s employment are social customs and traditions, illiteracy and limited facilities to vocational and technical skills learning. The primary reason for youth unemployment is the lack of the education, life, vocational and technical skills.</narrative>

2) Youth, particularly young women, from the targeted areas increase their levels of economic work (self or paid employment) in traditional and non-traditional occupations;
3) Local communities and parents increasingly recognize and encourage youth, particularly young women, to become socially and economically active members of society.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project is premised on pragmatic collaboration and sustainable partnerships between Technical and Vocational Training (TVET) providers and formal and non-formal sector-based industry and business. 

It strengthens existing TVET institutions and focuses on building institutional capacity to review and improve training models and competency-based curricula. As such it strengthens the quality, relevance and demand for TVET services. Increased enrolment, again, brings scale economies for the TVET institutes concerned. Minimal investments in classrooms and tools are only made after ascertaining that the infrastructure can be maintained by the institutions beyond the scope of the funding. 

Formal and non-formal businesses, again, are drawn to the project because it leads to savings in recruitment and training costs and as such, has high value also in the long term. 

The project is aligned with the National Youth Policy and its accompanying Action Plan, thus supporting the government in its youth employment agenda. At the same time, it builds the capacity of District-level youth forums to advocate for enhanced enforcement and inclusiveness of the Policy and to engage government on youth-focused, sustainable funding mechanisms, such as cost-sharing, loan schemes and ex-post fee structures. 

In order to ensure sustainability at the grassroots-level, communities play an active role in the design, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of the project. Participants for basic workforce preparation trainings are selected through participatory, community-based methods that ensure the involvement of young men and women. 

From an environmental perspective, Plan and its implementing partner work with young people and TVET institutes to ensure that vocational practices are environmentally sustainable and mitigate disaster risks.</narrative>
