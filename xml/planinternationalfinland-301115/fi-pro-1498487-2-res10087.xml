  <description akvo:type="6" type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In sub-Saharan Africa, 65% of children under the age of 5 live in poverty, 38% are stunted and the under-5 mortality rate of 98 deaths per 1,000 live births is more than 15 times the average for developed regions. This situation is aggravated by recent global concerns such as increasing food and fuel prices, natural calamities, conflicts and epidemics such as HIV/AIDS. These detrimentally impact the capacity of families to provide adequate care for their young children, especially among poor, rural and isolated areas. 
In addition, the coverage and quality of early childhood health, education and development services in the region is limited, especially in rural areas, with only 12% of children in Sub-Saharan Africa having attended private pre-primary education. This contributes to nearly half of the children who enroll in primary school dropping out or repeating grade one due to various reasons, including inadequate preparedness.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In the eastern and southern Africa region, programmes for young children have made a progressive shift from the traditional community-based preschools towards more comprehensive programs that include a wider age range, parenting education and a focus on the transition to primary school. These enhancements are strengthening the support for children younger than age 3 and older than 5 that were not being targeted nor receiving due attention. 

This regional project aims to promote a deeper appreciation for and strengthen the capacity of local actors in delivering quality, inclusive, community-based care and development programs for young children in eastern and southern Africa. The interventions are designed to enhance inter-country coordination, learning and interaction of early childhood care and development within and outside of Plan offices in southern and eastern Africa.

This collaboration has helped promote and support the development of flagship programs in four focus countries (Uganda, Kenya, Ethiopia and Mozambique) using a proven, comprehensive model called Community Led Action for Children (CLAC). 

The CLAC model is made up of several components that support children 0-8 years, beginning at the home and continuing through to preschool and early primary school. This model subscribes to the globally recognized &#x201C;4 Cornerstones to Secure a Strong Foundation for Young Children&#x201D; and includes the following four strategic priorities: 

1) Parenting programs to strengthen parents&#x2019; and caregivers&#x2019; knowledge on children&#x2019;s development 
2) Community-based &#x201C;Early learning and Play&#x201D; programs that provide access to  quality and inclusive early learning opportunities in their communities 
3) Transitions to primary programs to  promote timely enrolment and sustain support for quality learning in grades 1-3 and 
4) Policy advocacy and partnerships to enhance the capacity and collaboration of various Government &amp; non-government actors at multiple levels. 

This approach will be adopted by other project countries in the region (including Zambia, Rwanda, Egypt, Malawi, Tanzania and Zimbabwe). Opportunities to compare experiences among countries will provide practical references and insights on how this approach can best be integrated and /or adapted in different contexts, eventually being used in other regions and with other prospective partners.
The experiences and practices garnered and shared by the focus countries will be instrumental in amplifying the value of similar programs in this and other regions where early childhood care and development is a priority.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project directly benefits Plan staff implementing the early childhood care and development programmes in their respective countries. While the focus is on the four Plan Finland supported countries, all the other Plan offices in the region will benefit indirectly. The project enhances the quality, impact and coherence of the ECCD programming in the region.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This programme is anchored in Plan&#x2019;s main child-centred community development approach and aligned with global priorities and policies to ensure consistency with country-level strategic choices. Programming guidelines and resources were developed in consultation with country teams and shared widely to increase country-level ownership. This project seeks to create collaboration with other sectors and departments. In addition, the staff at the country level is given training and professional development opportunities to ensure that skills and knowledge are directly transferred into roles that directly support early childhood programmes. The design of the project promotes convergence and complementarity of available funding and technical support opportunities to maximize the comprehensiveness and coverage of project interventions.</narrative>
