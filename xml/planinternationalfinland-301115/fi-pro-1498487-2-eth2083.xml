   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Although legislation exists in Ethiopia to reduce the practice of harmful gender-discriminatory traditions such as female genital mutilation, the practices are still prevalent in some areas of the country. This programme seeks to raise awareness to eradicate these practices and to empower community-based organisations to protect girls and young women in 14 communities in the Bona Zuria district.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Financial sustainability
Most of the activities initiated during the project will not need substantial financial support to be sustained. The committees will continue functioning on a voluntary basis and will not require financial support and sustainability of community-based organisations (CBOs) will be ensured through small grants related to income generation.
School clubs supported by the project will require some financial support to cover their stationary related expenses. The project will negotiate with school management on how the clubs can benefit from ongoing income generating activities in schools. 

Institutional sustainability
CBOs are expected to take a lead in their communities in terms of combating harmful traditional practices and will continue the activities beyond the project end. The CBOs will be in close link with the committee-led Community Conversation groups and will follow up on their activities. 
Relevant government actors (the health office, police, judiciary etc.) will strengthen their reporting and responding mechanisms. The department of Women, Children, and Youth Affairs in particular will follow up on reported cases. It is expected that case management and ethical responses will be improved in the child protection unit of the police force and the social courts through the knowledge gained during the project. 
School clubs will continue to prepare and submit annual action plans on issues of FGM and HTPs to their school&#x2019;s principals. The school principals, together with the district education office, will continue following up on the school clubs&#x2019; activities. School clubs will continue benefitting from future trainings carried out by partner KMG in Bona Zuria. School clubs will also be linked with the community conversation committees and the CBOs for further support in the implementation of their activities. Tutorial classes will continue as part of the school structure. The project will negotiate with school management to allow the school clubs to continue with sensitization on HTPs after the project ends. 
Policy level sustainability
All the elements of the proposed interventions are part of current legislation and all necessary legal frameworks and policies already exist. Policy sustainability at the community level will be ensured by the bylaws set up by the new established community conversation committees. These committees will submit the bylaws to the Kebeles which will be further sent to the district level offices. The bylaws will then be validated by the district judges and the District Council. Activities will be linked to the work which KMG and Plan Ethiopia do on the national level, also improving sustainability.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The overall objective of the action is to contribute to the protection of children/youth from female genital mutilation and other harmful traditional practices.
The specific objective of the proposed action is to create a community-based system for protection against female genital mutilation, child marriage, and other harmful traditional practices in 14 kebeles (neighborhoods/communities) in Bona Zuria district.</narrative>

  <description akvo:type="7" type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project seeks to eradicate female genital mutilation (FGM) and other harmful traditional practices (HTPs) in 14 kebeles (neighborhoods/communities) in Bona Zuria district in Ethiopia. This will be accomplished by raising awareness and changing attitudes in the community and by strengthening grassroots-level community-based organizations (CBOs).
This project includes a wide range of awareness-raising interventions targeting various segments of the community. The use of community conversations, campaigns attached to various days commemorating children and women, and improving education through school clubs will enable us to reach the aspired number of population. 
In addition, community-based organisations will be directly involved in the implementation of the project. The project aims to strengthen their capacity to respond to FGM and other forms of HTPs and to facilitate coordination and networking among groups through training in community mobilization, gender mainstreaming, advocacy and networking, life skills and income-generating activities. Since poverty is strongly involved in the practice of FGM, the CBOs will also be involved in economically empowering adolescent girls and young women.
Project actions include holding community conversations in target villages on harmful practices in order to raise awareness; establishing and strengthening anti-HTP school clubs in at least 14 schools; and facilitating community led/participatory monitoring and evaluation systems. In addition, CBOs will be trained on community mobilization, sensitization, leadership, documentation, financial management, and other technical aspects such as life skills and income generating activities. Small grants will also be provided to local organisations to provide protection-related services/activities for children and young women.</narrative>

  <description akvo:type="6" type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Various harmful traditional practices are highly prevalent in Ethiopia and cause physical, emotional and psychological harm to a large number of its population, particularly women and girls. Although numerous efforts at the community, regional and national levels have contributed to a decline of harmful practices (namely female genital mutilation and child marriage), the practices are still widespread in various parts of the country, with the magnitude and pattern varying by region. Despite a growing public awareness regarding the criminality of these harmful practices, some people still fail to take firm action against these practices. The justifications for practicing these harmful practices are based on deeply entrenched discriminatory views and beliefs concerning the roles of women and children in society and within families.</narrative>
