   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In Togo, children with disabilities (girls especially) experience extensive discrimination. This project seeks to improve their rights to education and protection through community training and support, by strengthening Togo&#x2019;s legal framework and child protection mechanisms, and by building the capacity of Civil Society Organisations to advocate for services for children with disabilities.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In most traditional homes in Togo, children with disabilities are perceived and treated poorly. These children are often hidden in a room within the home, neglected, and marginalized from other family members and from the rest of the community. Some parents are ashamed and completely deny having a child with a disability. 

There are an estimated 306,000 children with disabilities in Togo. According to the situational analysis of child rights conducted by Plan Togo in 2010, 56.2% of these children are deprived of their right to education, compared with 23% of children without disabilities. Girls with disabilities experience double discrimination: they are less likely to get an education, receive vocational training and find employment when compared to both boys with disabilities and girls without disabilities.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project is a part of a continuing inclusion project in Togo. In this phase, project implementation will take place in three districts: Sotouboua, Tchamba and Moyen-Mono. These are among the most disadvantaged areas of the country and display extremely low school enrolment rates, especially among girls. The lack of ability for children with disabilities to perform certain activities leads to daily exclusion, violation of rights, and discrimination. These barriers do not allow young people with disabilities to participate in all aspects of community life. 

This project aims to empower communities to remove barriers that prohibit persons with disabilities from participating in community activities and from benefiting from community services, which include access to education, access to job opportunities, access to health services and access to recreation. The engagement of the whole community at all stages of the project is essential in integrating persons with disabilities into common programs. 

On the national level, Plan continues its lead role in advocating for the rights of children with a disability by directly addressing state duty bearers and by building the capacity of the national disability federation and the Child Rights coalition. Locally, civil society organisations will be strengthened, with the expectation that communities continue to manage activities after project completion. One goal of this project is to create a community-based rehabilitation model that can be used to influence national strategy and that will be adopted by other governmental institutions and non-governmental organizations.

This project also seeks to improve access to education and vocational training for children and youth with disabilities, especially for girls with disabilities. One project ambition is to work with multimedia centers in these districts to train children with disabilities who demonstrate technology-related skills. In addition, this project will implement sign language, Braille and alternative communication to ensure that children with language disabilities can exercise their right to freedom of expression and opinion. 

Due to the financial strain resulting from some disabilities, this project will implement new programmes in Village Savings and Loans groups for families with children who are disabled.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project places an emphasis on the participation of all community members.  Plan has established a &#x2018;self- help&#x2019; methodology, where children, their families, and communities learn the skills that are needed to manage and maintain projects. This approach increases the capacity of community leaders and community-based organizations in community-based project management to continue implementing project objectives long after the end of funding. 

By setting up and training community-based rehabilitation committees, community members and parents will acquire the necessary skills to manage and maintain project activities. Furthermore, the involvement of the Department of Social Action, parents, and children&#x2019;s clubs will help ensure continued participation in project activities.  Working with the government and other relevant players is an extremely important part of ensuring long-term impact; therefore, there is a focus on advocacy to ensure budget allocation.

Some project activities will always require external support, such as providing equipment for disabled children. This is a long-term process in the sense that, as the child grows, the unit must be modified and/or replaced, and the device costs can be prohibitive for most parents. This issue will be addressed by linking with other NGOs whose focus is purely on disabilities and by advocating the government for better support for people with disabilities. 

Before the end of the project, a phase-out strategy will be developed and implemented to prepare communities and other organisations to take over project activities.

Finally, the most important sustainable outcome of this project will be a change in attitude and behaviour in communities toward people with disabilities. By working to change the public&#x2019;s perception of people with disabilities and by practically increasing and realising their rights, we hope to see a long-term decrease in discrimination and greater participation of people with disabilities as fully participating members of society.</narrative>
