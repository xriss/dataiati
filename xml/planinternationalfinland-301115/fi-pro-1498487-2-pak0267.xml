  <description akvo:type="10" type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">All stakeholders (young women and men, communities, parents, TVET Institutes, public, private and social sector organizations etc.) will play a part in implementing the project and consequently continuing with its sustainability. The project will be implemented in line with the Action Plan for the National Youth Policy and skills policy at district levels. At present, policy legislation has been comprehensively designed but minimally implemented. In addition, skills training has been devolved to the mandate of provincial governments. This project will represent a flagship programme at both district and provincial levels, providing recommendations to the Pakistani Government for how to proceed in the future. Social and environmental sustainability Environmental factors will be considered in the choice of which vocational subjects to support. Plan and implementing partners will work with young people and TVET institutions to ensure that vocational practices are environmentally sustainable and mitigate disaster risks; e.g., participants will be asked during trainings to complete an environment checklist to ensure that no adverse environmental consequences are occurring due to the use of technology or production methods. Financial sustainability Financial sustainability will be secured by strengthening the capacity of the target households to maximise their opportunities for employment or self-employment, diversify income and build sustainable asset bases. The project hopes to strengthen the quality, relevance and demand for TVET services. Increased enrolment, in turn, will help bring about economies of scale for TVET institutions. In addition, the minimal investment in classrooms and tools will be made only after ascertaining that the infrastructure will continue to be maintained by institutions after the project has been completed.

Phase-out strategy:
The phase out strategy will support TVET institutes and allow them to sustainably carry out its operations by offering trainings for uneducated school dropouts who display career growth potential. Attitudinal change will be brought about at the community level through concerted awareness campaigns and at the Government level through youth advocacy.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Disadvantaged youth, particularly young women, are socially and economically empowered to improve their position in society. This will be accomplished through better access to quality market-driven training and financial services; increased assets, agency, and skills to seek employment or entrepreneurship; better recognition and encouragement from communities and parents; ensuring that policies, plans, practices and products of government, private sector and training institutions are responsive to the employment needs of marginalised youth, especially young women.</narrative>

  <description akvo:type="6" type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Pakistan is undergoing a dramatic demographic transition. The total population of Pakistan is 184 million (2013 estimates) with a youth population (15-29 yrs) of 55 million, 62% of whom live in rural areas. The vast majority of those living in rural areas work directly or indirectly in agriculture, with a majority being under-employed and engaged in unskilled manual work. There are few opportunities to improve their technical/vocational skills and capacities. The situation for young women is especially difficult. Gender relations in Pakistan rest on rigid patriarchal perceptions that place restrictions on girls&#x2019; and women&#x2019;s behavior, permitting them only limited contact with the opposite sex and limiting their mobility. This general attitude combined with inadequate facilities for learning vocational and technical skills severely limits women&#x2019;s employment possibilities.</narrative>

  <description akvo:type="7" type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project is a continuation of Finland&#x2019;s Ministry of Foreign Affairs&#x2019; funded on-going project &#x201C;Youth Economic Empowerment (YEE) through Creating Access to Quality Market Driven Technical Vocational &amp; Education Training (TVET) and Business Development in District Chakwal.&#x201D;The Pakistani Government provides TVET (Technical, Vocational &amp; Education Training) institutions. Unfortunately, due to their design for school graduates of specific age, qualification and sex, these institutions are largely inaccessible to those who need them most: uneducated and impoverished young girls and boys. This is an especially challenging situation for girls, who regularly face discrimination and do not always have the opportunity to finish their education. The current phase of this project has two main focuses: (1) increasing accessibility to Technical, Vocational &amp; Education training for youth&#x2014;including disabled youth&#x2014;from the most marginalized communities; and (2) strengthening components related to gender mainstreaming, ICT4D, disaster risk management, and youth-led advocacy for resource allocation. This project seeks to address these issues using the following strategies: 
1. Capacity building at youth group level to enable them to conduct research, mass awareness, advocacy and social dialogue with key stakeholders including the international community. 
2. Promoting market-based TVET and skill-based employment and enterprise promotion both in the formal and informal economy. 
3. Advocating public, private, and social sector organizations for policy and institutional support including strengthening of selected local TVET Institutions to promote YEE agenda. 
4. Introducing innovative ICT4V and POI Mapper software to continually monitor progress and maximize project effectiveness. 

In addition, this project will support existing TVET institutions and structures to: 
&#x2022; develop demand-led, competency based, accredited curricula 
&#x2022; establish operational linkages between employers and institutes, who support job placements and apprenticeships, 
&#x2022; introduce workforce skills and enterprise development trainings 
&#x2022; introduce current instructional methods, including problem-based learning 
&#x2022; introduce quality assurance mechanisms through establishing systematic monitoring and evaluation systems 
&#x2022; instruct staff on new course material and pedagogies 
&#x2022; engage management and teachers of TVET institutes to improve access by disadvantaged youth and particularly young women and those living with disabilities. 

As a result of these initiatives, youth are expected to be able to increase levels of economic engagement (self or paid employment) in traditional and non-traditional occupations in an environment where local communities and parents recognize and encourage youth, particularly young women, to become socially and economically active members of society.</narrative>

This project seeks to ensure that young women and men have access to youth-friendly microfinance structures, quality and market-driven vocational and technical training, and life skills and enterprise development training in order to become economically empowered through self- or paid employment.</narrative>
