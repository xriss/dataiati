   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Baka people are a semi-nomadic indigenous people with a population numbering roughly 30 000 in Cameroon. They are often discriminated against and marginalized due to their culture and physical features. Though they have successfully maintained their language, it is not taught in schools. Language issues, discrimination, and distance from schools result in relatively limited education for Baka children and youth. Indeed, in Cameroon as a whole, only 1 out of 10 children in rural areas has access to preschools (compared with 4 out of 10 in urban areas).</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Baka people of southeastern Cameroon face regular discrimination and limited education opportunities. This project aims to enhance the quality of education and protection for Baka children and adolescents by increasing participation of parents, caregivers and teachers, strengthening capacity of local indigenous organisations, and creating a national network for minority rights.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The primary objective of this project is to realise the basic child rights of the underprivileged and marginalized Baka ethnic minority children, focusing on their right to education.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project seeks a greater realisation of the indigenous Baka girls&apos; and boys&apos; right to education in a safe and supportive environment, with a particular focus on mother tongue education. The aim of this project is to increase access to and completion of high-quality, culturally-sensitive basic education that will ease girls&#x2019; and boys&#x2019; transition from primary to secondary education. This project also contains an early childhood care and development component that seeks to improve children&#x2019;s&#x2019; transition to primary school, e.g. through teacher training. In addition, issues of violence against children in schools and at home will be addressed.

This project seeks to bring together different stakeholders in order to create a national network for mother-tongue education and indigenous rights.  The following  groups will be involved to help increase access to and quality of basic education for minority children: parents, caregivers and Parent Teacher Associations are involved to increase the commitment to girls&apos; education; Civil Society Organizations are involved with advocating for minorities&#x2019; right to multilingual education; and the national government is involved in increasing teachers&#x2019; understanding and participation in multilingual education and gender-related issues at teacher training colleges. 

This project is part of an ongoing long-term program that began in 2003. The previous phase of the project (2012-2015) piloted an Intercultural Multilingual Education programme in selected schools that contained indigenous minorities, including training teachers on culturally-adapted, learner-centered approaches. Due to growing demands, the pilot is now being expanded to include other Baka areas (10 councils in total, up from 8). The education policy in Cameroon is currently under transition and the pilot study has been adopted as a case study by the government and other stakeholders (including UN agencies), meaning the results from this project will likely affect Cameroon&apos;s future education policy.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project&#x2019;s sustainability will be ensured through the participation of communities, government partners, and other organizations involved in the project. Building the capacity of institutions will enable them to mobilize additional resources to continue implementing the Intercultural Multilingual education approach. The training of local counselors and teachers on child-rights related issues will allow them to seek additional government funds to support local schools. Finally, advocacy work and regular communication will help engage the corporate sector in funding key activities to continue promoting minority children&#x2019;s right to education.</narrative>
