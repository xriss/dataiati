   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Plan Finland&#x2019;s global citizenship education focuses on the education, participation and advocacy of global child rights issues in Finland. The Global Citizenship Education project includes funding and managing the following groups: 

Plan Global School works with schools and youth forums through Child Rights&#x2019; Ambassadors, who provide participatory lessons on child rights and development work. Components include training educators on human rights related subjects, development of early childhood education programmes, and maintaining cooperation between Finnish and Ugandan schools to strengthen participatory school governance. 

The Children&#x2019;s Board is a forum for participatory advocacy and awareness-raising for children. The emphasis is on peer-to-peer awareness raising activities. Training is provided on relevant aspects in order to strengthen the capacity of members and motivate them to speak out about global children&#x2019;s rights. Continued cooperation with the Vietnamese young media club raises awareness of violence against children. Under the Regional project in Asia (CSO Strengthening in Asia for Increased Child Protection), opportunities and platforms are continuously explored to share the outcomes of the cooperation between the children in Finland and Vietnam at sub-regional and regional levels. 

The Young Adults&#x2019; Network (&#x201C;Mit&#xE4; verkosto&#x201D;) arranges a national awareness-raising campaign every year that targets young people, the general population, or decision makers, depending on the topic. Cooperation with global partners in Pakistan and the Dominican Republic on Youth Economic Empowerment and gender are the main focus areas. The network supports partners in developing youth engagement models and sharing campaigning experiences.

 Volunteers actively participate in local events and national campaigns to raise awareness of child rights around the country (e.g. on the Day of the Girl). Training components for volunteers will be further developed in order to strengthen their communication skills regarding these issues. In general, the aim is to increase the number of active volunteers and locations where volunteering is possible.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project engages people at different phases of life through various groups (the Children&#x2019;s Board, Young Adults&#x2019; Network, Child Rights Ambassadors and volunteers). The aim is that the training and empowering of children, young adults and volunteers on children&#x2019;s rights, the development situation, and in participatory advocacy will result in long-term societal change. By changing ways of thinking and involving individuals as agents of change, sustainability is an in-built component of the project plan.

This project also focuses on ensuring that relevant Child Rights-related content is embedded in formal education structures with the cooperation of education authorities. In addition, there is a teacher-training component of Global Citizenship Education for both current and upcoming teachers, with the aim of sustainably strengthening global citizenship education in Finland&#x2019;s formal education system. Ultimately, Plan Finland&#x2019;s development programmes are best supported by influencing political and structural changes. Since advocacy is a strong focus of this project, the resulting long-term goals (changing attitudes, influencing decision makers and increasing engagement) will help support long-term sustainable development.</narrative>
