   <narrative xml:lang="EN">General objective: to contribute to improving the quality of life of adolescents and young people by making the most of socio-economic development opportunities in the southern region of the Dominican Republic.

Specific objective: to promote a model of socio-economic empowerment for adolescents and young people (between the ages of 15 and 24) by developing improved capacities and opportunities for their economic, personal and social development in coordination with relevant local and national actors.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Nearly a third of youth in the Dominican Republic are unemployed. This project aims to improve the employment of young women and men in southern Dominican Republic through training, advocacy, and awareness-raising. Youth will receive vocational training, educational scholarships, and entrepreneurial support and subsidies, and a forum will be established to lobby for youth economic development.</narrative>

  <description akvo:type="7" type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Technical and Vocational Professional Training National Institute (INFOTEP) provides high quality technical and professional training in the Dominican Republic. However, it has a set of requirements that not all young men and women can fulfil. Other technical training entities&#x2014;such as vocational schools, polytechnics, and technical institutes&#x2014;tend to offer low-quality, out-of-date programmes that do not teach sufficient skills.

The project will provide young women and men with training on life skills and vocational and entrepreneurship skills. The activities include building youth capacities and motivation and helping them search for scholarships, finance for enterprises and paid employment. The project will be working in the provinces of Azua, San Juan, El&#xED;as Pi&#xF1;a, Barahona and Pedernales. Particular attention will be given to new technologies and private sector engagement.

The project results will be supported with awareness-raising in the communities and among parents to increase understanding of the importance of youth training and the risks youth face in gaining employment.

This project will set up a youth advocacy forum to lobby for economic development of youth at local and national level. This project will build capacity of the private sectors to continue supporting youth employment after the end of the project.</narrative>

  <description akvo:type="6" type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The employment rate of youth in the Dominican Republic is around 30%, more than double the national unemployment rate. 58% of the unemployed are women. Only 52% of young people have some sort of technical training, due mainly to limited availability and issues of accessibility. Over a third of the population between the ages of 15 and 29 neither studies or works, with the highest concentrations of the unemployed being in rural communities and poor neighbourhoods. The most common opportunities for adolescents and young people involve informal economic activities, which do not provide stability, generally have low wages, are not under the labour code, and do not involve social security benefits.  Young women are especially at risk due to high prevalence of teenage pregnancies.</narrative>

  <description akvo:type="10" type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project involves partnering with entities and institutions that are responsible for young people&#x2019;s development. These partnerships will be implemented with the goal of the partnership continuing once the project has been completed. 

One of the project tasks includes the creation of a youth network that will have its own responsibilities working in coordination with other actors to propose and advocate for solutions related to training, workplace access, and entrepreneurial opportunities for adolescents and young people.

This project works within local and national structures, both public and private, securing their participation in order to maximize program effectiveness.</narrative>
