    <narrative xml:lang="EN">The United States is engaging Thailand primarily as a development partner to leverage its significant resources as an upper middle income country to encourage it to take a greater leadership role in addressing global and regional challenges of mutual concern. Throughout its modern history as a constitutional monarchy, Thailand has experienced years of political uncertainty, including, most recently, a military coup in May 2014 following six months of protests, the dissolution of parliament, and failed national elections. Such dramatic shifts in the political system are disruptive for a key U.S. ally and make clear that there is a continued need for engagement in priority areas with U.S. support for good governance and transnational rule of law. Many political, legal, and criminal justice institutions are still developing and will benefit from continued U.S. engagement. Achieving U.S. strategic goals in Thailand and in the region is predicated on the country&apos;s stability. U.S. assistance will promote peace and security, foster reforms and modernization of the criminal justice system, and strengthen good governance.</narrative>
