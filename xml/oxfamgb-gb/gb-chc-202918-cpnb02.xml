   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Funding of GBP161,000 from the People&apos;s Postcode Lottery will support the work of our Education and Youth team. Oxfam Education offers a huge range of ideas, resources and support for developing global learning in the classroom and the whole school. This funding will enable Oxfam to develop a range of resources such as: Global Citizenship Guides  - Aimed at teachers in all subjects, and across all age groups, our global citizenship guides introduce the key elements of Oxfam&apos;s Curriculum for Global Citizenship, as well as providing case studies outlining best practice in the classroom, activities that can be adapted for use in many curriculum areas, and resources for further reading. Even it up!  - Oxfam is creating a cross -curricular resource, Even It Up!  for 11 -14 year olds in partnership with Young Lives, to be published in October 2015.  The lessons will be based on data and interviews gathered by Young Lives, an international research project into the causes and consequences of children&apos;s poverty and will explore issues of inequality. The project has been following the lives of 12,000 children in Ethiopia, India, Peru and Vietnam over 15 years.  The whole resource will consist of:  two introductory lessons, six geography lessons. six maths lessons, six English lessons, Reflection.  We also plan to produce a special set of these resources designed to support teaching and learning with students who have special educational needs. Oxfam Water Week  - Provides opportunities for young people to learn and think critically about water issues, before taking informed and meaningful action.  Water Week can be held at any time of year, but many schools find the summer term works well.  The resources have been streamlined for 2015 to enable schools to complete activities in just one or two sessions, but they retain flexibility for extension. Youth Ambassadors  - For a brighter tomorrow, young people must speak up against poverty, and for a fairer and more just society.  To this</narrative>
