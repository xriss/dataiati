hern Uganda (Acholi Sub Region) between the Government of Uganda and the rebel group the Lords Resistance Army (LRA). The conflict ravaged the region and peoples livelihoods. Since 2006, the LRA has not been active in northern Uganda and as a result, the p
opulation has resettled and started to rebuild their livelihoods. The agricultural enterprise continues to present the best way to improve the livelihood prospects for millions of rural families. Despite their important role as food producers and rural ste
wards, the commercial prospects for the poor smallholder farmers remain limited due to poor access to technologies, extension services, infrastructures, market information and linkages to better markets. #4. The main objective and expected results:#The mai
n objective of the project is to contribute to the sustainability of livelihood and economic empowerment of smallholder farmers in Pader District. This will be achieved through strengthened capacity of targeted lead farmers and farmer groups to practice ma
rket-based agricultural production and through strengthened linkages to markets and other different value chain actors.#5. Right-holders/ beneficiaries: 800 smallholder farmers#Duty bearers: The District agricultural officer, The district Commercial Office
r, The district Farmers association, Uganda Cooperatives Alliance (UCA), The District Community Development Officer and the District Production and Marketing Officer#6. Implementing partner: LWF</narrative>
