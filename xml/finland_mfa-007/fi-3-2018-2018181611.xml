  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In Cambodia, children and youth with disabilities and their families often live in the margins of their community. Only 3% of disabled children start school and more than half of them drop out in 1-3 years. Countryside is almost totally lacking educational
 and supporting services for severely disabled children and ignorance and discriminating attitudes cause enormous barriers to their  wellbeing. Without the support of community, parents and authorities, the children dont have possibility to develop their s
kills physically, socially or educationally.The project enhances the rights of children with severe disabilities (such as CP, autistic or intellectual dispability) by training communities and their leaders on disability issues and the rights of persons wit
h disabilities, by supporting community-based activity-centres for integarted education and inclusive education in local schools as well as home based care, in Kampot and Kratie provinces. The work of the project implementer Komar Pikar Foundation (KPF) ha
s proved that by community based solutions even the severely disabled children and their families can have access to education and supporting services and the discrimination can be reduced. As result of the project the children with severe disabilities are
 accepted as part of their communities, they have possibility to learn and develop their skills and have better access to e.g. health services.  The financial status of the families improves and discrimination is reduced.</narrative>
