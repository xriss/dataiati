   <narrative xml:lang="EN">1. Project: 11670 Qalqiliya Agriculture Livelihood Project  #2. Project area and Country: Occupied Palestinian Territories (Qalqiliya) #3. Project justification: #Palestinian livelihoods and in particular agriculture are severely undermined by the protract
ed Israeli occupation, which restricts the mobility of Palestinian labor (especially men) and products and easily leads to the confiscation of uncultivated agricultural land that Palestinian farmers have no access to. The situation is particularly critical
 in the area C fully controlled by Israel, as well as in the seam zone located between the Green Line and the separation wall. In the targeted area in Qalgiliya, the women play  an important role as the breadwinners and strive to address the basic needs of
 their households with small-scale farming that also helps to sustain their right to land and water. These efforts are however often hindered by their lack of technical expertise and access to necessary agricultural and other inputs. #4. The main objective
 and the expected results: #The main objective of the project is the enhanced resilience of the targeted Palestinians in the seam zone and Area C. This will be accomplished through increased household incomes for the targeted 120 female-headed households. 
The women will engage in profitable thyme farming, processing and marketing and will improve their access to capital and financial services through village saving and loan associations (VSLA). It is also expected that the three targeted womens groups/CBOs 
will improve their capacity to support the female farmers in accessing the local thyme markets.#5. Right-holders/ beneficiaries: #Female-headed households, CBO members, VSLA members (total 413 persons) #Duty-bearers:  Palestinian Ministry of Agriculture, l
ocal councils, targeted cooperative structures, ESDC#6. Implementing partner: Economic and Social Development Center (ESDC)</narrative>
