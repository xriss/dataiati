   <narrative xml:lang="EN">It is difficult to imagine a more discriminated group of women in Belarus than those suffering from alcoholism. In the eyes of common public they have a stigma of being unable to control the life of themselves and their children. Women feel embarrassed and
 try hard to hide their addiction even from the closest people. A stereotype exists that alcoholism is more shameful for women than for men. Children of alcohol dependent women are easily taken into social shelter wherefrom the mother has to get them away 
only after payments to the state. This leads to negative circle: inability to pay and get back the children leads to heavier alcohol use. Children of alcohol-dependent mothers bear the stigma of their parents. WHO ranks Belarus to be 1st in the world of al
cohol use. The main object of the project is to empower alcohol-dependent women and their children (especially girls) by providing them economic and social support. An innovative model of support for women suffering from alcohol dependency in Smolevichi an
d Minsk districts will include: selection and training of 10 women suffering from alcohol dependency and having underage children training them to cast and handle decorate and pack  plaster products in the social enterprise Our Craftsmen (which was establi
shed in 2016 on the support of Finnish FLC); giving them effective support system (co-ordinated with local AA groups) and organizing a seminar on professional handicraft activities which could help them with further employment. 5 women will be employed by 
Our craftsmen during the project the other 5 will have a possibility to volunteer in the workshop. At the same time a special support group for at least 12 girls whose mothers participate in the project. The topics will include: the ability to make informe
d choices resolve conflicts develop personal skills etc. A series of joint workshops for children and alcohol-dependent parents will be organized also a seminar for other family members (15) where they will receive support recognize and apply effective met
hods of preventing codependence.It is expected that during the project cooperation mechanism between NGOs local authorities specialists of the child protection system will be improved to jointly solve the problems of fighting alcoholism in Smolevichi and M
insk. At least 10 000 citixens will learn about the project and about the new model through public events media coverage and social networks.</narrative>
