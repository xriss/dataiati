   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In the Phongsaly Province in North-Eastern Laos the children of ethnic minorities to whom most of the people belong do not learn to read write because the teaching in the local schools is given in a language (lao) that the children dont understand. The lea
rning materials are culturally not relevant, which makes learning even more difficult. Most of the parents are illiterate themselves and have little access to information or skills that could improve their ability to have their rights to health, hygiene, f
ood security and decision making respected by their community leaders or local authorities .The project helps the local teachers and education authorities to understand the importance to provide mother-tongue pre-education to the children, parallel to usin
g the Lao language in teaching. Teaching materials are developed to reflect the local cultural understanding and knowledge, and the teachers are trained in using more child-friendly teaching methods. The culture of the ethnic minority, such as poems, games
 and songs, are collected and used in making the teaching materials. The life skills are discussed both with the young people and the adults, making them better prepared for the changing world around them. The health of the expecting mothers and the new-bo
rns is improving, as the local traditional birth-attendants and the village health volunteered get better informed of the importance of the ante-natal health and birth-preparedness, and of the hygiene and good birthing practices, including the diet of the 
mother and the child. Also the number of women going to health clinics in close-by towns is increasing. Perhaps the most important change that the project aims to make is in the attitudes of the local duty-bearers, i.e. the village decision makers and the 
local government authorities. Advocacy and training to the duty-bearers is essential for them to change their attitude from dictating orders to providing public services to the rights-holders. Ultimately, together with the increasing understanding of their
 rights by the people in the project villages, this change in the mentality of the duty-bearers is essential for the sustainability of the project results. The project is implemented by World Renew.</narrative>
