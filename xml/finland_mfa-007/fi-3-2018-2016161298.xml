   <narrative xml:lang="EN">F.a: Developing community based mangrove forest management in South Sumatra</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In Ogan Komering Ilir (OKI), on the eastern coast of South Sumatra, the destruction of mangrove forests has been massive due to fish pond and industrial timber concession development. In 1992, there were about 79 000 ha of mangroves in the area, but in 200
3 the remaining area was only about 40 100 ha. Until now, there is no a clear plan on how to save the remaining mangroves, even if these has been officially declared as a protected area. This project aims to promote local communities commitment to protect 
and enrich mangrove forests around their villages and facilitate making of a work plan for mangrove forest management. The main activities include community education and training on livestock and fish pond management, mapping, engaging different stakehold
ers to develop mangrove forest management and planning, re-vegetation of mangroves, and monitoring. At least 5000 seedlings will be planted to rehabilitate degraded mangroves and to function as a fence for the village to prevent seawater intrusion. Another
 important goal is to apply and dedicate max. 1000 ha of the mangrove area under a social forestry scheme, such as Hutan Kemasyarakatan (HKm). Education and training will also build up economic capacities of local people. The project requires all key stake
holders to work closely with each other, including at least local communities, government and forest management unit, private sector and NGOs. www.hutaninstitute.or.id</narrative>
