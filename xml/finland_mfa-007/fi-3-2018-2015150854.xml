   <narrative xml:lang="EN">F.a: Strong unions and QPS in Philippines health sector</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project strengthens health sector trade unions, their joint collaboration and their advocacy in legislative processes and to improve the public health care system in the Philippines. The main objective is the enactment into law of two proposed legislat
ive bills on health: raising of the paid maternity leave to 100 days and expanding the coverage of national health insurance scheme to all Filipinos through Universal Health Care bill. Increasing union membership, training, awareness raising and networking
 of health workers&apos; organizations contribute to the advocacy work.##The Philippine Government continues cutting funds from public health care and weakening the working conditions of public health workers, through privatization of public health services and
 favouring short-term contracts and contract agency labour. The privatization has already now decreased the health budget which challenges the availability of services and the working conditions of health workers. Even vital health services are being trans
ferred from public management to private enterprises. At the same time health care is no longer free of charge. Close to 10 million Filipinos are not covered by National Health Insurance. Side services such as cleaning, laundry, catering and security are b
eing outsourced which increases the dispersion of workers and thus makes organizing more difficult. Weak and dispersed unions are not capable of efficient interest representation of the workers. ##As a result, the understanding of the new legislative measu
res among the health sector unions increases and the political approval and enactment into law of those bills are promoted by advocating political decision-makers. The joint collaboration of the trade unions improves and union membership increases by at le
ast 13 000 new members: 9 new local unions in public health care and 3 new unions in private health care join the coalition. Also, an increase for public health care budget will be advocated. ##The beneficiaries are Philippine health sector workers and cit
izens using the health services.  ##The project is implemented by Public Services International (PSI) together with its member unions in the Philippines (AFW, CIU, PGEA, PSLINK ja PIPSEA).</narrative>
