   <narrative xml:lang="EN">F.a: Creating Access to Local Reusable Sanitary-pad for Girls (Ethipad)</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Approximately 52% of the female population is of reproductive age in Ethiopia. Adolescent girls in the project areas stay at home during menstruation, because they dont have access to hygienic and affordable sanitary pads. In addition, lack of access to af
fordable sanitary pads are highly correlated with their reproductive health. Besides this, inadequate preparation for young girls not yet experiencing menstruation, knowledge gap on the linkages between menstrual hygiene management (MHM) and sanitation sys
tems in schools and lack of awareness on MHM practices contribute to school absenteeism or complete drop out. Menstrual hygiene management is insufficiently acknowledged and has not received adequate attention in schools and rural communities in Ethiopia. 
In addition, sanitary pads are rare and not affordable in rural areas. As a result, the production and supply of affordable and reusable sanitary pads for rural girls and women become necessary. The project will create increased access of locally produced 
reusable sanitary pads by organizing and strengthening producer youth groups in project implementation areas. The producer groups will be capacitated to produce reusable pads from locally available resources and supported with needed equipment. In order to
 create linkage and distribution channel to the community, existing Village Saving and Loans Groups (VSLG) will be strengthened. The VSLGs will be used as outlets to distribute produced reusable sanitary pads. Collaboration with schools will make pads avai
lable in schools MHM rooms. In addition to strengthening the supply side of locally produced reusable sanitary pads, the project also create demand by the community, school girls and youth. This will be done through awareness creations events which will be
 conducted by the producers, school WASH clubs and local government. The producers will also be invited to existing bazaars and exhibitions to promote their products and create market linkage. Micro and Small Enterprise development office will also provide
 support to legalize and strengthen the producer groups which will lead to sustainability. Such interventions will also allow for linkage with MFIs so that the producer groups will get access to credit services to diversify their business and sustain suppl
ying reusable sanitary pads. The project is implemented in four woredas in three regions together with 16 schools and it will have 14 550 direct beneficiaries.</narrative>
