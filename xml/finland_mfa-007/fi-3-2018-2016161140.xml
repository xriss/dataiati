   <narrative xml:lang="EN">1. Project: 11527 Enhancing Sustainable Peace and Inter-communal Reconciliation in Jonglei#2. Project area and Country: Greater Upper Nile region, South Sudan#3. Project justification: #The Greater Upper Nile Region has experienced decades of war, undergon
e multiple repetitive crises, and been the scene of some of South Sudans worst violence since independence in 2011. After the outbreak of the latest conflict in July 2016, large-scale violence in the region has continued, and even intensified. The region i
s characterized by historically deep-rooted political, social, ethnic and resource-related conflicts that form part of local, regional and national conflict dynamics. It remains one of the most underdeveloped areas in the country, and the minimal existing 
infrastructure, including houses, schools, hospitals and roads, has been largely destroyed. People have been displaced from their homes due to violence, insecurity and economic hardship, and have sought refuge in civilian protection sites within the countr
y and in refugee camps in the neighbouring countries. #4. The main objective and expected results:#The proposed project aims to restore communities right to peace through empowering the targeted rights-holders to claim their right to peace and increasing t
he capacity of duty-bearers to fulfil their role as the duty-bearers.#The main objective of the project is to contribute to achieving sustainable peace and stability in the Greater Upper Nile Region. The project will support holistic conflict transformatio
n processes and initiatives, and facilitate the establishment and strengthening of local conflict resolution and peacebuilding mechanisms. This will be achieved through the creation of inclusive and non-violent spaces for dialogue and through strengthened 
community-level peace support structures in the targeted areas in the Greater Upper Nile Region.#5. Right-holders/ beneficiaries: 695 direct beneficiaries, including youth, women and traditional community leaders.#Duty bearers: Local authorities, state gov
ernments, religious and traditional leaders, all the decision-makers in the community and all the parties of signed peace agreements and resolutions#6. Implementing Partners: Civil society organizations, local and international NGOs, UN agencies, churches 
as well as the umbrella body of the South Sudan Council of Churches.</narrative>
