  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The illegal poaching and wildlife trade of threatened species such as Rhinos and African elephants in the East African countries of Tanzania, Uganda and Kenya has increased rapidly in the past decade. This has resulted in the decline of the species populat
ions which is posing a severe risk to the survival of the species and furthermore is affecting the whole biodiversity balance of the ecosystems. In addition criminal activity such as poaching and illegal wildlife trade has negative influence to the local c
ommunities as well as the the local and national economies since its affecting also for instance tourism business. Weak natural resources governance and law enforcement together with deeply rooted corruption is enabling the criminal activities to exist wit
hout needed actions to stop the poaching and trade. ##The program is building the capacity of local, national and regional government officials and institutions to track, expose and tackle illegal poaching and trade of threatened wildlife. Programme will f
acilitate and support government officials, customs, rangers, local communties and park staff to work together to improve wildlife monitoring, patrolling, and law enforcement in three East African countries. Programme will promote the development and imple
mentation of national and regional agreements and commitments to protect wildlife from poaching and trade. Programme will also raise awareness of the problem of poaching and share best practices such as the zero-poaching model to be adopted in the three co
untries. ##Beneficiaries: The government officials and institutions in different levels in the three countries (Uganda, Kenya, Tanzania), wildlife and park rangers, local communities##Implementing partner: WWF country offices in Tanzania, Uganda and Kenya
