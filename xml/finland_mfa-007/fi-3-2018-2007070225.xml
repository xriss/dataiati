   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Tajikistan Country Programme aims to impact in increased justice, strengthened human dignity, and peace in Tajikistan. Tajikistan suffers from a health care system that is not addressing the needs of mothers and children, and from a lack of jobs, drivi
ng people to massive labour migration. The Country Programme in Tajikistan will focus on the rights of mothers and children to health through improving rural health care, and the rights of children to an adequate living standard by creating better opportun
ities for sustainable income for the parents. This is to be done by developing the network of in-country partners who will continue the work in the future and have the capacity to advocate for the rights of the vulnerable. Fidas partners in the Programme a
re Stichting Assistance International (SAI) and Central Asian Partnerships (CAPS).#The Programme will focus primarily on rural communities in Khatlon, southern Tajikistan, an area that is mostly affected in Tajikistan. Rural women and community health work
ers will be provided with trainings in Mother Child Health. To create income opportunities the Programme will work directly with communities to demonstrate and create sustainable business models. Local partners will be responsible on teaching cross cutting
 themes to groups of men and women in the villages. Partners will take more ownership on the implementation of the Programme and will become stronger and competent organizations. The Programme will also train around 1500 relevant officials and responsible 
people on making a lasting, systematic change in Tajikistan.#The Programme has a positive impact directly in the lives of 10 100 people and indirectly around 55 000 peoples lives. By the end of the Programme period, dozens of communities are reached by the
se activities. The partners can now take their strong and sustainable role in reaching out to communities on the issues of health and livelihood and speaking out for the rights related to this.</narrative>
