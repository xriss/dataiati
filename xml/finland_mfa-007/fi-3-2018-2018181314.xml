   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Screening of Burundian refugees in exile in Western Uganda (Nakivale refugee settlement) will allow earlier identification of experiences of violence and rights abuse. Timely referral of cases in need will enable survivors to access professional medical an
d psychosocial services for the recovery of physical and social functionality. Monitoring and follow-up of recovery will also include careful documentation of SGBV and other violations experienced in the country of origin, Burundi, during flight, and in ex
ile, as well as extension of counselling support to children and spouses of victims. The collection, analysis and archiving of survivor testimonies will support future judicial processes for accountability and delivering of justice to victims. Documentatio
n of survivor testimonies will provide information on demographic characteristics of survivors, the nature of torture, where and when it occurred. This information can also contribute towards facilitating dialogue and debate on the human rights violations 
that occurred. This information will also inform policy and programs formulation processes that can provide redress for the wrongs that occurred to the Burundian refugees. Legal aid will be provided in both civil and criminal matters and this shall be in t
he form of; basic legal advice and assistance, mediations, legal information concerning the law and various procedures, drafting of legal documents such as pleadings and supporting documents, representation before courts of law and other quasi-judicial ins
titutions. Burundian refugees will also receive human rights awareness raising and education through information sessions to ensure that they are aware of their rights and of the legal frameworks in Uganda. Issues that will be discussed during information 
sessions include rights of refugees, legal frameworks on SGBV, prevention and response, the role of different actors in dealing with SGBV, SGBV in forced migration: prevention and response mechanisms, climate change, and environment. www.refugeelawproject.
