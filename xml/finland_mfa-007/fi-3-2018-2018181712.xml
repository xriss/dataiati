nities. Young people were provided civic education and encouraged to act as active citizens. Also duty-bearers are trained in the importance of consultation and inclusion of young people. Active members of the youth movements are responsible for the planni
ng, implementation, monitoring, evaluation and reporting of their activities to the Project Coordinator. In this way, young people learn to take responsibility and have the capacity to act independently for the fulfillment of child and youth rights even af
ter the end of the project. The cooperation started through an open call for tenders in 2005. http://pami-guatemala.org/wp/ More than 70% of the Guatemalan population is under 30 years old, and more than 50 % is under 20 years old. The social problems of t
