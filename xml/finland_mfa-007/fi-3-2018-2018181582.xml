  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project objective is to train water sector workers&apos; trade unions and improve their organizing efforts and thus dues collection. With the help of the project, the unions enhance their joint campaigning to attract more attention to workers&apos; rights in the
 privatization processes, and to guarantee quality water services for all citizens regardless of their income.##Water services have been privatized in the Philippines and in Indonesia in many ways. This has decreased the availability of affordable water se
rvices to citizens, but also the position, job security and trade union rights of water sector workers. In addition, the privatization of water services has been frequently associated with corruption. In Indonesia, the Supreme Court ruled the privatization
 of Jakarta water system as corrupt and announced that it must be returned to public control. In the Philippines, water sector trade unions have been successful in limiting the expansion of international financial institutions (such as Asian Development Ba
nk ADB) loans to the water sector. The heavy debts with their interests would have resulted in increased costs for water services to the public. The unions campaign to have water considered as a human right, to which all people must have affordable access.
 ##As a result of the project, unions develop policy alternatives to privatization with evidence-based research, and publish these alternatives to national governments and public. In Indonesia, the unions intend to assure the implementation of the Supreme 
Court decision and creation of a monitoring system for its implementation. Membership of the unions will be increased, which in turn strengthens their financial sustainability. Unions develop joint priorities and strengthen their cooperation with other civ
il society actors. ##The beneficiaries are the water sector workers, and, in the long run, all people that use public water services. ##The project is implemented by Public Services International (PSI) together with its member unions.</narrative>
