   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Persons with disabilities (PWDs) are amongst the most vulnerable people in Tanzania. They are short of opportunities for education self-study and income. Due to this PWDs are often unable to make informed choices and lack the skills for self-representation
 and advocacy. Public libraries in Tanzania are supposed to cater for the whole population. However there are no proper materials and services available for the disabled population. Therefore the project aims to bring accessible information available at th
e public libraries in Dar es Salaam Dodoma and Mwanza where there are relatively many PWDs living.This will be done by I) improving the project libraries service base and II) supporting PWDs to use the public libraries services for their own benefit learni
ng and leisure. In addition the project will capacitate the two partner organizationsTanzania League of the Blind (TLB) and Tanzania Library Services Board (TLSB) to do efficient advocacy work for the sake of inclusive libraries (III).The beneficiaries of 
the project are PWDs most importantly persons with visual impairments (PVIs) in the three mentioned Tanzanian regions. Special attention will be paid to involving girls and women (target 50 % of the beneficiaries). The project promotes better public servic
es that all people have access to. This contributes to the goal 3 of Finlands development policy (societies becoming more democratic and better-functioning). Accessibility of information services will also create a better basis for the Tanzanian civil soci
ety to function as more people gain skills and means to freely access information.Libraries for All has been planned and will be implemented in close cooperation with partners experienced in disabilities and libraries. In Tanzania it was TLB and TLSB where
 the project ideas emerged from. These two partners have the essential expertise needed in the project.In Finland the Finnish Library Association will work in close partnership with several organizations that are dealing with disability and accessible publ
ishing issues. These parties will also offer their expertise to the project.</narrative>
