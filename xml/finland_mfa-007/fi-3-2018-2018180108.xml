s.The population of PWDs in Homa Bay County has high share compared to other counties in the country. Exact numbers are not available since only a few of the PWD.s are registered. The baseline studies show that the capacity and capability of the PWDs to or
ganize themselves and to drive their rights is limited. This proposal aims in a logical way to continue the goal oriented five step CBR-program and to take it through its final stage. The program would also support and strengthen the impact and sustainabil
ity of the previous stages. The final objective for the proposed project is to improve the quality of life for persons with disability by strengthening their ability to bring their case in relation to the surrounding community the local authorities and dec
ision makers. The results of this advocacy program will be achieved by the three central objectives.1. Empowerment of PWD.s to understand their rights and the importance in participating in disability organizations and other organized community activities.
 2. Empowerment of the communities to understand the rights of PWD.s and to accept them just as able bodied members of the community. 3. Increased awareness within the local public services of the rights of PWD.s and improved services to them. The project 
implementation is about training empowerment and giving tools to the PWD.s and their representatives for influencing their situation. Having operated in the region for a number of years implementing the CBR matrix the proposed project will be the last comp
onent of the matrix. It will empower the persons with disability and the community to advocate for the rights of persons with disability</narrative>
