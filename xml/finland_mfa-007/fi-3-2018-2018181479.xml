  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project supports the livelihoods of Haitian small producers of coffee, mango and cocoa, strengthens their capacities to mitigate and adapt to the effects of climate change, and improves capacities of producer organisations. Haiti is the poorest country
 in the Americas, ranked 163rd by the UNDP Human Development Index 2015 and it is the only LDC in the Western hemisphere. After the 2010 devastating earthquake, the country has made progress to recover, although high levels of poverty persist. According to
 the World Bank, 72% of the total population live in poverty, with 29% living in extreme poverty. Due to its geographical position and territorial formation, the country is very exposed to natural hazards and extreme climatic events. Haiti is also among th
e countries most affected in the last 20 years by climatic risks. The effects of climate change multiply the natural risks to which the Haitian population is exposed. In many cases small agricultural producers are the most vulnerable as they do not have th
e technical resources and capacities to mitigate these risks and protect their livelihoods and its resilience capacity is low. Climate change and its effects have a direct impact on some fundamental human rights. The damages caused by climatic phenomena re
lated to climate change affect basic rights such as the right to a healthy environment, the right to water and the right to health, among others. The goal of the project is to contribute to better natural resources management for maintaining sustainable li
velihoods. The purpose is improved capacities small producers of coffee, mango and cocoa in Haiti to adapt and mitigate climate change effects. Especially young members of the producer organisations are trained on leadership. Direct beneficiaries of the pr
oject are around 6900 producers, of which approximately 15% are women. Implementing partner organizations are Latin American and the Caribbean network of small Fairtrade producers, CLAC, and the Fairtrade Haitian Network (KOSEA). http://clac-comerciojusto.
