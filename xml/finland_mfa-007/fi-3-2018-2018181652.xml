  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Refugees are often marginalised, not recognised component of civil society of the host country and therefore often excluded from civil rights. Various refugee associations and informal community based groups of refugees seek to respond to the shared need f
or action for a common interest of refugees. The project strengthens the resilience capacities of beneficiary groups  especially selected refugee associations in Kampala and youth groups in Kampala and Nakivale, by improving their management skills and org
anisational capacity. The project arranges a practical training to selected refugee associations in Kampala on business planning to help them to select and put in practise income generating activity, and trains selected leaders from youth groups on manager
ial skills. Both trainings include mentoring and advisory services from the professional project staff. The beneficiaries are expected to enhance their ability to more effectively plan and implement the associations or youth group activities, and as a resu
lt provide better services to their members, who are mostly fellow refugees. The project aims to have two refugee associations staff included in the extensive Business training, and to train 20 youth leaders on leadership skills. The associations and youth
 groups worked with are also linked to other projects FRC is implementing in Uganda. The project is implemented by Finnish Refugee Council field staff apart from the Business training which is conducted in cooperation with Teach a Man to Fish</narrative>
