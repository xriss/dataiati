   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The unions participating in the project continue organizing forest workers, with the aim of getting 10000 new members in four years. Occupational health and safety measures continue to reduce the number of accidents and injuries in forestry work. The union
s advocate for legislation that influences interest representation of forestry workers, and participate in cooperation with environmental organizations to promote sustainable green jobs.  The major problems of the forestry sector are unstable work relation
ships and dangerous working conditions. Awareness of rights, collective bargaining and union density have before the project been low, and before 2016 workers of the sector were not even officially recognized as workers. The project activities have brought
 around 20000 new members to the unions, and close to 12000 people have participated diverse types of trainings and advocacy work. Almost 2000 people have through cooperatives gained additional income to supplement the forestry work, making use of other pr
oducts of the forest, such as tree leave plates, mushrooms, berries and honey. The cooperation with environmental organizations, especially WWF, has reduced tensions between forestry workers and environmentalists by fitting together sustainable forestry an
d conservation, as well as nature tourism.  This last project phase ensures the continuity and sustainability of the work done in the current target regions and through spreading the successful models of action to a few new districts. The project benefits 
Nepalese forestry workers and their families through improved income and safety, as well as the participating unions through strengthened membership base, negotiation position and cooperation in advocacy work. The main actors of the project are BWI NAC (Bu
ilding and Wood Workers International Nepal Affiliates Committee) as the coordinating cooperation body and its affiliates CAWUN (Construction and Allied Workers Union in Nepal), CUPPEC (Central Union of Painters, Plumbers, Electro and Construction in Nepal
) and ANCWU (All Nepal Construction Workers Union) that implement the project in cooperation with WWF Nepal.</narrative>
