   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The aim of the project&apos;s 2nd phase is to continue and deepen the change which was started in 2017-2018. The long-term impact is the promotion of gender equality with respect to womens property rights so that the implementation of these rights is supported 
in the project area.URI-GL (United Religious Initiative Great Lakes) proposed project intervention to address some of the key outstanding property related abuses and gender inequality particularly those that have to do with property ownership and distribut
ion during marriage and its dissolution even for partners in cohabiting relationships. It also comes to address the issues around will making and property acquisition and sale agreements such that women are included in such documents as owners.The first ph
ase initiated a lengthy process towards active implementation through change in the mindset. Women and men local authorities as well as cultural and religious leaders became aware of womens property rights and many examples of abuse that women experienced.
 An old male dominant culture changes slowly and therefore those who have started to change things need more time and support to achieve a more sustainable change than what is possible during the two years pilot.The continuation project focuses both to tra
ining and supporting of 53 women 40 local duty bearers and cultural and religious leaders and to training and guiding of 20 community facilitators and 40 men so that they could comprehend the change and see it as supporting the whole family. In addition th
e project continues to promote womens rights to 4 500 000 people in the project area and nationwide through radio and tv.The main partners are URI-GL and Filantropia whose expertise grows alongside with the challenging thematic of the project. The partners
 are aware that the task requires time patience and ability to adapt in a complicated and patriarchal cultural context. URI-GLs strength is to work with different religious groups and Filantropia has a strong experience with womens income generating activi
ties and taking into account different kinds of people in development.</narrative>
