   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Civil Society Organizations (CSOs) in Turkmenistan face many difficulties. Due to restrictions in transparency and cautiousness of the official entities it is very difficult/almost impossible for them to participate in policy making. They have limited mana
gement capacities and restrictions to accept funds from non-resident international donors. The communication among CSOs themselves is very limited. CSOs which are not affiliated with and supported by the government mostly receive funding in the form of mem
bership fees from the local beneficiaries and small grants from the resident international donors including the UN agencies. Due to restrictions and lengthy processes imposed by the Ministry of Justice of Turkmenistan for the CSOs project registration ther
e are only a few UN agencies and a small number of other international organizations supporting the work of CSOs in Turkmenistan. In addition to the complex political environment CSOs also lack institutional capacity inside organization and low awareness o
f development opportunities.Despite those challenges CSOs put their efforts into participating in policy making community work and promoting social inclusiveness however their cooperation with the Government is constrained by lack of access to decision mak
ers and absence of platforms for dialogue. There are also limited opportunities for CSOs to generate income to ensure their financial sustainability and independence. Most of the CSOs work in the area of social services for vulnerable groups (disabilities 
single-parenting etc.) Currently the Government is considered as the main social service provider in the country whose services are poor and not sufficient to meet the demand. Therefore social services can be one of the areas where CSOs can play a role and
 fill in the existing gap and lack of social services. To address the above there is a need to create a strong dialogue between the governmental bodies and to remove legal and regulatory barriers for CSOs participation in social service sector increase kno
wledge of legislators and government on international practices in social service delivery and build capacity of POs on social work and social service provision. UNDP represents a well-positioned partner to assist in the development of the civil society in
 Turkmenistan and enjoys high level of the Governments trust is recognized by the Government as a source of independent and unbiased high level technical expertise.</narrative>
