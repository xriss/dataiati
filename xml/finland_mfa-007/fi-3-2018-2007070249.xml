   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Myanmar Country Programme contributes to increased justice and strengthened human dignity and peace in Myanmar. At the community level, the Programme aims to improve access to education and digital learning opportunities for poor and vulnerable childre
n and youth in the target communities. These will be achieved by improving the quality of education through increasing the availability of extra-curricular activities, strengthening household capacities to earn income and pay for the school related expense
s, and by increasing awareness and knowledge about rights of all children in target communities and among the poorest households.#The Programme works in multiple communities in three different states, Rakhine, Kachin and Yangon. Childrens school dropout ra
tes, especially when looking at secondary education, are alarmingly high in the programme areas. The baseline indicates that in some target communities the secondary education enrolment rate is as low as 50% of children. The present situation, if not addre
ssed, is a key factor leading to increased disparity and inequality. The poorest households, especially those with girls and people living with disabilities, are most affected.#The implementing partner of the Country Programme is Assemblies of God Myanmar 
(AoGMM), a church denomination. It is a self-reliant civil society actor consisting of over 1000 local churches and parishes. The Programme is partly designed based on lessons learned from earlier collaboration, during which 92 communities were reached thr
ough a community-based health education programme. Once the partners knowledge and management capacity regarding childrens right for education and organisational development increases, the partner will be in position to upscale the work into a nationwide p
rogramme. The impact of the work will then multiply to tens of thousands of the most vulnerable children and youth. The Programme works directly with about 8600 beneficiaries in improving their right to education and an adequate standard of living. In addi
tion, the lives of an estimated 140 000 indirect beneficiaries are improved through the extensive advocacy work carried out by the local partner.</narrative>
