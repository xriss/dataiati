  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Iraq is struggling with a multitude of challenges needing long-term support by the international community. Security situation is challenging due to presence of ISIL and due to tensions between ethnic groups. After a long internal conflict the humanitarian
 situation continues alarming. An estimated 9 million people are in need of support. Internally displaced persons (IDPs) amount to over 3 million.UNDPs Funding Facility for Immediate Stabilization (FFIS/FFS) aims to support the Iraqi Government to address 
the immediate stabilization needs in newly accessible areas allowing the sustainable return of IDPs. Currently the Fund is active in the governorates of Salah al-Din Ninewah Anbar Kirkuk and Diyala. The Fund operates in close cooperation with the authoriti
es and it is an integral part of the Governments national stabilization efforts.The fund implements projects through the following windows: 1) Public works and light infrastructure rehabilitation in areas occupied from the ISIL; 2) Support to jump-starting
 livelihoods and jobs creation initiatives; 3) Local governance and rule of law capacity building. In 2017 the Funds operations increased substantially as the Iraqi authorities managed to liberate new territories from the ISIL. The results have been signif
icant. The Fund has supported activities in liberated areas that have enabled the return of 3.9 million IDPs to their homes. In terms of number of supported projects the education sector has received most support whereas in terms of amount of financing the
 health sector and the energy sector have been the largest recipients.A special focus has been taken to increase the number of women as beneficiaries. In particular women&apos;s economic empowerment is emphasized. In 2017 1.4 million women were beneficiaries of
 the activities funded by FFIS. Finland participates in the Steering Committee in Baghdad and advocates for advancing women&apos;s rights and non-discrimination in the supported activities.The activities are implemented in a very high risk environment often dir
ectly after the fighting has ceased. Due to the difficult internal political situation the political risks are also high. However the UNDP risk management system is considered adequate. By 2018 the contributions to the Fund amount to 703 MUSD. Finland has 
funded the FFIS by 4 million euros in 2016. The funding decision for 2018 is 5 million euros covering operations in 2018-2019.</narrative>
