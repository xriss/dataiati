   <narrative xml:lang="EN">1. Project: 11870 Women in Development project for Yumbe District, Uganda #2. Project area and Country: Yumbe + Arua districts, West Nile region, Uganda#3. Project justification: #The influx of South Sudanese refugees in the districts of Yumbe and Arua has
 put significant pressure on social services in the district. Settlements in both Yumbe and Arua have surpassed their recommended maximum capacities, transit and reception facilities are overwhelmed and host communities compete for resources. Many refugee 
households are food insecure, and WFP has reduced food rations amongst refugee populations by half due to funding shortfall. The women and young girls in the project areas, who are the ones taking care of crop production and domestic chores, are most vulne
rable due to their limited access to cash income, credit facilities and resources such as land, which are largely controlled by men. Due to a lack of opportunities for income generating activities and gainful employment, womens right to sustainable livelih
oods is not fulfilled, exposing them to the risk of chronic poverty.#4. The main objective and expected results:#The main objective of the project is to contribute to improving the well-being of rural women in the refugee hosting districts of Yumbe and Aru
a in Northern Uganda. This will be achieved through increased capacity of women to initiate, plan and manage their businesses, to mobilize their own saving and access credit to finance their activities and to participate in decision-making processes affect
ing their wellbeing.#5. Right-holders/ beneficiaries: 1500 refugee women and women in host communities#Duty bearers: Local leaders at village, parish, sub-county and district levels, members of parliament, Chief administrative Officers and Community Develo
pment Officers, traditional leaders, community based organizations, religious institutions, local non-governmental organizations.#6. Implementing partner: Uganda Change Agent Association (UCAA)</narrative>
