   <narrative xml:lang="EN">F.a: Sustainable Livelihood Promotion of Pardhi Nomadic Tribes of Kanker and Kondagaon</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project will be implemented in 94 villages of Kanker and Kondagaon Districts, Chhattisgarh. It supports the Pardhi adivasis work for their rights and livelihoods. Pardhis are traditionally nomadic hunter-gatherers. They have been in a very suppressed a
nd underprivileged position ever since the colonial period. They have been treated as outlaws that have been subjected to discrimination by almost all - including other groups of adivasis. The traditional livelihood for them has been bamboo crafts. However
, income from this livelihood has been very limited, for example, due to the lack of raw material, bamboo stems. Without forest related rights, Pardhis have not been able to use bamboo vegetation in forests. Forestry authorities have been committed to sell
ing bamboo stems to them, but deliveries are far below the promised amounts. Bamboo from the government managed forests has also been found to be much more profitable to be used, for example, as a raw material for the paper industry.To guarantee their live
lihoods, many Pardhis have sought to move more and more into farming. But inadequate land rights and poor productivity in farming have forced especially young male Pardhis to go to search for odd jobs outside of their areas. Women in villages have been try
ing to get along with those bamboo crafts that they have been able to produce for local markets. Consequently, the importance of bamboo crafts in communities, especially for women, is very central. One of the key bases for rights related work is the suppor
t for the implementation of the Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006. Parivartan has trained young people in villages to help in filling the forest right registration application forms. In order to
 guarantee sustainable availability of bamboo raw material, communities will also be supported in making community level forest management plans. Bamboos will also be planted by the communities for their own use. In addition, the processing and marketing o
f bamboo products will be developed further. However, the project seeks to ensure that children will not be used as labor in the production. Instead they will be actively directed towards going to school. In addition, the Pardhis are trained and supported 
to utilise government rural and minority welfare programs. The number of project beneficiaries is almost 5000 people (almost 1,000 households). www.parivartan-kanker.org</narrative>
