   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The programme works for the improvement of rural communities? socio-economic situation and quality of life, as well for the strengthening of community capacities and enhancing children?s rights in Mogotio, Western Kenya. The programme was evaluated in 2016
, and based on evaluation findings the new programme period will focus on WASH (water, sanitation and health) activities, including livelihood support, such as providing access to clean water for households, health centres and schools, in cooperation with 
local water authorities, and child protection as well as participation. The evaluation findings were positive. More people have access to clean water, and water-born disease cases have decreased.  Families can provide better for their children, and in arou
nd 40 % of families, at least one parent has sustainable income. HIV/AIDS prevalence has decreased in the area. There remain some challenges especially related to access to clean water and livelihoods in the dry season. The water network should be extended
, existing water faucets reconditioned and the water committees offered capacity for sustainable management of water faucets. Also, project teams consisting of members of the community and the structures relevant to sustainability still need support. The s
tatus of protection and participation of children still requires support. Gender inequality, child marriage and violence against girls are some of the remaining issues in the community. Children&apos;s participation in collective decision-making is encouraged t
hrough Children&apos;s Parliament and the situation of women and girls are supported through focus on harmful traditions such as female genital mutilation and early marriages, as well as acts of violence against girls. Community advocacy groups are facilitated 
to engage in county planning in budgeting for sanitation and hygiene programmes and to mobilize resources. The water committees are facilitated to handle the use, maintenance and monitoring of water resources. The program beneficiaries are the 16 840 perso
ns living in the programme area. The main partner is World Vision Kenya that runs the implementation and accounts for the use of funding.</narrative>
