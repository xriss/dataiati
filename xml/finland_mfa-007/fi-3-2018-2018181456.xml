   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Digital development technical support aims to 1. Provide digital development support, training, materials and a digital solutions portfolio both to Plan staff and the civil society actors in the focus countries, 2. Strengthen civil society and improve comm
unity engagement via digital technology, 3. Empower girls as the digital storytellers of their own lives, 4. Expand the Digital Development Solutions Portfolio of tested and proven technologies that can be replicated and scaled up within the five key focus
 countries and beyond, 5. Continue to co-fund the position of Global Coordinator for Digital Development (based in Finland, co-funded by various other Plan offices) and recruit a Regional Digital Development Advisor for Eastern and Southern Africa. Within 
our programme focus of sexual and reproductive health and rights, there is room for exploring and testing the potential of various technologies and digital tools that could enhance programme delivery and reach, improve our monitoring and evaluation process
es, increase participation and ultimately lead to better results. In the context of this MFA programme, technology can be particularly useful for improving access to information about SRHR, GBV and child marriage, which has been noted as a major challenge 
in all of our programme countries. The expected results are 1. The capacity of Plan staff and the civil society actors to utilize digital tools for monitoring and evaluation as well project implementation is significantly improved. 2. Girls skills and acti
ve participation into the use of digital tools to improve their lives is strengthened. 3. Digital Development Solutions Portfolio is made available in the five focus countries. 4. Globa Digital Development Coordinator position is secured and funded during 
2018-2021. The beneficiaries are the Plan staff, project partners and communities which are part of the Plan International Finlands MFA funded SRHR programme 2018-2021. This components is mainly implemented by Plan International Finland.</narrative>
