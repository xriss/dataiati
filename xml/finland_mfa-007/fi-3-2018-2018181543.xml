   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Mozambican NGO JA! promotes the implementation of improved agricultural practices and agro-ecology as a way of ensuring sustainable food production especially in vulnerable communities, and as an agricultural approach to take care of ecological sustainabil
ity and tackle social problems by supporting smallholder agro-ecological agricultural models, which increases community resilience to climate change.#The project is implemented in two geographic areas of Mozambique: In four communities of Mount Mabu forest
 area in Zambezia Province and in Xai-xai, Gaza Province. #The communities in Mount Mabu have traditional land use rights, but have been asking for formalized rights to be guardians and manage the forest as a nationally-recognized community conservation ar
ea. The communities have self-organized themselves into 8 associations of which 4 of them are women&apos;s associations. With this project JA! aims at strengthening all associations, especially the women&apos;s associations, provide more agro-ecology trainings to co
mmunities, and to work with the community on medicinal plants in Mabu forest.#In Xai-xai, the communities have been affected by Chinese funded Wanbao farming project. However, the communities have been fighting against land grabbing, and have managed to ge
t back their land. Through the project, JA! will support the preparation of small projects and will provide a brief training on accountability and agro ecology. They will also support cross-community exchange with other associations that have more experien
ce in agro-ecology, and will help create a network of peasant agro-ecology. #The project will be also set up a seed bank to the project communities. As part of this project, JA! also intends to create a publication, with voices of women from the ground, fr
om Mabu and from the communities affected by Wanbao but also including other rural and non-rural women across Mozambique. Additionally, JA! will host a strategy meeting to gather academic and NGO women across southern Africa to envision what an African eco
feminist Just Transition looks like. #The project will have more than 2600 direct beneficiaries in five communities.</narrative>
