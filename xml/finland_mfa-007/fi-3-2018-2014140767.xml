   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The treaty-based International Criminal Court (ICC) and Trust Fund for Victims (TFV) were established by the Rome Statute that entered into force in 2002. The TFV provides support to victims of crimes falling under the jurisdiction of the ICC as well as th
eir families. These crimes include genocide crimes against humanity and war crimes. The TFV fulfills two mandates: it implements reparations ordered by the ICC and provides assistance to victims and their families. Through its assistance mandate the TFV fi
nances its partner organizations which implement self-help projects at the local level. The practical means of assistance include i.a. physical rehabilitation psychological rehabilitation and material support. The countries where the TFV has provided assis
tance have been Uganda and the Democratic Republic of Congo. In 2018 the TFV will start its work in Cote d&apos;Ivoire. If security permits the fund may launch assistance programs also in Central African Republic (CAR). One of the thematic priorities for the fu
nd is support to victim survivors of sexual and gender based violence (SGBV). The need for support to SGBV-victims is rising continuously and in addition reparations proceedings (Bemba case) are nearing the end. It is possible to earmark voluntary contribu
tions to the trust fund to support SGBV-victims.The objective of the projects is to help victims and their families to overcome the harm resulting from the ICC crimes as well as to help them lead a dignified life and to contribute towards reconciliation an
d peace-building. The projects funded by the TFV are targeted to both individual and collective levels: they contribute to individual rehabilitation and empowerment as well as community stability and reconciliation. The TFV receives voluntary contributions
 from several states. Sweden the UK Germany the Netherlands and Finland have been the biggest donors. Finland is also one of the most consistent supporters. The contribution of Finland during years 2017-2020 (all together 800 000 euros) will be used to the
 TFV&apos;s assistance mandate programs with a thematic focus on the victims of sexual and gender-based violence. Regionally the assistance will be directed to Sub-Saharan Africa.</narrative>
