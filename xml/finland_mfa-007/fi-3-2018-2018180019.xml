ates and members in the upcoming local councils. Through its two-stage strategy and to insure the sustainability of its impact the project will provide direct technical support for young female activists running for the Local Councils&apos; elections as well as
 women elected as local councils members later on. Through its activities the project will introduce a participatory decision-making process to the local councils mechanism in 6 targeted governorates namely Qalioubia Sharkia Kafr El Sheikh Assuit Sohag Ben
ui Seuf. This participatory nature of decision-making will be guaranteed through a dialogue launched and reinforced between local councils members and local development NGOs in these 6 governorates. To insure this the project will rely on an online platfor
m as an unconventional and creative communication tool. The project is a partnership project between the Egyptian Center for Women&apos;s Rights (ECWR) Gender and Legal Expert House (GELEH) and the National Council for Women (NCW) serving 6 Egyptian governorate
s through providing technical capacity trainings and online and offline raising awareness events. The project will also capitalize on its online platform to reach out a minimum of one million active citizens raising their awareness about the role of Local
